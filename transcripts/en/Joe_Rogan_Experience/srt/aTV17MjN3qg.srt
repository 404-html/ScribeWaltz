3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,590
it's a mute button. Oh, it's
fucked that up. I'm not a Newbie.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,670
That's the sad part about it. You would
think, see, this is my real laptop,

5
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:21,241
Ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:23,910
I don't have like a dedicated work
machine or anything like that.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,070
Did hop into this if an alien
love man. Uh, I love alien ware.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,570
I know I support them.
They make some awesome podcasts.

9
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,810
If you like playing video games, they
do make awesome podcast. Do I say that

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,580
may awesome computers
to do your podcast on?

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,760
It's fucking shows over
already before 40 even begins.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,750
What is it that your brain sends
out the wrong word sometimes?

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,930
Like how did I not know that that was
the wrong word? TDT, h c Heck Nah.

14
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:56,390
It's not that. Yes, just being stupid.
I think. I don't know. I think it's THC.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,660
I think my brain's not that good.
It's pretty good. We should not,

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,330
we should do a Doug Benson not
smoke weed for three months.

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,270
And I don't think I'm pair
around you. No, no. Both of us.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,870
I don't think I can be around
you. If I was sober, we
should try it. It'd be weird.

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,430
We should do an experience. We should at
least 30 days. Okay, sure. I'm done. Um,

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,690
anyway,
on it.com

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,810
blah, blah, blah. Go get
some vitamins, bitch. We uh,

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,980
we also sell a kettle bells and battle
ropes and all kinds of good stuff.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,050
Beef Jerky, Buffalo Jerky. It's
actually buffalo. I like I said,

24
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,200
it's fucking delicious. It's all the,
everything from onnit.com is essentially,

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,730
someone said you should call it a
performance website. Uh, I don't,

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,120
I think that sounds g h.
E y you know,

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,970
it's the way of saying gay without
being offensive to homosexuals.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,680
Did,
have you ever played pool on on it?

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,620
I played pool on Alpha brain. Silly
Bitch. That's intense stuff, right?

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,860
She's so silly. This is just silly person.
Brian. Really, they need to understand.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,390
You're like a small child.
I was crying like a child last night.

32
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,224
At the comedy store.

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,770
Why would you say I got really drunk
and all these people were like, Hey,

34
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,500
can I buy you a shot? I was like, Oh,
I'm sure. And then I was like, wait,

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,980
now I'm wasted. And I gave
away my cat last, you know,

36
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,000
yesterday and it started getting
emotional about my really,

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,540
I hate when I get drunk and stoned
and I just tear up like a little bit.

38
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,960
Maybe you need some new mood.
I do need a new mission.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,980
I used to do I need to start
over by some new mood? No,

40
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,910
I'm going to have to buy it.
You know I need to stop growing.

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,830
I need some more design. What you
need more frothy loads. Do you think?

42
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:31,290
Do you have low testosterone?
You probably, I probably totally.

43
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:35,310
Probably not that good.
It's probably a low but you seem happy.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,540
Maybe if it was, if you got like
all test it up man, you know,

45
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,630
snapping in the slim Jims Shit.
Yeah.

46
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:45,510
You might be like too intense if
you were like all write it up.

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,190
Wifebeater not about a beater
but certainly like a shaker.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,560
He would grab people and shake
them, slap my room. It's commercial.

49
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,810
It's the worst we've ever done.
For sure.

50
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,160
If I was even thinking
about buying some products,

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,720
I would say, this is how the
fuck did you bring me this? I'm,

52
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,300
this is what you're calling a commercial.
Uh, w what Alpha brain is folks is, uh,

53
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,520
you know,
what the fuck it is.

54
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,590
You heard this podcast before
while we playing games,

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,700
they're vitamins and vitamins and
enhanced cognitive function. Um,

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,950
the idea is that there's certain
nutrients that they've isolated that are

57
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,670
particularly helpful for
brain function and uh,

58
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,970
it has a very clear effect for me. Uh,
for some people it doesn't, I don't,

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,380
I don't understand how people's brains
work. But, um, I think everyone, you know,

60
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,430
has different sensitivities to various
herbal compounds and different vitamins

61
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,450
and nutrients and you know,

62
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:44,140
and everybody has different sensitivities
to how your body is set up to now.

63
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,570
Some people's bodies are there,
they're very sensitive and they're,

64
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,750
they're very healthy and they're aware
of like different things having changes

65
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,860
on them. And then other people
just a little numb. They're
not, not quite tuned in.

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,970
Um, uh, I don't know what works
on you. Everybody's different,

67
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,380
but if it doesn't work on you,

68
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,980
it's a hundred percent
money back guarantee for the
first 30 pills. Just try it.

69
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,620
No one's trying to sell you
anything that doesn't work.

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,740
There's science behind it.
If you go to the Onnit science page,

71
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,240
a lot of the stuff that's in it's at the
various ingredients have been shown in

72
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,930
double blind placebo tests.
I think.

73
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm not really even sure if I understand
what that means, but here we go.

74
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,390
What I'm saying is yes. Yeah. What I'm
saying is it's this, there's science.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,290
There's a reason to believe it works to
that. It all makes sense. It's all the,

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,840
all the various ones, whether it's
Alpha brain or knew mood, knew mood,

77
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,590
which is a literally a mood
boosting supplement. It's,

78
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,710
it's five HTP and l tryptofan and w
the way it works is five HTP becomes

79
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,640
serotonin in El Tryptofan
becomes five HTP.

80
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:50,320
So the idea is that it gives you like
sort of a slow release boost and the

81
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:54,670
nutrients that your brain needs to produce
serotonin. It's all fascinating stuff.

82
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,440
Plus we got kettle bells and battle
ropes and all kinds of other manly shit.

83
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,900
So go get on it. Use a code name, Rogan,

84
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,510
and you will save 10% off any and all
supplements. All right, you freak.

85
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:09,890
You need to start selling cats.
Her. The ACAT buddy gave it.

86
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,660
We should have like an exchange program.
You don't have to,

87
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,200
you just give them away.
Give them a way to like people like Joey.

88
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,340
Joey will take another cat.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,270
Actually my cat techie now lives on the
Trueblood set the set where they film

90
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:27,580
Trueblood at [inaudible] House. So
they use it. That's where they film it.

91
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,910
You'll be in prison. Pretty specific.
Yeah, I was gonna find that chat.

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,700
Then you're going to be even Saturday.
Oh, well they're not going to want it.

93
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,070
It's the true blood set. Chose say
tonic. It's about vampires and shit. Oh,

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,940
that's right.
You don't want that.

95
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,340
My fees for cat's going to be
around negative energy all the time.

96
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,920
Fucking vampires and shit to cue the music
class tries here. This is ridiculous.

97
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,150
Rogan experience.

98
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,820
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

99
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,940
May I begin before we
even do this podcast.

100
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,420
May I just say that you are
a bad motherfucker. Yeah,

101
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,550
you can say you are a bad mother fucker.

102
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:15,551
There are very few people in life where
I've watched him on TV and I've watched

103
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:19,310
him do stuff and I just went fuck that.

104
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,110
Fuck that.
Like you on that fucking show,

105
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,880
you went through some of the
realist moments ever in television.

106
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,040
Literally survival.

107
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,140
Not That fucking English do two sleeps
in the hotels that jacked your idea.

108
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,630
But the real shit man, when you were,
there's so many times I watch your show.

109
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:42,830
It just my mouth open.

110
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:47,720
Like just thinking about what the fuck
must've been going through your head

111
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,010
surviving in the mountain,

112
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,650
not the whole. The whole thing had to
come from that. I mean when I, you know,

113
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,530
when I first uh, sort of offered it
up and call it a network, you know,

114
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,110
they were a little shocked and I
said, no, I'll, I'll actually do it.

115
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,460
They kept thinking, you know, cause no,

116
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,620
they're used to like production company
as just somebody calling and saying,

117
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,230
you know, we'll, we'll set up a camera
and we've got these guys going in.

118
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:08,180
And I said, no, I'm going to
actually survive. And that's what,

119
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,350
that's what to set it off. Nobody's
done anything like that before. That

120
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,470
dude, that one when you went to
Africa and a hot air balloon,

121
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,480
I've watched that thing like five times
and caught a curdle like hugging myself

122
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,960
while I was watching like what the fuck?

123
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,490
He's got a hot air balloon
and there's lions out there.

124
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,820
Yeah, it actually is, you know, the,

125
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,100
I don't know if this made it on the show
or not, but uh, later on in the show,

126
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,000
when I'm in the memory that that was in
the thorn Bush shelter made a shelter

127
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,740
out of thorns or whatever.
So that night, I mean,

128
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:40,400
I listened to a kill go down about a
hundred yards from me and that was,

129
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,220
that's a freak most freaked out I've
ever been, you know, hear it going down.

130
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,220
You hear the screams and,
and in the end,

131
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,220
I think it was a Jaguar taken down
about boon cause they all hunt down and

132
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,400
baboons go nuts. And, and
that was like real close.

133
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:54,530
That was probably one of the
most nervous I've ever been.

134
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,740
Holy Shit.
A Jaguar and a bamboo and,

135
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,800
and there's no fence between you
in it and a wall. This is your,

136
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:07,060
you're in their environment.
Yeah. God Damn, that's crazy.

137
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,410
That is so terrifying,
man.

138
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,520
You know, it's not, it is,
but it isn't. I mean it is.

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,690
Well, it's like, you know, we, it was,
we were talking about fighting earlier.

140
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:20,141
I mean going,

141
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:22,840
and that can be terrifying going in
up against an opponent that you know,

142
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:27,670
is as tough a tough ass, but, but for
re and, and also if you're a fighter,

143
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,910
will, you're, you're geared for that,
right? Well, in my world, you know,

144
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,400
I spent a lot of years out
there. So for me, you know, I,

145
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,050
I remember I was out with my sister one
time and she looked into the forest and

146
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,870
she said, well, that, that's
really, really intimidating to me.

147
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:44,350
And I remember thinking all I want
to do is go right inside there.

148
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,440
And it was a real dark for
monitoring. So, um, I'm just really,

149
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:52,300
really comfortable out there. It's, it's
not that the other shit doesn't happen.

150
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,580
It happens. And it's not that
it's and real, it's real,

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,660
but I'm just really comfortable
whenever I'm in the Bush, I'm really,

152
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:05,460
really comfortable. And so the reality
of the danger settles with me, you know,

153
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,190
it settles on me and it's okay and I
can, I just, I just know what to do.

154
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,880
How much of a hindrance is it
while you're doing all this,

155
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:16,110
you're also setting up cameras and
turning them on and doing all your shit?

156
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,240
You're, you're filming it from several
different angles. Well, I was, you know,

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,120
that's the artist in me, right? I
mean, in the passion of a filmmaker,

158
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,990
I'd get out and I, and I
got it. And really I want to
tell a story, right? I mean,

159
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,330
if I'm there and I'm surviving,
that's one thing. Okay, that's cool.

160
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,590
Now I want to tell the story. In a very
beginning, I remember saying, Oh God,

161
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:36,930
she said, Oh, you know, have the camera
be shaky. Like it's like, uh, you know,

162
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,110
just a home video on it. And I, and I
said, why would I do that? I'm a good,

163
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:44,490
I'm a good filmmaker. I'm not going to
make my film look worse because you know,

164
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:48,000
you cause you, you know, I'm not,
you know, putting out movies,

165
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm not Steven Spielberg, I'm going
to make it look as good as I can.

166
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,700
And so the passion of of filming
comes in really strong when I work at,

167
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,520
when I'm out there surviving because I,
let's see,

168
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,090
I got to walk down through a valley,
so I'll stop and look and go,

169
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,590
well I've got to walk through this valley.

170
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,370
So I got to tell the story of walking
through the valley and I've got four or

171
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,690
five cameras.
Well how am I going to do that?

172
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,640
Well there's a cliff up
there I could probably reach.

173
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,690
So I'll go put a camera up there and I
could way off in the distance and then

174
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:12,540
I'll have one on my buddy.

175
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,590
And all of that is about trying to
be a passionate filmmaker and, and,

176
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,760
and I just won an award recently and
it has to do with the film making.

177
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:24,350
I was really proud because it, it
speaks to the fact that it was, it was,

178
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,510
and I wasn't just a guy going out
sleeping on a shelter and doing a fire,

179
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:31,920
but I'm a filmmaker. I'm up making,
making a film, but like nobody else,

180
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm actually really doing what
I'm making so I'm not, you know,

181
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,130
setting up nonsense. You were
creative and all the aspects of it,

182
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,900
the editing of it, the way you know,
you and you would be honest about like,

183
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,140
we got to walk over here to get this shot.
And I honestly,

184
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,190
I don't really want to go back.

185
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm going to leave the camera
and the crew pick it up like I,

186
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,800
that was the other thing too, is just
being honest with all of it. Right.

187
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,980
If I'm going to do a show
like that, I, you know,

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,410
I can't tell you how often you'd
have discussion saying, well,

189
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:03,110
why don't you just say like, this
happened, right? It's like, no, you know,

190
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,960
I remember one time in an
argument, I said, look it,

191
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,230
I'm in the middle of the Amazon jungle
and I've got no food and just whatever

192
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:13,830
water's flowing and I'm alone for seven
days in the middle of the Amazon jungle.

193
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,780
If you'd,
and I'm saying this to like executives,

194
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,480
if you don't think that's dramatic
enough and get another boy,

195
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,160
because in my world that's pretty freaking
dramatic and it will be dramatic and

196
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:24,300
I don't need to embellish it.

197
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,150
So I always wanted to tell the truth with
what was going on up there. You know,

198
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,250
that's a real issue with reality shows.

199
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,840
It's like it's this dirty little
lies going on left and right.

200
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,480
They're creating
scenarios, you know, I'll,

201
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,370
I'll have no problem going on record
saying all the time that in my opinion,

202
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,580
reality shows suck. I don't
know why they're on air. I mean,

203
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,920
I do know why they're on there cause
they sell. But, but what gets me is,

204
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:52,921
is what I don't get is how many millions
of of North Americans and people in the

205
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:58,030
world watch him and think it's actually
hat or did you see it? It's like,

206
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,970
no, now they're even
scripted. Badly scripted.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,910
I don't think I agree with
you in a don't agree with you.

208
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,650
I don't think they suck.
I think so.

209
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,550
I think it's a new art form thing
is creating and creating this,

210
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:14,020
this painting show out of losers or weird.
It's creativity.

211
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,050
It's different. You know what
I mean? There's just so many.

212
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,570
Like when Mark Burnett started it,
right, if it wasn't for Mark Burnett,

213
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:23,290
I wouldn't be on Eric as well because he
started with survivors series and then

214
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,810
I started getting these phone calls
because I was a filmmaker, survival guy.

215
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:30,070
And that's when I realized I could pitch
my idea and I said I'll do it for real.

216
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,890
So Burnett started it. And
you know what? My opinion,

217
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:35,590
the man's a genius and the stuff he does,
he's totally a genius.

218
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,160
But the shows are riddled with lies
and lies that you know are meant to the

219
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,150
public. Is meant to swallow so, so if,

220
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,650
if there's chill was really going down,
that's one thing.

221
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,980
But when you've got somebody like
I remember a single one time,

222
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,470
it gets really bad when you know you've
got to wait for the commercials to see

223
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:00,640
some good acting.
That's what's happening with Yachty shows.

224
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,830
There's definitely some of that too.

225
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,130
I think it's an emerging art
form are really thing. See,

226
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,400
I don't mind the competition shows.

227
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,150
I got a guilty pleasure for like
trading spouses and stuff like that.

228
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,290
The competition ones are cool. I like
that. But what I know though about I,

229
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,270
I've met a lot of people that do them and
like do behind the scene stuff and you

230
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,160
know, they're laughing at everything
along the way as they do it.

231
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,970
A lot of the times it's

232
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,870
this weird thing where we're
willing to watch a person with the,

233
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,890
there's no reason to watch them, but once
we locked, watch him for a little bit,

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,560
we get locked in. Yeah.
Just for whatever reason,

235
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,190
decide to keep following this
person around on TV. I Dunno man.

236
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,080
I've tried to watch,
you know,

237
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,870
I shouldn't say shouldn't name names
cause cause it was probably my own network

238
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,750
and stuff. But some shows like a,
you know, and they do like the,

239
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,400
the pawn stars and the, and
the shadow watch that. Um,

240
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,110
cause I, I don't watch TV, right?

241
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,900
So I'll watch and I'm in a hotel
room somewhere else. It's like, okay,

242
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,250
I'm in a hotel room, all my breath time
to put on and I'll put on the networks,

243
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,080
right? And I'll walk through
the reality and networks.

244
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,150
And I tried to watch some of
them. I can't do it. And I'm, I'm,

245
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm alone in my hotel.
I told him actually saying out loud,

246
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,410
you fucking kidding me. No, no.
And I'm in my mind, I'm rolling.

247
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:17,560
I was like, people are watching this
and somebody who's watching this going,

248
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,470
they're gasping. And it's like really?
And, and so I struggle with it, you know,

249
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,300
plus I get called a reality show, just
surviving man got called a reality show.

250
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,900
It wasn't really a reality show. It
wasn't my God, I disagree completely.

251
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,510
I think it's a reality show in
the real essence of the word.

252
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,870
It's the new reality.
Shows are not reality shows.

253
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,090
They could should call
it like scripted drama.

254
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:44,860
Just call it hybrid or any bad actors.
We don't have to pay much,

255
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,560
but we'll say anything we say TV shows.
Yeah.

256
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:52,100
It's like loosely scripted scenarios. I
mean even though the whole, I mean look,

257
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
they didn't script it,
but they just edit what people say.

258
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,260
You can get a script out of it.
You can,

259
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:01,280
you can figure out how to edit it together
to make some stupid story or forced

260
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:04,520
them to go get pizza at five different
places and film and when they don't have

261
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,930
the right and they get to start getting
mad and like it's, it's really dumb,

262
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,310
but for whatever reason,

263
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,170
that infuriating feeling that you get
when you watch it, it's almost addictive.

264
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,470
That's a good way of putting
it and infuriating feeling.

265
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,190
Yeah. You might have a point. I knew,
I knew, I knew. I knew our forum.

266
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,920
I Dunno. A new art form that hit. The
thing is because I came from documentary,

267
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:32,340
right. I'm thinking that I'm a
documentary and a document, uh,

268
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,980
survival just so happens I really
go out and survive it. Right, right.

269
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:38,400
So then I get, but I get lumped in with
reality shows. One of the problems I had,

270
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:38,910
and I had it,

271
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,610
I had it with like in shark week and I
have it with different shows and stuff

272
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:46,500
I've been on. And is if you're gonna try
and do comedy than get a comedy writer.

273
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,700
That's what I think,
right?

274
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,990
Because there's a lot of documentary and
reality TV producers are like, you know,

275
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,220
26 years old and the all hopped up cause
they got a job and they're working on

276
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,140
the new show and they're trying to be
funny. And to me, I'm at home going,

277
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,700
this is like worse than
bad student art films.

278
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:07,470
I'd rather go see a student art film
then than a a producer who finally got a

279
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:11,220
job for company who gets to produce
this segment and it says, and then,

280
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,290
and there's, you know what, that
they're sitting around going, you know,

281
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,380
it'd be cool if, and it's like, it's
like high school comedy at that point.

282
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:20,490
And I and, and high school boys in the
locker room sort of thing. And I, uh,

283
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,360
that's why I can't do it.

284
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:23,880
So I sit there in a hotel room and
I'm trying to watch pawn stars.

285
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm trying to watch the,
what are the t chopper dude's and then,

286
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,340
you know, but did you ever see
micro secret addiction? No.

287
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,110
So I dunno what w what
show was it is, well, no,

288
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,400
no porters who you've seen hoarders.
Okay.

289
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,170
So I'll be watching hoarders and I gotta
say I'm watching hoarders and I know a

290
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:46,920
couple of people like that too, but I was
watching hoarders and I thought, okay,

291
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,540
this is really kind of sick.

292
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,400
And then they're going to
clean it up and I'm coming up,

293
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm kind of an anal
retentive organized guy,

294
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,200
like going to places I'm
really organized and shit.

295
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,750
So I'm watching hoarders go on.
I could clean that place up and

296
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,310
I'm watching it. And that was all
cool. And in one episode I watched,

297
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,730
and this is, this is what really pissed
me off and sweat through it for me was,

298
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,160
uh, the, well the mother was the hoarder.

299
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,520
And then they were injured interviewing
the sons and it was clear that most of

300
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:18,810
the people in the family
were intellectually disabled,

301
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,270
so that was the moment when I
went, fuck, whoa. Like why? Okay,

302
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:27,160
if I'd had the produce, I go, what
the fuck are you doing? You're you're,

303
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,000
I get when you do, when you're
taking people who are semi normal,

304
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,160
but they're kind of screwed up and
neurotic and you're doing okay,

305
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,020
I get all that, but you've got people
on there right now and they're,

306
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,440
they're intellectually disabled.
That's very clear.

307
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:41,160
You can tell they're not messed
up in neurotic or psychotic.

308
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:45,180
They're intellectually disabled and
you're running them through the hoarder TV

309
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,460
in that, that, that was the day I just
about threw the TV out the window.

310
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:50,100
I pulled a rock'n'roll.
Yeah,

311
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,750
I certainly see your point there.

312
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,810
The way I was looking at it as like the
keeping up with the Kardashians type of

313
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,460
thing that I feel like jewels,

314
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,850
it's no different than a soap opera
soap operas or silly, you know,

315
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,710
and this is silly too,
but it's silly with real people.

316
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,550
Don't you think that's something that a
lot of those people need though in their

317
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,850
life? They need that big of a
like slap in the face. Like,

318
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:14,480
because once you're on TV and everyone
in your neighborhood knows about it,

319
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:17,510
you're now obsessed with that.
You know what I mean?

320
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,310
Like you're being brought to light.

321
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,670
So I think that's maybe some
of these people who need to,

322
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,460
like the people who are on are
the people who are watching that,

323
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,880
people that are on it,
they,

324
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,330
they've gotten their life has gotten
to that point where they actually need

325
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,050
everyone in America to know that they
fucking suck and that they're a hoarder

326
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:36,470
maybe. Yeah. I don't know. I mean with
the reality shows, there's a lot of,

327
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,540
there's a lot of, you can, you can see
the hole. It's a culture celebrity, right?

328
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,420
I was getting messed up with
culture celebrity when we
get to La cause it's just

329
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,690
weird. It's was kind of weird, you
know? And so now you've got healthy,

330
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,850
it's one thing if you've got,
you know,

331
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,400
Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp and scarlet
Johanson and the culture celebrity,

332
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,180
they're kind of like groomed for it and
they're like superheroes and sort of

333
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:58,250
thing. And I do it. But
then you got, you know,

334
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:01,340
regular people are just messed up and
they're instantly thrust into the culture.

335
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,550
Celebrity just gets weird. Just gets
creepy, you know, cause they all,

336
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:05,850
you know how they always
do the outtakes when you,

337
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,570
the camera cuts to and now they're,

338
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:11,660
they're bitching about their sister or
somebody like that and you can see them

339
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:16,350
trying to project in that amateur
way. Well I just thought, you know,

340
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,960
ah, you know, one of us, you ain't
going to mess with my bedroom. You know,

341
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:24,270
and then he's like, I really
am I watching this. It's,

342
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,330
it's very apocalyptic. It's,
yeah. Well we're coming close.

343
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,983
I don't know.

344
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,810
Yeah, well that's, that didn't know who,
who's ever called a day right on it.

345
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,890
And has there ever been a time ever where
anybody's ever said that this is going

346
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:42,340
to be the day there's some shit
goes down then it really was? No,

347
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,190
no, never, ever, never. But
the Mayans, they were wrong.

348
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,880
Even predict their own demise.
They just ran out of it.

349
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,000
It's like they ran out of rock

350
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,680
and not, and not only that, the, uh,

351
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,660
most recent calendars that they've
found actually go past December, 2012.

352
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,100
It was just the end of this particular
cycle that they called the long count.

353
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,470
I don't know exactly what
it's supposed to mean to them,

354
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,570
but nowhere does it imply that it means
an apocalypse or doomsday scenario.

355
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,880
But there is, there is a, um, I think
predicted not predictions, but uh,

356
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,940
prophecies that,

357
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,560
that what it can represent or
possibly represent as a chess shifting

358
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:21,910
consciousness and that that
is the big sort of, you know,

359
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,430
apocalyptic. That's the
big, the big shift. You have

360
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,880
tier, you know? Yeah. That's a, that's a
weird word and a metaphysical kind of way.

361
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,400
Consciousness is a weird word when
people think about like a shift in

362
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,010
consciousness. Like, what
does that mean? Could be,

363
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:36,910
it could be a technology that allows
our consciousness to be elevated.

364
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:41,510
It could be, you know, that
we have access to, you know,

365
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,820
some new medical innovation that changes
the way the mind works. I mean that's,

366
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,250
that's a,
that's a distinct as well.

367
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,690
It's, it's, I mean, you can feel it now
though, we call the age of information,

368
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,130
right? Yeah. You know, or you know,

369
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:57,700
it's almost get almost mess with it
called the age of enlightenment because,

370
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,910
you know, we're just, we're getting in
tune with a lot of things. The whole,

371
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,440
the whole co, I mean, you know,

372
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,250
a big thing in my life in a big thing
and doing survivorman and beyond survival

373
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,120
beyond survival was really big for me
on this was the energy of connecting to

374
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:13,060
the earth and feeling like I was connected
again to the planet and the earth and

375
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,300
the natural world. And, you know,

376
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,460
thanks to the ceremonies and things
I did when I filmed beyond survival.

377
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:21,970
A kind of brought me back, you
know, cause with survivor, man,

378
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:25,390
I kind of lost that touch, you know?
And, and, and we are speaking little,

379
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:28,390
it's a little messy metaphysically
that's whole sort of thing.

380
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,830
But there's something to really,
the Po Energy,

381
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,350
power of energy, feeling it, you
feel it from one person to another.

382
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:38,500
You feel it from one inanimate object
to another, you feel it from the earth.

383
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,270
And so a big thing for me is,
you know,

384
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:42,170
with all I've done is
trying to get people to uh,

385
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,370
to connect with the planet again. You
know, kick his shoes off, walk bare feet,

386
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,820
get some dirt on your fingernails if
they see that it's actually healthy for

387
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:52,390
your body to sleep and grass.
And if he's sleeping grass,

388
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,330
it's actually like physically
beneficial and you,

389
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,760
your body has a positive feeling from it
and you wake up feeling great. It's got,

390
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,740
you know, if you get jet lag, one of
the cures is to kick your shoes off,

391
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:06,240
go walk up barefoot on your lawn wheel
and it just knocks jet lag out your

392
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,290
system. You know, pretty,
I've, I've actually,

393
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,900
I finally tried it one time and I dunno,
I felt great after.

394
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,050
So I have no idea if it's coincidence
or not, but, but that's what they say.

395
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,700
If you want to regroup after jet lag,

396
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,010
which I get a lot cause they're
always flying, just walk barefoot.

397
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,480
Grass is so hot right now.

398
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,000
Grass fed grass logging on as well.

399
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,280
Our relationship to plants,
a relationship to plants I think is,

400
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,140
we have to consider it the fact first of
all. And then if it wasn't for plants,

401
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,840
they wouldn't be processing the
oxygen. You know, they're, they're,

402
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,390
they like clean the air, the carbon
dioxide, they put out oxygen. Right.

403
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,130
Well just think of it this way. We breathe
out the plants, breathe in, breathe out.

404
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:49,180
We breathe in. Think of that. Yeah, I mean
that's, that's crazy. Pretty connected.

405
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,740
It doesn't get any more
connected than that.

406
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,350
And I feel like there's gotta
be something to touch in.

407
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,360
It has got to be something to
actually touching like grass and live,

408
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,510
live plants and organisms
like a rain forest,

409
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:04,360
like the feeling from a rain forest.
Like there's,

410
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,310
there's gotta be something to touching
all that stuff. What a whole though,

411
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,460
you know the whole thing. And
you hear about, you know, oh,

412
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,740
I go out to the wilderness and I,
and I get filled.

413
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,430
And that's what I feel every time
I get out there. There's really,

414
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,190
there's a reason why it's said that
way because you, I come here, you know,

415
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,730
I go out in the city and uh, it's like
everything's being sucked out of you.

416
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:24,880
And then when you go out
into the wilderness and you,

417
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,750
you just breathe it in,
you are taking,

418
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:31,360
you're taking really good shit and you're
taking really good energy. And I think,

419
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,340
I think we also,

420
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,420
we wonder like how much stuff
is coming at us all the time,

421
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,410
whether it's radio signals,
you know, cellular signals,

422
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:46,160
Wifi is, there's pollution,
there's all this stuff

423
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,180
around us,
noise,

424
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:51,680
pollution and all that stuff has just
forcing you to react to it. And it's for,

425
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,730
it's always coming at you when you're out
in a place with no cell phone service,

426
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,100
you see nothing but stars at night.

427
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,310
And it gives you this really
unique separation from noise.

428
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,960
This, this, yeah. You know what, there's,

429
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,020
there's two times I found in a year
in the wilderness where if you just,

430
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:17,460
you're just standing there and you're
in the middle of nowhere and the entire

431
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,780
forest, uh, goes still
at, nothing's moving.

432
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,860
I mean there's not a fly buzzing,
there's not a caterpillar crawling.

433
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,930
It happens twice in a year.
The,

434
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:33,000
an obvious time is like January
minus 35 degrees Celsius.

435
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,960
I don't know what that minus 40 Fahrenheit
even, you know, bitter, bitterly cold.

436
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,120
And you, and I've stood
there and I've listened and,

437
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,160
and I swear at that moment it's,

438
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:49,190
you can hear the sound of the
entire planet spinning on its axis.

439
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:53,130
You just hear this, this
moan, and it's really intense.

440
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:56,480
And the other time is in the middle
of middle heat of like June and said,

441
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,060
everyone knows this day in the wilderness,
if they ever get time out there,

442
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,120
middle of June, it's baking
Lee hot, super humid.

443
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:06,210
And all of a sudden you realize there's
not even a bumblebee. There's nothing.

444
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:10,560
It's just, and you can hear the planet.
I think you can, I've heard the phrase,

445
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,780
you can hear the planet.
He said try that.

446
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,460
God is deep.
That is fucking deep.

447
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:24,110
How many days all told have you
spent surviving outdoors like that?

448
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,770
How many, how many episodes did you do
on the show? Each was seven days. Um,

449
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,760
why you got to go about, uh,
I dunno what's 40 times seven?

450
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:35,420
It's about 40 times seven.
If you count other times as well.

451
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,090
Did the the all go seven days?
No,

452
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:42,860
cause I did the two new brand new ones I
did last year. Uh, I did, uh, two 10 day

453
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,100
dude. The new ones, the new ones, man,

454
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:51,710
I fucked up. I didn't know
that it had a different name.

455
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:52,970
I thought it was still surviving.

456
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:56,090
So I went to get them on the
DVR and I did get it in time,

457
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,740
whether it's a governmental 10 days.

458
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,370
And then beyond survival was the other
series I did so survive men 10 days.

459
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,110
The survivor man, 10 days. The one that
I didn't get on the DVR. I have my,

460
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,130
I have survivorman Dvrs, I've got all the
old ones. You missed the one in Norway.

461
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,370
Is that 10 days in Norway?
It's 10 days in Norway.

462
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,920
And it was toughest night of my,
of my lifeline.

463
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,920
Yeah. It was, um, you know, when I do the
journey sometimes if I'm trying to travel,

464
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,140
of course I, you know, I know
roughly where I've got to go.

465
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:24,640
I might've even scouted,
you know, I was like, oh,

466
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:27,250
I'm going to be over in that area.
And I come in the night, you know,

467
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:31,870
I get dropped in and I go do my thing
and I thought I had it set where I was

468
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,390
going to,
it's supposed to go to go down a mountain.

469
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm going to go down the
mountain down this side.

470
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,450
That was sort of how I had it set up.

471
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:41,230
I'm going down there and I end
up getting lost. And it was, uh,

472
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,700
I was in the middle of the
mountain and the sun was dropping.

473
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,150
It was freezing rain and wet snow all day.
I was drenched to the bone,

474
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,820
both from sweat and from freezing rain.

475
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,970
And I was crawling down hill
on a steep mountain side.

476
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:56,550
The whole mountain side was just
like ice and steep. And I was,

477
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,160
and I came up to cliffs, Oh Jesus
Christ. And you can't go back. Uh, and,

478
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,690
and that was probably, you
know, probably the toughest.

479
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,180
How did you get out of there?
I just kept crawling.

480
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,860
I literally crawled down the hill.
It's,

481
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,090
you can sort of tell when you see the
show that it was way worse than I come

482
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,350
back and look at the film. I thought, man,

483
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:16,440
it was way worse than what that looks
like. But it was, I was crawling,

484
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:21,030
I crawled down a hill and I made a sea
cliff. I cliff's, yeah. Geez. How scary.

485
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,820
Yeah, I would this hypothermia. Right.
That's what I was worried about it.

486
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,030
So how did you get out of it?
Uh, when I got down there, um,

487
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,980
finally made it to the bottom
and I actually slept in
between two rocks and, uh,

488
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,860
got a little tiny,
um,

489
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,380
cooked up a little bit of food because I
had some fire starting stuff that I got

490
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:44,190
and then, you know, did pushups and sit
ups, sit ups and jumping on the spot.

491
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,150
A lot of times in a survival
situation when you, uh, when you, um,

492
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,670
are in the middle of the night and
you're sleeping on the ground and you get

493
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,260
that chill up your spine and just sucks.

494
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,070
I get out and I'll do jumping jacks
to pushups now just to get your,

495
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,440
just to flush it through
furnace up and you to,

496
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:00,420
you got to heat up and then it
buys you to 20 minutes. Right?

497
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,420
Yeah. It's amazing how it
could be freezing cold,

498
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:06,210
but if you go hiking up the side of
a mountain, you, you'd get sweaty.

499
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,030
Yeah. That's the worst case,
right. It, you know what I mean?

500
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:12,360
Everyone knows my saying is,
you sweat, you die. It was
a reason for that. You know,

501
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:13,290
it really is true.

502
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,400
It's the worst thing is to be like 4:30
PM and realize you're still soaking wet

503
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,043
and a winter day.

504
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,320
I went hunting in Montana recently and uh,

505
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,370
we spent four nights in the bad
lands camping on the Missouri River.

506
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,130
Nice. And uh, I'd never done that since.

507
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:33,560
I mean maybe when camping a
couple times when I was a kid,

508
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,160
but we went to Yellowstone and the
weather was good. You know, it wasn't,

509
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,330
there was no issues.
Like maybe it rained a little bit,

510
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,740
but this was cold as fuck and
wandering. But we had all, you know,

511
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,480
equipment and guns and all that
shit for deer mule deer. Yeah.

512
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,120
So it was, um, it was for a television
show that's a Stever Nela show, uh,

513
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,430
called a meat eater. You ever
seen that show? I have him.
Fascinating shot. Yeah. So,

514
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,020
but that was like literally,
um, one of my first,

515
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,260
or probably my first experience
ever doing anything like that.

516
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:07,190
Even sleeping outside like that many
nights in a row. And I'm 45 years old.

517
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,340
I've never experienced it before
until I got a couple of months ago.

518
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,110
Yeah. I think, I think everybody
should in a way, you know, I mean,

519
00:29:14,111 --> 00:29:18,220
at the very least, you know,
we can be into what we're
into. We can be in the UFC,

520
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:22,360
we can be into hockey, we can be into
math, you know, doing math equations.

521
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,670
We're going into anything we
want. But I think that, um,

522
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,330
if you can take an hour a week and
get out and just stand by a tree,

523
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,960
you know, they're crazy. Yeah. It,

524
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,730
it's crazy. So you get out in a hunting
situation like that, you're, you're,

525
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,580
you're there with the guys
when you're doing thing, but
still you're, you're just,

526
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,260
you're just around it, right. You're not,

527
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
you're not underneath a bunch of hydro
wires getting, you know, zapped with,

528
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,900
you know, leukemia inducing
electricity. You're, you're,

529
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,690
you're in the Bush and you're
getting the positive stuff.

530
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,930
Yeah. I don't, those fucking
power wire towers freaked me out.

531
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:58,120
When you see like one of those things
and like houses right next to it,

532
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,050
you're like, yeah, that's not like a good,

533
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,680
it's the highest rate
of, uh, our heard anyway,

534
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,930
an escalated rate of leukemia
amongst hydro workers.

535
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,130
I used to do land surveying a lot of years
ago running the transit and doing the

536
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:09,581
land surveying.

537
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:12,610
And I remember every once in a while
we'd have to set up underneath like the

538
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,860
hydro wires are crossing or whatever.
And I,

539
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,880
I distinctly remember looking through
the transit and feeling electrical shocks

540
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:23,030
coming into my, my, my
forehead is, I wasn't trying
to mark the spot for the, the,

541
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,630
the, the party chief sort of thing. Yeah.

542
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,480
So I mean if that's happening and I'm
standing on the ground hunter, you know,

543
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:29,314
112,

544
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,950
200 yards from the wires and I've got
electricity coming up through my transit

545
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,950
and into my forehead. Come on.
It just can't be congested.

546
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,140
Good man.
This is not right.

547
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,730
It's like you're getting stoned all day.
Yeah.

548
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,790
Wow. Yeah. You can't live near that.

549
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,370
I don't think there's no science.

550
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,700
The science behind non conclusive

551
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,790
data, that feeling of uh, being
around nothing. No, no cell phones.

552
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,610
The weird, the weird thing about
it is it's kind of invigorating.

553
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:04,850
Like you don't need naps.
Like does,

554
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:06,830
one of the things that
me and my friend Brian,

555
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,150
one of the that we talked about like
we never got like tired and we got,

556
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,340
we went hiking and we got sweaty and
we were out of breath for a second,

557
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:16,490
you know, like that kind of tired. But
we never got that weird, I need a nap.

558
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,050
Tired that you get in the city.

559
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,180
There's this weird thing that happens
where you know the middle of the day,

560
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,750
like fucking go for a nap right now.
That'd be awesome.

561
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,320
You don't have that feeling when you're
out there doing something all the time.

562
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,360
I should try it in the Arctic.

563
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:35,260
If you go to the Arctic in June
and you've got the sun 24 hours,

564
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,400
you just, you're like, you're
just like, oh, you know, and
I'm alone. I do my thing.

565
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,290
So I'm thinking, oh, I'll,
I think I'll, you know,

566
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,470
go shoot the scene over here would be
starting a fire or something and I'll look

567
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:49,390
at my watch, he'll say
4:30 AM and I'm like, okay.

568
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,740
And I've been up, you know, you just,

569
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,500
you just stay up and you feel like staying
up because the sun never leaves and

570
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,740
you just, you know, you crash
eventually because you crash.

571
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,670
But you can stamp a long
time in the Arctic, in the,
in the, in the early spring.

572
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,680
It's pretty awesome. Max, how
many days have you stayed up?

573
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,410
I don't know because you lose.

574
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,140
When I was doing my thing survivorman
I would lose track of time anyway.

575
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,840
It's easy when there's nightfall,
but when I'm in the Arctic he just,

576
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,900
I can tell it's night because the
sun is over on that side of the sky.

577
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:17,410
But you know, cause it circles around
here like this. I'll, I'll just does this,

578
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:20,320
this oval loop around
the perimeter of the sky.

579
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,560
I would just think we gotta get Outta
here, man. This place is going to blow.

580
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,370
That's what I would think if this is, the
sun is only up all the time. We're like,

581
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:33,970
we got, you can't live here. We've got
to get the amendment in California.

582
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:37,720
This place is going to blow sooner
or later. How dare you bring that up,

583
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,980
scare the shit out

584
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,600
of me.
And December 21st is coming.

585
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,970
I don't really think that it
was an earthquake predictor
that predicted the big

586
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:50,440
one. I think it was just the
end of the calendar. Yeah.

587
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,590
But there's a lot of people want to like
get behind it and it becomes this focal

588
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,110
point, which could mean
that something could happen.

589
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:00,780
Just because so many people
are focused self fulfilling
prophecy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,030
I was asked to do a
bunch of TV shows on a,

591
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,320
on going out and like checking out people
who are preparing for the apocalypse

592
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:09,560
and preparing for the last days. And
uh, I just don't know. I couldn't get,

593
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,510
I couldn't really get my head around it,

594
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:15,080
but I want to find people that
prepare for y two K it didn't happen.

595
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,380
And then where are they now?

596
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,870
They went crazy for a little
while and then they said he know.

597
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,310
I think we were just a little premature.
It's 2012 it's really going down.

598
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,900
So what about the dude who put up
the 200 billboards? Oh yeah, yeah,

599
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:31,650
I remember that. And he actually
went on record and said, if, uh, if,

600
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,970
if it doesn't happen,
God is a liar and I'd love to,

601
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,860
I would have loved to call them the next
morning. So, uh, did, we're still here.

602
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,050
I think that guy had done that before
though. Yeah, he did. He isn't. Yeah,

603
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:47,890
I think so. I don't know if it's the same
guy or not, but there was another guy,

604
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:51,800
I did that shit. Oh, she's
one of those things, man. When
you're in a position like,

605
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,270
uh,

606
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,270
like especially guys who are preachers
and pastors and anybody's in a religious

607
00:33:58,581 --> 00:33:59,061
position,

608
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:03,980
you're in this position of literally
being the word of God from God to the book

609
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:07,910
through your mouth.
If you're around a lot of dumb people,

610
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,570
you can, you can all of a sudden
believe your own bullshit.

611
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,660
You can start thinking that you
make sense. Next thing you know,

612
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:15,950
you're buying billboards.

613
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,370
He telling everybody the end's coming
and you give them a very specific date.

614
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:23,200
Like, do you have a like a plan
B? If this is incorrect or you,

615
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:26,450
you just rolling your diet's, you're
a crazy person. You're a crazy person.

616
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:28,910
Just rolling the dice.
I mean,

617
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:31,850
a lot of these lots of guys in that
position that they've carry a lot of

618
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:35,930
charisma, right? Yeah. You know,
Burt Lancaster movie, the rain maker,

619
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,860
and it's just so much charisma,
you know, you could sell, you know,

620
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,180
I've never fridges, two fridges
to an Eskimo, all kinds of things.

621
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,100
I've never seen that. Is that
a good one? That's a good one.

622
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,350
That's a good classic movie.
I think it's called the rainmaker.

623
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:49,310
It's Burt Lancaster. It's pretty, it's
pretty killer. And it's about that, right?

624
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:49,491
I mean,

625
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:54,491
he's so masterfully charming and
charismatic that you want to believe,

626
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,030
you know, and, and that's what
happens. And if you're in,

627
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,570
if you're living in the pit
or you live in, in, in, you
know, you've got misery. Um,

628
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,860
someone really charismatic comes along,
you know, whatever, whatever you say, man,

629
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,840
my favorite one is when the charismatic
guys call someone else. A false prophet.

630
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,860
That's my favorite. She put
all the charismatic, you know,

631
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,060
teachers in like the ring.
Yeah, I do a cage match.

632
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,680
It would have to be like
a Roman thing though.

633
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,250
27 towards everybody should
be dead there. You ever, ever,

634
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:30,530
ever seen the guy, um, he's got the hair
slicked back, I forget what his name is.

635
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,540
Famous guys. The one who always talks
in tongues. Jimmy Swaggart. No, no, no.

636
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,770
So one of the,
one of the last popular guys,

637
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,800
I forget his name, but he's
a, he was on TV, he said,

638
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,950
every time you write a check to me,
Satan gets a black eye.

639
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,860
He said that with a straight face.

640
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,610
Okay.

641
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,580
Maybe Satan says gay lover.
That's an unbelievable quote.

642
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,220
Like that's another like
the fact like you are,

643
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,930
your bar is so low like of people who
are going to buy that line who are going

644
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:03,310
to believe that it's good fodder for
south park shows anyway. Yeah, exactly.

645
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,270
But it was real.

646
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:07,840
It wasn't like it wasn't a Saturday
night live sketch that was a real guy who

647
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:11,500
was actually saying that you've given him
money and say it and gets a black eye.

648
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,730
They came up with it. That
strategy for extracting money, um,

649
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:20,260
where they were telling people
that if they were broke,

650
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,820
what they should do is give the church
money and then God would pay them back

651
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:27,070
like a hundred fold.
And like,

652
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:30,850
they kept like advertising that and
having all these people tell the success

653
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:31,990
stories about how they were,

654
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,690
they had no money for the
rent and no money for food,

655
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:39,691
but there was $200 they had stashed and
they sent it now and all the sudden they

656
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:43,270
want the lot and they will tell this
crazy story about all these great things

657
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:44,200
that happened to them when,

658
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,290
so they're literally going for people
who are beyond poor, they have net,

659
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,340
they have like there's still scraping
together their last pennies to send to the

660
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:53,790
council.

661
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,380
Extortion. It's like in a religious
extortion, you know, I know that, uh,

662
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,250
I remember years of, uh, just, you know,

663
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,200
just talking to this kind of stuff and
learning and searching and all that. And,

664
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,880
and the thing about like,

665
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,740
if you take something like a Jehovah's
Witness to thing to thing about it is

666
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:13,750
that
if you're not in,

667
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,930
then you are of Satan.
So therefore,

668
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,220
if you are of Satan than anything
you're going to say to me in the next 15

669
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,110
minutes is going to be from Satan.

670
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,650
So basically you just have to get finished
saying what you're saying and then I

671
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:28,360
will show you the,
the way,

672
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,540
and that's the tricky part is how do you
have a realistic debate with someone of

673
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:37,120
a dogma when they're
convinced that whatever,

674
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,740
that you're already connected to Satan,

675
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:41,920
so you don't even know what you're
saying anyway. You can't. It becomes,

676
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:42,800
it becomes an impossible.
Well

677
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,540
situation. Satan is the gateway
to to like you're crazy.

678
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,830
Like you can believe in God all day.
You can believe in angels,

679
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,690
you can all that.
It's cool,

680
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,430
but when you start thinking that Satan
is hiding in your basement or Satan's

681
00:37:57,431 --> 00:37:58,840
around the corner or Satan's coming,

682
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,240
you can't bring up Satan
like no one can say,

683
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:04,990
we found site and in Afghanistan were
moving in right now hanging with Jimmy

684
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,440
Hoffa. Yeah. You can't say you found
Satan. You know, you can't say,

685
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:11,760
Satan is influencing me. People go,
oh, you're fucking crazy. You're,

686
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,250
but if you believe in God, a
biblical God, you really are.

687
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,770
You're supposed to believe in
Satan too, I believe. Yeah.

688
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:20,740
I believe it's part of the pack. I
better look that up. But you can't. Yeah,

689
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,930
you can't do that.
And you can't ever,

690
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,390
you're listening to Reverend Joe Rogan
here. Robert Tilton false prophet.

691
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,450
That's the guy. Uh, it's,
I'm looking at it a,

692
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:34,360
a website about a false profits and
that's what they're calling Robert Tilton.

693
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,550
He's the guy who every time
you write a check to me,

694
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:40,120
say it and gets a black
eyes, gets a back. He was,

695
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,890
he was a guy that he,

696
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:45,820
they took a video of him saying a bunch
of things and they put fart noises

697
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:49,470
behind it. Incredible farting. It's
preacher. Did you see that? No.

698
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,090
It's funny.
In a very juvenile and it's embarrassing.

699
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,180
You find it.
It's not good for more than five seconds.

700
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,650
You get annoyed with
it. Uh, Robert Tillman,

701
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,560
Tilton t, Tilton rather. T. I. L. T.
O. I. Yeah. This looks good already.

702
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,900
Does it? Yeah. Just from the, a thumbnail.

703
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,880
This is him for, I've seen all that. Laban
is, I've seen what Laban is done under.

704
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,393
Not Amazing,

705
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,900
but my word will not return void and
it will go to that which it was sent

706
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,133
and it,

707
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:36,590
but life and joy and
the the nature of God.

708
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,450
Oh,
laid Lu

709
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:45,080
for eating all salt provided multiply.

710
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,610
That's the opening of
the windows of heaven.

711
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,140
I'm a child. God bless you
too. I'm fucking childish.

712
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,880
I laugh at Childish Shit.
If it was just a cat on reality TV,

713
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,910
yes, I definitely problems like
I'm not, I'm not claiming that,

714
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:08,150
don't I? I'm, I'm silly person.

715
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,550
I find find humor in silly things.
It's your job to them. Yeah,

716
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:15,380
I guess part of it that's made it
a job. Yeah, that's more like it.

717
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:16,580
I sort of shoot.

718
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,260
Well still you see, I mean, so to die.

719
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,300
Who was doing what I was doing before I
was doing it. Nobody, nobody. I made it a,

720
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,260
I made it.
It's like,

721
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:26,390
oh well I'm going to go sleep under
some twigs and start a fire boat and you

722
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,160
will pay me some money to do this.

723
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,490
Did you start out like
just camping and say,

724
00:40:31,491 --> 00:40:35,230
I wonder how long I could survive
on my own with a few simple,

725
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,190
no, I was actually a, I was working at
much music in Toronto, a much music city,

726
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:45,020
TV producing the video network there
and, and uh, and I was a singer,

727
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:47,630
songwriter, rock and roll
musician and playing in the bars,

728
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:51,380
doing all this stuff and we were getting
signed to RCA was doing well and I got

729
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:54,980
really disillusioned with
all of that industry and uh,

730
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:58,010
and I stood there and I was what, 25 and
I didn't know what to do and I was like,

731
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:00,810
what am I going to do now cause I'm, I'm
quitting. I'm getting out of this, um,

732
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,030
to actually,
you know what,

733
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:07,280
I left music in the 80s because the music
of the eighties sucked so bad that I

734
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:10,700
just said I can't, I can't get him
some more and Halan. Okay. Van Halen.

735
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,330
Well Ain't away to my window.
That's right.

736
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:17,130
And you got to go pre junk free jail.

737
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,310
Well there was other good,
wasn't that the same?

738
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,570
At least you didn't say
salmon hot for teacher was on
that album, was it? I think,

739
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,550
I don't know. I think so.
Yeah. It was a bad video too.

740
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,960
We'll jump was just a little
electric. They went poppy, they got,

741
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,580
they got poppy on that and it
was, but at least, you know,

742
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:34,010
at least it was pre Sammy.
You made a good point though.

743
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:37,460
There's not much from that era that come
on Depeche mode, the Thompson twins.

744
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,330
I just wanted to kill
myself. Thank you. Thank you.

745
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,800
Isn't there something until the hearing
a real guitar. It's everything man. And,

746
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,340
and you know what, I, I left the
music industry just dropped it.

747
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:52,730
I didn't play my guitar for 10
years. I didn't, I remember saying,

748
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,980
I don't even want to know
what's coming on in the rate.

749
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,040
I remember like audibly saying,
Oh yeah, you hear this new band.

750
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,320
But then they go to say it and I
don't want to know. I don't care.

751
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,750
I don't care about music anymore.
It's dead. Because you know,

752
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:06,740
rock and roll was dead. And I was
like Cindy Lauper. And so I, uh,

753
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,670
I what I did more on that later,
but what,

754
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,440
cause one thing I gotta say
I regret is I missed, uh,

755
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,270
pearl jam and Nirvana and sound good.
I missed all that cause I was in a canoe.

756
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,960
I don't regret being in a canoe,
but I missed that happening.

757
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,720
And I now I look back and going, man,
that was some pretty good stuff going on.

758
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:27,440
I wish I hadn't missed that era. I was
in a canoe. I spent, that's where I went.

759
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,290
So I looked and I thought
what I want to do.

760
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,600
And the first thing I thought was
I want to do wilderness adventure.

761
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,400
And I didn't even know what that meant.
I just said,

762
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,380
wilderness adventure is throw
it out there in the air.

763
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,060
And I remember I used to love Jacques
Cousteau and Tarzan movies and I saw this

764
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:45,290
little ad for wilderness survival course
and the college and I went and I took

765
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:49,970
the wilderness survival course and Humber
College in Toronto and I fell in love.

766
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,540
That was it. I've never looked back.
And His dog sledding, sea kayaking,

767
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,570
Whitewater canoeing, everything
I could do with being out there.

768
00:42:56,571 --> 00:43:00,100
And I spent the next, you know, 10 12
years doing nothing but adventuring and,

769
00:43:00,101 --> 00:43:03,260
and lots of survival to why that's,
that's how I,

770
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,750
that's how I learned and trained
was just all laymen stuff. You know,

771
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:09,320
I came down to the states and trained
with John and Jerry Macpherson and then I

772
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,750
went out and practiced a lot
when out and survived, you know,

773
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,380
first with classes and people and
then with buddies and then on my own.

774
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,130
And then I was, I'd been out on
my own and that's, you know, and,

775
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,070
and I got to say some of the best of your,

776
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,400
I was lean and mean and fit.
I mean,

777
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:29,350
I was carrying canoes all summer long
and guidance teenage kids and carrying

778
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,910
their canoes cause they wouldn't,
I was, it was great time.

779
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:36,310
I was about 28 29 by this time and I was
rock solid hard. And I love that man.

780
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,920
Someone's going to take that
and make a clip that they will.

781
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,160
I was so hard then every
day. And it was, yeah,

782
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,510
that's going to be a problem. That's
going to be a problem. I know.

783
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,170
That's all right. I hear what
you're saying. So you were, um,

784
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,460
you were just living like a savage.
Well, I was, I'm an outdoor guide.

785
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,910
I was an outdoor guide and I loved
it, man. It was awesome. And, um,

786
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,710
and it was a,

787
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:05,510
about 10 years of that into that where
I'm just to wrap the story up basically,

788
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:08,930
where I kind of got itchy for music again,

789
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:12,200
and I was in Yellowknife in the northwest
territories and w stepped into a blues

790
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:15,950
bar and they had a, um, Monday
blues jam. And I thought, well,

791
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,210
I used to blow some harmonica, you know,
uh, jumped up in a blue on, uh, uh,

792
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,410
some harp on a Mustang Sally. And the
minute I stepped on that stage, I went,

793
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,420
Oh man, I've missed this. And, uh, so I
started playing again as well, but then,

794
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,450
you know, uh, basically
that's right about, I mean,

795
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,670
I was keeping my kids in diapers
by playing the bars. At that point.

796
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:39,270
I started playing the bars
won't, you know, solo playing.
And, uh, and, and then,

797
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:42,330
you know,
then is when a survivor series hit,

798
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,540
did my interviews and made my phone
call and Survivorman Kinda took over.

799
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,770
Wow. That's incredible man. What
do you think happened in the 80s?

800
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,540
It made a music fall off?

801
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,090
Well,
there was a few things.

802
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,880
Number one was everybody was
hung up on saying rock is dead.

803
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,100
Everybody thought it was Zeplin
dinosaur rock and Floyd dinosaur.

804
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,600
They were calling a dinosaur rock. If you
listen to a Q and a seven Toronto, you,

805
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:05,300
oh well you're listening to
dinosaur rocky and, and I,

806
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,680
and so it was all synthesizer solos
weren't allowed to go on unendingly.

807
00:45:09,681 --> 00:45:14,420
You had to have precise Nini, Nini, Nini,
Nini, Nini, Deany Neat Solos, you know,

808
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:17,450
all of this fed into
this synthesizer stuff.

809
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:22,400
And we had Thompson twins and
flock of seagulls and Aha on,

810
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:25,100
and it's not that there weren't
some bright spots, you know,

811
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:29,170
sting was doing some great stuff and
Peter Gabriel was the youtube, you know,

812
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,490
there was some bright spots,
but as a general rule,

813
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:35,180
the pop culture went to this and
the whole thing about rock and dead.

814
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,560
And then when I met what I missed,
when the whole grunge movement came out,

815
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,680
came out and I started listening
to Pearl Jam. Only recently,

816
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:45,580
I was like going through all this
old stuff. I'm like going, Oh,

817
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,190
this is just rock music.
That's all it is. You know? Uh,

818
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,230
Mike McCready, whatever his name
is from Pearl Jam, Ace kick,

819
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:57,231
he's doing a kick ass rock blues
solo for five minutes on alive.

820
00:45:57,561 --> 00:46:00,320
That's all he's doing. He's doing the
almond brothers. He's doing cream.

821
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:05,120
He's doing Zeplin it. Absolutely. And
that, you know, so I'm, I'm actually now,

822
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:09,020
I think music's awesome. I
think, you know, Dave Matthews,
Ray Lamontagne, you know,

823
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,830
Adele, you know, off, I'll even say lady
Gaga, you know, pink, uh, you know, um,

824
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,450
the mom, Mumford and sons. I'm, I think
there's some great stuff out there today,

825
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:19,670
but in the eighties and the eighties,
I was so,

826
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,500
I couldn't bend more
disillusioned with music.

827
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,280
Wow. Um, have you ever heard
of roadkill ghost choir?

828
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,020
No. I just found out about us. I
just listened to this one song. Uh,

829
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,440
I think it's called,
I don't even remember the name of it,

830
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,500
but whatever it is that the, there
are a new band. It's like God,

831
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:41,340
this really sort of Bluesy Banjo.
He field to them.

832
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,940
Great vocals,
like really interesting songs.

833
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,380
There's guys like the black keys of
course here at the black case. Ben Harper.

834
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,290
I'm not, I've never really
listened to much. Ben Harper

835
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,750
men's cool. I'm going to, especially
at it too, we were talking,

836
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:56,380
you know if you're going to
go down the spiritual road,

837
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:57,670
you know Ben's and explorer,
right?

838
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:00,460
He's a spiritual explorer and so there's
a lot of words and a lot of lyrics here

839
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:03,880
that take you down that road. I don't
know anything about them. My player,

840
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:05,530
you know, he's one of those
famous dudes that I know.

841
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,930
It's not like I get a reviewer to see six.
Steve, what is it? C six Steve Seasick.

842
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,330
Google seasick Steve.
Okay,

843
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,330
everybody should Google see 60
if this guy is the real deal.

844
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,590
Jack White pulled him off.

845
00:47:17,591 --> 00:47:20,790
I don't know where he found
them on a street or something.
He plays heavy slides,

846
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:25,390
Zz top light blues. On a broom handle
with a wire and the guy is the real deal.

847
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,860
Like he's just, and now he's playing at
the, what are they called? Isle Man Rock.

848
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,230
He's

849
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,640
playing of 30,000 people. Here
you go, man. That's seasick Steve.

850
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,590
How old is that dude? Old enough man.
And that's a real guitar. But he's got

851
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:49,150
like one that he plays with a broom.
He's got this bad ass Nigga,

852
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:51,110
this Nigga his guitar strap.
It's a strength.

853
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,790
You know who plays with them?
John Paul Jones has his bass player now

854
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,100
he played with Dave Grohl,
the foo fighters

855
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,890
called trust.
Y'all

856
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,980
see 60 man. So you know, I dunno.

857
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,960
I think now I liked the
music that's out there now.

858
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,140
Like what's coming down the pipe now?

859
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,050
I want to know what happened to them
in the 80s where did it go wrong?

860
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,630
How did they get from it's where day?
Yeah.

861
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,630
How did they get from Leonard scattered
to some of the shit that float and ate?

862
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:51,060
Some of it I blame on on on the
edge because as much as I really,

863
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,010
I like you too. You too much.
I love you too. But the edge,
you know, started doing,

864
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,570
you know, sort of nondescript
guitar Solos, no noodling, know,

865
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,730
riffing, you know, and, and um,

866
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,350
and so the whole whole group of followup
guitar players came into this and then

867
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:08,840
cleaned that up even more.
And,

868
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,120
and so you ended up with all these really
little precise little nugget that we

869
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:15,800
lost the rock and roller. We lost the
shredder. You know, I went to rose,

870
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:21,270
the sound that you two created and
fantastic where the streets have no name.

871
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:25,140
I mean that is a frilly and that's
one of the greatest songs ever.

872
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,430
That just that power of that fucking song.
Like oof.

873
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,540
I, I hear you though. There's
the other stuff is missing.

874
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,980
Even like Bruce was doing dancing in
the dark. I mean Bruce, you know us.

875
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:40,800
What were you doing? You know what
happened buddy? Courtney Cox was on video,

876
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:41,730
so that's an shit.

877
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:47,390
He's dancing so white to comparising
for a culture that was the ADC style.

878
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,460
Totally do that man.
You could totally do a version of that.

879
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,550
Know when it was like for the wild.

880
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:58,230
They were trying to cool the Dal something
coming on and they were trying to

881
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:02,790
make it cool to dance for like the
longest time they tried with center fever.

882
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,650
That worked for a little while.

883
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:08,390
And then you know why people quit quickly
got away from it when they found they

884
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:12,480
could go to bars and just not dance. Well,
there's only one Michael Jackson, man.

885
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:15,210
I mean, I thought Michael was a genius.
You see? What do you know what I love?

886
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,650
I love entertainers. Yeah. Pure
gene Kelly, Elvis, the Beatles.

887
00:50:19,651 --> 00:50:22,800
Michael Jackson, David Lee Roth,
and quintessential from it.

888
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,820
So the other night I went out to see axl
rose in Vegas, guns and roses. Right.

889
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,950
And um,

890
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,420
do you know what Qi was?
Iconic. He did his move. He,

891
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:35,420
his voice was right on. He's put on
a bit of weight like bottled did,

892
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,960
but just like bottle. He was kicking
out his voice. He played all the hits.

893
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,590
It was awesome. What happens to
those guys too? They just go bananas.

894
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,590
Who He'd just get too famous
was axl rose type characters.

895
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,510
They just get to huge as rock stars.

896
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,140
And then they just go bananas for a few
years and then pull it together again.

897
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,520
I don't know. I Dunno. I Dunno. I at some
of them do not know. I mean, when I go,

898
00:50:55,521 --> 00:51:00,521
not all of them listen to like welcome
to the jungle and sweet child of mine.

899
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,830
He opens with welcome to the [inaudible].
When you go back and listen to those,

900
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,030
you will like Jesus Christ.

901
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:08,030
You mean this guy could have been
putting out shit like this for 20 years.

902
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,050
If somehow or another he could keep it
together and still produce this kind of

903
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:16,250
shit. I kid, their early
stuff was fucking fantastic.

904
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,050
Mr. Brown stone. How could they, how
could they fuck that up? Alcohol, drugs,

905
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:25,180
women and Cat pee. Joe. Too
much money. Too much money,

906
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,770
but you don't like it. It
happens. You listen to right now,

907
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:30,440
Peter Frampton's going out and I don't
know, I don't know if my friend Danny,

908
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,470
Danny knows Peter at all, but
uh, Peters out doing his, his,

909
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,530
his co Frampton comes alive.
He's doing interviews and seven,

910
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,200
I was just too young. I had all the money
throw it. He was too young, you know, to,

911
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,353
to handle it.

912
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,320
It's different now because now you come
with like bookkeepers and people were

913
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:47,450
like, man, it's so much
different back then.

914
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,800
I just read Greg Allman's autobiography.
Really?

915
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,880
What a great read it's and you just,

916
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,770
I mean I literally read it as a rock and
roller with complete envy from page one

917
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:00,830
to the end. I'm like, Oh man, look at him.

918
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,750
Cause he'd be like every fifth page
and we just did it for the music man.

919
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,810
It was just about the music we played for
free and all of these parts cause it's

920
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:13,590
just about them like yeah, that's
why it's so good. It was incredible.

921
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,750
It's a great read. It's called my cross
to bear. He was a bad motherfucker. Yeah.

922
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:20,390
And if you hear this Greg,
I blew a mean harp.

923
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:23,450
I don't want to come play with you at
the beacon theater when you're playing in

924
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,720
there, adding jump up on stage and
blow some harp with you. Thank God.

925
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:30,950
He said Harp. Do you want, do you
want me to take a harmonica? Have you,

926
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,040
have you ever met him or
connected with him and then, no,

927
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,800
I just read the book recently and I just,
I just, you know, it was like, yeah,

928
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:39,740
I mean, I know I sound like an
old rocker, but you know. Okay.

929
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:42,680
So last night I was at Alice
Cooper's Cooper town in Phoenix,

930
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:46,300
Arizona cause I get to play
in the Chrysalis putting
some times and he's got the

931
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:47,210
solid rock foundation.

932
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:49,310
It's a great foundation that
Alice Cooper does for street kids.

933
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,280
Last night was a battle of the bands
and I was listening to the battle of the

934
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,500
bands and they're trying to
compete for one spot to play in.

935
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:57,680
As Chris was putting concert and a,
he's got all Smith's pudding,

936
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,480
that's what you call it, sales
Cooper, Christmas pudding concerts,

937
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,530
a big rock show for a in a theater.
And you know,

938
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,370
all the proceeds go to
the solid rock foundation.

939
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,830
So these bands are
battling it out last night.

940
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:09,650
So I'm watching twentysomethings young,
young,

941
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:14,360
20 somethings and even younger, uh,
playing it up. And you know what?

942
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,970
I sat and I thought,
these guys are playing rock and roll.

943
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,240
They were just playing rock and roll and
actually I was like thrilled. I thought,

944
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:23,780
look, check it out. It was a guy went up
there and he was ripping off Blues Solos.

945
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:25,980
They would and they were doing and he's,

946
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,590
these are kids, 20 year old kids
and they were playing rock and roll.

947
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,450
I was very happy last night.
Yeah.

948
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,440
There's something to be said certainly
for that particular type of music.

949
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:38,240
Like it doesn't need to [inaudible].
It doesn't need to be synthesized.

950
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:41,520
It doesn't need to like we,
you doesn't need to be overproduced.

951
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:44,010
There's emotion comes through that music,

952
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:48,210
through that raw guitar and
here in a real drum. You know,

953
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:51,780
like seeing a guy really hit
the base, having, you know,

954
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,930
having it like a band,
like the black keys,

955
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,650
like there's an emotion that comes
through watching their stuff that it's so

956
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:03,350
crisp. It's not like did, did,

957
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:10,020
did
you know that fake weird noise.

958
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,780
It's like you don't have to
reproduce the noise, you know,

959
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:16,540
just to keep doing it with,
with instruments like instruments,

960
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,480
you're expressing a person's
movement through, through guitar,

961
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,960
through the drums.
You're expressing this person's movement.

962
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,540
And as soon as I know that you're just
pressing some buttons and it's creating

963
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,200
them, that music that, that
sound becomes weird. Well,

964
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:35,130
my contention is that the thing, here's
the other thing that got lost in the 80s.

965
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:40,340
The thing that's missed is music is live
musical performance because you can do

966
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:44,450
whatever you want in the studio
with auto tune and you know,

967
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:48,050
a guitar garage, you'd Guitar what
I would, guitar garage bandwidth.

968
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:50,670
You can do anything you want
with pro tools and logic,

969
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,150
but you can't recreate that
live unless you've got a shit.

970
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,490
And I played a Gig in odd, uh,
Ottawa, Ontario a month or so,

971
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:03,270
a couple of weeks ago and it was a rock
bar and I've been playing my, my big,

972
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,370
my more sort of Nice stage
stuff with my, my, uh,

973
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,920
film footage from around the world. And
I do it survivorman question and answer,

974
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,160
but final say for some reason we got
booked into Mavericks and Ottawa is a rock

975
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:16,450
bar and I had a blast because,
you know,

976
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,740
not by the end of that night I was
almost in heart attack territory.

977
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,480
I was drenched with sweat. I blew my
harmonica like crazy all night long.

978
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,720
Had a blast with people. And it's
like, you know, you can't replace that.

979
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:32,721
You can't replace great live performance
with synthesize preprogrammed button

980
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:37,170
pushing crap. Yeah, you can't do
it. You got to be good on stage.

981
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,850
That's what separates the, you know, the
stars from the hackers. But then again,

982
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:45,470
I say there's some electronic music that
I think is very artistic should or is.

983
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:50,340
Yeah, it's not, it's not the same
thing. I'm an art rock lover.

984
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:54,000
I grew up, you know, Pink Floyd, I think
Radiohead's fen, fantastic muse, you know.

985
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:58,440
Uh, absolutely. You know, so it's
not, it's not to the exclusion, right?

986
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,251
It's just a,

987
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:01,890
something that went wrong in the eighties
cause it's some of the stuff that's

988
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,230
wrong then, you know, I dunno.

989
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,400
Cause bands were getting signed in the
80s that had never even been on stage.

990
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,710
You know, and I steely Dan, they got
grandfathered in for that. They're okay.

991
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:16,440
They're an exception. But in
the eighties you know, no,

992
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:17,910
I mean these people never performed.

993
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,670
It's Kinda interesting because that's
sort of one of the things that's happened

994
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:21,231
with the Internet.

995
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:25,000
It's forced live performances be much
more frequent if you want to make money

996
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:29,410
because they can't sell the
kind of records that they
used to be able to sell it.

997
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:33,850
This did the internet swallowed everything
up. I think it's a good thing. I mean,

998
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:37,300
only because I love the stage. Like I
was saying earlier, I like entertainment,

999
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,620
you know, I think it's a good thing too.
And it also prevents those like, um, uh,

1000
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,600
Mike Meyers movie scenarios where they
construct a fake band. You know, I mean,

1001
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,150
it seems like it would be a Mike
Meyers movie or something like that,

1002
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,540
but that's like a lot of like milli
Vanilli a lot of these bands that they

1003
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:52,871
create,

1004
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:57,871
like they put together these artificial
things in a very like comical,

1005
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:03,050
cartoonish sort of way and people just
ate it up. What do you think a of idol,

1006
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,470
the idol, American idol, the voice, uh,

1007
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,200
America's got talent and really
watched them. I've, I've only watched,

1008
00:57:09,201 --> 00:57:13,900
I watched American idol a once and it
was obvious that a lot of the people that

1009
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:17,750
they were showing were crazy.
They were like their idea. Yeah.

1010
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,770
The idea of like what was
good was there were nuts.

1011
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,380
They were like saying their voice,
you'd be fucking terrible.

1012
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,170
It was almost like they were doing
it on purpose. Yeah, they do.

1013
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,700
That's the preliminary,
right.

1014
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,740
That's a preliminary shows
and when it gets to the end,

1015
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,430
I mean I have to meet you get to the end.
There's some talent on the stage. Sure.

1016
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,001
There is.
And,

1017
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:36,670
and that's why I said one of my
exceptions to the reality shows is the

1018
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:39,730
competition shows, you know, I,
those I've never minded, you know,

1019
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:43,840
for some reason that just seems they do
all the reality stuff around it for the,

1020
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:48,430
for the, you know, 11 episodes
leading up to the last two. But,

1021
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,310
but then when they get down to the
town and the performance, you know,

1022
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:54,820
it ends up on some pretty talented
people. I think it's pretty cool. Yeah.

1023
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:59,850
I think this is probably because of
the fact that there's more ways you can

1024
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:02,290
deliver your music.

1025
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:05,800
Like I found out about so many people
just because of a youtube video. I'm like,

1026
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:07,570
someone would send me
something through Twitter.

1027
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:10,150
You've got to check out this band.
So I go, okay, check on the band.

1028
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,550
And then some of them you don't give
a fuck about. And the other one,

1029
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:13,780
every now and then he'd go,
whoa.

1030
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,970
And so then you started retweeting
it and next thing you know,

1031
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:20,530
you're watching the, the numbers on the,
this, the hits just go up 10, 20,000,

1032
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,230
30,000 feet.
People start telling each other about it.

1033
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:26,620
Like it really becomes like a viral
thing if it's a really good song. Well,

1034
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:28,810
let me let, let me totally,
this is totally shameless,

1035
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:32,710
but I just found out this morning that
my song Arctic mistress is number 10 on

1036
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:35,830
the, on the most download
indie indie download this week.

1037
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,980
And I don't even know what that means.
It's called Arctic mistress.

1038
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:43,260
That's a powerful word. Arctic
missed. It was, it was my, you know,

1039
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,860
lyrical, uh, um, take on the
Arctic as, as a mistress,

1040
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:50,890
as a seductive woman. And so I
wrote it that way. It's a beautiful,

1041
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:53,260
it's kind of an AC song, so you're
not going to hear it on rock stations.

1042
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:56,890
But anyway, my point is being
is ac mean adult contemporary.

1043
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,690
You're going to hear it
in the dentist's office.

1044
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:01,990
You're not going to hear it on the rocks
and when I'm not going to play it today

1045
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:06,280
either, but, but uh, the point
being that, you know, I just
found that out. It's like,

1046
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,240
what's that mean? It's, it's, it was
too ahead of Adele for indie downloads.

1047
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,240
I'm like, okay, awesome. I
don't see any checks, haven't,

1048
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,800
but I don't know what it
means. But anyway, anyway,

1049
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,790
I just plugged it so I don't care.

1050
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,240
Do you like doing music more than
you like doing your show? Yes.

1051
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,350
Yeah. That's your, your
foot. Don't, don't,

1052
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:28,060
don't misconstrue that to say that
I don't love survivor man, cause I,

1053
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,290
I don't piss on the flag.
I mean, you know what?

1054
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,720
Survivorman open a lot
of back doors for me.

1055
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:35,750
I mean including going to play with
Alice Cooper, Stephen Stills, Tommy Shaw.

1056
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,160
That wouldn't happen if not for survivor
man. You know? So I think you, uh,

1057
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,490
you open a lot of people's
eyes on that show.

1058
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,770
That's a tip for me.
That's like as far as pop culture goes,

1059
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,151
that's one of the,

1060
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:53,840
that was the one most revealing shows
ever because a lot of people have this

1061
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,870
distorted perception of what they
would do if they got lost in the woods.

1062
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,270
I just go fishing,
catch some fish.

1063
00:59:59,271 --> 01:00:02,720
Like a mother fucker was always
good at fishing and I'm like, dude,

1064
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,700
get all the a dude, man. How
come you didn't like take
down a deer? And it's like,

1065
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:08,330
well,
okay,

1066
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:13,330
you take down a deer with a spoon and a
piece of string I can get all the time,

1067
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:16,880
man, how come you didn't catch a whole
bunch of fish? Okay, here's a Bobby pin.

1068
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:21,190
In some thread you go catch a whole bunch
of fish. So it's, it's people's. Yeah.

1069
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,630
But on the other hand,
what I always pointed out was anybody,

1070
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:29,150
like I went out there being just an
idiot because anybody could do what I do.

1071
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,860
I got some survival knowledge.

1072
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,230
There's no question and I've
got all that training for sure.

1073
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:37,310
But I also am doing things that
anybody could do. You know the thing,

1074
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:41,420
the way I survive, it's still
80% anyone. So you don't,

1075
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,410
not physically impressive. You don't have
to be in incredible shape. You don't,

1076
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:48,410
you just have to skillset,
skillset,

1077
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,390
not not super impressive
in terms of skill set.

1078
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:52,940
It's just here's what you
could do, you know? I mean,

1079
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,260
I'm really good at the fireball.

1080
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,340
So there's one of the ways that you
know the 20% where I kick it rubbing two

1081
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:00,840
sticks together. Yeah. Yeah.

1082
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,470
So that's not so normal for
everybody on the street,

1083
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:05,330
but a lot of the other stuff
is just what anybody could do.

1084
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,920
I tried to do that once and it was
not successful. It's just really hard.

1085
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,090
It is not easy to start a fire with a
stick luck that I didn't have enough of

1086
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:17,870
the little a kindling.
It's often like, you know,

1087
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:20,950
watching your sidekicks on the gun and
youtube the other day, I can't do this.

1088
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,470
I've been doing Muay Thai. I'm like
suck up my legs. I can't teach you that.

1089
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,810
I know that you could. I know Micah
teacher, the fireball, it's just,

1090
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,400
it's just that skill set, you know you'd
get, it's an exchange. Let's do it.

1091
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,800
Alright, I'll teach you how to
throw a side kick. Teach me to live.

1092
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,840
I live in the woods and cook
the food. What's the, the,

1093
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:41,390
the first time you did it, did you
go out for a test run? Like I will,

1094
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:45,140
I'll do two nights by myself in the
woods and then eventually kick it up to

1095
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:48,500
seven. I mean, for survivor man
itself, no, I knew I could do it,

1096
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:51,770
so I just went right at it. But before
that, had you done any trial runs?

1097
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:55,730
Had you done any like, not for survivor
man, but in learning survival? Yeah, lots.

1098
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:58,460
I done it with, as I said,
I went out with classes,

1099
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,230
I went to a friends and I
went out on my own for sure.

1100
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,810
And when you went on your own, did you
do the same thing you did on the show?

1101
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:04,070
Like give yourself a scenario,

1102
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:07,250
like a broken bike and you have to
dismantle the bike? Not so much.

1103
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:10,250
That was for the show? No, I just,
I just went out. I go out hiking.

1104
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,810
I go off in the Bush and do my thing.
Just just survive. It was all wilderness.

1105
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:17,540
See, I wasn't trying to create
scenarios then. I love the scenarios,

1106
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,200
but my stairs are fun.
Yeah.

1107
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:22,620
My favorite for sure was
the hot air balloon because
that was just the freakiest

1108
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:26,280
like you were going to shoot a rocket
at the line. That was cool. Hey, I know.

1109
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:29,040
I still love that it's,
it's when we do a promo clip or something,

1110
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,720
it's always in there because just that
I remember that moment just, you know,

1111
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,330
crank and down on the fuel
and just shooting like a 12
foot flame in front of me.

1112
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,840
Yeah, that's pretty rocket.
That was bad ass. It's like,
okay, lions bring it on man.

1113
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:44,400
Bring it. You were fucking hanging
out. Wiki lions, man. You need that.

1114
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:48,150
If you're hanging out with lions. Ooh,
that's so frightening. Barbecued zebra.

1115
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,760
Now I heard you on opiate,
Anthony.

1116
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:55,761
I think it was where you said that you
think you had a Sasquatch experience.

1117
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,930
Ooh, I'll tell a story. If
I can get another dentist.
Am I allowed to say again?

1118
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,380
We're not sponsored by any,
well damn it should be old.

1119
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:07,590
Milwaukee is what I want to get.

1120
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:11,160
Sponsors were too controversial for
alcohol companies, I should say.

1121
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,440
Sorry my Miller,
I'm from drinking my Miller lite.

1122
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:17,330
That's what I'm supposed to say, man.
I love you. This is delicious. Uh,

1123
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:20,520
so tasty. What we ask him.
Oh yeah. Big Fake Foot, man.

1124
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,660
I you said that you had more than one,
you know,

1125
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:27,240
to Sasquatch experiences when, uh, when my

1126
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:32,790
second wife and I were off
living in the Bush for you,

1127
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,310
we lived for the Bush in the Bush
for a year and I'm just like,

1128
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,710
it's like 500 years ago, no metal, no
matches, no plastic nylon. And we're like,

1129
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,920
you know, just a couple
of original traditional
aboriginal is living out there.

1130
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,400
And I did a film about it and all that.
And when we were, when we were out there,

1131
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:51,480
there was this moment where, um, we're
in a, I don't know where we were,

1132
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:55,030
but we were in like a little shelter.
We're out by the, by the river and it's,

1133
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,510
it's one of those quiet nights where
I can hear, you can hear everything.

1134
01:03:57,511 --> 01:04:02,511
It's just nice and quiet
and I hear a large bipedal,

1135
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,820
so you know,
two feet walking towards the tent.

1136
01:04:05,821 --> 01:04:08,010
Now I know what a bear
sounds like when I hear it.

1137
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,800
I know what a moose sounds like it and
I know their feet might line up and all

1138
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:14,700
that sort of stuff. I know those
sounds, and this was a very large,

1139
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:17,970
I would say it was like a very large
man walking in the forest. Now that's,

1140
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:20,670
you know, is that a big deal? Well,
yeah, we were in the middle of nowhere.

1141
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,180
Like there was no roads for,
you know, a hundred miles.

1142
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:26,730
So there should not be anybody walk and,

1143
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,420
and it was walking and it came
closer and closer and closer.

1144
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:34,350
It was about 50 feet from the tent.
I wished to this day I hadn't done this,

1145
01:04:34,351 --> 01:04:37,680
but I got nervous and I did the
same thing I might do with a bear.

1146
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:41,280
I just kinda yelled at, hey,
we're over here, you know, uh,

1147
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,070
not 10 minutes and send this
little shelter. And uh, and uh,

1148
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:49,071
it stopped and I wished I peeked my
head out around the corner and then it

1149
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:53,100
turned and it just walked away just
a little bit faster than it came.

1150
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,430
And that was it. So that was, that
was episode number one, a big,

1151
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:00,000
big man walking towards us
in the middle of the bush.

1152
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,470
And at nighttime it was dark.

1153
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:06,510
The second time was the one I told
an opiate Anthony. And that was,

1154
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:10,710
I was in day five or day six of
filming survivor man in Alaska.

1155
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,770
And um,
I'd filmed this scene.

1156
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,710
It's funny because we just looked at
these clips recently and I had forgotten

1157
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:20,890
something. I filmed this scene where
I was cutting grass up to make a bet.

1158
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:26,110
So recently we were looking at the footage
and, and I'm going to look at that,

1159
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:29,590
look at that. And my editor pointed
out and we'd look and every I'm,

1160
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,520
I'm doing my thing and you
see me stopping and going

1161
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,920
like that and I'm just looking now at
whatever and went back and I do the two or

1162
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,900
three times I stopped and I look, I forgot
that I did that, but we saw it on our,

1163
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:46,540
on our, our outtakes, so
to speak. And I'm starving.

1164
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,550
I just keep looking on the bush.
Anyway,

1165
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:52,990
I finished my scene and I turn the
cameras off and I'm just sort of standing

1166
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,400
there and I hear the sound and the
heck, you know, and um, you know,

1167
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,540
of course I'm thinking grizzly
bear of course. Absolutely.

1168
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:02,470
That's what I'm thinking.
And about 50 feet away,

1169
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:07,600
it's ruffles the sort of
roughing in the trees,

1170
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,210
rustling in the trees.
And then I hear,

1171
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,950
Ooh,

1172
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,060
like that only way louder,
right up my spine.

1173
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:24,100
And then he did it five more times
like that. Super, super loud.

1174
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:28,510
Now I've heard Moose and bear of her
bears grunt. Well, I can make a wolf howl,

1175
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:32,790
but I've never heard anything like that
before in my life other than a zoo with

1176
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:36,320
a great ape exhibit. Right.
Oh, so to me, you know,

1177
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:40,000
there's two ways to ask a question.
Joe. You can say to someone, hey man,

1178
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:43,480
did you believe in big foot? That's a
hard question to ask because you know,

1179
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:47,460
if you're sitting around at a party, it's
like, ah, no way, dude. You got it man.

1180
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,930
Don't be losers. No Sir. That's
when we asked a question.

1181
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,050
The other way to ask the question is,
do you think it's possible?

1182
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,470
Did on our vast expanses of
forest throughout the planet,

1183
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:01,740
that in tiny little pockets of maybe
six species sticks members that,

1184
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,440
uh, uh, by peatal gigantic
epiphysis ape could exist.

1185
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,350
It's very intuitive and sensitive human
beings and doesn't really want to be

1186
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:12,270
discovered yet is responsible for
hundreds and hundreds of physical, uh,

1187
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,150
audible anecdotes. That's a
different way to ask the question.

1188
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,840
And so I actually presented
that to discovery channel
science channel recently.

1189
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:21,600
I said, why don't I do
Survivorman bigfoot? Matt,

1190
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:25,450
why don't I go out there and I'll
just go no camera co and they are,

1191
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:27,490
they're down with it. We're trying
to make that happen right now.

1192
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:30,880
Are you going to go back to the same spot?
I thought about that.

1193
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:34,060
That was a tech Tekla arm or
something like that. I'll ask,

1194
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:40,640
but there's some hot in BC and in,
uh, I think a Washington state.

1195
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:45,050
So I'll go to a few so that,
I mean, so what am I saying?

1196
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:48,140
Do I believe? I don't know what
the answer is. I don't know.

1197
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:50,490
I just know what I heard.
When you watch finding big foot,

1198
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:54,090
do you guys get out there bitch,
man, I'm looking for real.

1199
01:07:54,091 --> 01:07:54,831
You know what you're asking me?

1200
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:59,630
You're asking me about a reality show
I'm watching and I'm just like, no.

1201
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:04,040
Really? Here comes another episode of
what was that? I heard a squatch. Oh,

1202
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:07,220
that's a squatch. And then you see
nothing cut to commercial catch. Conversa.

1203
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,830
Every single, every show is the
same thing, right? Oh, let's,

1204
01:08:09,831 --> 01:08:12,330
let's do the night shot cameras. Cause
that's going to look scary. Yeah.

1205
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,440
Holds finding big foot.
Not, we're looking,

1206
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,830
we're looking for,
you don't even find shit every episode.

1207
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:20,240
It's like what was that?
And they cut to commercial.

1208
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:23,090
Well they know when they're putting
that together that it was nothing.

1209
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:25,270
It's a TV show called the fuckers.
And so I gotta,

1210
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,260
I gotta I with a friend
of mine at the network.

1211
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:30,470
We got a bottle of Scotch on it and I
said if I come back with something that

1212
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:33,650
makes the hair stand up on the back of
your neck, it's a bottle of Scotch to me.

1213
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,520
And if I said, if I come back with
nothing, I'll you about us guys.

1214
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,090
So we got a bet riding
on it and I don't Dunno,

1215
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:42,980
I'm just going to go out there and I'll
be alone. Why isn't there some new stuff?

1216
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:45,480
Brian there some new uh,

1217
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:50,650
biologists have listened to some
big foot sounds and deciphered it.

1218
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:54,390
It was really recent. See if, see if
he could find it because they, like,

1219
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:58,700
they played the sounds that
these hunters made say a cause.

1220
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:01,760
I'm not going to be like confirmation
bigfoot sound. No, they've, they've had,

1221
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,520
that's one of the most
compelling pieces of evidence.

1222
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:09,170
The only one that really makes any dent
in my imagination is the sounds that

1223
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:11,570
they've recorded. They had,
of course scary. I'll tell ya,

1224
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:13,490
the hair went up on the
back of my neck that day.

1225
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,370
I heard a great ape is what I heard. I
heard the sound of an ape, you know. Ooh,

1226
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,200
I mean, and I'm alone in the middle of
the Alaskan Alaska home of the apes.

1227
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,500
Well, uh, for,

1228
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,590
for people who have never flown over
the Pacific northwest or Alaska or in,

1229
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:32,420
and then do you think they really get
how crazy it is? People don't know.

1230
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,130
People don't know how vast
it is out there. I mean,

1231
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,460
I'm the first one to kind of come up in
environmentally speak against, you know,

1232
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:41,090
clear cutting and you know, all that
stuff. On the other hand, I've flown,

1233
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,080
I mean four hours and not
seeing anything but trees.

1234
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,560
And so if there was 12
Sasquatch living down there,

1235
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:53,660
and let's say they were intelligent
enough that they buried their dead.

1236
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,360
So that's a question, right? Well,
how come you never find a skeleton?

1237
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,970
I've been in the woods for
many, many, many years.

1238
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:02,270
I've never in my life come across a
black bear skeleton and there's 60,000 of

1239
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:05,730
them in Ontario alone. Never once
seen a black bear skeleton nature.

1240
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,520
So efficient moving.

1241
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,340
I found one moose one time that
fell through the ice in the spring.

1242
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,470
Other than that, or deer,
you know other than that.

1243
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:16,880
So if you've got 12 by pedal apes that
co that live and they bury their dead,

1244
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:20,420
I mean you're not going to
find a skeleton. You're going
to find, what do we find?

1245
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:24,230
We tracks, we hear sound, somebody
gets rocks thrown at them.

1246
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:26,930
Somebody sees something.
So we got, you know,

1247
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:31,610
well how many times someone see a
mountain lion and we know there's so many

1248
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:34,340
mountain lions. Yeah, that's the thing.

1249
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:37,160
There's no like game camera trap photos.

1250
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,670
You would think that someone would have
taken some sort of a game trap photo.

1251
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,500
Well there is some stuff.

1252
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:46,040
I mean if you can Google some of that
when it comes to big foot to photos,

1253
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:50,180
I've never seen a photo. Nothing's
always blurry. And out of focus.

1254
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:53,000
And if they're really smart and they're
good at hiding and they live in the

1255
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:53,430
forest,

1256
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:56,390
it probably would be tough to get a beat
on them that they might even know what

1257
01:10:56,391 --> 01:10:59,180
it is cause it's going to mind even just
recognize the technology and the tree

1258
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:01,250
and say, I don't want to, I'm gonna
stay away from that. Who knows, right.

1259
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,380
To most people like me, it's just
a sexy idea. It's just a very sexy,

1260
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:09,140
I plan on going like Todd standing is a
real, it's a real cool gentleman. He's,

1261
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:14,010
this is his whole life is, is, uh, is
um, researching bigfoot and Sasquatch,

1262
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:18,410
uh, at, for the purpose of
protecting them. And you know,
when I go out, probably go,

1263
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:21,390
you know, with him, the whole point is
we're not going out there to shoot them,

1264
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:26,220
tag them or it was going out there to be,
go on their terms if they exist,

1265
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:28,950
whatever they are and let it happen.

1266
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:33,150
But the only way you can do that is my
way, which is to go out there alone,

1267
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:37,260
spent long time and immersion. And
so, I hate to sound like a marketer,

1268
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:42,090
but who else to do that? But survivors,
you're the fucking guy to you.

1269
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:46,230
It's a very different thing though. The
news to me, I was saying it's sexy to me.

1270
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:47,303
To you,

1271
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:51,870
you had an experience like you've had
two separate experiences and one that was

1272
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:54,540
like,
that sounds fucking terrifying.

1273
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,250
A bear can't make a noise like that.
Nah.

1274
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:02,220
Bear a bearing on the bark sort
of thing, but not, you know,

1275
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,720
hoping, hoping, hoping,
hoping like that. Ooh.

1276
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:08,310
Bears are and five times in
a row the exact same way.

1277
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,490
I mean touch you wish you just got a
flashlight on it just to see what the fuck

1278
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:13,050
was. You know, the thing
was, my camera was,

1279
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:17,280
was 20 feet away and I wanted to
turn it on so bad, but I didn't move.

1280
01:12:17,281 --> 01:12:18,450
I didn't move a muscle the whole time.

1281
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,980
And then when I finally moved is when it
took off and I heard this big crashing

1282
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:26,250
and smashing and going
through the forest and

1283
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,850
then I was gone shit
around right after it. Why?

1284
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,480
When I went down to where it was really,
I went down,

1285
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:37,610
I got to go see this shitting my,
and I was [inaudible],

1286
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:38,660
I got scared

1287
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,980
when we were sleeping, cause a deer came
in at the camp dear, made some noise,

1288
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:46,010
like Holston stomped his feet and
I was like, oh, this is a fucking

1289
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,440
dude asked.

1290
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,140
Here's what if you find out that big foot
is just a bunch of murderers that are

1291
01:12:51,141 --> 01:12:54,470
hiding in woods, you know, like that's
where they live now. They've just,

1292
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:59,120
they live in the middle of woods and
said, just whoop, whoop, whoop sound.

1293
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:02,250
Because that's them trying
to think of the crap on it.

1294
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:05,330
So you'd get the fuck out of that. Could
be something be, and they'd be like,

1295
01:13:05,331 --> 01:13:08,990
those dudes from swamp people, they can
make some noise and they can throw rocks.

1296
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:12,060
They can make some noises to wear a suit.
Yeah.

1297
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,380
Big Foot's a serial murderer and
there's just tons of serial murders.

1298
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,370
Now that's a different theory.
I'm not even going out now.

1299
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:23,270
Straight [inaudible] so you're talking
about serial murderers who live way off

1300
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:26,930
in the middle of nowhere
working at people. Never go.
They can live. You know what,

1301
01:13:26,931 --> 01:13:30,200
being trolled. You know what that
means. No, that's a good idea.

1302
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,093
Just trolling you with,

1303
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,910
if you're a serial murderer that you
don't want to go to print to this

1304
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,620
conversation. Shocked. Cover yourself
with here. He turns his face away.

1305
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:39,503
Like

1306
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,390
if I was a serial murderer and you
looked like a monkey, I get it.

1307
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,290
And then you breed with other
ones and you make female. No,

1308
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,510
you make people get scared of you.

1309
01:13:50,511 --> 01:13:55,511
Like you're some kind of animal or the
core big foot gets all the serial murders

1310
01:13:55,551 --> 01:14:00,060
and makes him his bitch. Ooh, Texas
chainsaw massacre. Where eight foot. Yeah.

1311
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,560
There's a King Pin monkey
go steal me that backpack.

1312
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,850
He just has sex with
all these serial murder.

1313
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,900
There's a guy who's sending a
blimp over the Pacific northwest.

1314
01:14:08,901 --> 01:14:12,100
He's going to try to capture
one, uh, on campus. Saw

1315
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,430
that. Yeah. Yeah. You got to go in.

1316
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,670
I think you got to do a pull the survivor
man and go in and be there for like

1317
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:20,800
two weeks on your own. In the
middle, sitting on a tree.

1318
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:25,080
How long could you go out there for? Like
if you, uh, if you could bring like, oh,

1319
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,520
you wouldn't want to bring an animal
because it would smell, right,

1320
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:31,540
like the carry like alarm or something to
that carrier. You're, you're uh, items,

1321
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:34,960
but like how long could
you live out in one spot?

1322
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,340
Like if you went to the Pacific northwest?
Yeah.

1323
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,660
Wherever you think that there's the
highest incident of bigfoot sightings and

1324
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:41,680
you went wandering through the woods,

1325
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,310
how long could you live out there with
what you could carry, what it could carry?

1326
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:49,870
Well, if you're willing to hunt,
you could go, you know, you could,

1327
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:52,360
you could really go and definitely
if you're willing to hunt.

1328
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:57,430
So as long as you brought it full,
sorry, I don't mean it to be applied,

1329
01:14:57,431 --> 01:14:59,820
but, so I did a book will to live.
And in that book I wrote about it.

1330
01:14:59,821 --> 01:15:02,890
You just plug your book will to
live Harpercollins and I, and I,

1331
01:15:02,891 --> 01:15:04,740
and I did all these
stories of survival and,

1332
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,690
and one of the stories that I dissected
was actually, um, um, Chris mcinnis the,

1333
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:14,380
the into the wild guy that John Sean
Penn movie with Eddie Vedder soundtrack.

1334
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,210
Cool soundtrack. And uh,
you know, he went in,

1335
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,170
he didn't have to die.

1336
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,720
I mean he had a gun and he just
went in with a lack of skill.

1337
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:25,660
But there are men and women,
I mean there who go out there.

1338
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:28,270
And as long as you've got the skill
set and you've got the ammunition,

1339
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:31,040
you forget, you take, like he took down
a moose and then the moose spoiled.

1340
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,670
That was ridiculous. It didn't have to
happen, but he didn't know what to do.

1341
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,810
You take down one moose, you kind of
covered for the year at least six months.

1342
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:42,710
Right. So of eating. So it's indefinitely
if, uh, if you, if I've got, you know,

1343
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,870
a rifle and ammunition,
you know, wow. Otherwise,

1344
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:50,740
if you're talking survival, it's
brutal. You know, if it's survival,

1345
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:52,690
I have no idea it'd be is
you know, you, you can,

1346
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,660
you can perish pretty quickly even
if you are a survivor man. Yeah. His,

1347
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,550
the kid from that movie,

1348
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,300
he went and he was like sleeping in like
a mobile home or something like that.

1349
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:05,830
Right. He found a whole bus,
an old bus, all of us. And
he died there. Unfortunately,

1350
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:08,350
very tragically. He did. I say
tragically because you know,

1351
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:11,500
he was an intelligent man and create a
man. He didn't need to die, you know?

1352
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,250
But it was also, I said in my book and
he was very, very charming. You know,

1353
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:18,570
Alaska doesn't give a crap if you're
charming, you're not, you know?

1354
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:22,990
That's a good point. Yeah. You can
believe in yourself all you want,

1355
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:25,170
but if you're delusional,
if you don't freeze to death,

1356
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:28,360
if you don't know how to cure me like
the most, if you don't know how to hunt,

1357
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:31,600
you're going to freeze to death.
You need to learn those skills.

1358
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:33,580
It's like it's a ridiculous proposition.

1359
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:36,610
It just go out there and try to figure
it out as you go along. Like I said,

1360
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,250
you know, I, I, in the
beginning of the conversation,

1361
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:41,290
I tend to play it down a little
bit and I, you know, I say, look,

1362
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:45,130
anybody could do what I do.
I still stand by that.

1363
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:50,260
But that doesn't mean that it's
not, you know, brutal out there.

1364
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:53,080
It doesn't mean that it's,
uh, that it's easy, you know,

1365
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:54,820
because the worst thing is
three o'clock in the morning,

1366
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:56,920
he tried to sleep through
the nights and three o'clock,

1367
01:16:56,921 --> 01:17:01,720
four o'clock in the morning, you don't,
I mean, when I'm there every time on,

1368
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:04,750
on day three, I want to go home,
right? I'm like, what am I doing here?

1369
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:07,870
This is stupid. Why am I doing this?
You know, I could be my, you know,

1370
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:12,080
my by the crew that brought me in is
out somewhere at a hotel having a beer

1371
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:14,570
right now, you know, and
I'm sleeping on the ground,

1372
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,350
freezing my ass off and shivering
and its socks and I'm tired.

1373
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,600
I'm hungry and I miss my kids and
all that, you know, blah, blah, blah.

1374
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:24,140
All that stuff comes in and there's
nothing, there's nothing. This.

1375
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,000
The thing about when the a
copycat shows all came up,

1376
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,910
there's nothing fun about
survival. It's sucks, you know,

1377
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:33,290
I mean what I do is survivorman is
can be brutal and can be very hard.

1378
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,180
And I sh I do it with,

1379
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,910
with a wink in my eye and with some wit
and I have some witticisms and I've got

1380
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:41,510
skill set and I'm teaching
and I'm filming, but it
still sucks no matter what.

1381
01:17:41,511 --> 01:17:42,680
It's still very,
very hard.

1382
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,290
And when the other shows came along in
the chat and make it look like it's all

1383
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,180
so you know,
this or that are fun,

1384
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,960
it's not be the reason is that they're
not there three in the morning,

1385
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,930
sleeping on the ground. Like
I still am, you know, I still,

1386
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:57,980
I'm still there at 3:00 AM sleeping
on the ground. I'm not often a hotel,

1387
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,160
you know, working over the scripts
for the next day. I'm, and,

1388
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:04,130
and sleeping on the ground
sucks. You, you, you, you don't,

1389
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:07,910
you feel like you get the shivers up
your spine and it feels just like you did

1390
01:18:07,911 --> 01:18:10,310
when you were eight years old and
you had the flu. And you just,

1391
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:13,130
you cry and you want to go home and you
just want your mum to bring you some

1392
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:14,870
toast and peanut butter,
man. That's all you care.

1393
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:17,510
And that's what it's like when you're out
there and you're shivering and Europe,

1394
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:21,920
you know, 45 year old man,
it's still sucks. She's Christ.

1395
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:25,190
That's in survival.
Wilderness travel is different.

1396
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,020
Cause I can go out there
with food and a 10,

1397
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:29,210
I ain't be out there forever as beautiful,
you know,

1398
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,100
then you're connecting with the earth.
But surviving

1399
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,443
is different.

1400
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:37,160
So if you had like a campsite
in a tent and you know, uh,

1401
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:41,390
various, uh, necessities,
fishing rod rifle,

1402
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,390
you can just be out there near
a river where there's water.

1403
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,530
You'd be out there forever.

1404
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,720
Yeah, I've had a woman.
Yeah. Would you use,

1405
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:51,110
would you enjoy that without a woman?

1406
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,420
No. I mean, even with them,

1407
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:56,880
with a woman, the first year
of a marriage, my second wife,

1408
01:18:56,881 --> 01:18:57,900
that's exactly what we did.

1409
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,540
We spent a year living in the bush
a full year and you know what?

1410
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,140
It was fantastic. I got to say,
wow, that was incredibly great.

1411
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,060
Now did you forage for your own food?
We did the whole league. Really? Forest.

1412
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:11,190
She didn't grow up there.
Now would I do it now?

1413
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,100
I go out now and I did enjoy times
now, but you know, also love, you know,

1414
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:22,020
Sushi in Vegas too, so. So I mean I
like, I like both worlds. You know,

1415
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:24,360
I like jumping back and forth.
I love my music and rock and roll,

1416
01:19:24,361 --> 01:19:25,560
but I love hopping in a canoe.

1417
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:30,710
So I'm always equally at home as I am
in a dugout canoe as I am going to New

1418
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,733
York and watching a show.

1419
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:35,870
Yeah. It seems like you,
uh, you found this, uh, uh,

1420
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,710
that's a crazy balance.

1421
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:41,040
It is crazy balance. Yeah. I like,
you know, when I was really young,

1422
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:44,550
I watched a Tarzan movie one time and it
wasn't Weissmuller was Steve Reeves or

1423
01:19:44,551 --> 01:19:46,860
somebody like that.
And in it,

1424
01:19:46,861 --> 01:19:49,890
the beginning of the movie happens and
he'd guys in a suit and he's like New

1425
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,570
York, he's like this high
end lawyer or something.

1426
01:19:51,571 --> 01:19:54,600
And he's got babe on his arm
and he's in a call, comes in,

1427
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:59,760
it was trouble in the jungle and he and
he grabs the stuff and this woman goes,

1428
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:00,930
aren't you going to need to pack?

1429
01:20:00,931 --> 01:20:04,710
And he picks up a Bowie knife in a loin
cloth and he goes, this is all all need.

1430
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,430
And it was Tarzan and off he
goes off into the jungle. This.

1431
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:10,150
And I thought that's the coolest
thing I ever saw in my life. Man.

1432
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,790
This guy likes to drive an Aston Martin
and swing from a tree as like so cool.

1433
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:19,020
And here I am now doing playing
survivor man and you know,

1434
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:21,840
and rock and roll and I love jumping
between both worlds. It's cool.

1435
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:27,230
I uh, there was a Charles Carroll whack
cause that what the guy's name was Jack

1436
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:31,070
Heroin? No, no, no. Charles Kuralt.
Charles Corolla used to do those. Um,

1437
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:35,540
I think it was a, for 60
minutes. It was. Anyway,

1438
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:40,541
he was interviewing this guy who was a
trapper who lived alone in Alaska and he

1439
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:45,760
lived there for like six months out of
the year and then it would come back down.

1440
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:46,594
He would,
you know,

1441
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:50,720
but he would stay up there for huge
periods of time with no contact with the

1442
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,510
outside world. And he said that
once he started to do that,

1443
01:20:53,511 --> 01:20:55,190
he could read animals minds.

1444
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,980
You do get a little loopy when you're
out there for awhile. You know,

1445
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:04,840
a lot of times I'm the compare me to
Dick Prone Akia wilderness man in the

1446
01:21:04,841 --> 01:21:08,020
wilderness or something. And you know,
I think what Dick did was fantastic.

1447
01:21:08,021 --> 01:21:11,650
He was obviously an engineer mind and he
built this great place and he's out in

1448
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:16,150
the wilderness like 30 35 years, 25 years,
something like that. But in my mind,

1449
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,531
you know,

1450
01:21:17,531 --> 01:21:21,100
if you're leaving society behind for 25
years has got to be a little something.

1451
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,310
You got to be missing something. I,
I, I think, and I've known trappers,

1452
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:28,360
a lot of friends, trappers and
I, you know, I trapped. Um,

1453
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:33,100
but you can get pretty loopy out there.
If he even in Survivorman for seven days,

1454
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:36,220
my one of my guys I work with you say,
yeah, I always knew when you lost it.

1455
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:39,100
Or a day on day five is like, oh,
this is the day less loses it.

1456
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:42,940
Let's look at his eyes, you know,
and that's only five days, you know.

1457
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:47,500
So you're out there for a few months or
few weeks. Um, do you get a little loopy?

1458
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:51,520
If you're alone, you're not alone.
It all changes. But if you're alone,

1459
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,370
I think you can. You can. Kettle little.

1460
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:58,640
I liked that. Show me cabin fever mountain
men. Have you ever seen it? I heard it.

1461
01:21:58,641 --> 01:22:01,850
Saw the promo, but it would
be interesting. I don't
know how much of it is bs.

1462
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:04,310
It seems legit. But uh, the one guy,

1463
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:09,110
one guy lives in Alaska and he's a trapper
and all this guy does is just run his

1464
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:12,710
trap lines all day with a snowmobile and
he's up there for months and months at

1465
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:15,500
a time. It's fucking crazy.
Like you're watching it,

1466
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:18,710
thinking about what the hell that's
like this guy's flying in a plane.

1467
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:23,920
He flies for hours over this vast
wilderness for lands in the spot that he's

1468
01:22:24,261 --> 01:22:26,030
been walking around for years.

1469
01:22:26,031 --> 01:22:29,120
He goes to the same spot and he
has these different cabins set up,

1470
01:22:29,121 --> 01:22:32,960
these built log cabins and
he's constructed at these
various places and they're

1471
01:22:32,961 --> 01:22:36,890
just barely big enough to store like
hides and a bed and he has like a little

1472
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,970
stove in them.
It's fucking cool.

1473
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:42,190
It's escaping society, right?
It's just shunning society.

1474
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,700
And the fascinating part about what he's
doing is you think about it that while

1475
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:48,640
he's out there, he doesn't know
what's happening in the world. Yeah.

1476
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:52,330
It comes out in the world changed, comes
out and you know, nine 11 happened,

1477
01:22:52,331 --> 01:22:56,350
comes out and something else happened.
Comes at a war, whatever he though,

1478
01:22:56,351 --> 01:23:00,640
so those guys don't know. They literally
don't know anything has gone on.

1479
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,840
They might come out and,

1480
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,140
and all sorts of stuff has happened
and then the dust has settled.

1481
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,380
Not even ever hear of what happened
while they were gone because it maybe it

1482
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:11,970
doesn't matter anymore by the time
they get out. That's wild though.

1483
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,480
Have you ever seen then a vice piece
on that guy that lives in the Arctic?

1484
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:21,170
Hi Mo or high mo. His name is a
thing. It's called high. Yeah.

1485
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:25,930
Heimos Arctic refuge.
And it's about a guy who lives way,

1486
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,550
I think it's northeast Alaska
and he has a this cabin.

1487
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,890
It's like one of the last
ones that you'll ago.

1488
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:36,050
One of the last people that is allowed to
live out their homesteading loss. Yeah.

1489
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,150
And he's uh,

1490
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:41,350
he's out there eating Caribou
and fishing and he gets,

1491
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:45,520
he gets tr traps and he gets money
for the skins and that pays for like

1492
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,840
vegetables or whatever the hell he
needs that he gets his vitamins from and

1493
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:51,190
different supplies and
guns and stuff like that.

1494
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:53,020
And he's just out there
with him and his wife.

1495
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,860
A lot of these guys, they, they really,

1496
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,670
if you taught when she
interviewed them and talking them,

1497
01:23:57,671 --> 01:24:01,410
they don't want much a society that's
not for me. Let's see that, you know,

1498
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:06,000
that's not for me. And that's where
they end up is Alaska. Well he was tall.

1499
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:10,500
Came about like this great satisfaction
that he gets from hunting and fishing

1500
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:15,390
and, and being like a hunter
gatherer. He was like, this is like,

1501
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,090
this is what peeps Manhattan.

1502
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:20,430
It's the core of us. I mean, why does,
why did so many people like survivor? Man,

1503
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,000
I think a lot of times it's because
it touched on the core of who we are.

1504
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:27,750
We can have all this other stuff like
you got in here in this studio right now,

1505
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,470
but if you're left alone, what
matters? Food, water, shelter,

1506
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,680
done those three things. Food,
water, shelter over and over again.

1507
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,740
And when I do what I do are these
guys go off and live like that.

1508
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:39,570
You're bringing it down to that,
you know,

1509
01:24:39,571 --> 01:24:42,390
you're bringing it down to the
brass tacks, you sand, this is it.

1510
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,390
There's nothing else that matters.
And so people watch it and go, yeah,

1511
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,280
if I lost it all,

1512
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:51,510
it would be like what Stroud's doing
and I'm going to Wa because that's like

1513
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:52,351
losing it all man.

1514
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:56,730
All you have to do is get warm
and get some water and some food.

1515
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,210
Like that's pretty it.
And in many ways that's very freeing.

1516
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,350
If you think about it, you don't worry
about rent payments or anything else,

1517
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:07,990
you're just going to drink.
Yeah. But then you ought to know,

1518
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:10,020
like every day is a search for food.

1519
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,360
I think you'd get tired
of that shit real quick.

1520
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:16,620
Do get it gets it gets old real fast.
Yeah. That's what I mean. You know,

1521
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:19,380
if you're good and you catch a moose,
you know, that's it. That's a big,

1522
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:23,430
that's of that spiritual moment when
something like that happens. But you know,

1523
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:27,360
when, if you have me go in with stuff like
we were talking about, I'm a happy man,

1524
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:30,870
you know, cause now I'm not worried about
trying to get the next meal. Do you,

1525
01:25:30,871 --> 01:25:33,600
where do you live now? He, without
giving out your home address,

1526
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:39,260
basically live in a cottage country in
Ontario for people of Toronto other than

1527
01:25:39,261 --> 01:25:44,130
Muskokas. Um, and uh, I've got my
off the grid place as well. Um,

1528
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:48,180
but I, you know, I wasn't raised by wolves
and I don't, you know, I don't live, I,

1529
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:50,330
we did an MTV cribs came up and we did,
did,

1530
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:53,730
did my place and so I did a sort of a
tongue and cheek show of my bedroom and it

1531
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,580
was basically shelter and
the Bush, um, you know,

1532
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,750
with a little fire going inside
some the master suite. Um,

1533
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,440
but I asked live normal,
you know,

1534
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,040
I live up there normal and
then you an off the grid place

1535
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,600
too. Do, yeah, that's pretty
cool. Actually. Solar panels
and wind generator and,

1536
01:26:07,601 --> 01:26:12,590
and um, where's that 170 acres in
northern Ontario as well. You just, uh,

1537
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:16,490
you built like, just a sustainable
home up there. Did you, I mean,

1538
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:17,510
I'm not gonna say I built,

1539
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,650
I had someone else you don't want me
building and give me an ax and a tree.

1540
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:24,590
I will make you shelter. You throw in
an angle or a moving part. I'm screwed.

1541
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,780
Not into precision. Not in a preseason.
No, absolutely not. Um, so yeah,

1542
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:32,660
I did it for, I did it for a film called
off the grid. Okay. With Les Stroud.

1543
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:37,040
I've seen clips of that online. I've
never seen the actual movie though. Yup.

1544
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:41,360
You should watch it.
I will promise you when you set this up,

1545
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:45,050
do you like go to visit it every now and
then and stay there all the time? Yeah.

1546
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:47,570
Yeah. What do you do when you go
up there and just play guitar?

1547
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,200
Live Lower Caveman and play guitar.
Play Guitar, get out in the ATV,

1548
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,250
go jogging down the road. Um,
have people over sit by the fire.

1549
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,650
Do you bring food with you or do you
hunt and fish where you're out there?

1550
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:01,880
I actually, you know, I really, it now
I really only hunt for survivor man.

1551
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:05,360
When I'm doing survivor man, I hunt.
Um, but I haven't had time to go out.

1552
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,620
I actually,
my buddy,

1553
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:09,080
one of my best friends hunts all the
time and I'll text him while he's in his

1554
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:12,350
tree stand and he'll always say,
stop texting me and then I'll phone them,

1555
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:16,260
stop phoning me any
deer coming. Uh, but I,

1556
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:18,330
I don't have much time to
get out there anymore and,

1557
01:27:18,331 --> 01:27:22,330
and do much hunting or anything like
that. So Ted Nugent isn't, you know,

1558
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:27,110
inviting me lay out when he does.
Have you ever done it with Ted Nugent?

1559
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:31,130
No. No, not at all. To Nugeo
lives a crazy life. He uh,

1560
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,320
he has like two places,

1561
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:37,310
one in Michigan and one in Texas and the,
they're those uh,

1562
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,870
like a high fence operation.

1563
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,840
So he's got all these trees and
shit and he hangs out and I'm,

1564
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:44,930
and the animals just run around and
he's like got his own like personal

1565
01:27:44,931 --> 01:27:47,350
playground to like shoot
deer. Yeah. He freak.

1566
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,760
He comes up to Ontario every
year to, to uh, to hunt bear.

1567
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:53,710
And he freaked out on Ontario because
they stopped the spring bear hunt and he

1568
01:27:53,711 --> 01:27:56,660
would, he'd went on a rampage and
said nobody go to Ontario anymore.

1569
01:27:56,661 --> 01:27:59,670
Which was like, people are getting really
ticked off about why did he say that?

1570
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,820
Because we stopped there,
bring the spring bear hunt.

1571
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,100
Now it's only a false all fall bear hunt.

1572
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:05,540
But he still comes up I
think for the fall bear hug.

1573
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:08,780
Well they do that though because
they count numbers. I mean, yes,

1574
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:12,020
it's important to like, well there was a
lot of orphanages happening too. Right?

1575
01:28:12,021 --> 01:28:12,980
Cause you shooting the,
the,

1576
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:16,520
the mother bear in the sprit with a new
spring Cobb who hasn't had a chance to

1577
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:19,070
really get on its feet, you know, at least
in the fall that's had the summer to,

1578
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,130
to Wean itself and to, you
know, do what it's got to do.

1579
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:24,810
So I've been a lot of it was that
as well as numbers. Who knows?

1580
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:28,130
There's science behind it somewhere.
Right. Most of the time. Right.

1581
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,040
So why is he getting upset about that?
I thought that that would,

1582
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:33,680
that was his whole thing is being a
conservationist. I Dunno. I Dunno.

1583
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:36,020
Eyes cause he likes hunting
and black bear in Ontario.

1584
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:38,840
He loves hunting period show.
It's fascinating to me.

1585
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:42,500
He's always like thanking God and the
government and fucking thinking all the

1586
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,120
army and the marines and Shit.

1587
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:49,190
Shooting deer with arrows all day.
He's having a good time though.

1588
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:52,910
I gotta tell you guys, Ted Nugent,
he's in his sixties he looks at me.

1589
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:55,850
But besides all the right wing rhetoric,
it gets a little crazy.

1590
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:59,600
Like Obama's purposely trying to ruin
this con. He gets a little muddy, but,

1591
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:04,500
but the whole shooting deer with arrows
delex fun as fuck he's doing is doing,

1592
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:08,580
you know Bruce the Bruce Lee thing. He's
expressing himself honestly, right? Yeah.

1593
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:13,470
Yeah. Just, um, the, um, the deer hunting
aspect of it is kind of fascinating.

1594
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:17,320
I mean, he, he really has like great joy.
Does he have his own show? Oh yeah. Yeah.

1595
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:19,050
I haven't seen it yet.
Spirit of the wild.

1596
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,170
I don't know if we get a
new jeep Canada on chip.

1597
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:24,180
If you're into watching dudes
fuck up beers with arrows.

1598
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:28,610
He's bad ass. He's a, I mean he's, he,

1599
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:31,980
I don't know like what the limits are for
how many deer you're supposed to kill,

1600
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:35,820
but he gets them all
he does.

1601
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:38,880
He feels the quoting hills is
fucking tags. I'll tell you that,

1602
01:29:38,881 --> 01:29:40,980
that Ted Nugent knows how
to shoot some fucking deer.

1603
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:44,340
Like there's a lot of like hunting
shows and like you'd say, well,

1604
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:45,540
if Ted Nugent as a hunting show,

1605
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:48,630
it's probably not as good as
like the real hunters we'd done.

1606
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,850
And he's a real fucking hunter.
Like Alice Cooper's a real golfer.

1607
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,380
Know what I mean? He's a
kickass Golfer. You know,

1608
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,410
there's different guys like that. I mean,
that's the thing about being an artist,

1609
01:29:58,411 --> 01:30:00,720
being a performer. I
think you, you, you know,

1610
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:04,560
you'd go at things with pretty much
full Gusto, you know, and your hobbies,

1611
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:08,790
you know, uh, look at Ron Woods paintings,
you know, I mean things like that.

1612
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:13,320
It's like we always ask surprise like,
well Ron would can paint too. Well, yeah.

1613
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,480
You know, and it's like,
okay, perfect segue.

1614
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:19,920
So me as survivor man and the whole
thing of me playing my music, it's like,

1615
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:23,370
that's why blue harmonica on all those
shows is to say to people at a little

1616
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:25,740
wake of my, yeah, I'm not
a one trick pony here, man.

1617
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:29,280
I don't just do fire beaus that's why
you didn't know harmonica. That's cool.

1618
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:34,310
Fucking dragged an amp out there with
a life raft. Do you pull a little

1619
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:39,480
bomp bomp bomp you to like an hours
where the battery and he chose to play

1620
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:43,890
Voodoo child on the beach just yet.
That would send a message,

1621
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:46,860
wait for my traps.
And so confident I am in surviving.

1622
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,520
I'm going to blow some blue and my ass
skills. Segue. Why don't we do it? Yes,

1623
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:54,600
please. Um, what's the name of the
song you're going to do? Uh, let's see.

1624
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:58,320
What am I going? Oh yeah,
we're going to do a, yeah, you
ready Daddy? You can set up.

1625
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,610
Okay. So he's a showbiz man.
That's an awesome segue.

1626
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:07,440
Danny Weiss is a, we say that's
how new of a friend Danny is.

1627
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:11,010
Danny waste is a brand new friend of mine.

iron butterfly, Alice Cooper name.

1630

And then he hit Bett Midler. Lou
Reed. Okay. Larry through it.

1639
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,280
pop renaissance man.
A man of many skills

1640
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,250

himself and knows how to jam folks.

1646
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:44,350
Lodo woman with a Nice Tattoo.
It could be

1647
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,160
right across the chest.

1648
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,810
She could have one on a lay

1649
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:58,080
slip. Aware and a wet. Yeah.

1650

Don't go up that
long.

1652
01:33:07,311 --> 01:33:10,340
Is he into Wallman with a nice time?

1653
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:17,303
Wow.

1654
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,680
No, no. Give me my field.

1655
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:38,660
Nice.
It could be

1656
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,250
on the oh,
across crossfit shoes.

1657
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:48,150
She could have one on her legs.

1658
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,370
So step away.

1659
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,720
Don't go up that girl.

1660
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,833
Oh.

1661
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:57,240
Oh,

It's a mama with a nice,

1664
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:14,510
it could be on the
chips.

1665
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,190
You have one auto

1666
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,200
slip away wet.

1667
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,800
Don't care what that

1668
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,960
is tied to last time.

1669
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:03,270
Yeah. There we go, man. That's cool.

1670
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:08,780
Thanks Danny. You're welcome. That
was awesome. That was fun too.

1671
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:11,440
If I was a Checker,
I'll let you, fuck man.

1672
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:16,320
If I was at a bar and you're playing
there like, oh let's go, fuck man, I

1673
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:22,030
want to go hunting, man. I would do
things to is man. Yeah, because they say,

1674
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:23,820
you know like those kinds of songs,

1675
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:28,880
like they'll like putting ideas in the
girl's head and then you get off the

1676
01:36:29,681 --> 01:36:34,630
stage and she's like, I can't believe
how good your music sounds, Les Stroud

1677
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:41,290
survivor man. Cause I don't want to
rock and roll is all about, isn't it?

1678
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:44,050
It must be. It's a, it's a
very compelling, you know,

1679
01:36:44,051 --> 01:36:46,630
someone who could make awesome sounds.
It's a,

1680
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,540
it's a incredibly compelling to people.

1681
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,190
You, no, that was a, I told
you earlier that I was,

1682
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:52,770
did I read the Greg Almond autobiography
and he was talking about, he said,

1683
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:55,260
he said he had no luck
with women whatsoever.

1684
01:36:55,261 --> 01:36:58,500
And then he started to sing
the second he sung on stage.

1685
01:36:58,501 --> 01:37:01,110
You've got this cute little long blonde
hair dude. And he starts singing,

1686
01:37:01,111 --> 01:37:05,190
you know, stormy Monday, you know, and
all that. You know, and yeah, that was it.

1687
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:10,040
Yeah. That's a great fucking
songs. Oops. Even so,

1688
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:14,210
the later stuff, like I'm no angel. That's
a great fucking song, man. That's stuck.

1689
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:17,240
I had some real soul to his voice.
Absolutely.

1690
01:37:17,241 --> 01:37:21,710
That was a voice of a man who's had
real life experiences. Real regrets.

1691
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:22,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

1692
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:26,220
Did. And the book hope
pulls no punches. You know,

1693
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:31,250
it's a life of drugs and alcohol and
redemption and women and man has a lot

1694
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:32,554
going on and yeah.

1695
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:39,140
Mapi oh man, I don't know so
much good fucking music man.

1696
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,640
The almonds.

1697
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,120
Well, you know, that's one of the new
things to musically is coming out. I,

1698
01:37:43,121 --> 01:37:44,940
I didn't, you know, I
started listening to a,

1699
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:50,100
uh, what's that? The, the
Sirius satellite thing.

1700
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,410
Jam Jam,
something.

1701
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,190
I can't remember the name
of the station gem on and

1702
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,170
uh, uh, the plan, you know,

1703
01:37:58,171 --> 01:38:02,960
widespread panic and government mule and
a almond brothers with Derek trucks and,

1704
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:07,890
and it plan all this stuff. And so
that's new stuff. And, and fish and,

1705
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:09,510
and it's, it's great. These guys,

1706
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:12,840
these guys went from hack noodlers
to pro top players now, you know,

1707
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:15,180
they were hacked noodlers back in
the day when they were starting.

1708
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:17,190
Now they're great,
you know,

1709
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:20,340
and they're playing really super well in
the Warren hands and all these guys is

1710
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:22,170
great stuff, you know, and I'm,
and I missed that, you know,

1711
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:26,460
just some letting somebody go. I'm sure
Danny has had his share of just, you know,

1712
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,010
shredding and cutting loose
and going and you know,

1713
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:32,660
I do this thing when I play with my
band and my guitar player, you know Oj,

1714
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,710
God bless him, he's a great
player, is really creative.

1715
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,520
But he'll do the solo and I know
he'll do a solo based on, okay,

1716
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:39,810
it's time to end the solo.

1717
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,670
And if I'm having a great night and
I think he's got it, I'll go, no,

1718
01:38:43,671 --> 01:38:45,830
you're not done. And I'll turn my
back to him one on stage and going,

1719
01:38:45,831 --> 01:38:50,320
oh sorry man, you're not done. Keep
fucking playing man. Keep playing. And I,

1720
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,930
and I just go, you got it. You went
to the top. Now go past it, you know?

1721
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:59,200
Yeah. When you go off. We had a
Stevie Ray Vaughan, Andrew dice clay.

1722
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:04,270
Believe it or not, his son Max is
a, an incredible drummer. And uh,

1723
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:04,961
we,
uh,

1724
01:39:04,961 --> 01:39:09,961
we played a video of him at the Improv
and Hollywood and it's ridiculous how

1725
01:39:10,091 --> 01:39:11,890
good he is. I mean, what, what is he 21

1726
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:15,040
yeah, he's very young, but he's been
playing drums his whole life, so I mean,

1727
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:18,510
he's fucking incredible. He's like, like
a professional. I mean it's like, well,

1728
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:23,070
kids, same kids these days, right? I mean,
man, they're starting young re quickly.

1729
01:39:23,071 --> 01:39:25,280
You've got 12 year old shredders.
Yeah.

1730
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:29,720
You didn't have 12 year old kids shredding
in the 70s yeah. Way More listened to.

1731
01:39:29,721 --> 01:39:32,200
And due to Internet you
can learn how to do it.

1732
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:35,190
Now when I want to learn new
track, I just go, okay, let's see.

1733
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,210
How do I play that song?

1734
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:38,550
I just youtube it and there's
some guy sitting there going,

1735
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:41,700
and then you go to this chord and what
you don't know is he detuned it and put a

1736
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:46,380
cape on and you're going, oh,
that's how he does that. It's crazy.

1737
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,360
We live free for free. Yeah.
Yeah, we live in strange times.

1738
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:54,510
It is strange. But again, Joe, I keep
coming back to the same thing. I mean,

1739
01:39:54,511 --> 01:39:57,510
you know, I obviously you and I both
like fights. The UFC were like, like,

1740
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,740
like the martial arts, mixed martial arts,
all that stuff. Love it. That is a stage.

1741
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:06,750
It's real and it's right then and
there and rock and roll or good music.

1742
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,540
If not rocking, we'll just
good music, right? The country,

1743
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:13,530
I don't care what you got pop right then
and there is when it's all, you know,

1744
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:16,080
it comes down, he's got deck, this
drama guy you're talking about, man,

1745
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:18,600
if they can do it right then and there,
it's an awesome thing.

1746
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:19,434
It's nothing like it.

1747
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:23,220
And that's why I love performing so
much because with survivorman and beyond

1748
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:27,960
survival and shark week and all the film
stuff, I don't know for months and and,

1749
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,870
and while though now it is a little
quicker with the websites and stuff,

1750
01:40:30,871 --> 01:40:34,740
it's like oh we loved your episode last
night but when you've got people in a

1751
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:40,350
crowd and there's 8,000 people and
you've got 90 minutes with 8,000 people,

1752
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,350
so a lot of energy and it,
it lives or dies right there,

1753
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:44,400
you know that very second.

1754
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:47,550
You know how to win them back and pull
them back if you thought you lost them

1755
01:40:47,551 --> 01:40:51,450
for a second. And that's intense. You
know, I love that stuff. I love the stage.

1756
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,860
Yeah, well it certainly, what,

1757
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,840
what people don't understand
about mixed martial arts,

1758
01:40:55,841 --> 01:41:00,400
a lot of people think it's
brutish behavior or they
think that it's a thugs or

1759
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:02,470
you know,
violent assholes.

1760
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:08,050
It's hard for them to wrap their heads
around it, but they really are artists.

1761
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,333
It's,

1762
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:13,690
you're expressing yourself
and you're expressing your,

1763
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:18,040
when you watch someone execute
beautifully inside the octagon.

1764
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,700
To me when I say beautiful, I'm not saying
cause I'm running out of adjectives.

1765
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:24,370
I'm saying cause it is beautiful to me.
To me,

1766
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:27,550
when I watched like a great
performance inside the octagon,

1767
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:32,551
it's like a work of art and it's
dedication and focus over a years and

1768
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:37,290
intelligence and learning and adapting
and changing and modifying and,

1769
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:42,010
and constantly assessing until you build
your skills up to the point where you

1770
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:44,550
have extreme competency.
You know,

1771
01:41:44,551 --> 01:41:47,950
like when I see a guy like Anderson
Silva inside the octagon, I seen him.

1772
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:53,020
He is putting on a fucking show.
No, no, no one more clear than any.

1773
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:57,250
Then the Anderson, there's never been a
more clear example. And his last fight,

1774
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,890
he called the guy who's fighting,

1775
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:04,210
Stephan Bonner called him to come to me
and he put his back against the cage,

1776
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,053
like, come on, hit me.

1777
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:08,240
And he just stood in front of them and
let's stop Steph and bought a throw

1778
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:12,820
punches from inches away and just slipped
them and crack them and throw them in

1779
01:42:12,821 --> 01:42:17,350
the ground and need them. And then just,
it was a masterful ballet of violence.

1780
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:20,140
It was a, uh, a beautiful performance,

1781
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:24,280
an artistic expression of
who Anderson Silva is. Yeah,

1782
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:27,280
he's a fucking artist when that guy does,

1783
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:31,150
but people have a hard time accepting
the concept of an artist's attached to

1784
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:33,970
something as violent,
as damaging a person.

1785
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:38,410
But it's just because they're looking at
it wrong that it's not a violent act in

1786
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:42,850
the sense of normal violent acts where
somebody find someone that picks on them

1787
01:42:42,851 --> 01:42:44,410
or starts a fight with him for no reason.

1788
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:49,000
It's a contest of great
significance and repercussion.

1789
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:52,450
That's what it is.
You looking at it as violence because it,

1790
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:56,380
those techniques can be used in a violent
act and even though it's violent and

1791
01:42:56,381 --> 01:42:57,220
it's description,

1792
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:01,900
it's not an act of violence and it's an
act of competition and the expression of

1793
01:43:01,901 --> 01:43:05,590
character.
That's why the best fights move.

1794
01:43:05,591 --> 01:43:10,120
Souls changed lives. Dude,
start jogging. I mean, it just,

1795
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:15,121
you see that expression of character
when somebody really puts a training camp

1796
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:19,030
together and really develops their skills
to the point where they're at a Manny

1797
01:43:19,031 --> 01:43:20,610
Pacquiao level or you know,

1798
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,530
some someone that like sugar
ray Leonard was that chick.

1799
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:25,870
That's that kind of shit.
That's art. That's art.

1800
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,610
I agree with you.
I think it is or I think,

1801
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,800
and I think seeing that kind
of passion in people in,

1802
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:33,730
no matter what genre they're in,
you know, we could, you know, is,

1803
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:38,140
is hugely motivating.
Hugely inspirational. You
know, every single day, ah,

1804
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:42,430
sorry this, this circling it back. But
every single day alone in the wilderness,

1805
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:47,200
I would sit on the edge of a lake about
just film day three of survivor man or

1806
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:48,670
whatever.
And I would say to myself,

1807
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:53,671
whatever it is I do let result in being
inspirational to somebody's life and,

1808
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:56,030
and affect them in a positive way.

1809
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,330
And then I would stop that and I would
think of, don't be an idiot last you just,

1810
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:01,790
you make in a shelter who it's
what's inspirational about that.

1811
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:04,670
And then I started getting
these emails from people.

1812
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:08,540
You got me through eight months on my back
in a hospital bed watching your shows.

1813
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:10,910
My son and I were a strange,
but because of your shows,

1814
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:14,270
we got back together again. I left an
abusive relationship because he shows,

1815
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,190
because of my shows. All I'm doing
is building a freaking shelter.

1816
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:19,730
And so when you connect to it, I don't
just go, when you go like with the,

1817
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:20,720
with the fights as well,

1818
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:24,410
it's the same when you see people in
embroiled passionately in what they

1819
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:29,570
passionately in what they do.
Like Silva, like so many others,

1820
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:33,710
you can't help but be inspired by it.
I think an effected by it.

1821
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:35,840
That's a fascinating,

1822
01:44:35,841 --> 01:44:38,150
I think those people that are saying
that you're changing their life,

1823
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:41,430
it's probably the government trying to
get close to you and then just true.

1824
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:45,320
That's normal now I'm, I'm, I'm
a Canadian. They don't care.

1825
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:47,630
But I think they will try
to get closest in Canada.

1826
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:51,540
You most certainly changed
people's idea of, of uh,

1827
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:56,610
how thin like are a attachment
to surviving really is
like how little we really

1828
01:44:57,521 --> 01:45:02,050
know and how much we're dependent on
this whole system that we have set up the

1829
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:03,970
cities and delivering food.

1830
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:08,320
I used, I did a show once a, um, I'm
sorry, discovery channel. I love you,

1831
01:45:08,321 --> 01:45:09,970
but I'm so embarrassed by the show he did,

1832
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:13,720
which was surviving urban disasters and
primarily because I didn't produce the

1833
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:17,050
show. I, I, and, and I, and
I regret it to this day. Um,

1834
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,980
and it was all about how to survive
an urban disaster, right? You know,

1835
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:23,800
fill like a bathtub with water,
that sort of stuff. Um, you know,

1836
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,500
just all sorts of little tricks and tips.

1837
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,730
And now nowadays you can bet every time
there's a hurricane sandy or anything

1838
01:45:30,731 --> 01:45:31,420
like that,

1839
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:34,090
I get phone calls from the new centers
if I'll go on and do an interview about,

1840
01:45:34,091 --> 01:45:37,080
we know what people need to know about
surviving to the stuff, you know,

1841
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:39,070
and it still amazes me to this day though,

1842
01:45:39,071 --> 01:45:43,300
just how lacking in common sense I think
most people are, you know, it's like,

1843
01:45:43,301 --> 01:45:47,080
well, you know, it's hurricane
coming. Like, think of it,
think about the same thing.

1844
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:50,780
Survivorman oh, is as shelter,
food and water. What else?

1845
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:52,120
You got to think about whether
or not you're gonna be able to,

1846
01:45:52,121 --> 01:45:55,300
they call of duty that night, you
know, shelter, food and water, man.

1847
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:59,330
Uh, you, unfortunately for a lot of
people that seems like an abstract idea.

1848
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:01,670
It doesn't seem to be really
registering in their head.

1849
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:05,540
The idea that you could have no food
and no water like their whole life.

1850
01:46:05,541 --> 01:46:09,140
It's true in supermarkets,
go to the store, get your
food, go to the restaurant,

1851
01:46:09,141 --> 01:46:11,420
get your food.
The idea of it is abstract.

1852
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:13,680
Hey, I take every once in
a while I'll do, you know,

1853
01:46:13,681 --> 01:46:17,340
one of those corporate things and I'll
take some people up. They got one night,

1854
01:46:17,341 --> 01:46:20,520
one night overnight and if
freaking, you know, I mean,

1855
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:24,330
people go four hours without food. I
mean my son will say, oh, I'm starving.

1856
01:46:24,331 --> 01:46:25,710
And I was like, dude, seriously,

1857
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:27,560
you got to Ron's father to
say I'm starving to attack.

1858
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:32,880
It gives you been four hours without a
hot dog. Like relaxing, you know? Yeah,

1859
01:46:32,881 --> 01:46:37,580
no shit. What's the longest you've
gone without eating? Uh, probably, um,

1860
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:42,780
10 days I guess. Whoa. Few pine
nuts and things thrown in there.

1861
01:46:42,781 --> 01:46:45,860
Maybe a frog or two. So, I
don't know if that's, that was
one of the, one of the, no,

1862
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:50,010
that was actually before survivorman
really now with the new, well

1863
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,110
I guess with the new shows,
yeah,

1864
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:56,310
I guess in Mexico I got a squid I found
and some clams and some stuff like that.

1865
01:46:56,311 --> 01:46:59,460
And then Norway, I get the deer
carcass. So there's a few things,

1866
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:02,370
but founded deer carcass. Yeah. Well it
was one of those things where, I mean,

1867
01:47:02,371 --> 01:47:04,430
I knew there was hunters up
there. I mean, I knew them.

1868
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:05,940
I knew there'd be hunting
going on up there.

1869
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:07,980
I knew they would probably
be carcasses left around,

1870
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:11,370
up in that area where I was going to
be. So, so I did, I wasn't set up,

1871
01:47:11,371 --> 01:47:15,850
but I knew that, that that potential
was there. Um, and sure enough, I, I,

1872
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:20,030
I traveled around and found a hunter's
cabin, which was part of surviving, right.

1873
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,730
D and e is doing a good be any as
part of survival sometimes. Right.

1874
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:27,380
And it'd be stupid if you stayed outside.
So I know I,

1875
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:31,260
it's ethically wrong to go through that
window. I will just freeze out here. Um,

1876
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,280
and there was a deer carcass there. Oh,
someone had shot it and left it there.

1877
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,990
Left the, the guys take some of it out.
So it was all, all the meat was gone.

1878
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:42,120
It was just the cup,
the guts and stuff.

1879
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:45,030
But there's a lot of food when you've
got it. I'm going to the liver.

1880
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:48,780
You left the liver. It's like that
big Norwegian dear liver. Oh Wow.

1881
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,820
Do your livers. Delicious.
Very proud of that show.

1882
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:54,630
That was the first 10 days when the
Norway one does frogger to taste any

1883
01:47:54,631 --> 01:47:58,770
different? Well I don't, I
wouldn't, I don't eat toad
actually. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

1884
01:47:58,771 --> 01:48:03,720
I haven't had towed at all. So coming
frog. Hmm. He never had a toad. I Dunno,

1885
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:06,390
I will next show a few. Is it, I mean,

1886
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:10,160
take it in with me as far as how
they're related. Told to drive. It.

1887
01:48:10,161 --> 01:48:11,980
Will toad toads are dry
land and it's a dry land.

1888
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:15,270
Amphibian and frogs are water amphibians.
But do people eat both?

1889
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:18,480
Probably the biologist somewhere going,
oh dude, there's getting it so wrong.

1890
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,000
Probably we ever, I don't
know. I've never heard of it.

1891
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:22,200
And it told you been a toast?
No.

1892
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:26,100
I grew up with a lot of toads in Ohio
Gi and I don't know, I didn't eat them,

1893
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:28,950
but anybody had kissed him alive.
But I don't see him anymore.

1894
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:32,520
Anyone become a prince? No, I
don't think. Is that that? No,

1895
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:34,890
I think you just get like black dude.
If he kicks the toad

1896
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:39,600
frog turns into [inaudible] frog legs.
That's very common.

1897
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:42,930
But they do taste like chicken.
I don't think people eat toad,

1898
01:48:42,931 --> 01:48:46,050
but somebody is going to get right
in down into someone's eating them.

1899
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:48,650
There's people eating a lot of
shit out there. When I was in,

1900
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:51,390
I remember when I was in Costa Rica and
I was setting up to do the Costa Rican

1901
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:52,350
survivor man show,

1902
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:56,250
and this was before the show started and
we're standing is a little hut and it

1903
01:48:56,251 --> 01:48:59,700
was upstairs and I hear this
person walking up the steps.

1904
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:05,680
It was a big foot. Costa
Rican, bigfoot? No, no.

1905
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,170
He's not in the jungle at finally as
freaking me out. So I take my flashlight,

1906
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:14,090
I go around. It was a frog
the size of us of a, of a,

1907
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:18,900
like a saucer pan. And he was
going up the steps clump. Wow.

1908
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:23,670
Clump. This isn't massive.
Costa Rican frock. Huge guys
are gigantic down here now.

1909
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:27,810
That would be a good meal. I love
toads. Steak dinner. Um, would,

1910
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:30,240
would you have eaten that?
Yeah.

1911
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:33,690
If I'd find him a week later when I was
filming survivor, man, I want him to kill.

1912
01:49:33,691 --> 01:49:38,670
That's a big fucking, no, we probably
just, they don't sound like a Hollywood.

1913
01:49:38,671 --> 01:49:43,000
They don't have fangs or anything.
Is Anybody died from frogs? Uh,

1914
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:47,990
well, and they also, they have the
poison tip frogs in Costa Rica. And what

1915
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,860
is the deal with those? This is the
poison on their skin. You touch that,

1916
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:53,920
touch it to your eye. You're dead. Whoa.

1917
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,060
There's a lot of shit in the rain forest
that's designed to get rid of people.

1918
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:02,770
I know. Did you, uh, you stayed in
the Amazon? I'm sure the Amazon.

1919
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:05,020
I tell you the thing about the Amazon is

1920
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,690
just so much there that's poison us and
it's not, you know what it's, it is.

1921
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:13,750
It's not the snakes. It's not
the spiders, it's not Jaguar,

1922
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:18,640
it's not other creepy crawlies.
It's the aunts every time it's the ants,

1923
01:50:18,641 --> 01:50:20,830
the ants or the worst part of
the jungle because they're just,

1924
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:23,770
there's so many of them and
they all hurt like hell.

1925
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:26,350
And the bullet ants are worse.
The bullet ants are like,

1926
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:29,470
he gets stung by pulling out, first
of all, it's bomb is like a wasp.

1927
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:32,710
And then he's got a big
teeth on the front end.

1928
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:35,110
It's about two inches long.

1929
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:38,500
And what it does is it sinks its teeth
into you and then it shoves its bumps

1930
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:39,310
sting or into you.

1931
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:43,090
And they say it's like taking a
scorching red hot pair of pliers,

1932
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,600
jamming it into your skin,
squeezing as hard as you can,

1933
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:49,610
twisting as hard as you can and
holding that for five hours. Oh,

1934
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:54,550
and that's a bullet ant staying. Yeah.
And you can Google these, the, the, uh,

1935
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:57,400
if it's the, the what?
Ani people and different,

1936
01:50:57,430 --> 01:51:02,430
they actually have a a coming of age
thing where the young men take a glove,

1937
01:51:02,441 --> 01:51:07,441
they build a glove out of twigs and
they trap on the glove like 30 of these

1938
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:13,060
ants. And the other thing is you have
to shove your hand into the claw. Yeah,

1939
01:51:13,061 --> 01:51:17,260
we played it on the pog saw that, I
believe we played it. But yeah, we tents.

1940
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,400
It's insane.

1941
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:22,900
The amount of like disconnect that
you must have to have the tolerance.

1942
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:26,110
Six of those things can bring
a full man full grown man down.

1943
01:51:26,111 --> 01:51:28,300
He can put them out. But think
the God, the show that I watched,

1944
01:51:28,301 --> 01:51:32,370
I think the host tried it.
I think the host good. Yeah.

1945
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,490
I think it was some English guy.
Let himself get Jack by the bullet ants,

1946
01:51:35,491 --> 01:51:36,640
if I remember correctly.

1947
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,970
The other was a bunch of young men has
doing it as a rite of passage. Yeah,

1948
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:46,030
that's, there's a lot of that. I
mean what I did beyond the Syria,

1949
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,890
did you see the series
beyond survival nicely? Okay.

1950
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:50,320
So you got to check that out
because that was, you know,

1951
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:54,760
that was a series I did where survived
around the world with remote indigenous

1952
01:51:54,761 --> 01:51:58,390
peoples. And I did ceremonies. I got
tattooed with a stick and a nail.

1953
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:00,890
Where was that a in um,
by the mentor.

1954
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:05,280
Why in Sumatra and the Tattoo on the
side too that it's like sticking a nail.

1955
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:09,160
That was Britain. Then I did Voodoo
ceremonies, a seats, ceremonies,

1956
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:13,300
trance dances, uh, all the stuff
I did around the world. And um,

1957
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:18,700
and we did a plant
medicines in, uh, in, uh,

1958
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:22,910
the Amazon jungle with the
Incan people in the [inaudible],

1959
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:26,470
the Watani and that it was very,
very intense series.

1960
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:29,260
I can't remember why I went to
that series, but in any event, uh,

1961
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,240
it showed a lot of these crazy ass
ceremonies and combined with survival,

1962
01:52:34,241 --> 01:52:35,021
so are the split,

1963
01:52:35,021 --> 01:52:38,050
the distinction was made between
spiritual survival and physical survival.

1964
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,640
And they said that I
went there to learn why,

1965
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:42,940
what's their spiritual survival in the
jungles and deserts and places like this.

1966
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:46,460
And so they all was these wicked

1967
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,970
ass ceremonies where they are connecting
to the ancients and connecting to the

1968
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:54,740
earth and, and, and learning
how to survive, but doing
all these things, you know,

1969
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:58,430
as well. And so I got to partake in
a lot of the ceremonies and do them.

1970
01:52:58,431 --> 01:53:00,530
That was pretty intense.
So that series,

1971
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:03,050
the reason why half soft said this
is the behind the scenes crop,

1972
01:53:03,051 --> 01:53:05,990
but the reason why beyond survival,
it did very well aerated very well.

1973
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:07,880
The problem was they didn't
put my name in the title.

1974
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:10,280
I know that sounds horribly pretentious,
but I said,

1975
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:13,370
look at once you're flicking the dial
and you're looking at the screen and it's

1976
01:53:13,371 --> 01:53:16,430
got all the different shows listed
and you see beyond survival,

1977
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:18,200
but you don't see less
Stroud's beyond survival.

1978
01:53:18,201 --> 01:53:21,110
He just going on and you're gonna Watch
CSI. It's true. You don't. But if they,

1979
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,720
if they'd said less jobs beyond survive,

1980
01:53:22,721 --> 01:53:26,230
all the survivor man fans would have
gone. Ah, okay. That's funny that,

1981
01:53:26,231 --> 01:53:30,350
that's like an egotistic thing to
say. I know it is. It's right. Yeah.

1982
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,460
So you're supposed to say it. It's
like one of those things where you at?

1983
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,990
You're right though. It's
unquestioned. Like for me personally,

1984
01:53:35,991 --> 01:53:37,610
if I saw beyond survival,
probably wouldn't.

1985
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:40,790
But if I saw less Stroud's beyond
survivor, like, oh survivor man, dude,

1986
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:43,820
I'll check that shit out. You
could have like, you know,

1987
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:48,890
a UFC podcast or something, something
podcasts. But Joe Rogan's names not in it.

1988
01:53:48,891 --> 01:53:51,470
It's like, oh well maybe I might listen
to my, check it out and then I see,

1989
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:54,860
oh it's Joe Rogan's you have see
podcasts. Oh, I can check that out.

1990
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,050
We should totally do that.
But I would probably get sued.

1991
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:59,870
The problem is to shift that.
I can say on this podcast,

1992
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:03,050
I don't want to like connect that with
the UFC has a different task and then so

1993
01:54:03,051 --> 01:54:05,660
then I'd have to like tone myself
down when I'm fucking ruin it.

1994
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,200
Steevo was the one that, by the way,
they did the bullet and glove. Yes. Oh,

1995
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:13,940
Steven did an on an on. Wild boys are
jackass. Crazy wild boys. And he also,

1996
01:54:13,941 --> 01:54:16,910
he also put him, I remember that,
but it put him in the hospital. Yeah.

1997
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:21,380
Fucking weird. Have you ever encountered
a Brazilian wandering spider?

1998
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:27,320
No. He never heard of it? No.
Oh my God. Really? No. I'm
going to Brazil in December.

1999
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:29,430
Oh Jesus.
To the Brazilian wanderings party.

2000
01:54:29,431 --> 01:54:32,660
You've got to look this up cause it's a
spider that stings you and first of all,

2001
01:54:32,661 --> 01:54:37,661
it gives you the most unbelievably
painful erection cause it it shock jolts

2002
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:38,361
your,

2003
01:54:38,361 --> 01:54:43,340
your production of nitric
oxide and injects it in some
sort of a venom form from

2004
01:54:43,341 --> 01:54:45,610
this spider and you,

2005
01:54:45,611 --> 01:54:48,590
you get like literally die with a hard on,

2006
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:52,070
like your whole body stiffens
up and if you do survive,

2007
01:54:52,071 --> 01:54:56,780
it's the most toxic spider known to man.
And if you do survive, really? Yeah.

2008
01:54:56,781 --> 01:55:01,400
If you do survive your Dick's dead
forever, your sexuality is ruined.

2009
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,680
It's called a Brazilian wondering spider.

2010
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:07,480
It's unbelievable man to be a lot of like,
I don't know,

2011
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:09,090
I think they're trying to uh,

2012
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:12,410
figure out how to use its venom
to make the next hard on drug.

2013
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:15,770
They're going to make something that
just cruise 70,000 Jaeger. Right?

2014
01:55:15,771 --> 01:55:18,350
And the Dick. Yeah, that's the baby.

2015
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:22,070
I took some spider tonight and it wanders
on the floor. There it is right there.

2016
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:27,000
Is that it? Yeah. Yeah. That motherfucker
will kill you with a boner. Mm.

2017
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:31,370
I bet this guy. We'll explain that so
you don't think I'm crazy. That's a mean.

2018
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:35,320
Let's see. Look at the spider.
It's still not entirely sure about

2019
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:42,180
pack it up because it'll tell you about
what it does to men and scientists a

2020
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:44,130
little bit before bitten by this beast.

2021
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:46,620
You're going to end up
with a very painful,

2022
01:55:46,621 --> 01:55:51,621
long lasting erection and scientists
are still not entirely sure about the

2023
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:52,740
effects on women.

2024
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:57,690
The male brain actually mistakes the
chemicals in the spider venom for the

2025
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:01,620
chemicals that the male brain normally
use this to trigger an erection and the

2026
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:04,350
bizarre symptoms.
Now consider this.

2027
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,010
This little spider has been doing that
kind of thing for millions of years.

2028
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,900
Man has only just designed a drug
that does broadly the same thing. Now,

2029
01:56:12,901 --> 01:56:13,890
how lucky was that?

2030
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:16,760
He's way too obsessed with boners.

2031
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:22,110
I'm obsessed with that being a terrifying
fucking way to die. Die with a boner.

2032
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,550
That's the thing. I mean, you know,

2033
01:56:23,551 --> 01:56:27,500
there's things down in the Amazon
jungles where Brazil, it's,

2034
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,350
when I was down there, I was training off
the, what Ani and we'd learn to survive.

2035
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:36,180
He was telling us a story through an
interpreter. He had actually, uh, was,

2036
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:39,420
uh, a blowgun hit, uh,
a monkey up in the tree.

2037
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:44,730
I had to climb up the tree to get the
monkey 60 feet in the air and he just said

2038
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:48,570
the canopy, right? So
he just barely graze,

2039
01:56:48,571 --> 01:56:51,060
just brushed a caterpillar.

2040
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:55,710
And the electric jolt was so powerful
that it jolted him right out of the tree

2041
01:56:55,711 --> 01:57:00,210
and down 60 feet. Oh my God. And he
didn't break a single bone in his body,

2042
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:04,470
but he spent weeks, two weeks in the
hospital and his entire body was black,

2043
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:08,930
just went black total black color,
just blow everything black. And uh,

2044
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:12,750
they found one entomologists that was
in Brazil that had an anecdote antidote

2045
01:57:12,751 --> 01:57:15,000
for that caterpillar.
I mean,

2046
01:57:15,001 --> 01:57:18,170
so the stuff that's in the Amazon
jungles just bizarre. It gets,

2047
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:21,750
it still freaks me out. I go down there
and like I said, but it's the ants.

2048
01:57:21,751 --> 01:57:24,780
I'm getting the crawl, the itchies
thinking about it. It's the,

2049
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:26,680
it's the answer I always get to me when I,
yeah.

2050
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:31,830
My friend Brian Callen wanted to be
a naturalist and he spent one summer

2051
01:57:32,621 --> 01:57:33,740
vacation,
uh,

2052
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:38,870
or a will or a trip rather in school where
they went to the rain forest and they

2053
01:57:38,951 --> 01:57:41,170
had a sleep on these uh,

2054
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:46,200
these elevated platforms that they would
cover the posts with like chemicals to

2055
01:57:47,021 --> 01:57:49,990
keep the ants off of it. And he said
when you were up there sleeping,

2056
01:57:49,991 --> 01:57:52,280
you could literally hear
the ants wall walking.

2057
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:55,370
That's right. Yep. That's right.
They, there's so many of them.

2058
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:59,570
That's what you need here.
That's like a fucking,

2059
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:01,370
it's not fun.

2060
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:05,600
There's nothing fun about trying to
sleep on the floor in the Amazon jungle

2061
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:06,860
through that shit.
I'm not,

2062
01:58:06,861 --> 01:58:09,350
I'm not even sure how I did the
shows I did do down down there.

2063
01:58:09,351 --> 01:58:11,580
Cause sometimes I think about going
down again to do like a, you know,

2064
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:13,850
a 10 day thing. And I think, man,

2065
01:58:13,851 --> 01:58:17,100
I don't know if I was just like lucky
the first couple of times cause I'm going

2066
01:58:17,101 --> 01:58:20,030
to get down there and one wrong
move and I've got, you know,

2067
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:24,200
a fertile on snake or a spider or
a poison dart frog or a bullet at,

2068
01:58:24,950 --> 01:58:28,340
you know, and if, and I was sleeping
on the ground the whole time. Right.

2069
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:32,810
So you didn't make any kind of structure
or anything? Yeah, I slept off the,

2070
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:35,030
off the ground by about a foot
and a half on poles. I mean,

2071
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,670
you know the answers of care,
the answer above your head.

2072
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:42,070
And it was a walking from
chain tree. Yeah. And they're

2073
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:46,310
big, big, big. Those bullet answers
so big. You only get 60 in a nest. Oh,

2074
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:51,040
it's how big God, you know. And I saw
a man at one point, I saw six in a row.

2075
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:55,180
I thought I gotta be near a
nest somewhere. Oh God. So
it's, yeah, that I got admit,

2076
01:58:55,181 --> 01:58:57,370
I mean the Amazon jungle
on the other hand,

2077
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:00,670
I love the Amazon jungle and I don't
know if that's the Tarzan thing or what,

2078
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:04,880
but I just loved the jungle. It's must
be so excited. Our full lie. Beautiful.

2079
01:59:04,881 --> 01:59:09,040
Dangerous. Yeah. Yeah. It's
really beautiful down there.
They see that Amazon, um,

2080
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:09,640
that uh,

2081
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:14,640
rather ants can actually
take out elephants and that
if a sufficient amount of

2082
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:18,790
ants find a trail to the elephants ears,

2083
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:23,290
they will literally crime up in
elephant's leg and eat him from the ears,

2084
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:28,790
climb into his ears and just start
eating his brain. I don't know. Yeah,

2085
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,633
that sounds,

2086
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,650
that sounds like the craziest fucking
thing I've ever heard in my life.

2087
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,020
But I know that ants,
if you're lying on the ground,

2088
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:39,490
like there's certain army ants that
will fuck you up. People die from them.

2089
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,930
You don't think I got bitten by a
couple of army ants. I was trying,

2090
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,380
I saw them going across in a
stream and I wanted to film them,

2091
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:48,550
a stream of ants and I, and I and I,
I put the camera down and you know,

2092
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:51,010
about three or four inches from
the stream of that, no big deal.

2093
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:54,310
They're just keep walking across in front
of my lens and I get this cool shot of

2094
01:59:54,311 --> 01:59:59,020
the ants going by. I literally put it
down just as I barely touch the ground.

2095
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,071
I swear to you,

2096
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:04,330
the ants from over there jumped over
like jumped onto the camera in my hand.

2097
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:06,310
Like boo boo, boo boo like
that. I was like, wow.

2098
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:09,460
And I instantly bit my hands like
they just started attacking. Yeah,

2099
02:00:09,461 --> 02:00:13,180
they just attacked. These are men,
they're big ass army ants too. So,

2100
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:16,790
and then on the other hand, we had some
aunts come through the hot one night, uh,

2101
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:19,600
beforehand. And, and the way that we,

2102
02:00:19,601 --> 02:00:24,430
they were going under my hammock and
what we did was we took a fire and we

2103
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:28,330
scraped the ground in front of them with
a fire to break cause they all travel

2104
02:00:28,331 --> 02:00:30,370
on pheromones. It's all done
through pheromones, scent, right?

2105
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:33,340
They follow each other on the pheromone
trail and you have to break that trail

2106
02:00:33,341 --> 02:00:33,970
with fire.

2107
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:37,510
And we were guiding them and so they made
a new trail because we guided them to

2108
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:41,030
go over this way and away from the hut.
That's, I was showing that by the Adani,

2109
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,300
which is just using the fire thing.
Right? Cause saw pheromone instinct.

2110
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:46,060
That's why if you've ever seen,

2111
02:00:46,061 --> 02:00:49,090
if anybody's ever seen those youtube
videos of the spiral of death,

2112
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:52,360
they lose the scent of whoever
the fuck is in the lead.

2113
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:57,070
And they just spiral around in a circle
until they starved to death. Really?

2114
02:00:57,071 --> 02:00:59,620
What VMC Brian?
It's crazy.

2115
02:00:59,621 --> 02:01:04,030
Spiral love video of ant death spiral.
This is going to freak you out.

2116
02:01:04,031 --> 02:01:08,230
They've never seen this before. This is
a, it's a rare occurrence apparently.

2117
02:01:08,231 --> 02:01:11,860
But the ants get confused
when they're, uh, they're,

2118
02:01:11,861 --> 02:01:15,730
they lose a cent and they don't
know who the fuck they're following.

2119
02:01:15,731 --> 02:01:18,340
And they get in these,
they look like hurricanes.

2120
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:22,990
They're getting these spinning hurricanes
of ants and then they spin in a circle

2121
02:01:22,991 --> 02:01:27,100
until they all died. Yeah. It's called a
death spiral. It's fucking fascinating,

2122
02:01:27,101 --> 02:01:31,120
man. It's, it's rarely filmed. It's not
that common, but that's it right there.

2123
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:36,040
Look at that there. That's essentially,
that looks to me like a galaxy.

2124
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:40,400
It looks like a hurricane. It looks
like, you know it's craziness.

2125
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:41,360
If you've never seen it,

2126
02:01:41,361 --> 02:01:44,120
you have to Google it because it
doesn't even seem like it's real.

2127
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:46,730
It's this insane amount
of ants and at the top,

2128
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,770
in the middle rather in the center.

2129
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:52,460
There is so many of them that
they're piled up like many,

2130
02:01:52,461 --> 02:01:57,461
many times over like 10 20 ants high and
they're all just trampling each other.

2131
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:01,070
And why do they think they think
it's because it's a pheromonal thing.

2132
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:02,500
There's one error.
Yeah,

2133
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:05,360
there's an error and they don't
know what they lost their scent.

2134
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:08,810
They don't know what the fuck doing. Ah,
seriously man. Billy doesn't know the way.

2135
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:13,790
Yeah. Yeah. I know the way guys who'd
I know where I'm going and trust me,

2136
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:19,050
it's a fascinating thing to watch though,
cause an error that nature.

2137
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:21,920
That's a thing. I've, I've been
really super fortunate with the,

2138
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:23,590
all the film work that I've done is,
is,

2139
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:27,380
has been to see the beauty that I've
seen. You know, the Andes mountains,

2140
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:31,070
the Amazon jungle dude, your big
foot stores still freaking me out.

2141
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:35,510
I gotta be honest, that 50 foot away.
How will they ape while you're asleep,

2142
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:39,230
you're in this tent. Jesus Christ
man. When you're in Alaska,

2143
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:44,630
G. U. E Z, that's the,
that to me is the ultimate.

2144
02:02:44,631 --> 02:02:46,550
If I had like one,

2145
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:52,450
one question that I could ask where I
could find out like one truth about the

2146
02:02:52,761 --> 02:02:57,740
world, I would ask about big. Really. If
you could talk to God said, come on dude.

2147
02:02:57,741 --> 02:03:02,390
Is there anything out there?
Come on. I would be it, you know,

2148
02:03:02,391 --> 02:03:06,060
I would ask about this life.
I would ask about like an afterlife.

2149
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:10,610
Maybe if I hadn't like looking
towards the dirt on the squatch man,

2150
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,900
I wouldn't want to know.
Dude.

2151
02:03:11,901 --> 02:03:15,950
I need to know is big foot reel and Ufos
I would have to go with Ufo was before

2152
02:03:15,951 --> 02:03:20,510
big foot, but the right up there with
me both would make me equally happy.

2153
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:23,120
You see that knew the meaning of
life. Have you ever seen, sorry,

2154
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:25,760
have you seen that new footage in Denver,

2155
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:29,660
Denver where they actually like the
television channel went down to actually

2156
02:03:29,661 --> 02:03:32,560
check it out? Yeah. Yeah. That's fucked
up. We don't even know what that is. Yeah.

2157
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:33,111
But you know,
you can,

2158
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:36,170
there's a lot of military shit going on
in Denver and guess what? They don't,

2159
02:03:36,171 --> 02:03:38,660
they don't tell those people
nothing. You know, when,

2160
02:03:38,661 --> 02:03:41,640
when you find out that there's the,
the,

2161
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:46,340
the idea is that in the next decade
there's going to be 30,000 drones flying

2162
02:03:46,341 --> 02:03:50,330
above the s the city streets,
30,000 in this country. Um,

2163
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:53,240
you don't think they
might just start that now?

2164
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:55,010
Like what do they have
to wait until 10 years?

2165
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:57,710
They already have like permission
to put drones anywhere they want.

2166
02:03:57,950 --> 02:04:02,270
So when I see, when I see something
that's floating over a city, bunch of,

2167
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:03,710
a few people film it,
I'm like,

2168
02:04:03,711 --> 02:04:05,360
this is probably some government
shut they're working on.

2169
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:07,680
I think a lot of that stuff
is pretty, you know, if you,

2170
02:04:07,681 --> 02:04:11,050
if you don't get caught up
in it, conspiracy theory
is fascinating. You know,

2171
02:04:11,230 --> 02:04:13,820
I listened to it lots of times.
I'll be doing a long drive from Toronto.

2172
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:17,360
I'll throw on a George Norris
coast to coast and check that out.

2173
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:20,570
I was actually on at one time where you
really, yeah, it was like a color in.

2174
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:23,630
Did you ever talk to art bill?
No, I was talking. It was George.

2175
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:27,970
He's the Oji doorbell shows were special
because art bell never questioned it.

2176
02:04:27,971 --> 02:04:30,380
No matter how fucking crazy you were.
And Call it art.

2177
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:34,650
I'm aware of Wolf really
for how long he would put.

2178
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:37,800
How did you get bitten? Where
were you? Tell us your story.

2179
02:04:38,230 --> 02:04:40,740
I think I would tell you some story about,
it was in Romania.

2180
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:41,670
It was on a hunting trip.

2181
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,670
It's good am radio in the middle, in
the middle, like two in the morning,

2182
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:48,750
drive it home in a long,

2183
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:51,630
dark night and you're just
listening to that stuff in my past.

2184
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:55,470
And he introduced me to a Terence
Mckenna in a way because one of the first

2185
02:04:55,471 --> 02:04:59,360
Terence Mckenna recordings I've ever
heard was someone had taken a, um,

2186
02:04:59,610 --> 02:05:03,090
one of the, uh, art bell
shows and put it on mine.

2187
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:08,340
It was like from the 90s and a,
it was a Terence Mckenna from Hawaii on a,

2188
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:13,650
uh, like a wireless, a radio
spectrum Internet connection.

2189
02:05:13,651 --> 02:05:14,760
It was really fascinating.

2190
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:19,260
So our bell had like some really
interesting people on a show as well as

2191
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:24,460
Wackadoos who were like
playing conversations
backwards to find like hidden

2192
02:05:24,781 --> 02:05:27,030
meaning. And what someone
was trying to say is a spice,

2193
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:31,050
but when they bring in like those, those
MIT guys and, and some of these, you know,

2194
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:35,480
big thinkers and it's pretty fascinating
to listen to these people talk and it's

2195
02:05:35,490 --> 02:05:37,230
like, oh, this is so and so.
And he's just like, you know,

2196
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:40,530
as sat is 10,000 or I don't know, I don't
know what you call it in America but,

2197
02:05:40,531 --> 02:05:40,890
but uh,

2198
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:44,520
it's just super huge intelligent people
and it's pretty fascinating to hear them

2199
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:49,110
go through and the covering all the
different basis of conspiracies, man,

2200
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:51,420
let's just do, it doesn't
sound like a Wacko, you know,

2201
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:52,890
then you get the phone callers.

2202
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:56,340
That's a different story when you get
the phone calls in that slack. Yeah.

2203
02:05:56,341 --> 02:05:59,460
Well my grandfather is an alien.

2204
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:06,480
I can prove it. Yeah. There's
dudes will call. He had a, a line,

2205
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:09,300
if you could call that line,
if you were from the future,

2206
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,880
it would give that line out.
If you're a time traveler,

2207
02:06:11,881 --> 02:06:16,020
there's a time traveler line.
If you've splitting out a time,

2208
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:20,850
you're just asking for assholes. Okay,
come on man. How many time travelers are,

2209
02:06:20,851 --> 02:06:21,381
they really didn't,

2210
02:06:21,381 --> 02:06:25,170
they need their own line and then you
finally get through and the answer, man,

2211
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,750
your line was busy the whole time.
It was busy a long time.

2212
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:30,490
I've been calling for 47
years. It was busy. Yeah.

2213
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:32,810
Why couldn't you go back in
time to when it wasn't busy?

2214
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:36,390
Don't you have a good time machine
or is it just the one shot deal?

2215
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:40,080
If time travel does happen, yeah you're
going to be able to do it all the time.

2216
02:06:40,081 --> 02:06:43,440
Or was it like a one you get one shot at
it and then there's no time machine if

2217
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:45,810
you go back in time. So you know,
that's a way to think about it.

2218
02:06:45,811 --> 02:06:49,210
And then you have to choose where you go.
Which area. Going into other dinosaurs,

2219
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:52,340
you going to be like the 60s.
What would you do if you could do,

2220
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:57,030
say if there was a time machine that
could put you for one week in a era,

2221
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:01,770
the Paleolithic Jurassic, like you could,
you could live at one point in time.

2222
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:06,300
Could humans live during the dinosaur
era? Was it too hot? How hot was it?

2223
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,240
I don't know. I think, you know, when you
see like the new version of King Kong,

2224
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:12,720
every time I saw a dinosaur moving,
I always thought the same thing.

2225
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:17,320
How come they never show really
big ass killer insects? And, uh,

2226
02:07:17,321 --> 02:07:19,410
finally when they did the new King Kong,

2227
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:22,340
they got attacked by all this as like
if finally that's it right there.

2228
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,340
That's what it would be like.

2229
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:26,070
You'd be a human and you get
eaten by like a dragon fly.

2230
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:31,000
Cause the dragon fly would
be, you know, this big. So I
don't know. I think I don't,

2231
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:31,843
I have no idea.

2232
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:35,860
I'm sure there's paleontologist right
now just like rolling their eyes going,

2233
02:07:35,890 --> 02:07:38,410
Ah man, he's idiots don't know
what they're talking about. Dude,

2234
02:07:38,411 --> 02:07:42,070
if you could go back in time with the
fucking camera and film you surviving

2235
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,100
around dinosaurs, that would be the
dopest show in the history of the world.

2236
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:48,700
If they invent a time machine
within the next five years,

2237
02:07:48,701 --> 02:07:52,190
promise me you will do survivor man,
Jurassic.

2238
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,850
You would probably benefit from a
time where she, more than any buddy,

2239
02:07:57,070 --> 02:07:59,410
except people would like steel
gold and hide it someplace.

2240
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:02,230
Then know where it is in the future.
Those people would benefit the most.

2241
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:05,410
But if you could keep it
ethical, you would, you would
benefit more than anybody.

2242
02:08:05,411 --> 02:08:08,580
You could be able to go back to a fucking
dinosaur era and make of a show. Yeah.

2243
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:12,250
What would you do? You'd have
to hide in the ground. You know,

2244
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:12,860
I ain't go hang out with,

2245
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:14,710
go ahead and hang out with the
brontosaurus cause they're like,

2246
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:16,510
we know they're gentle.
Yeah. But they're sorting.

2247
02:08:16,511 --> 02:08:18,830
Things are just going to step on your
head while you're sleeping. Problem.

2248
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:21,310
Steven Spielberg, they were nice.
They probably weren't though.

2249
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:25,210
They probably were 10 at all.
Steven Spielberg, man, he
wants to make aliens nice.

2250
02:08:25,211 --> 02:08:30,060
Everybody's, everybody's nice
with that guy. Yeah. The, uh,

2251
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:32,050
the t rex in Jurassic Park.

2252
02:08:32,051 --> 02:08:35,590
I will never forget that scene where the
kids were in that truck and the t rex

2253
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:38,470
comes over the fence and the,
what's really amazing,

2254
02:08:38,471 --> 02:08:42,310
and that was like one of the first
movies that you really utilize Cgi to the

2255
02:08:42,311 --> 02:08:47,020
point where you got a realistic sense of
what an animal like that would be built

2256
02:08:47,021 --> 02:08:49,330
like, and what it would
be physically capable of.

2257
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:53,560
It's so hard to think that
that was all over the planet.

2258
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:58,180
Like they had a bunch of different kinds,
you know, enormous. Actually right now,

2259
02:08:58,181 --> 02:09:00,220
you know,
all the Donald Digs they've done,

2260
02:09:00,221 --> 02:09:04,310
they've only actually found 10% of what
they figure actually existed. And like,

2261
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,610
so we've got 10,000 dinosaurs
that they know about,

2262
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:10,390
but there's hundreds of thousands of
mammals on this planet that we know about

2263
02:09:10,391 --> 02:09:14,860
it. So they're just scratching the surface
of the file of what was here. I know,

2264
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:17,290
but I think as, as humans, if
we walked in dinosaur time,

2265
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:19,360
I mean the bottom line is we'd
be, we'd just be fodder. Yeah,

2266
02:09:19,361 --> 02:09:20,320
they'd get us too quick.

2267
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:24,610
But I love the fact that there's people
possess to study that and it gave me

2268
02:09:24,611 --> 02:09:25,421
that information.

2269
02:09:25,421 --> 02:09:29,380
I am so appreciative of that because
if it was up to me to find out how long

2270
02:09:29,381 --> 02:09:34,210
dinosaurs, there's a scene, there's
a scene right there. Put the t rex.

2271
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:38,440
God, Dan, that was terrifying.
It seems so realistic, man.

2272
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:42,070
You just put music on this.
You son of a bitch style with Brian.

2273
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,940
I know what you're doing.
Look at that fucking thing.

2274
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:54,010
I'll still watch this movie
just for just for this.

2275
02:09:54,011 --> 02:09:57,160
I'll watch this movie
for fucking movie rules.

2276
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:02,740
That thing is so
the idea that this,

2277
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:07,150
this planet had a fuck load of those
running around at one point in time.

2278
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:11,110
Boy, we are so lucky that
that asteroid hit the Yucatan.

2279
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:16,210
We are so fucking lucky.

2280
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:20,860
Could you imagine how about this?

2281
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:22,960
You're on the fucking
highway in this thing.

2282
02:10:22,961 --> 02:10:27,340
Steps up and flips a cab over in front
of you and you're just hitting the gas.

2283
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:30,680
It's like people who live around
mountain lions to go, well, you know,

2284
02:10:30,860 --> 02:10:34,940
we have to respect the fact that they
were always here. The fuck you do.

2285
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:39,770
Let it kill that dinosaur son. Things
going to eat everybody. We're so lucky.

2286
02:10:39,771 --> 02:10:42,590
Those things aren't here anymore.
While we wouldn't be if they were,

2287
02:10:42,591 --> 02:10:44,810
that's for sure. I wonder if people
would try to bring them back though.

2288
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:47,480
If they were here and we killed them off.
People are so dumb.

2289
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:49,910
They would try to bring them back.
Pull the drastic thing. Yeah.

2290
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:52,520
Well they're doing that thing
with the crocodiles in Florida.

2291
02:10:52,521 --> 02:10:53,690
They were almost done.

2292
02:10:53,691 --> 02:10:58,691
There were almost no scary monsters that
like eat dogs and jump up on fucking

2293
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:03,590
boardwalks and snatched dogs from six
feet in the air and now they're bringing

2294
02:11:03,591 --> 02:11:05,210
back the crocodile population and they,

2295
02:11:05,211 --> 02:11:08,840
they're eating dogs now in Florida
and one of them pulled the dog off,

2296
02:11:08,841 --> 02:11:13,010
a six foot doc jumped out of the water
and snatch this dog right in front of

2297
02:11:13,011 --> 02:11:16,220
their friends. But we, I mean we
had saltwater crocs and floor,

2298
02:11:16,221 --> 02:11:18,880
we have saltwater approximately in yeah,

2299
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:21,500
crocs in Florida cause they all hover
around the edge of the edge of the

2300
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:24,020
everglades, but they were on the
brink of extinction. But you know,

2301
02:11:24,070 --> 02:11:25,830
you know when the python two right?
Yes.

2302
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:30,080
That's huge problem down there that we've
shown the picture of the python eating

2303
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:33,110
the alligator showing like 10 times
on this show. It's because it's so,

2304
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:36,670
so wrap your head around that.
It's eating a fucking alligator.

2305
02:11:36,671 --> 02:11:38,900
Like that's how crazy these snakes are.
Like Pete,

2306
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:43,610
that's like that Jennifer Lopez movie.
I remember that. That movie, Anaconda,

2307
02:11:43,611 --> 02:11:48,090
Anaconda, Yay. Literally like, I mean,
not quite that bank but pretty fucking

2308
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:51,300
close. It's eating an alligator.
It's an alligator. And its Bot,

2309
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:54,450
which basically by extrapolation,
if it can eat an alligator like that,

2310
02:11:54,451 --> 02:11:56,180
it can eat you. Fuck yeah, can eat you.

2311
02:11:56,220 --> 02:12:00,240
When I was doing a whole the shark
week shows and we were down and we'd be

2312
02:12:00,241 --> 02:12:01,680
diving with all the different sharks,

2313
02:12:02,010 --> 02:12:05,520
I tell you there's all the sharks in the
world and then there's the great white

2314
02:12:05,521 --> 02:12:10,110
shark and it's a different beast
altogether. It's just like a big truck,

2315
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:15,060
a big bus with a mouth on the front end.
And the thing about the great whites, uh,

2316
02:12:15,090 --> 02:12:16,950
I had uh, I was in a
cage, I had it rammed.

2317
02:12:16,951 --> 02:12:20,230
It was an 18 foot great
white came up and Oh my God,

2318
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,660
when you see the other sharks coming,

2319
02:12:21,661 --> 02:12:25,230
you get that classic sort of sharp
movement, you know, side to side movement.

2320
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:27,270
When a great white,
it just sort of,

2321
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:31,740
it's just this big feeding tube in the
water and it just moves slowly towards

2322
02:12:31,741 --> 02:12:36,660
you. And it, at the one point I
was in a, I was in a solo cage and,

2323
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,660
and this 18 footer we were
calling it the megalodon.

2324
02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:42,720
It came and it came
slowly, slowly, slowly,

2325
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:48,000
slowly and right towards me and just
all he did was like bump my cage,

2326
02:12:48,001 --> 02:12:51,180
like a little bump with his nose,
but of course that he's 18 feet.

2327
02:12:51,181 --> 02:12:54,260
It was like Bam crap, you
know, and throws me back and I,

2328
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:56,490
and I was in the cage and
I had this much space.

2329
02:12:56,491 --> 02:12:59,820
I had like four inches in front
of my face that I could actually,

2330
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:02,310
that's all the distance I had.
And so I had a great mouth,

2331
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,440
great white mouth like right.

2332
02:13:04,441 --> 02:13:07,710
They're four inches in front of your
four inches in front of my face.

2333
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:11,700
Shooting that shooting the great white
scenes for shark week was one of the most

2334
02:13:11,701 --> 02:13:14,550
exhilarating things.
Abigail. It's intense.

2335
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,590
God and P and all the shark divers out
there and they know how beautiful is to

2336
02:13:19,591 --> 02:13:20,520
dive with the sharks.
I've,

2337
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,730
I've hand-fed most of the
species ridden on the backs of

2338
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:26,200
your hands. Got a great white,
I hand fed a great, what

2339
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:32,340
the fuck is wrong with you man?
Have we not learned enough

2340
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:36,660
from the crocodile hunter?
Yeah, well those are stingrays.
Well, it's all, I mean,

2341
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:38,870
it could. It was a sting ray that
got them. But I mean that kind of,

2342
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:43,410
he really handled everything
dangerous crocodile. I remembered the,

2343
02:13:43,510 --> 02:13:46,530
the picture was feeding a crocodile
is holding this baby. Yeah, that was,

2344
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:49,020
he took a lot of heat for
that. Rightly so. That's crazy.

2345
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:52,410
You got a God damn 20 foot dinosaur in
front of you and you're also holding a

2346
02:13:52,411 --> 02:13:57,240
baby. I don't like to be around dogs.
I'm holding a baby, you know? Yeah, yeah.

2347
02:13:57,241 --> 02:13:59,400
You know, you're like, I don't
know that dog get Outta here.

2348
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:01,950
This guys got a crocodile
and it's his idea.

2349
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:05,040
It's not that just wandering
through the woods. Oh Shit.

2350
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:08,970
I was with my baby and I saw a croc about
what to do. Luckily I had a chicken.

2351
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:11,460
I threw it the crocodiles way
and distracted. I know this guy.

2352
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:16,470
Luckily I had this chicken.
Not for that. Crikey.

2353
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:20,580
Sometimes those really big sharks can
break those cages, can't they? Well,

2354
02:14:20,581 --> 02:14:24,030
we had one great white that, uh, they
were bringing in so I could film.

2355
02:14:24,031 --> 02:14:27,390
I'm with a camera man and I got a camera
trying to film this great white and uh,

2356
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:31,920
it's a big fella and they were bringing
it in close to the cage and they're

2357
02:14:31,921 --> 02:14:36,060
doing it with a rope and a fish head and
they're not supposed to let the great

2358
02:14:36,061 --> 02:14:38,850
white get ahold of the fish head because
then all hell will break loose because

2359
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:41,730
he's got the big thick rope and it's
attached to the boat. Sure enough,

2360
02:14:41,731 --> 02:14:44,220
the great white gets a
full bite on the fish head.

2361
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:48,690
And so we're now in the water in a cage
with a great white and shimmies around

2362
02:14:48,691 --> 02:14:53,010
and the great white gets in between the
boat and our cage. So we got a 16 foot,

2363
02:14:53,011 --> 02:14:57,570
17 foot great white shark that is
this wide as he's in front of me.

2364
02:14:57,571 --> 02:14:59,990
I mean that's a thing like, you know, the,

2365
02:15:00,050 --> 02:15:04,110
the girth of these beasts is incredible
and you see when you're under the water,

2366
02:15:04,170 --> 02:15:06,750
he could pretty much take me in one gulp,

2367
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:09,180
like one gulp and they could do it.

2368
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:12,240
That's the amazing thing of a
great white checked is so powerful.

2369
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:15,060
And so he's in between
the cage and the boat.

2370
02:15:15,061 --> 02:15:17,680
And our cage was held on by
two ropes for goodness sake.

2371
02:15:17,681 --> 02:15:22,050
So we're in the water with a cage held
on by two ropes and the shark is Bam

2372
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:25,680
crash, Bam crash. And if you
Google anything, you know
shark week, you could see it.

2373
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:28,740
I forget which one it was a,
that was one.

2374
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:31,840
That was one of the Times
I was really super, super
freaked out. I was like, look,

2375
02:15:31,850 --> 02:15:33,360
this is not good.
You know,

2376
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:36,210
cause he's going to break the ropes and
we're going to cage is going to sink to

2377
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:37,530
the bottom and we're going to like,

2378
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:40,680
our ears are going to blow out as
we go down and the sharks out there.

2379
02:15:40,681 --> 02:15:43,440
So how we're going to have to hop out
of the cage where the great white is.

2380
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:45,570
Oh it was insane.
It was insane.

2381
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:50,620
Oh I long could you stay down there?
A cage went to the bottom of you?

2382
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:53,760
It's combat. No, I think we were
attached by what they call hookah lines,

2383
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:56,550
both align to the boat.
So we would've just,

2384
02:15:56,551 --> 02:16:01,110
it would've snapped who would have had
no where to blow out king way. Oh my God.

2385
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:04,620
I tell you what happened to while we were
filming that this wasn't on the show.

2386
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:08,820
I went down in the solo cage and
they slant, they slam the door,

2387
02:16:08,821 --> 02:16:11,100
like throw the door down at above me.
Right?

2388
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:16,460
And I go down and they through the
door and it pinched my air hose.

2389
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:20,370
So they're lowering me with my
air hose pitch and I'm under,

2390
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:23,340
I'm Bam Bam.

2391
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:26,820
And I'm punching as hard as I can at
the top of the cage because it's not

2392
02:16:26,821 --> 02:16:29,590
clicked right.
And I'm punching because they're me down.

2393
02:16:29,591 --> 02:16:32,830
I got nowhere and I've got a great white
going around dancing all around the

2394
02:16:32,831 --> 02:16:35,790
boat. I'm like, finally they
pulled me up. Oh Man. I, I they,

2395
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:40,210
I ope that they opened the cage Huffman.
I jumped out, just tourist strip,

2396
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:44,170
huge into the, into the guy who did
it. I just freaked out. Oh my God.

2397
02:16:44,171 --> 02:16:46,810
So it was just in common. Threw him
off the boat into the sharks accident.

2398
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:50,230
Oh Jesus Christ. It was, but it
was like they have you on camera.

2399
02:16:50,231 --> 02:16:52,720
So they saw that you were freaking
out. No, no, we weren't filming it.

2400
02:16:52,721 --> 02:16:55,590
They were just lowering media
wasn't even,

2401
02:16:55,591 --> 02:16:57,610
I look at when we're
watching the checks ne Wow.

2402
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:02,330
Oh that's me right there. That's when I
got bit. He's got my hand right there.

2403
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:07,000
See right there. I still got the scar,
but that's just, that's just really a,

2404
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:11,110
a little reef shark right there.
Not Bad.

2405
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:15,780
So then mark the camera man, the
shark goes right up, is there,

2406
02:17:15,781 --> 02:17:17,510
I'm looking at right up into his,

2407
02:17:17,730 --> 02:17:21,060
got his hand in his mouth
as an underwater cinnamon.

2408
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:25,510
Biggest danger we face is
the sharp that you don't see.

2409
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:29,780
Oh my God. I could have ended
up serious transfigured,

2410
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:31,940
but thanks to their chain mail suits,

2411
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:37,030
they're able to preserve both my whole
life and thanks to I won him the narrate

2412
02:17:37,730 --> 02:17:38,361
everything.

2413
02:17:38,361 --> 02:17:42,920
I do go rogue and took a massive dome
before coming to the podcast studio,

2414
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:47,870
thanks to Kale shakes and protein
made with hemp. It came out smoothly.

2415
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:51,820
Frothy loads all over her face in a world,
in a room.

2416
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,270
That guy was so cheesy, but
that video was awesome, man.

2417
02:17:56,450 --> 02:17:58,880
That was what happened to the guy.
How'd you get the shark off his arm?

2418
02:17:58,881 --> 02:18:02,240
He just pull out sort of thing.
So if you were in chain mail,

2419
02:18:02,270 --> 02:18:05,120
is that what that does?
That works with the reef sharks.

2420
02:18:05,121 --> 02:18:06,320
It doesn't work with lemon sharks.

2421
02:18:06,321 --> 02:18:09,020
Doesn't love tigers or any of
those cause they got picked it.

2422
02:18:09,170 --> 02:18:11,650
It works at the reef sharks
when they got small teeth. So,

2423
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:15,860
oh fuck is that Brian's like wearing
a glove and having a of great wine.

2424
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:19,430
Great Way. Fuck that. That
will take your leg off.

2425
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:24,140
Apparently there's a lot of them
off the coast of San Francisco now.

2426
02:18:24,141 --> 02:18:26,810
They are beautiful beast man.
They're beautiful, beautiful animal.

2427
02:18:26,811 --> 02:18:29,240
You go down and you swim with a
great white, it's changes your life.

2428
02:18:29,241 --> 02:18:34,040
Look at the size of that thing. Are you
allowed to catch those? How's that work?

2429
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:35,780
What's the, you know there
was a, you could shark fish.

2430
02:18:35,781 --> 02:18:37,280
I don't know about great whites.
I don't know what the rules are.

2431
02:18:37,310 --> 02:18:40,130
You've been hearing about all this
dolphins getting murdered and, uh,

2432
02:18:40,770 --> 02:18:45,240
is it Mexico or is somewhere somewhere?
No,

2433
02:18:45,460 --> 02:18:49,980
it wasn't by men or by people or
by the Gulf of Mexico. People man.

2434
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:53,420
Murder, Rasor Cure. And like I'm a,

2435
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:56,600
I'm a huge supporter of wrinkled
baron and it's filmed the cove,

2436
02:18:56,601 --> 02:19:00,830
which we showed all the Tai-chi Japan
where they were slaughtering. They still,

2437
02:19:00,831 --> 02:19:01,460
and they still,

2438
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:06,350
they catch the dolphins and use them for
marine parks and they slaughtered the

2439
02:19:06,590 --> 02:19:08,600
ugly ones for food and they
just still corralled them.

2440
02:19:08,601 --> 02:19:11,750
There's that also work
with, uh, Rob Corddry,

2441
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:14,090
Rob Stewart as a friend of mine.

2442
02:19:14,091 --> 02:19:17,900
He did the film Shark Water and
which exposed to shark finning.

2443
02:19:17,901 --> 02:19:19,850
I got up and spoke against
shark finning and stuff.

2444
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:22,850
I actually live with some sharp fitters
when I was doing the beyond survival

2445
02:19:22,851 --> 02:19:23,121
serious,

2446
02:19:23,121 --> 02:19:26,420
I live with the sea Gypsies for a
while and they were in their off hours,

2447
02:19:26,421 --> 02:19:28,040
you know, they used to,
they were shark fenders.

2448
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,670
The, the Shark Finning doesn't bother
me nearly as much as the dolphin thing.

2449
02:19:31,671 --> 02:19:35,370
I mean, it's fucked up that you're just
[inaudible] animals still bad in. Yeah,

2450
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:37,550
it's fucked up.
But sharks are scary as shit.

2451
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:42,200
I know we need a man. I mean
like you wouldn't wipe out
the wolves either. Right?

2452
02:19:42,201 --> 02:19:43,630
You need to write and uh,

2453
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:47,960
I wouldn't wipe out to the wolves and
less I lived around them then I would go

2454
02:19:47,961 --> 02:19:52,400
check on them. Have you ever
had a wolf incident? Uh, no.

2455
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,260
It just started,
started to scare me.

2456
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:57,650
Over the last couple of years I've
been scared of basically all animals my

2457
02:19:57,651 --> 02:20:00,300
entire life and through the
streaks sock taking you.

2458
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:04,100
I have taken you out when I do
survivor man. Big Foot. Yes. Dude.

2459
02:20:04,101 --> 02:20:07,200
I will fucking gladly go
with you and look for bellow.

2460
02:20:07,210 --> 02:20:10,820
Puts you on the other cliff. You can
sit over there on that. Rock would have,

2461
02:20:10,821 --> 02:20:14,480
do we get to bring tents at least? Yeah.
We'll take stuff you can eat. I don't,

2462
02:20:14,481 --> 02:20:14,930
yeah,

2463
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:19,540
I don't mind the idea of going out
in the woods and look at for bigfoot,

2464
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,210
if you're,

2465
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:24,440
if you really believe that there's a spot
where there might be something and it

2466
02:20:24,441 --> 02:20:28,730
takes less than two weeks. Yeah. That's
what exactly what I'm doing. Okay.

2467
02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:32,240
You just had that moment of like,
shit,

2468
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:34,340
what did I just thinking
about how long it would take,

2469
02:20:34,730 --> 02:20:38,260
how much time I could take off work
and stuff. You know, we could choose,

2470
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:42,050
we get you to show. Yeah. Now where
would you go if you had your choice?

2471
02:20:42,051 --> 02:20:46,730
You would go to northern California.
The big thing is BC, Canada, BC, Canada,

2472
02:20:46,850 --> 02:20:51,170
where you brought already,
which is Alaska. That's
Alaska. But I think that'd be,

2473
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:52,670
I don't know.
I should go back there actually.

2474
02:20:52,670 --> 02:20:55,100
But do you think there's areas where
there's more of them and what would you

2475
02:20:55,101 --> 02:20:59,390
base thing? So, uh, other
people who studied them,
they're all crazy. They're all,

2476
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:02,810
there's this whack jobs out there for,
not all of them, but most all of them.

2477
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:06,590
But most of them, not all of
them. Well, it's the end, by
the way. I'm an enthusiast,

2478
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:09,770
you know, when I say that,
that they're all crazy. I'm
crazy too. Like I just don't,

2479
02:21:09,771 --> 02:21:11,750
I'm not base my whole life on it,
but like,

2480
02:21:11,751 --> 02:21:13,130
I want to watch that
finding big foot in there.

2481
02:21:13,131 --> 02:21:17,390
Like I've been hunting Sasquatch
for 25 years. Like, okay,
that's, that's fucked up.

2482
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:22,410
You don't even have a video,
even a of him for 25. Yeah.

2483
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,900
You need to get out of that. You
got your own TV show. Yeah. That's,

2484
02:21:24,970 --> 02:21:28,910
that's ridiculous. You definitely
need to take a different method,

2485
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:32,120
that method of a going out for
one night without a camera crew.

2486
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:36,620
I think survivorman method will
work when it comes to, yeah.

2487
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:41,840
Not a lot of guys do. Willing to do what
you do, you know, and live like that.

2488
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:46,820
We'll see. Of course if it, if
it had happened, it was real,

2489
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:51,680
that'd be uh, that'd be
life changing. Yeah. If you
actually did find a Sasquatch,

2490
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:54,530
you would be a change a lot.
Yeah. People would freak out.

2491
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:58,970
You would go on a tour like the fucking
like buffalo bill and the wild west days.

2492
02:21:59,510 --> 02:22:03,440
Like the guy who shot to uh, Jesse
James. Yeah, something like that.

2493
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:08,510
Now if you did the flex brother,
would you, if you, if you did find it,

2494
02:22:08,511 --> 02:22:11,930
like what would you want to get? What
you want to get a video? A photo,

2495
02:22:11,931 --> 02:22:15,980
but you wouldn't ever shoot one?
No, I, I, I suppose if it was me,

2496
02:22:15,981 --> 02:22:20,480
I'd like to get a very crisp
and clear and obvious video,

2497
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:22,760
but when people believe that you'd
have to track, you know what,

2498
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:25,470
when it came to the, the skunk ape,
they didn't believe about skunk, ape.

2499
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:26,760
I think it's the Philippines

2500
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,480
or Vietnam.

2501
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:31,320
They didn't believe that in believe on
those massive ape now and Nana couple of

2502
02:22:31,321 --> 02:22:34,260
years ago, they got actual
video and it, all it is,

2503
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:38,190
is video footage and now Rizek
there it is. There it is. You know,

2504
02:22:38,191 --> 02:22:41,010
it's kind of skunk ape. It's a,
it's a really big chimpanzee. Yeah.

2505
02:22:41,011 --> 02:22:42,960
You can Google it. I can't
remember where it, where it was,

2506
02:22:42,961 --> 02:22:45,060
but it's the same situation.
Nobody believed that it existed.

2507
02:22:45,061 --> 02:22:48,780
It was considered to be a myth, a
legend. This gigantic a champion. Then

2508
02:22:48,910 --> 02:22:51,910
there was a skunk ape.

2509
02:22:52,030 --> 02:22:56,470
I thought that's like a nickname
for bigfoot. Yeah, it is. Apparently

2510
02:22:57,340 --> 02:23:01,060
it might, it might be as well, but this
was to do with a particular chimpanzee,

2511
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,523
Huh?

2512
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:11,740
Yeah. The, I think the, um, there's
a nickname, unfortunately skunk, ape,

2513
02:23:12,010 --> 02:23:16,120
and then the skunk ape nickname is a,
it's a very popular,

2514
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:20,620
and it's in reference to a
mythical animal from Florida.

2515
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:25,660
And now this was a, I think
a, um, like Vietnam. Maybe,

2516
02:23:26,050 --> 02:23:29,950
maybe Phillip, he hitting on him.
Maybe I'll, okay, I'll try to find it.

2517
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:34,300
Yeah. Cause that looks like big foot
stuff you've got going on there. Yeah.

2518
02:23:34,301 --> 02:23:36,310
That's what all this stuff is. This, uh,

2519
02:23:36,370 --> 02:23:40,210
when you look up a skunky cause I
remember when I was really into big foot,

2520
02:23:40,211 --> 02:23:43,660
I remember that was like one of the
nicknames that they called it the Florida

2521
02:23:43,661 --> 02:23:44,494
skunk ape.

2522
02:23:46,910 --> 02:23:47,743
Hmm.

2523
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:51,460
Um, and this thing, they
didn't think it was [inaudible]

2524
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,620
[inaudible] the silicon fish as well.
I mean they thought it was exist,

2525
02:23:54,670 --> 02:23:57,370
extinct for something like 500 million
years in the life out of school,

2526
02:23:57,371 --> 02:24:00,580
have them off the coast of Philippines
in New Jersey. You know, it's big,

2527
02:24:00,581 --> 02:24:05,200
huge fish, you know, or the,
the, uh, the giant squid. And
then a couple of years ago,

2528
02:24:05,201 --> 02:24:08,020
Japanese trawler brings up a squid that's
big enough to eat and kill a whale.

2529
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:11,190
Did you ever see that video that
they got on one of the oil rigs?

2530
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:16,200
It's an under really deep deep water
video of this squid that looks like

2531
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:21,540
Brian. How dare you it the
squid looks like a crab.

2532
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:26,740
It's the weirdest thing ever. It's a squid
with like crab like appendages. Yeah,

2533
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:29,120
pull it, pull it up Brian.
Cause if anything is really,

2534
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:30,900
it's all I ever sent real it's from,

2535
02:24:30,901 --> 02:24:34,170
it's just a weird type of squid
that we didn't know about.

2536
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:34,951
Well are they still think,

2537
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:39,890
I mean so much of the of the ocean has
not discovered terms of species. Um,

2538
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:44,430
yeah. They said, what did they
call it? The squid crabs. Crab.

2539
02:24:44,431 --> 02:24:46,950
Like squid. How about
that? Crab like squid.

2540
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:51,090
Okay. While you're doing that, why don't
we sit up and do another chimp to fuck.

2541
02:24:51,091 --> 02:24:54,680
Yeah. What does, what does this one,
it'd be like, this is my essence.

2542
02:24:54,690 --> 02:24:58,580
We're talking about conservation and I
think I'll sit right here. Danny. Yeah,

2543
02:24:59,070 --> 02:25:00,700
right there. Yeah. I
think I sit right here.

2544
02:25:02,530 --> 02:25:03,363
Yeah,
I can do it.

2545
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:08,600
Okay. Here to Joe. You got to get
this set up like a recording studio.

2546
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:12,740
Well we've never, we, you know it's very
rare that we have bad motherfuckers.

2547
02:25:12,741 --> 02:25:14,870
Like you actually have musical talent.
This is the thing.

2548
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:19,430
You could see it right here. See
It on my laptop. Look at this.

2549
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:20,563
Okay.

2550
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:26,110
Less I'm watching. Oh you
can't see it. It's right here.

2551
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:29,800
Look at it.
It looks like an alien.

2552
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:35,270
I mean is that the freakiest thing you've
ever seen? That's a real thing. Yeah.

2553
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:39,480
It's a real animal.
It's just an an undiscovered squid.

2554
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:42,660
You know, that's the thing about
everybody having a camera these days.

2555
02:25:42,661 --> 02:25:44,400
We are going to start seeing
some pretty cool stuff. Yeah.

2556
02:25:44,401 --> 02:25:48,330
Courtesy of the Shell Oil Company.
Thank you. Shell will doing God's work.

2557
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:51,570
Hopefully Bobo. We'll get some
camera. Yeah, I think Bobo.

2558
02:25:51,900 --> 02:25:54,810
He needs to be proven correct.
It would help them.

2559
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:57,173
Hmm.

2560
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:00,870
And what is this song,
sir?

2561
02:26:01,560 --> 02:26:03,770
All right.
Well,

2562
02:26:08,250 --> 02:26:10,590
so this is a,
sorry man,

2563
02:26:10,591 --> 02:26:13,710
I actually got to use some cheat sheets
here cause I haven't really played the

2564
02:26:13,711 --> 02:26:17,780
song live very much,
but it's a new song, uh,

2565
02:26:17,781 --> 02:26:22,110
on a new CD I recorded and um, I
played it recently, a in Ottawa.

2566
02:26:22,111 --> 02:26:25,380
We did sort of full band and we kind of
rocked it out and it really got a great

2567
02:26:25,381 --> 02:26:30,330
reaction. Um, but a lot of, I'd say like
a lot of the material that I'm doing,

2568
02:26:31,700 --> 02:26:35,400
you know, I mean it gets to starting to
be called Earth music. Uh, it's because,

2569
02:26:35,401 --> 02:26:36,420
you know,
I come by it honestly.

2570
02:26:36,421 --> 02:26:39,810
I mean I've survived in jungles and
deserts and forests and the big foot thing

2571
02:26:39,811 --> 02:26:43,380
going on and connecting to
the earth. So a lot of, um,

2572
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:47,660
what I write about is that earth
music, you feel like, I mean,

2573
02:26:47,661 --> 02:26:49,100
I read that songs too,
right?

2574
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:50,970
But,

2575
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:55,260
but you were inspired by
your experiences in the wild.

2576
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:59,233
That's it.

2577
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:01,990
Powerful bass music. Let's
do this. And this is a,

2578
02:27:02,390 --> 02:27:04,640
this is a song called one giant farm.
Okay.

2579
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:08,050
And normally we get,
let's see if we can work this out here.

2580
02:27:09,350 --> 02:27:10,930
We did the intro twice too.

2581
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:52,120
[inaudible] hump

2582
02:28:04,270 --> 02:28:07,150
the dolphins.
Chill the way hills

2583
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:13,240
bloodstains strip from your sales farmer,
florists,

2584
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:15,190
pharmacies,

2588
02:28:32,150 --> 02:28:34,610
this world is smaller now.

2589
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:38,120
Don't ignore the bit of truth

2590
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:44,530
is not one GI.

02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:08,460
Oh to hear the song.

2596

Stop living blindly here.

2597
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:32,000
What I say stem there.
Don't walk away.

2598
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,140
Revolution is coming soon.

2599
02:29:37,460 --> 02:29:40,220
Children today won't be fooled.

2600
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:43,400
I know

2601
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:47,510
this world is smaller now.

2602
02:29:48,590 --> 02:29:51,050
Don't ignore the bit of truth

2603
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:55,420
is not one.

2604
02:29:59,270 --> 02:30:03,010

My wilderness.
Tell me.

2608
02:30:16,970 --> 02:30:21,170
Oh to hear the song.
The scene.

2609
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:27,603
Okay.

2610
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:08,310
Free the dolphins.

2611
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:13,850
Save the whales and Breeza fill
up your sales love for forest.

2612
02:31:18,900 --> 02:31:19,980
I love mother

2613
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:22,100
Earth Wall.
Shipley's

2614
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:24,970
I know

2615
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:30,410
I'm feeling stronger now.
Uh,

2616
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:32,540
he,
the bit of truth

2617
02:31:35,030 --> 02:31:37,670
is not one giant

2618
02:31:40,610 --> 02:31:43,940
tail man.
When can I wrong?

2619
02:31:45,230 --> 02:31:46,063
Oh,

2620
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:50,880
Tell me when I,
his mom.

2621
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:51,913
Aw.

2622
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:56,580
My wilderness home to me.

2623
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:01,240
Oh,
cool.

2624
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:05,790
Tell me when I,
his mom.

2625
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:07,640
Okay.

2626
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:11,440
My wilderness home. Israel. Me.

2627
02:32:11,441 --> 02:32:13,190
Where now can I,

2628
02:32:13,340 --> 02:32:16,630
oh,
so I hear the song.

2629
02:32:57,300 --> 02:33:01,470
Thank you dude. You're fucking
serious musician. Thank you man.

2630
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:06,090
This has got to be, is this,
Huh? Yeah. This has gotta be, um,

2631
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:10,500
is it on now? It's on. Um, like such a,

2632
02:33:10,501 --> 02:33:15,501
a cool thing for you to be able to do
these gigs and you don't have to do it as

2633
02:33:16,261 --> 02:33:20,130
an unrecognized musician. If you could
do it as a guy that people already love,

2634
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:22,340
they're already,
you know what love you from survivor man,

2635
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:26,670
then they tune into it and you get to get
that wave of people that appreciate it

2636
02:33:26,671 --> 02:33:30,720
from that I, yeah, but you know
what? You're, that's, that's
the toughest part is, um,

2637
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:32,203
you know what

2638
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:32,941
people think,
you know,

2639
02:33:32,941 --> 02:33:35,370
here's the last survivor man's
coming into town to the local hall.

2640
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:39,360
Oh is he going to tell stories as he gets
to see a keynote speaker and trying to

2641
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:40,350
get people to understand,
no,

2642
02:33:40,351 --> 02:33:43,540
I'm going to knock your socks off off
with some kick ass music and I'm going to,

2643
02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:46,680
you're going to blow your minds was my
Monica and I'm going to tell some stories

2644
02:33:46,681 --> 02:33:50,730
from survivor man, intimate Q and a. Oh
you do? I do it too, man. I break it down.

2645
02:33:50,731 --> 02:33:52,980
I'll go in between a song, a land,
but again, questions and they're like,

2646
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:57,000
you know what's the craziest place you
ever survive man and or you know that

2647
02:33:57,001 --> 02:34:00,240
show when and and I'll and I'll get right
down and then it's like you want me to

2648
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:02,190
rock and roll a bit more like yeah,
start

2649
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:02,620
up again.

2650
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:07,300
Now I think we need a reality show about
you when you to follow you around doing

2651
02:34:07,301 --> 02:34:11,380
all that as well as a survivor. Shit, how
come we don't have that? Ah, well let's,

2652
02:34:11,381 --> 02:34:12,730
let's make that happen.
Yeah.

2653
02:34:12,731 --> 02:34:16,590
We're going to have to do surviving
reality with Les Stroud. Yeah.

2654
02:34:17,370 --> 02:34:18,060
You go

2655
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:22,870
in and do shows as well. Yeah. That
mean why you can do something like that?

2656
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:26,710
Why don't you have like one episode
where you do a kick ass show and then you

2657
02:34:26,711 --> 02:34:28,060
have to go live in the
woods for the weekend?

2658
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:32,420
Like compliance one
eighties that's exactly it.

2659
02:34:32,421 --> 02:34:34,610
I mean I did a concert and
then we went down to Mexico,

2660
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:37,880
Mexico to film survivor man. 10 days. It
was just like, wow, this is just weird.

2661
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:39,470
Where did you go to Mexico?

2662
02:34:39,830 --> 02:34:42,950
What part of Mexico went to Tiburon
island also called Shark island actually.

2663
02:34:42,951 --> 02:34:45,850
Cause the hammer has a command
that was for the shark episode. No,

2664
02:34:45,890 --> 02:34:48,770
that was for a survivor man.
10 days. Last episode of shot.

2665
02:34:49,170 --> 02:34:50,970
Now when you go to Mexico,

2666
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,440
like how dangerous is it for a bunch
of gringos with cameras traveled around

2667
02:34:55,441 --> 02:34:55,860
Mexico?

2668
02:34:55,860 --> 02:34:58,120
That's no problem at all. I mean if
you're hanging on the border towns,

2669
02:34:58,121 --> 02:34:59,170
it's a problem.
But you know,

2670
02:34:59,171 --> 02:35:01,930
we just went right down right to where
we had to get to and everybody was very

2671
02:35:01,931 --> 02:35:03,910
friendly, very nice. It
was no issues whatsoever.

2672
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:06,970
So everybody gets worried about
like the violence in Mexico.

2673
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:08,440
They should just chill her blown man.

2674
02:35:08,441 --> 02:35:10,810
And you know what happens when the media
gets ahold of stuff and they make it

2675
02:35:10,811 --> 02:35:14,050
sound like it's so crazy and
insane. It's like, well, you know,

2676
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:18,600
people are getting killed other places
too, you know. Uh, it's just, it's,

2677
02:35:18,601 --> 02:35:21,970
it's where we went was just fine,
man, Ma rocked. It was great. I loved,

2678
02:35:21,971 --> 02:35:23,200
I love Mexican.
It's funny,

2679
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:26,500
we'll talk about like third
world countries and places
that are devastated by

2680
02:35:26,501 --> 02:35:28,330
poverty and that the, uh, you know,

2681
02:35:28,331 --> 02:35:32,380
they talk about it like at some distant
faraway land and then you tell them that

2682
02:35:32,381 --> 02:35:33,310
in Detroit,

2683
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:38,080
47% of the people can't read in Detroit.

2684
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:42,730
That's not the middle of nowhere. That's
not a third world country in Detroit.

2685
02:35:42,731 --> 02:35:47,200
47% illiteracy rate. And
you go, Whoa, yeah, this is,

2686
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:49,540
this is not well managed.

2687
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:54,110
Yeah. There's a lot of nuttiness going on
in this system I think. I think, uh, if,

2688
02:35:54,150 --> 02:35:56,610
uh, my eyes really got open
from all my travel, you know,

2689
02:35:56,611 --> 02:35:58,830
I think people should travel,
you know,

2690
02:35:58,831 --> 02:36:00,690
and they should see what else
was going on out in that world.

2691
02:36:00,691 --> 02:36:03,630
Because while you go hang on in Sri
Lanka for a while and see what it's like,

2692
02:36:03,631 --> 02:36:04,740
it's a different world man.

2693
02:36:04,770 --> 02:36:08,130
Fuck that is on the other hand you could
also watch Brittany Spears in Sri Lanka

2694
02:36:08,131 --> 02:36:11,130
so it's, it's messed up. You know,

2695
02:36:11,131 --> 02:36:15,150
I remember being in in Thailand and
going down and this on this thing and

2696
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:19,500
there's Brian Adams coming across the
speakers and I'm like, wow, really?

2697
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:22,170
How could, I thought it was in
Thailand while I am in Thailand.

2698
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:27,270
Thailand is a last refuge for the scumbag
in this country and this world rather.

2699
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:30,990
It was like one right where it's like
okay to be a scumbag and all these

2700
02:36:30,991 --> 02:36:35,280
comebacks get together and they just
have found a place where it's and they

2701
02:36:35,281 --> 02:36:37,740
party every full moon. Fuck
yeah, they party every day.

2702
02:36:38,010 --> 02:36:42,060
I have a bunch of friends that have gone
to Thailand to train because there's a

2703
02:36:42,061 --> 02:36:43,880
lot of camps of multi-campus.

2704
02:36:43,890 --> 02:36:46,410
They'll take guys in and they
say it's an amazing experience.

2705
02:36:46,590 --> 02:36:49,710
I was in Thailand doing some stuff
there and just touristing and then I was

2706
02:36:49,711 --> 02:36:51,900
running everyday and everyday I ran.
I actually went up and ran,

2707
02:36:51,901 --> 02:36:54,270
but to the my training camp
and it's like, oh, this looks,

2708
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:58,620
and there was a bunch of Canadians there.
It's like, it's five. I'm like, AH, no.

2709
02:36:58,630 --> 02:37:00,860
Really?
I hear it coming across the road.

2710
02:37:00,861 --> 02:37:02,460
It's like the blue dudes
where they're there, they all,

2711
02:37:02,610 --> 02:37:05,100
they all got the tattoos now
because it was, you know,

2712
02:37:05,101 --> 02:37:07,480
the thing down there that
and that style of thing. Yup.

2713
02:37:07,540 --> 02:37:10,290
They're survive man fans and that in
Thailand at him white tie training camp

2714
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:13,360
is that style of tattoo that they do
similar. And because they're there,

2715
02:37:13,361 --> 02:37:16,610
they do a tap taps through town.
It's much spine,

2716
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:19,510
sharp, sterile needles and
things like that. In the, in,

2717
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:23,930
in where I did in Indonesia was a like a
rusty nail. Really? Yeah. It was nasty.

2718
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:27,860
Did you get infected? Uh, no but,
but I, I don't know if I did really,

2719
02:37:27,861 --> 02:37:29,750
I guess I didn't for a while I did.

2720
02:37:29,930 --> 02:37:32,690
I went down and they rub it
off in the streams that hurts.

2721
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:35,790
So rubbing brass and stuff all over
it and leaves and things in the,

2722
02:37:35,810 --> 02:37:37,220
in the water right after they've done it.

2723
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:42,610
And what is the worst like infection or
disease or anything that you ever caught

2724
02:37:42,741 --> 02:37:46,490
while you were out? Yeah, a few lots,

2725
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:50,750
but it's always the stomach, stomach
stuff from eating something fucked up.

2726
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:55,610
I had one, one time, some parasite and um,

2727
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:57,710
I remember it would,

2728
02:37:57,711 --> 02:38:01,820
it would leave these long
snake like leisure lesions
all the way around the roof

2729
02:38:01,821 --> 02:38:05,660
of my mouth and my tongue would be a
massive white and had to eat with a straw.

2730
02:38:05,660 --> 02:38:08,600
And I, and I went in, I checked off
all doctors and dentists and fun.

2731
02:38:08,601 --> 02:38:09,261
I go to this doctor,

2732
02:38:09,261 --> 02:38:12,290
he's a third world disease specialist
named Dr Keystone and Toronto.

2733
02:38:12,291 --> 02:38:17,120
Real cool guy, a great doctor. And I
go in, I opened my mouth and he looks,

2734
02:38:17,121 --> 02:38:18,980
he comes in,
he looks at my mouth and he's looking at,

2735
02:38:18,981 --> 02:38:21,050
and he's squinting his eyes.
He goes,

2736
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:25,910
I have never seen anything like that
before. I'm like, ah, that's just,

2737
02:38:25,911 --> 02:38:29,390
that's a scene in a movie, man.
Oh Man. You know, of all people,

2738
02:38:29,391 --> 02:38:31,130
this guy's a number one third world is,
and it's like,

2739
02:38:31,131 --> 02:38:35,330
you don't know what this is. I'm screwed.
You know? So, ah, that was nasty.

2740
02:38:35,331 --> 02:38:39,200
That was like a year long. I had, it was
painful a year long. It lasted. Yeah.

2741
02:38:39,201 --> 02:38:42,680
Well until I got to him and sort of got
the pill and then he gave me some big

2742
02:38:42,681 --> 02:38:46,760
horse pills and that finally took care
of every once in a while though I feel I

2743
02:38:46,761 --> 02:38:51,340
feel stuff in my mouth and I ha,
I wonder if it's still in there somewhere.

2744
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:54,380
Dormant stages because every once
in a while I feel things that are,

2745
02:38:54,381 --> 02:38:58,400
I are not there like that. You know, Jesus
said it was, I took, I should, I should,

2746
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:00,100
I should just put this
on my Facebook sometimes.

2747
02:39:00,101 --> 02:39:02,940
I actually took a photograph of my
tongue and that when it was like, Oh,

2748
02:39:02,970 --> 02:39:05,660
put it up man,
come on Twitter.

2749
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:08,380
Because I had to send it to the doctor's
a hair here as here it's it, it's,

2750
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:11,000
it's bad today. Here click look. And
then I showed it to him, you know,

2751
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,910
cause it would chat and you know what,
you know I talked about the snake,

2752
02:39:13,911 --> 02:39:16,490
like legions in the roof of my mouth.
That would happen over night.

2753
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:20,480
So imagine that. It's like you
go to bed, you're Ruth was fine.

2754
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:24,530
You wake up and it's like a snake or a
worm has been dancing around the roof of

2755
02:39:24,531 --> 02:39:26,570
your mouth all night.
It was at what was happening?

2756
02:39:26,571 --> 02:39:30,230
Was it like moving across your mouth?
I still don't know. It was just nasty.

2757
02:39:30,830 --> 02:39:34,580
So that that was, yeah. What
were the parasites? What
were the pill? I don't know.

2758
02:39:34,581 --> 02:39:39,560
They were just big ass
man. They were huge.

2759
02:39:39,850 --> 02:39:43,020
Oh God. And now, so
getting parasites in my,

2760
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:47,540
my digestive tract and that's stuff
that we're, you know, worries me.

2761
02:39:47,541 --> 02:39:51,710
Even now to this day,
I always get traveler's belly too.

2762
02:39:51,711 --> 02:39:54,950
If I go somewhere and now because of
this, I like to just like, oh, here we go.

2763
02:39:56,090 --> 02:39:57,290
One time I was in a,

2764
02:39:57,291 --> 02:40:02,291
I think it was t Sri Lanka and I was
on the bathroom floor in the fetal

2765
02:40:02,631 --> 02:40:06,140
position. You know, coming out both
ends and the most pain I've ever felt.

2766
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:08,210
I broken lots of bones,
but that's the most pain I've ever felt.

2767
02:40:09,170 --> 02:40:12,360
And it was just parasite, you
know, just digested parasite stuff.

2768
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:16,400
That's the stuff nobody sees when I'm
out there being survivor man, you know,

2769
02:40:16,930 --> 02:40:18,720
that don't see that stuff.
What does that show the,

2770
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:23,490
uh, the enemy within or something like
that. There's a show about parasites. Um,

2771
02:40:23,630 --> 02:40:25,970
it's all about people that don't
know what's wrong with them.

2772
02:40:26,210 --> 02:40:28,910
And then they find that a
parasail fucking massive.

2773
02:40:28,911 --> 02:40:32,870
Paris has have grown a nest in their
brain if they start doing wacky shit and

2774
02:40:32,871 --> 02:40:34,160
seeing things and hearing things,

2775
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:36,650
and they finally go to a doctor and
that he remembered that time you went

2776
02:40:36,651 --> 02:40:38,930
swimming in that lake in Africa and yeah.

2777
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:43,090
Shit. Crony here. Scary Stat.
This is a true Scott to stat.

2778
02:40:43,410 --> 02:40:45,940
There's more,
uh,

2779
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:51,120
cells on us that are not
our own that are ours.

2780
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:53,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2781
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:57,070
So if you add up all the parasites and
all the things walking on her skin and

2782
02:40:57,071 --> 02:40:57,910
all the little critters,

2783
02:40:58,060 --> 02:41:02,140
there's more cells making up all of those
critters that are inside and out of us.

2784
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:06,520
Then we have that our actual own body.
That's insane.

2785
02:41:06,670 --> 02:41:10,180
I was joking. I was thinking one time
I was, my theory is that, you know,

2786
02:41:10,210 --> 02:41:11,320
every once in a while he'd be like,

2787
02:41:11,770 --> 02:41:14,530
Oh and you got to like scratch your head
or something. Like, oh scratch your arm.

2788
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:16,720
Like for why? Boy, my theory is that,

2789
02:41:16,721 --> 02:41:19,540
well that's one of those little critters
like he like bit you or something,

2790
02:41:19,541 --> 02:41:23,080
you know, that's exactly what it is. Cause
you're crawling with stuff man. Yeah.

2791
02:41:23,081 --> 02:41:27,100
You really were just cry my, you know,
go Microsoft. We are crow were oozing.

2792
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:29,370
We really are like an ecosystem.
Totally.

2793
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:31,620
And that's one of the things that people
don't understand. Like one of the,

2794
02:41:31,621 --> 02:41:34,600
I always talk about the
benefits of probiotics on Mike.

2795
02:41:34,601 --> 02:41:36,990
You got to keep healthy
bacteria in your body.

2796
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,540
Acidophilus for grapplers
it's really important.

2797
02:41:39,541 --> 02:41:43,050
Acidophilus is very important because
it fights off ringworm cause it's a very

2798
02:41:43,051 --> 02:41:47,700
aggressive bacteria. Acidophilus
says and uh, as is, uh, the Kombucha,

2799
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:50,010
Kombucha is really good for
that as well. It keeps, uh,

2800
02:41:50,070 --> 02:41:52,560
keeps you from getting ringworm,
but the,

2801
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,200
nobody really thinks about
the idea that you have.

2802
02:41:55,201 --> 02:41:59,460
Like there's this whole ecosystem going
on in your body that you have to support.

2803
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:02,430
Like you can't just eat Twinkies yet.
It support

2804
02:42:02,430 --> 02:42:06,610
this ecosystem. I'm a huge, I'm a huge
believer in fasting and cleansing. Yeah,

2805
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:09,660
huge. I think you know the, the,
the idea is this is, you know,

2806
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:14,340
as long as you're eating that pizza or
that awesome falafel I had at your pita

2807
02:42:14,341 --> 02:42:16,860
pita place around the corner,
that was awesome.

2808
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:20,040
And if that's some of the best
hummus falafel, so if you're,

2809
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:21,180
as long as you're eating,

2810
02:42:21,330 --> 02:42:26,070
your stomach is like working its ass
off and when you cleanse it's just like

2811
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:30,510
your stomach just goes, ah,
thanks man. Thanks dude.

2812
02:42:30,511 --> 02:42:32,850
I needed and they just,
it just gives you stomach a break.

2813
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:35,520
And I'm a big believer in going in
the mornings. You know what I'm doing?

2814
02:42:35,521 --> 02:42:36,340
Well I'll go in the mornings,

2815
02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:39,450
I won't eat for awhile until I get
the stomach growls. Not a good thing.

2816
02:42:39,451 --> 02:42:41,850
You want the stomach to grow
because when you get to that stage,

2817
02:42:41,851 --> 02:42:45,180
it's now working on itself. It's like,
okay, you gave me a break this morning.

2818
02:42:45,181 --> 02:42:47,250
He didn't shall bacon and eggs down there.
So I'll tell you what,

2819
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,980
how about I work on some stuff that's
been sitting over here in the corner for a

2820
02:42:49,981 --> 02:42:51,870
while and it just, it's
your system, you know,

2821
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:56,550
so cleansing and fasting just
revitalizes your body. And when I,

2822
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:59,940
when I would do, I do a, uh, there was
one point when, so many programs, right?

2823
02:42:59,941 --> 02:43:03,720
One of the ones I liked was called eating
alive, Dr Maths and out of Vancouver.

2824
02:43:03,750 --> 02:43:07,290
And I'll tell you by day six
of this eating to cleanse,

2825
02:43:07,291 --> 02:43:11,010
I felt like a prize fighter.
Now I was just walk around the house,

2826
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,060
don't want him to hit on the bags

2827
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:15,310
because it's like, and I feel good
and all because I stopped, you know,

2828
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:18,700
shocking my stomach and pushing the hell
out of my stomach with pizza and crap.

2829
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:19,361
Yeah,
yeah.

2830
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:22,150
Well there's a lot of stuff that people
eat that your body's really just not

2831
02:43:22,151 --> 02:43:25,200
designed to process. And that's the
whole idea behind the Paleo Diet.

2832
02:43:25,201 --> 02:43:29,350
I said grains and especially like the
modern grains are just really not supposed

2833
02:43:29,351 --> 02:43:33,370
to be like eating giant pieces of
bread now. But it tastes so good.

2834
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:37,510
That's fresh spaghetti.
So delicious. So yummy.

2835
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:42,100
Fried cheese tastes ricotta. You know,
you know what I crave when I'm out there.

2836
02:43:42,220 --> 02:43:45,970
What? Fried Cheese Pizza. The
fried cheese pizza. Because I just,

2837
02:43:45,971 --> 02:43:49,300
my fat reserves start to
diminish and I think I want fat.

2838
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:52,310
So I start thinking about pizza and I,
and I think about that,

2839
02:43:52,330 --> 02:43:54,970
just my mouth starts drooling on day four.
Thinking about that.

2840
02:43:54,971 --> 02:43:57,430
That's interesting. So when you're
fat starts getting diminished,

2841
02:43:57,431 --> 02:44:00,520
your body starts craving fatty things.
I think me and my case anyway,

2842
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:04,060
that's my theory is that it makes sense
why I crave pizza on day four. Well,

2843
02:44:04,061 --> 02:44:07,890
when I work out I crave meat. Like
whenever I lift weights I just crave, oh,

2844
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:10,610
I really like, oh, I can't
wait to have a stake. Yeah.

2845
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:12,100
It's like your body knows like,
look,

2846
02:44:12,101 --> 02:44:15,550
we gotta we gotta I'll tell you
what the seven protein bill. Yeah.

2847
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:18,250
We need to get that. Get that stuff.
You're breaking down your tissue.

2848
02:44:18,251 --> 02:44:22,840
We need something to build it up
quick. Yeah. What is, um, the,

2849
02:44:22,870 --> 02:44:27,610
like if you had to pick one place where
you would never go back and try to

2850
02:44:27,611 --> 02:44:31,900
survive again, where would it be?
You know, I think, um, I think, uh,

2851
02:44:32,970 --> 02:44:37,060
I,
I really love the desert,

2852
02:44:37,630 --> 02:44:42,280
but it's my least of places to be
because it's most inhospitable.

2853
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:46,120
It's just dry man. It's
just dry and Kinda, I dunno.

2854
02:44:46,130 --> 02:44:50,270
I always remember feeling so uncomfortable
and sand in every crinkle of your

2855
02:44:50,271 --> 02:44:55,040
body, you know? And uh, whereas
the forest or the jungle,

2856
02:44:55,041 --> 02:44:56,630
even though it's raining all the time,
you know,

2857
02:44:56,631 --> 02:44:59,840
you're just walk around with
nothing on and it just felt great,

2858
02:44:59,841 --> 02:45:02,570
but it cold is harder. But, but, uh,

2859
02:45:02,571 --> 02:45:06,200
I just find a good being in the
deserts, uh, the beautiful though.

2860
02:45:06,201 --> 02:45:08,360
Like I don't want people, ah, how come
you don't like to, I love the desert.

2861
02:45:08,361 --> 02:45:09,590
It's a gorgeous,
they're beautiful.

2862
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:12,440
It's just something about when you're
surviving and you're sleeping on the sand

2863
02:45:12,441 --> 02:45:15,020
and you're sleeping outside all the
time, you get sand in everything, man.

2864
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:19,450
Or of the mixed martial arts
fighter. Evan Tanner? No,

2865
02:45:19,810 --> 02:45:23,410
really a fascinating guy.
Very, very interesting guy.

2866
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:28,300
It was a really tough guy too as
well and get to leave. Yeah. He um,

2867
02:45:28,810 --> 02:45:32,500
decided to go on some vision quest and
you went out into the desert and uh,

2868
02:45:32,530 --> 02:45:37,120
apparently lost his water or something.
Got Disoriented, one of dying out there.

2869
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:41,640
You don't realize like how easy it is.
Even for a tough guy like that. Get the,

2870
02:45:41,890 --> 02:45:43,450
if you don't know what
you're doing and you fuck up

2871
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:48,340
your life, your life hangs on the balance
of water. Really. It's all about water.

2872
02:45:48,341 --> 02:45:51,790
I mean I'll go, I'll do the whole
10 day survivor man with just water.

2873
02:45:51,791 --> 02:45:54,980
If there's lots of water to drink, I'll
be fine. I'll get over it. Really it's,

2874
02:45:54,990 --> 02:45:58,830
the food is not an issue that, you
know, water is, is it, what about you?

2875
02:45:58,870 --> 02:46:03,070
What are your energy levels like? Totally
drop. Yeah. Oh, I'll shoot a scene,

2876
02:46:03,071 --> 02:46:04,630
I'll call it that way.
I shoot a scene,

2877
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:08,440
I'll do the fireboat and then I'll have
to sit down and I think I'm sitting down

2878
02:46:08,441 --> 02:46:12,290
for like two minutes and it's like, no,
it's 20 or longer and I'm just sitting.

2879
02:46:12,291 --> 02:46:13,910
Cause you could become solar methodic.

2880
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:16,760
So that's a problem without food
had the problem that food is,

2881
02:46:16,940 --> 02:46:21,500
you become lethargic, you
lose your energy, and it's
hard to get up and do stuff.

2882
02:46:21,950 --> 02:46:26,950
The problem with water is that you
may last 10 days without water,

2883
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:31,350
but after three you're a basket
case and it you're, you're the,

2884
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:33,590
just think of the migraines
that come through.

2885
02:46:33,591 --> 02:46:37,100
You get those intense migraines
from lack of water and stuff.

2886
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:39,370
So the last seven days
of your life on a planet,

2887
02:46:39,430 --> 02:46:41,780
if you're going without water and
you're dying from dehydration are,

2888
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:42,853
are horrible.

2889
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:45,590
And that's why people in life rafts
end up drinking the ocean water,

2890
02:46:45,591 --> 02:46:48,440
making themselves crazy, you
know, and they'll literally say,

2891
02:46:48,441 --> 02:46:52,700
I'm going to go to the store and they'll
walk off the raft, you know, intense.

2892
02:46:52,701 --> 02:46:54,560
You know,
that's water's everything.

2893
02:46:54,561 --> 02:46:57,830
So when I do my survivor man shows and
everything to do with survival, to me,

2894
02:46:57,831 --> 02:47:00,140
the very first question is,
where's my fresh water coming from?

2895
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:05,350
The mind fuck is to be dying of
thirst in the middle of an ocean.

2896
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:09,170
It's crazy. It's, it is
crazy. It's, it's, you know,

2897
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:14,260
Elaine Bombard proved
that you could ingest some
scientifically in very specific

2898
02:47:14,421 --> 02:47:17,870
ways, but, but you know, if you don't
have fresh water coming in, forget it.

2899
02:47:17,871 --> 02:47:20,480
The last show I did was in Mexico and I
was on the ocean's edge and I had to go

2900
02:47:20,481 --> 02:47:23,810
away and land to find water. How much
water can you drink out of the ocean?

2901
02:47:25,130 --> 02:47:29,530
Well, you can't really use the
proper answer as you, you can't, um,

2902
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:32,600
you could take a shot of water
out of the ocean every day.

2903
02:47:32,601 --> 02:47:34,400
If you're drinking fresh water as well,

2904
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:36,710
then you're actually getting some
salts and stuff and minerals. But,

2905
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:40,850
but if you have no fresh water, you just,
you can't, you're going to make yourself,

2906
02:47:40,990 --> 02:47:43,070
you're going to, you're going to
poison yourself. How crazy is that?

2907
02:47:43,071 --> 02:47:47,390
Most of the fucking water has salt
in it. And that's most of it. Yeah.

2908
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:51,960
These giant bodies, it's all salt. Yeah.

2909
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:54,810
But also the amount of
fresh water that exists,

2910
02:47:54,811 --> 02:47:59,630
like under the surface of North
America and Russia. Intense. You know,

2911
02:47:59,720 --> 02:48:02,940
last question. Do you believe in those
defining rots where dudes find water?

2912
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:06,920
Did they work?
I got to say it,

2913
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:11,750
it did shit that I wasn't doing and they
were in my hands. We like, I'm like, Whoa,

2914
02:48:11,751 --> 02:48:15,290
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. It's like one of those
weird moments like, oh crap, oh crap.

2915
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:19,250
And I was doing it and, and sure enough,
and then when we dig and we found water,

2916
02:48:19,251 --> 02:48:23,900
so I have to be a very light stick.
Uh, yeah, these are copper rods, Kai,

2917
02:48:23,901 --> 02:48:26,210
you don't want to, it goes back
to what we first started talking.

2918
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:30,020
I think it's really about
energy, right? You know,

2919
02:48:30,620 --> 02:48:33,350
you connect in an engine in an
energetic sense, right? To everybody.

2920
02:48:33,470 --> 02:48:36,230
I think that's what if you want to
bring someone, you know, if someone,

2921
02:48:36,231 --> 02:48:38,360
if you brought someone in your life,
it's because for some reason your energy,

2922
02:48:38,770 --> 02:48:42,430
you know, and I think that's just a,
that's just a small manifestation of,

2923
02:48:42,431 --> 02:48:46,070
of energy skill set. You know, just,
you know, the energy through you and,

2924
02:48:46,220 --> 02:48:49,980
and these wires, like this member of
the store I said about, about, uh,

2925
02:48:50,030 --> 02:48:53,090
doing a land surveying and I'm
like hundreds of yards away from,

2926
02:48:53,210 --> 02:48:55,040
but all I've got a tripod on the ground.

2927
02:48:55,041 --> 02:48:57,470
I'm looking through a transit and I
feel electrical shocks coming off the

2928
02:48:57,471 --> 02:49:01,790
transit. That's practical energy we've
set up on manmade lines but the war,

2929
02:49:01,820 --> 02:49:02,450
the earth,

2930
02:49:02,450 --> 02:49:06,030
you know the world has all this energy
and I think the those dividing roles,

2931
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:08,100
I think that's all you people
are tapping into. What was it

2932
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,240
like?
Basically there's,

2933
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:13,290
sorry there's some sort of a signal that
we just haven't been able to figure out

2934
02:49:13,291 --> 02:49:17,910
how to detect yet that certain aspects
of nature giving off like like underwater

2935
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:22,440
water, our underground water. I
th I think, I think that that,

2936
02:49:22,470 --> 02:49:25,110
again I'm being ridiculously vague,

2937
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:29,160
but I think that we simply
have flowing energy.

2938
02:49:29,161 --> 02:49:31,950
I think energy can be stored
like in rocks and so on,

2939
02:49:31,951 --> 02:49:34,500
but it's the earth is a whole
matter of flowing energy.

2940
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:38,400
Water is like the physical
manifestation of that energy.

2941
02:49:38,850 --> 02:49:42,060
You can see it cause water moves and it
flows and it stuff and it's like more

2942
02:49:42,061 --> 02:49:46,260
vibrant energy all the time. So I think
when you get an a mez metaphysical stuff,

2943
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:50,700
you have individuals, human beings
who who can connect into this or that.

2944
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:53,070
I can't explain it. Who
can explain it. Right.

2945
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:56,160
All we know is that weird shit
happens and stuff happens that you,

2946
02:49:56,161 --> 02:50:00,480
that is really difficult to explain
whether you're you're fully entrenched in

2947
02:50:00,481 --> 02:50:05,310
the Bible or the Koran or
atheism or whatever it is,

2948
02:50:05,311 --> 02:50:07,140
you're whatever dog more non dogma.

2949
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,690
The reality is it's pretty damn hard
to explain some shit that goes on.

2950
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:13,170
And my personal explanation is
just that there's, you know,

2951
02:50:13,171 --> 02:50:18,020
God's spirit energy itself, the
universe. It's just, you know,

2952
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:19,290
it's all connecting that way.
I mean,

2953
02:50:19,291 --> 02:50:23,190
I live my life as survivor man by being
really super grateful for what I've got.

2954
02:50:23,191 --> 02:50:26,130
You know, I'm grateful for the abundance,
I'm grateful for my kids for health.

2955
02:50:26,131 --> 02:50:27,840
And the more I'm grateful,
the more I get it,

2956
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:32,250
the more it comes back to me all the time.
When I, I always say thank you about,

2957
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:33,070
you know,
I,

2958
02:50:33,070 --> 02:50:35,550
like I told you when I start off
survivor meant I would be thankful in the

2959
02:50:35,551 --> 02:50:37,500
morning or help me to do this.
You know,

2960
02:50:37,710 --> 02:50:41,280
and I call that a meditation called a
prick out, whatever you want. In my case,

2961
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:45,750
it's a matter of being grateful for
what's going on. And I know that it works,

2962
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:49,890
that when you are grateful for B and
Joe Rogan and having your show and doing

2963
02:50:49,891 --> 02:50:53,880
the things you do, guess what? You get
more of that. He get more Joe Rogan more.

2964
02:50:53,881 --> 02:50:57,970
You show more of the things that you do
because you show in the universe. Uh, I'm,

2965
02:50:58,020 --> 02:51:00,350
I'm grateful. I am who I am.
I'm grateful. I'm less jot.

2966
02:51:00,351 --> 02:51:04,170
I'm grateful that I was survivor man
and still am and uh, and I, I'm, I'm,

2967
02:51:04,210 --> 02:51:07,590
I'm just getting started man. Look, music
sounds get started. It sounds so hippy,

2968
02:51:07,591 --> 02:51:09,750
but I totally does.
Of course it sounds hippy,

2969
02:51:09,751 --> 02:51:13,080
but so at some point you
just got to go with a hippie.

2970
02:51:14,730 --> 02:51:16,560
Exactly. Listen man, thank you very much.

2971
02:51:16,561 --> 02:51:19,430
It's been an awesome podcast and if
people want to hear your music, what's,

2972
02:51:19,470 --> 02:51:24,210
what's the best way to it or buy it?
They can go to Les Stroud dossier,

2973
02:51:24,390 --> 02:51:28,950
right? You've got the Itunes,
the new LBA folks. Yeah,

2974
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:31,050
that's the kiss. Some dude named
less drought in the states,

2975
02:51:31,051 --> 02:51:34,560
took less drought.com son of a bitch,
son of a bitch. So less dot dossier.

2976
02:51:34,561 --> 02:51:38,280
You can get all, all my
stuff there. Um, and um,

2977
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:42,350
and you know what I thought about
coming on? I thought, you know, if, if,

2978
02:51:42,410 --> 02:51:45,420
if the parents that are out there,
I know there's a lot of scouts,

2979
02:51:45,421 --> 02:51:49,620
a lot of young people that love my stuff
and I know I got a little potty mouth

2980
02:51:49,621 --> 02:51:52,650
wells hanging out with Joe Rogan is
they're going to happen when you're here.

2981
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:54,770
But the reality is I think that,
you know,

2982
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:58,950
the fact that I've got fans from like six
to 60 has been blowing me away and uh,

2983
02:51:58,951 --> 02:52:02,000
and now I get a chance to do the music.
So did you need us to test?

2984
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:06,040
You need a less job pause test. It's
thinking about it while you're in, in

2985
02:52:06,060 --> 02:52:09,500
the woods. That's what
a great idea. I mean,

2986
02:52:09,501 --> 02:52:12,290
think about all the time you have
while you're there and on today's show,

2987
02:52:12,291 --> 02:52:13,280
big foot dude,

2988
02:52:13,281 --> 02:52:18,281
you should totally do a podcast that would
be like you just musing about life by

2989
02:52:18,351 --> 02:52:21,140
yourself.
In a fucking tent and like do it that way.

2990
02:52:21,141 --> 02:52:24,320
You don't have to edit it for a television
show. You can do like an hour of it.

2991
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:25,940
Background sound of just the,

2992
02:52:25,950 --> 02:52:30,040
the atmosphere that you're in would
sound so like a relaxing podcasts. Yeah.

2993
02:52:30,090 --> 02:52:32,620
Great. That's a great, I haven't, I
won't say I haven't thought of it.

2994
02:52:32,810 --> 02:52:36,560
Our friend bill bird does his
podcast totally by himself
and our guests tomorrow.

2995
02:52:36,561 --> 02:52:41,060
Greg Proops, I guess apparently he does
his podcast by himself to comedian. Yeah.

2996
02:52:41,090 --> 02:52:45,250
It's funny. Yeah. He's very fun. I was
addicted to whose line is addicted.

2997
02:52:45,380 --> 02:52:48,230
That was my stress relief when I was
editing survivorman so you could do that,

2998
02:52:48,231 --> 02:52:50,810
man. You could be out in the
tent making a fucking podcast.

I kind of do if you think
about it. Yeah. You kind of do.

I could just play play harmonica song

every opening. Yeah, you could definitely
do that. Yeah, that could be it.
