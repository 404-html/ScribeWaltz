1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,850
Freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,020
You put that much emphasis on beauty
being one of the defining self worth

4
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,070
characteristics.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,960
Then when that starts to go,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,890
you're in this mad fucking scramble for
as much surgery as possible to restore

7
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,730
this youth rather than appreciating
the gifts that each age bring.

8
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,970
Like each age should bring
more wisdom and like,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,660
like the older Abuelita's like the that
you see down in the jungle that have

10
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,180
fucking magic that they're
able to bring like,

11
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:27,331
yeah,

12
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm not young and beautiful anymore,

13
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,210
but I've lived 65 years.

14
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,390
I'm tuned into my instincts
and I can fucking bring magic.

15
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,500
I can heal with herbs.

16
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,880
I can do these different things.

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,960
That's all well and good,

18
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,400
but their Instagram ass pictures with
book shit version Celta pisses on those.

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,810
Go Fuck Yourself.

20
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,490
Old Magic Lady in the jungle.

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,900
Look at these yoga pants,

22
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:46,734
fixtures,

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,440
fucking yoga pants or revolutionized
the world changed everything,

24
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,280
changed the game.

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:53,590
Well,

26
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,500
you could look at a girl
naked without her being naked,

27
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,590
but better than naked because
it's all compressed like it's not.

28
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,620
It's not like you don't see the sloppy
aspects of skin and flesh and tissue and

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,253
deposits.

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,290
Just that beautiful Preston shape and
shape is so deeply ingrained in the human

31
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,950
brain and the colors of a flower.

32
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,803
Yeah.

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:13,861
You know,

34
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,230
you get your whole legs are all pink.

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,491
It's amazing.

36
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,720
It's a bright pink,

37
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:21,630
a shocking bright pink or white or like,

38
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,261
whoa,

39
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,730
it's a white rose,

40
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,480
right?

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,430
Like a total hack into our psyche.

42
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,410
Like the monkeys that
have those colored butts

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,780
[inaudible] totally freak
out the monkeys out.

44
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,940
What the fuck is that?

45
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,130
I Buy Boone Ass fucking goddamn explosion
of fireworks coming out of their

46
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,060
asshole.

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,371
We,

48
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,610
they should be baboons,

49
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,444
nasty yoga pants.

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,640
The most popular yoga pants ever.

51
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,870
Maybe be too much.

52
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,040
They were all just all flesh color,

53
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:51,960
just all normal.

54
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,570
And then just fold baboons ass.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,451
Beyond that.

56
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:56,641
No,

57
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:56,871
there's,

58
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:57,371
there's really,

59
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:57,440
uh,

60
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,241
quite a bit of fear of,

61
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:58,640
of,

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,391
of my speaking.

63
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:01,100
So there are mostly in Canada,

64
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:01,890
right?

65
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,450
Uh,

66
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,280
mostly in Canada and in America.

67
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,240
Outside magazine.

68
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,530
The date they quashed that story.

69
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:06,711
I mean,

70
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,850
this is going to be a big feature.

71
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,841
How did that happen?

72
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:10,400
Do you know the mechanism?

73
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,150
Yeah,

74
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,781
so the,

75
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:12,560
uh,

76
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,740
the writer was staying at our place
and at the time I believe we had,

77
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,330
uh,

78
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,163
there were,

79
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,940
uh,

80
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,000
there were people watching us and I
had specifically said because his,

81
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,990
his rental vehicles parked across and
here he was sitting on the couch and,

82
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,180
you know,

83
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,270
we're talking and talking and I looked
and it was a truck that repeatedly drove

84
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:31,220
by and stopped and went to
the other in the street,

85
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:31,491
turned around.

86
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:31,731
I said,

87
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:32,000
fuck,

88
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,510
you're being,

89
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,291
you're being watched.

90
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:33,970
Like,

91
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,730
and he's just like,

92
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,060
you know,

93
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,360
I think at this point he didn't truly
appreciate the depths that we were in.

94
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,650
And at this point I don't,

95
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,760
we weren't even sued yet.

96
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:41,841
And,

97
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:42,590
uh,

98
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,730
sure as shit marina and named
him by name the author and uh,

99
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,841
and that was it.

100
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,720
So he wouldn't,

101
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,440
I mean,

102
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,260
he tried to get the,

103
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,521
the,

104
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:51,791
the,

105
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,700
the article to run,

106
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:54,070
but outside ultimately said like,

107
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,970
we're not interested in being sued now.

108
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:56,511
It's a different time.

109
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,830
There's anti slap legislation now,

110
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:59,120
so outside if you're listening,

111
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,340
but,

112
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,510
well why didn't they just shut their
fucking mouth until they published it?

113
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,160
I,

114
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,431
he was,

115
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,810
how did they find out what he was looking?

116
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,810
He was asking a current and former
employees to see if anyone would speak.

117
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,460
And then obviously there
was someone that went to,

118
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,511
you know,

119
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:13,900
when you live,

120
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,510
when you worked in an
oppressive sort of regime,

121
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:17,190
if you will,

122
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,520
you're,

123
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,570
you're quick to try to score bonus points.

124
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,550
I assume the former trainer
or someone probably said,

125
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:21,761
hey,

126
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,530
this guy's calling around
looking for something.

127
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,360
What are the businesses that guy have?

128
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,980
They're all in house businesses,

129
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,191
but yeah,

130
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:27,490
he's got,

131
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,540
he owns a lot of property.

132
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:28,930
He has,

133
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,160
he owes no one any money.

134
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,000
There's no outside,

135
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,570
uh,

136
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,740
financial interest whatsoever.

137
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:35,800
He is the sole controlling
mind cause it seems like God,

138
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,540
like that needs a come to Jesus moment.

139
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,590
We're just realizing it's was like,

140
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,400
what am I doing?

141
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,233
My life is,

142
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,450
I mean he's at the later stages of
his life and just live in like this.

143
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,261
So when people,

144
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,060
it's all anger and evil and,

145
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,290
well I hate to mention it,

146
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,160
but the couple of years ago,

147
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,701
a few years ago,

148
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,930
and this was my greatest ally,

149
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,860
his son actually passed away and this
was the guy who actually allowed me into

150
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,580
the park when I,

151
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,570
when unbenounced to me,

152
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:56,650
I was no longer allowed there.

153
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,990
He let me in and that's when I saw,

154
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,710
you know,

155
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,150
smooshy in the condition that she was in.

156
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,500
That ultimately inspired me to sort
of speak out and not be anonymous.

157
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,310
And uh,

158
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,620
he shortly thereafter actually
passed away and he was my age.

159
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,230
I think if you became a lawyer
and you were arguing all the time,

160
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,420
you'd probably be a nightmare to be
around cause you're probably always trying

161
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,254
to win.

162
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,673
I'll for sure.

163
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,300
Yeah.

164
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,660
Yeah.

165
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,410
That's what they do.

166
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:17,770
Right?

167
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,603
That's what they do.

168
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,100
Find their way out of technicalities.

169
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,180
You're a shrink too and you're,

170
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,810
you know,

171
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,081
every,

172
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,370
every conversation you get in,

173
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,290
are you psychoanalyzing
everybody probably,

174
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:26,620
right?

175
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,580
Yes,

176
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,240
for sure.

177
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,790
That's got to wear out on
you other people for Awhile.

178
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,620
Like will you knock it the fuck off?

179
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:32,951
Yeah.

180
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,500
Well when I was in
college that was the area.

181
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,380
I'm never really applied
myself at college at all.

182
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,880
But the one thing that I was thinking of,

183
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,350
like if I had a job,

184
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,070
like what?

185
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,510
What are things that I'm interested in?

186
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:47,830
Psychology did come up because I'd
read a lot of like self help books and

187
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,831
psychology books while I was fighting to
try to like manage my mind and anxiety

188
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
and shit like that.

189
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,481
But then I thought about it.

190
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,314
I'd be like,

191
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,810
you just be dealing with people with
problems all the time and you don't,

192
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,180
I don't necessarily want that.

193
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,470
I don't,

194
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,550
I don't think that's a good idea.

195
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,890
Just make you dick soft.

196
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,470
That's why.

197
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,160
Is that do it?

198
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,993
Yeah.

199
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,211
Yeah.

200
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,530
When someone tells you their problems,

201
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,010
I always feel like if you
tell me your problems,

202
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,320
you're making my Dick's off
problems make you dig stuff.

203
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,154
I've never,

204
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,580
well,

205
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,450
I always felt like that
when I was dating girl.

206
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,810
She starts telling your problems.

207
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:25,991
You're like,

208
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,141
man,

209
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:27,040
you're making that ticks off.

210
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,191
Right.

211
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,450
Depends on what the problems are.

212
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,550
The problems with my ex boyfriend.

213
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,360
He just never wanted to eat pussy.

214
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,013
Good problem.

215
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,021
That's a problem.

216
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,040
That makes it the car,

217
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:37,840
Babe.

218
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,970
We've got solutions.

219
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,660
We've got solutions for this problem.

220
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,870
Problems make met Dick.

221
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,580
I've never heard that before.

222
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,540
Thank you.

223
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,373
But now

224
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,860
that's an original problems.

225
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,240
Make my Dick Stop.

226
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,140
You should make a song.

227
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,760
I've written a few lyrics.

228
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,130
Really have to wrap.

229
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:03,131
Or the way that I had it written out is
that it's one of those songs that starts

230
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:08,330
with banter between like the piano player
and the guy on the mic and he's like,

231
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:08,870
yeah,

232
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,703
you know,

233
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,910
hey Joe,

234
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,650
how'd it go last night?

235
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:13,010
He's like,

236
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,220
ah,

237
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,820
man.

238
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,420
You know,

239
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,231
she came over,

240
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,340
but you know,

241
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,151
you didn't know nothing.

242
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,451
I hate,

243
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,140
listen.

244
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,210
I hate more than proud.

245
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,580
Was like,

246
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,211
Oh yeah,

247
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:20,451
man.

248
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:21,920
Then you hear a little
bit sprinkle of the piano.

249
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,750
You problems make my Dick so dick.

250
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,700
So that can actually be a funny song.

251
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,390
I think so.

252
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,080
Yeah,

253
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,471
definitely.

254
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:30,621
Yeah.

255
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,000
You see the team up with somebody?

256
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,030
Yeah.
