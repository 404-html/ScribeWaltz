1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:03,750
Yeah,

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,070
and the idea that I know,

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,660
I know I lived in the city since I was
18 so I've been around gays for a quarter

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,240
century and I think of these guys I know
that had been together for 10 years and

6
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:12,780
I go,

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,650
so let me get this straight,

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,550
this,

9
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,540
these two are going to break up according
to UN evangelical person and then

10
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,270
they're just going to make out with some
chick with blonde hair and eat her out

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,860
and like fuck her and have
a boner and pray to God.

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,723
Come on.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,140
You'd know that won't happen.

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I wonder how much of homosexual behavior
could be induced by molestation at an

15
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:37,471
early age though.

16
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:37,741
But yeah,

17
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,030
that's the million dollar question.

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,340
That seems to be a real factor.

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,881
It's not,

20
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,590
and this is not the nine
people that are born gay,

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,630
but I think there's a spectrum and I
think there's most certainly some gay acts

22
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:56,631
that are committed on young people and
horrifically those people tend to on a

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,390
pretty frequent basis do the
same thing to other young kids.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,280
It's really weird in in,

25
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,680
in terms of like the victims
becoming the victimizer.

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,251
Yeah.

27
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,360
I know where you're going with this.

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,040
We're walking into the
elephant in the room,

29
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,551
but what kind of,

30
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,061
not even,

31
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,380
I mean just just talking about,

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
I was listening to the George to Chi
interview today because they're trying to

33
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,560
pull up everybody now that
the Milo thing is out there,

34
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:24,510
they're pulling up everybody who in any
way it has condoned sex with underage

35
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,344
people.

36
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,490
And George to Kai was talking about his
own experiences in camp and it was on

37
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:33,600
the stern show and he was
just talking about w what he,

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,550
the way he was describing it as
a positive experience with a,

39
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:40,140
a kid who was in his late teens,

40
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,400
I think he said it was 19 and he
was like 13 somewhere in that age.

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,361
And you know,

42
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,090
it's absolutely child molestation.

43
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,590
It's absolutely illegal.

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,570
But the way he was describing it,

45
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,440
he was pretty much describing
it as a positive experience.

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,100
Right?

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,310
Which when it's your experience,

48
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,320
I mean it's illegal.

49
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,540
The guy did something
that was against the law.

50
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,250
But boy,

51
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,640
that's a weird area because
it's his experience.

52
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:09,720
And he was talking about,

53
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,380
yeah,

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,750
well here's the deal and
this is a mistake Milo made.

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,550
You have to acknowledge that what you're
talking about is fucked up and horrible

56
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,384
and wrong,

57
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,390
but you just so happen to have not had a
bad experience within those parameters.

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,960
Like say you were raped
as a woman and you came,

59
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,910
right?

60
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,310
Uh,

61
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,500
which by the way happens
for some strange reason.

62
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,600
So if you're one of those women
and you're about to say that,

63
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,440
you have to understand that we're going
into a very dangerous place right now.

64
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,274
And you can't say,

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,611
look,

66
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:41,040
some rapes are absolutely fabulous
and women have come from them.

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
You have to say,

68
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,530
this is fucking horrible.

69
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,221
Rape is evil.

70
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,540
But I buy some weird freak
of nature actually liked,

71
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,571
or a murderer.

72
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,490
I'm sure there's times when you
murdered a guy and he ended up,

73
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,320
he was a mass murder and
it was a good murder,

74
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,710
right?

75
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,041
And you go,

76
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,311
okay,

77
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:53,500
this,

78
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,480
I'm describing a murder.

79
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm not condoning murderer.

80
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,480
But in this weird case,

81
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,343
it worked.

82
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,830
And Milo's mistake was,

83
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,831
he said it worked for me and then he
implied that it could work for a ton of

84
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,640
other gays to be fucked at 13.

85
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,690
Well he did that,

86
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,120
um,

87
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,550
drunken peasants podcast and his take
on it from a drunken peasants was

88
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,620
different than his take on it from mine.

89
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,420
And on my podcast it seemed more like
he was trying to make light of something

90
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,210
that most likely definitely
did happen to him.

91
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
The father Michael thing.

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,513
So there's two,

93
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,850
there's the father Michael thing
and I don't know if I believe that.

94
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,241
I think that's,

95
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:28,780
it's a,

96
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,670
I've heard him say that joke
a few times where he's like,

97
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,160
I'd never would have given such good
head if it wasn't for Father Michael.

98
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,671
Right.

99
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,940
So you think that might be something
like that he's constructed?

100
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:37,901
I don't believe it.

101
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:38,530
I don't know why.

102
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,363
That's just my gut.

103
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,630
And then the other thing was condoning
sexual relationships with 13 year olds

104
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,110
and he said,

105
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,400
especially in the gay world,

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,530
now I know of straight guys
who were a straight guy,

107
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm thinking of in particular
who was molested at camp.

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,940
And it was by an older gay camp counselor.

109
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,670
This guy thinks of that guy every day,

110
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,380
falls him on linkedin hoping he'll die.

111
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,250
He wants to murder him.

112
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,270
Uh,

113
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,890
so the problem with what Milo said is
you end up normalizing this behavior and

114
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,330
say it's okay if in the gay world,

115
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,500
next thing you know,

116
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,270
some older gay who's at Camp Goes,

117
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,421
well,

118
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,460
this is probably a fag that I'm blowing.

119
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,890
Right?

120
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,900
So this is okay.

121
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,310
Yeah.

122
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,690
So what I say to these gays,

123
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,920
these 13 year old gates to go,

124
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,840
I would be okay with
fucking a 29 year old.

125
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,321
I go,

126
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:20,621
well,

127
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:21,454
I'm sorry,

128
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,490
but we're not normalizing
that because the vast,

129
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:27,040
vast majority of times
it doesn't turn out well.

130
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,993
So No.

131
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,721
Yeah,

132
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,250
that's a very good way of putting it,

133
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,911
you know,

134
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:31,744
and it's,

135
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,000
it's really disturbed.

136
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,390
Well done.

137
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,370
The Milo thing is so odd
because first of all,

138
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:41,371
I think he's got this act and let's call
it an act cause part of it has got to

139
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:41,980
be an act.

140
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,950
He's got a wide spectrum
of his personalities.

141
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,300
So on Bill Maher,

142
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:50,320
he can be a raging Liberace queen
with pearls on dress like a woman.

143
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:50,630
I mean,

144
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,340
just like a woman.

145
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,070
Yeah.

146
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,590
Camper than any woman I know.

147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,190
Yeah.

148
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,810
And then for the apology,

149
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,940
he's the conservative with
the coke bottle glasses.

150
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,803
Yeah.

151
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,370
It's sorta like when a Jamaican goes back
to Jamaica and they start speaking in

152
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:03,970
Patois,

153
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,970
like their grandmother
and not necessarily lying.

154
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,430
It's just a wide range of use.

155
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,061
Yeah.

156
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,730
He plays it up and there is,

157
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,650
there's definitely a performance
piece to a lot of what he does.

158
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,370
What's,

159
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,420
what's really interesting is he's
very good at riling people up.

160
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,790
He's obviously very good
at getting people upset.

161
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,000
And,

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,320
and in doing so,

163
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,830
he's created these sort of
false narratives about him,

164
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,180
that he's a Nazi,

165
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,310
that he promotes genocide.

166
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:30,971
I mean,

167
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,640
there were so many people outside the
Berkeley thing that were screaming,

168
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:38,641
calling them a Nazi and saying he's a
fascist when they in fact were behaving in

169
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,520
very authoritarian,

170
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,870
fascist ways.

171
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,660
That's Antifa.

172
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,041
By the way,

173
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,371
you said,

174
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,390
I don't know what Antifa is.

175
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,430
That's those guys antifascist
is that what Antifa stands for?

176
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,720
Okay.

177
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,201
But you're right,

178
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,940
they're terrorists and they use terror.

179
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,100
They use violence to
achieve political gains,

180
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,830
which is terrorism and a these people,

181
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,350
it's not like Milo ever set or Trump
even ever said anything that is remotely

182
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,650
close to genocide,

183
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,880
but those guys just go.

184
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,320
Anyone that wants to enforce
immigration laws is a fucking Nazi.

185
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,020
So I need violence cause
I'm trying to stop Hitler.

186
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,390
I'm around the first stages of Hitler,

187
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,760
so I'm going back in time and
strangling him in his crib.

188
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,510
Kind of dry.

189
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,841
Right.

190
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,730
But the problem is the way
they're reacting to it is
the absolute wrong way to

191
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,550
react to someone who sang something
that you don't agree with.

192
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,150
Oh yeah.

193
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,150
The the right way is to say something
that you feel opposes what they're saying.

194
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,590
It makes more sense to debate them.

195
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,790
That's the beauty of free speech.

196
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,320
Like it has no limits.

197
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,140
If you want to get out there
and deny the Holocaust,

198
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,110
you want to get out there
and sexualized toddlers.

199
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,520
I'll go to your talk.

200
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,031
I want to hear it.

201
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,410
And then in the Q and a,

202
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,730
I'll shoot you down.

203
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,001
Well,

204
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:47,211
not,

205
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't think he even
should just be a Q and a.

206
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,271
I mean,

207
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:52,730
I think it should be
real clear other there,

208
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,100
there should be someone and they,

209
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,920
we shouldn't just rely on the audience
to come up with some sort of a response.

210
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,300
I think if you're going to have someone
as controversial as Milo and you are so

211
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,500
opposed to it that you're willing to
throw bricks through Starbucks windows and

212
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,790
light cop cars on fire,

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
there should be someone that
can speak for your side,

214
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,691
of course,

215
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,370
and then you should organize
some sort of a talk.

216
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:16,160
But this is setting it up
the wrong way because you go,

217
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,380
it's like someone said to me once,

218
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,981
hey man,

219
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,101
you know,

220
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,560
like we were talking
about martial arts flows,

221
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:21,081
black belt,

222
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,340
I'd fucking kick everybody's ass.

223
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,421
Like,

224
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:22,761
oh no,

225
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:23,420
you wouldn't.

226
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,571
No,

227
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:23,871
you wouldn't.

228
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,171
First of all,

229
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,110
you wouldn't because you'd have discipline
and you'd realize the consequences of

230
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:27,201
that.

231
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,034
But second of all,

232
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,510
when you just kick someone's ass,

233
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,590
they don't,

234
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,310
they don't just take it like they
come back with a bat or a gun or their

235
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:34,761
brother,

236
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:35,540
he started fighting.

237
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,230
They want to get it back and it goes
back and forth and back and forth and all

238
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,290
conflict pretty much goes that way.

239
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,010
You have conflict and then
someone responds to that
conflict and it escalates.

240
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,310
So if you have this thing where you
start throwing bricks through windows and

241
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,820
lighting cop cars on fire in stopping
people from talking and hitting people

242
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,340
that have a make bitcoin great again,

243
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,580
hats and just see that girl got
maced in the face by a 60 year olds.

244
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,010
Eventually people show up with guns.

245
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,330
That's what happens.

246
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,420
This is what happens when you
keep escalating the violence.

247
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,130
You become a them.

248
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,780
You become the other,

249
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,840
you become the enemy and you create this
polarizing atmosphere that's so intense

250
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,290
that no dialogue kind of fix it
now because you're the enemy.

251
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,030
We were talking about the
north versus the south.

252
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,320
You're,

253
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,290
you're talking about,

254
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,911
you know the,

255
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,510
the Protestants versus the Catholics.

256
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:23,661
You,

257
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:23,901
you,

258
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:28,901
you create this horrific environment
where almost it's almost impossible to

259
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,400
avoid violence.

260
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,540
Well,

261
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,500
so I'm done avoiding it.

262
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm taking the low road.

263
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:35,810
I'm punching them in the face.

264
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,130
So that's what you're
doing with this outfit?

265
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,293
Yes.

266
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,080
That is really what I'm doing stuff.

267
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,300
But I did a talk at Nyu.

268
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,230
They pepper sprayed me.

269
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,010
Did they read,

270
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,760
when was this?

271
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,320
This was a couple of weeks ago.

272
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,711
What did,

273
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:46,610
what was it talk about?

274
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,990
I didn't even have a plan.

275
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,550
I was,

276
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,850
they know me as pro Trump
or something and they,

277
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm a Nazi because of
that and they should,

278
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,950
they don't want to give
a platform to free.

279
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,880
That's the irony of all this is they
pretend that it's gotten so far.

280
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,340
It's beyond debate now in their world.

281
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,570
We are recruiting fascists for
some sort of imminent genocide.

282
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:11,250
So we're like signing up the brown shirts
with a form at our talks and you go

283
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,380
say that was possible.

284
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,543
Uh,

285
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,600
how does that work?

286
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,560
Like we sign you up,

287
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,970
then you're part of the club.

288
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,890
Then you come with us
on the next genocide.

289
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,210
The fuck are you talking about?

290
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:24,090
You haven't even played it through in
your mind because for these people it's a

291
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:24,600
religion.

292
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,370
That's why they don't want to debate.

293
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,420
It's like a born again.

294
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,490
He doesn't want a debate
about the existence of God.

295
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,170
He's already on that side.

296
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,020
So what was your plan when you went there?

297
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:34,411
What did,

298
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,340
what did you want to talk?

299
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,510
I was going to say,

300
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,410
uh,

301
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,090
this Nazi that,

302
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:39,570
uh,

303
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,050
that you've made Milo and I out
to be who wants genocide and who,

304
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,350
uh,

305
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,670
sees nonwhites is inhuman,

306
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:45,911
blah,

307
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:46,031
blah,

308
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:46,171
blah,

309
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:46,291
blah,

310
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:46,680
blah,

311
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,431
homophobic,

312
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:47,881
sexist,

313
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:48,714
whatever.

314
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,703
Uh,

315
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:50,911
first of all,

316
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,550
that guy should be allowed
to talk if he existed,

317
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,930
but he doesn't exist.

318
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,180
Your monster is a mythical beast
and you've gone to college,

319
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:04,020
you're 60 grand in debt already to fight
this mythical beast who doesn't fucking

320
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,680
exist?

321
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:04,861
Well,

322
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,581
in terms of Milo,

323
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,810
he definitely doesn't exist.

324
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,250
Milo is not a Nazi.

325
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,001
He's definitely,

326
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,470
he's not promoting genocide.

327
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:13,200
And those are two things that just
get trumpeted about left and right.

328
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,130
Exactly who is,

329
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,480
but Milo has said some very
inflammatory things about,

330
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,540
and in a very generalizing way about
women and about the wage gap and about all

331
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,410
sorts of things that he,

332
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:30,390
he designs his words and his
phrases to be inflammatory.

333
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,900
So he gets the most response and
it's been incredibly profitable.

334
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,141
I mean,

335
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,850
up until Harper Collins
pulled his book deal,

336
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:38,220
he had a $250,000 book advance.

337
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,230
His book was number one on Amazon.

338
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,780
Just sheerly through controversy.

339
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,350
Yup.

340
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,540
I mean through presales and controversy.

341
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:50,541
So it's a strategy and a lot of ways
and it's also a response to this really

342
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,990
hard stance that the far left is taking
this anti anti free speech stance.

343
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,231
Right.

344
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,550
But always with these cases you go,

345
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,780
what exactly did he say?

346
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:02,110
I always say this to
people who bitch about it.

347
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,550
And Coulter,

348
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,030
I go,

349
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,090
what sentence in what book
is factually incorrect?

350
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:07,230
What specifically are you saying?

351
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,520
And with this Milo thing,

352
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,790
he said that often sexual relationships
with 13 year olds can be beneficial for

353
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,074
gays.

354
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,381
Uh,

355
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,720
he has since retracted
that and apologized,

356
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,340
but that's not enough.

357
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,750
And that's about as,

358
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,920
as egregious as it gets.

359
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:24,390
The other stuff that he says,

360
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,750
we all say in a joking way and then that
becomes pure evil and you advocate for

361
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,050
this,

362
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,560
right?

363
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,140
So they,

364
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,520
the left is willfully ignorant
of humor when it comes to Milo.

365
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,550
And with Trump too,

366
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,900
you know,

367
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,660
within culture is doing is very
similar to what Milo is doing.

368
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,060
You mean their,

369
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,010
their merchants of outrage
and that's what they're doing.

370
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:44,671
I disagree.

371
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,800
I think they're speaking
in a hyperbolic tone.

372
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:47,790
They're flamboyant,

373
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,740
but that's what the
charter was still there.

374
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,260
Yes,

375
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,610
there's,

376
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,200
there's definitely some truth,

377
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,030
especially with Milo that some
of the things that he says,

378
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,110
um,

379
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,891
but all truth.

380
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:57,081
What,

381
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:57,251
what?

382
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,120
Like again,

383
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:58,871
I'm saying it right now.

384
00:11:58,871 --> 00:11:59,191
What,

385
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,150
what did he say this factually incorrect?

386
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:01,810
Well,

387
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,830
there wasn't a joke,

388
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,191
not,

389
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,720
not factually incorrect,

390
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:09,610
but extremely offensive to people
like the 13 year old boy comment.

391
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Like the thing about sort of normalizing
relationships between grown men and 13

392
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:15,560
year old boys.

393
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,970
Right.

394
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,331
You know,

395
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:21,070
I think a big part of why he even says
that is because he's in many ways like a

396
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:26,071
natural contrarian and in many ways a guy
who wants to get a rise out of people.

397
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,520
And by saying that he didn't feel
like there's any consequences to being

398
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,990
outrageous in that regard.

399
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,590
But I think we could both agree
whether or not it's factual.

400
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,550
In his case,

401
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,860
it's a fucked up thing to say.

402
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,560
It was a fucked up thing
to say it was negligent,

403
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,850
which is why I apologize.

404
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:46,320
But I think the grain of truth to that
and with his other statements is a lot

405
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,160
more than a grain,

406
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,200
but the grain of truth
to what he was saying.

407
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,320
His gaze have less
chastity then straights.

408
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,390
And if a woman is known as a slut,

409
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,950
she's less likely to be picked up.

410
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:58,140
And I've been sued for
calling a woman a slut.

411
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,830
Where are you really?

412
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,370
Yup.

413
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,203
Who Sued you?

414
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,021
It was a long time ago.

415
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:01,801
Back in vice days.

416
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:03,720
It was in to do's and don'ts and the,

417
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,640
the way the law is,

418
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,780
it's kind of antiquated,

419
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:07,200
but it's like,

420
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,940
oh you called her a slut now she won't
have currency in the market of marriage

421
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,350
cause she's known as a whore.

422
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,740
So we're going to punish
you punitively for this sin.

423
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,173
Did you have to settle?

424
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,770
Yeah.

425
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,603
God dammit.

426
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,450
You can't even call someone a slut.

427
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,170
There's no word for a man.

428
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,310
No.

429
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,090
A cad.

430
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,811
That's a compliment.

431
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:28,621
That's hilarious.

432
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:28,800
Yeah.

433
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,060
A cat is hilarious.

434
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,241
Well,

435
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,940
the fact that there's no equivalent for
a man shows you that there's a different

436
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:33,271
standard.

437
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:38,271
And then with gays it is different to
like 13 year old and an older person,

438
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:39,750
right.

439
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,880
If it's a girl and a 40 year old teacher,

440
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:45,510
I want to take him to the parking lot
and beat him until he has a weird walks.

441
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:46,620
Weird for the rest of his life.

442
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,630
If it's a woman in a boy,

443
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,411
uh,

444
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,460
I don't want to murder her.

445
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm grossed out 13,

446
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:55,470
especially 14 little better.

447
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,540
And then with gays,

448
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,870
uh,

449
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,290
well I'm not gonna make the same
mistake Milo made right now.

450
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't ever do it.

451
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,530
But if a gaze,

452
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,940
no one has a sled in the future,

453
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,800
like say a 19 year old fucks,

454
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,630
200 people as a woman,

455
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,970
no one wants to go near as a gay.

456
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,650
You've been around the block.

457
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:14,891
No,

458
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,690
there's not the same
consequences for sure.

459
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,241
And I,

460
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,970
I had a bit of my act about,

461
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,920
I don't know if you
remember this commercial,

462
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,720
but there was a commercial adjust for men
commercial where there was a baby that

463
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:26,950
was driving a Porsche,

464
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,480
a baby with a beard and there was a
grown woman next to the baby and the baby

465
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:35,200
has like a Tuxedo on and it's like
you've always wanted the biggest bed,

466
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:38,110
his beard and the baby goes to the
nightclub and a bouncer looks at him and

467
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:38,411
winks.

468
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,161
And I'm looking at this,

469
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,470
look at this commercial
[inaudible] see the babies?

470
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,220
Yeah.

471
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,990
So the baby walks in just for men.

472
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,870
I mean I don't know what the fuck just
for men if you don't know it is some

473
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:48,910
stuff that guys put in their
feed when they're getting old.

474
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
So this baby's got a bottle,

475
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,130
he goes out to the dance floor,

476
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:56,600
there's all these girls with these tiny
little skirts dancing around him and

477
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,350
he's like,

478
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,230
he's like a pimp and
he's with this hot woman.

479
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,350
And this to me my bit was this is proof,

480
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,310
positive proof,

481
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:04,731
positive.

482
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,130
There's no sexual equality when
it comes to child molesting.

483
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,820
Cause if you even wrote that
down with the sex is reversed.

484
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:11,930
If you even wrote it down,

485
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,610
you're fucking going to jail.

486
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,300
Okay.

487
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,230
There's a little baby girl and she
goes out to a room full of guys who are

488
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:22,010
wearing Tarzan skirts and they're all
swinging dicks around her and she's got a

489
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,340
bottle and they're all fighting for her
attention and kissing her on the cheek.

490
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,110
You would go to fucking jail.

491
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,990
But that was a commercial that
aired on mainstream television.

492
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:30,980
No one cared about it.

493
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,510
That commercial air for years,

494
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,100
it's probably still on now.

495
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,940
And that commercial is proof positive
that we have a completely different

496
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:42,941
attitude towards a grown woman
who's hot as fuck and a little baby.

497
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,730
Yeah,

498
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,040
well even I was watching big
with the kids the other day.

499
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,360
Tom Hanks is what?

500
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,420
Eight in that movie?

501
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,620
Nine and then that woman's seduces
him and I guess he fucks her.

502
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,780
He gets a boner and I'm like,

503
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,280
you're raping a child.

504
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,173
Exactly.

505
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,040
Why are we watching?

506
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,873
And she's hot.

507
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,870
She's hot and he looks like a man.

508
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,070
So I just let it ride.

509
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,090
If that movie was reversed and it was a,

510
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:08,420
a young girl that all of a sudden was
in a sexual woman's body and the guy was

511
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:08,870
fucking her.

512
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,141
She's like,

513
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:09,800
I don't know.

514
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,790
Are we supposed to be doing this?

515
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,110
You would be horrified.

516
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,730
You would be absolutely horrified.

517
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,933
These protests,

518
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,000
especially the things
like the Milo protest,

519
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:22,001
I mean maybe now that Milo
has been humiliated and it
at least temporarily side

520
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,390
tracked or put down for a
bit while he has to rebuild.

521
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Maybe someone can come along and have
reasonable dialog and do some sort of a

522
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:32,781
campus B.

523
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,320
I don't like it.

524
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,910
Why is he doing these things on campuses?

525
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,270
First of all,

526
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,830
I don't think he gets
paid for most of them.

527
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,030
What?

528
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,100
My theory with Milo is a,

529
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,170
I think his eyesight's getting worse.

530
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,650
His glasses are getting thicker
and thicker and he sorta going,

531
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:48,170
this is my moment to make an impact.

532
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,831
So he's just like,

533
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:49,730
you think he's going blind?

534
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,271
I think so,

535
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:50,890
yeah.

536
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,220
He just theorizing this.

537
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,630
Yeah.

538
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,850
He's only like 28 yeah.

539
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,511
But you look at him,

540
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:56,780
he's,

541
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,180
he's,

542
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,130
he just can't read English.

543
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,180
They're insane.

544
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,570
Really?

545
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,020
Yeah.

546
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,890
And they're getting thicker.

547
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,293
Maybe it's stress,

548
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,871
stress me,

549
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:04,704
his eyes worse.

550
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,470
Um,

551
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,310
I don't know.

552
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,143
I'm not a doctor.

553
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,630
I can't think it would be good.

554
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,720
But I think he's trying
to make a maximum impact,

555
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,140
uh,

556
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,960
in a short amount of time cause you
think he doesn't have much time left.

557
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,460
That's such a way he seems healthy

558
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:21,470
weight.

559
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,801
In fact,

560
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,820
when we were in Orlando,

561
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:24,350
we made out at the site of the,

562
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:24,800
uh,

563
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,340
you guys made out of the cab
was Milo to offend Muslims.

564
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,330
Wow.

565
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,163
So I said,

566
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,990
I did a big speech about
freedom and [inaudible] America.

567
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,603
Delicious.

568
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,890
I like strawberries.

569
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,070
Well at least he freshens breath up
before I know gaze just tastes better.

570
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,531
I said,

571
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:43,191
fuck is lamb.

572
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:46,790
And then we made out at the site
of the Orlando shooting to Muslims,

573
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,410
but we had armed guards and stuff.

574
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:48,741
And I said,

575
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:48,921
all right,

576
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,450
I want to make sure these guys are
scoping out the rooms and shit.

577
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:51,990
Yes.

578
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,321
And he goes,

579
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,460
I don't care if I die,

580
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,720
I'll happily die for this.

581
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,531
I was like,

582
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:55,771
well,

583
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,431
I do care.

584
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:56,821
Actually.

585
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:57,810
I've got three kids.

586
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,000
Well,

587
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,371
what does,

588
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,790
is it Neil Ism or nihilism?

589
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,540
I always say it wrong.

590
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,410
I always say nihilism,

591
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,244
nihilism,

592
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,370
that nihilistic sort of
instinct that he has.

593
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:12,030
He has a burn it all down instinct and
I think he has that with his life as

594
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,600
well.

595
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,690
And I think a lot of that I'm,

596
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm planning some serious
bro psychologists here,

597
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,020
you know,

598
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,320
some armchair psychology from
someone totally unqualified.

599
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:25,520
But you've got to attribute that to any,

600
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,230
at least in some ways
being molested as a child.

601
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,400
I would imagine that his experiences that
he's calling positive experiences when

602
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:33,234
he was young,

603
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,020
in many ways those could
have potentially damaged him.

604
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:40,800
And also being young and being
homosexual and being rejected,

605
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,410
all of those things wreck havoc.

606
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:44,220
And you,

607
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,390
you develop this,

608
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,171
fuck you,

609
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,190
I want to burn it down.

610
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,191
And this is one of the strategies that
he sort of adopted that strategy to be

611
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,990
this guy who was very difficult for like,

612
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,500
he's,

613
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,580
he's gay.

614
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,160
He's um,

615
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,470
uh,

616
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,620
an English gay guy who's a
right winger and mean it's,

617
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,170
it's so baffling to them.

618
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:05,260
They don't know what to do.

619
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,820
They hate it because they see blacks
and gays as their little pets,

620
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,220
and they like putting them
on the front lines and going,

621
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,300
look at who we're helping.

622
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,490
And then when one of them
defects to the other side,

623
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,410
they become particularly outraged,

624
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:19,170
but very few defect at the
level that he's defected.

625
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:19,670
Right.

626
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,100
I mean,

627
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,410
turned around and started
attacking direct guy here.
