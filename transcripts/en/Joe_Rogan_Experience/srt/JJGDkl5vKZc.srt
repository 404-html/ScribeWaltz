1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,460
What the fuck?

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,010
What the fuck is going on in this world?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,350
Are we really slipping away that much?

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,730
Are we really that far off kilter?

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,450
Jesus fucking Christmas
ladies and gentleman,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,460
Chris,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,640
is that what it's come to?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,180
This podcast is edited for television.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240
This podcast is flying off the rails right
from the get go but we have sponsors.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,140
One of them is hover and hover is
a s website domain name a company.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,400
If you want to set up a domain name,

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,900
it's a great one to use.

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,640
And in fact I just used it myself a
couple of weeks ago for something I'll

14
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,540
probably never use,

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,950
but I'm crazy.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,830
Sometimes I come up with an idea and uh,

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,230
I don't even know where
the idea came from.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,820
It might have come from marijuana,

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,430
it might really be marijuana's
idea and I borrowed it,

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,660
but I registered a domain and I did it
through hover.com and it was super quick

21
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,410
and easy.

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,570
If you go to hover.com
forward slash Rogen,

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,290
you can get 10% off of your domain name.

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,000
Registrations.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,750
Hover is owned by the same
people that don't Tang.

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,310
And what we like about them,

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
the same things that we like about tank,

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,620
they're trying to provide a service
without ripping people off that everybody

29
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:23,141
could use.

30
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:23,640
Indeed.

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,660
And you know,

32
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,810
there's the business is not a bad thing.

33
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,980
We just always associate businesses
with being a bunch of greedy cunts.

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,400
And that's why people think of
corporations and think of businesses.

35
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,380
We kind of all categorize them together.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,730
Are you selling me something?

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,350
Oh well then you must be an asshole.

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:40,861
You know,

39
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:45,861
you must have this predatory mindset of
just trying to squeeze as much money out

40
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:46,764
of me as possible.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,990
That's not how Harvard deals with it.

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,860
Um,

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,180
and the way they do deal with it,

44
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,970
they just tried to give you a good
service and give it to you at a reasonable

45
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,730
price and include things a lot
of people make you pay for it.

46
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,840
Like who is privacy?

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,861
So,

48
00:01:58,861 --> 00:01:59,310
uh,

49
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,200
go and check him out because her awesome.

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Go to hover.com forward slash Rogen and
get yourself 10% off any of your domain

51
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:07,980
name registrations.

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,430
We are also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com and uh,

53
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,040
if you've listened to the show
over the past couple of months,

54
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:19,041
you've listened to about all the different
shit that Ana is added into its store

55
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,810
for a fitness including these,

56
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,170
uh,

57
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,640
steel clubs and steel maces
and kettlebells and a saw,

58
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,121
it appears.

59
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:27,850
Look,

60
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,840
looks like a soft chin up bar.

61
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,450
Decapitate the victims know that that
sits on your fucking the door and allows

62
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,460
you to do chin ups on the,

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:37,861
yeah,

64
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,440
it's easy to use it.

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,110
It latches like it,

66
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,260
it rests on your,

67
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:43,501
uh,

68
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,670
the top of your door.

69
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,960
So you can do chin ups in your house and
there's the rope to strangle yourself.

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,980
That's triangle on anybody.

71
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,683
You shouldn't do that.

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,860
I don't think people,

73
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,010
I bet most people that get busted or
die of auto erotic expatiation they were

74
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,160
really getting set up.

75
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,530
Somebody tried to set them up to make
them look as foolish as possible.

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:02,651
Oh,

77
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,940
look at him and his Dick in his hand.

78
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,580
I know a lot of girls that would like to
be choked the fuck when you're fucking

79
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:08,110
them.

80
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,890
That's true.

81
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,360
But I think that's sort of a weird
freaky domination thing as well.

82
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,260
I think,

83
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:14,650
uh,

84
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,780
the girls who want you to choke him there,

85
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,380
they also want you to fuck up my gear.

86
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,930
Some Mongol that just came over the top
of the hill and it hasn't seen a woman

87
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,764
in six months.

88
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
Those are crazy bitches.

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,610
Yeah.

90
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,450
But I don't know.

91
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,130
I've never jerked off in the Necktie,

92
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,980
like hanging off the headboard.

93
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,870
It might be awesome first.

94
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm not going to try with a battle rope.

95
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,350
It's definitely,

96
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,490
yeah,

97
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,323
that's too thick.

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,850
It's very rough to,

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,530
it wouldn't be nice for your skin,

100
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,160
you know,

101
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,800
then you have a collar shirt on
it and you'd be irritated all day.

102
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,151
My point is,

103
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:46,840
um,

104
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,860
all the stuff that we're selling,

105
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,190
one of the most important things that
I could ever tell you is if you want to

106
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,020
use any of this exercise equipment,

107
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,190
um,

108
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,770
get yourself a trainer and get someone,

109
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,620
I don't know how much they
cost 50 bucks or whatever.

110
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,550
Get somebody who understands kettlebells
and just not to take you through a

111
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,450
workout and necessarily,

112
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,510
but just teach you the correct
fundamentals of how to use the,

113
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,011
the,

114
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,360
the,

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,540
the weights properly,

116
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
how to lift without hurting yourself.

117
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,650
And you don't have to use a lot of weight.

118
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
One of the beautiful things about
kettlebells as you're going to get amazing

119
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,540
workout from a 35 pound kettle bell,

120
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,960
there's a video that we sell
called the extreme kettlebell DVD.

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,920
Um,

122
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,700
it's,

123
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,210
I use a 35 pound kettle bell for that
thing and he kicks my ass every time.

124
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,440
45 minutes in,

125
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,251
I'm ready to throw up.

126
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:30,730
I mean it's,

127
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,290
it's really hard to do.

128
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,310
It's really hard.

129
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,920
You got to have fucking to be
hard to use a 35 pound weight.

130
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:36,754
You Pussy.

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,010
Just trust me cause you're
using your whole body.

132
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,180
You'd be amazed at how much your own
body if you have to just moving your body

133
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:45,070
around doing body weight squats,

134
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,420
how difficult that is to do.

135
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,790
I do 200 bodyweight Hindus,

136
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,870
Hindus squats.

137
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,490
It's really hard to do when you,

138
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,750
by the time you get to 200,

139
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,760
you fucking legs are shaking and knock in,

140
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,740
you're barely getting
through those last 50.

141
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,820
Um,

142
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,210
it's,

143
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,043
it's not,

144
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,050
you don't necessarily have to always
lift heavy weights or do just the

145
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,760
traditional exercises that you've seen,

146
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,000
you know,

147
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,950
bench press and curls and stuff like that.

148
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,461
You know,

149
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:09,860
those,

150
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,020
they serve their purpose.

151
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,290
But the reality is if you want exercises
that help you in athletics or help you

152
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:17,590
with functional strength,

153
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,640
um,

154
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:18,841
the,

155
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:21,190
the best ones are the ones that
incorporate your whole body.

156
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,640
And so that's where the steel clubs come
in and steal naces and that's where the

157
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,600
like medicine balls and stuff like that,

158
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,220
there's a lot of different workouts.

159
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,570
If you're interested
in any of these things,

160
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,030
once you learn how to do
the technique properly,

161
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,110
there's a lot of different workouts that
you can get online on Youtube for free.

162
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,210
It's like super easy to find.

163
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,241
I have a question,

164
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:41,540
Joe.

165
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't have doctor laser.

166
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,330
Maybe could answer this or not,

167
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:45,160
but uh,

168
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,280
I'm not sure if he's real.

169
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,340
That's fine.

170
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,100
The spider that we showed yesterday,

171
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:50,480
but that was growing the horns.

172
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,840
It's actually a fungus virus from
the courthouse steps mushrooms,

173
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,680
which is one of the main
ingredients to shroom sport.

174
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,340
So

175
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,141
what's that all about?

176
00:05:59,141 --> 00:05:59,281
Like,

177
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:01,040
am I going to get us to have horns?

178
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,920
Cordyceps mushrooms is
also the mushroom that,

179
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:04,400
um,

180
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,640
it,

181
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,060
it,

182
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,920
it makes those ants zombies.

183
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,181
You know that,

184
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:08,620
uh,

185
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,220
you know that.

186
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,730
Yeah.

187
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,790
This is a crazy mushroom.

188
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,900
It's not any,

189
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,970
not only does it make the answers zombies,

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,700
but it also will be,

191
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,030
it will grow inside of the dead
ant take over the antibody,

192
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,320
grow inside the den.

193
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,110
And the other answer
recognize it's a threat.

194
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
So they take it out of town.

195
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,250
They literally take the ants body and
walk miles away from where their ant hill

196
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:31,790
is.

197
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,490
Because if they leave the ant there,

198
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,020
if the ant is sick with this mushroom,

199
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,040
if he's infected,

200
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,900
the amp will climb to the top of the,

201
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:40,820
the highest leaf.

202
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,654
It could fine.

203
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,340
And then it explodes.

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,460
And so this is how the army,

205
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:46,761
right?

206
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:47,970
This is how you control the army.

207
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:50,060
And he's just trying to get people
endurance when they're doing crossfit.

208
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,903
Sorry.

209
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,190
You do not have to worry about it.

210
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,410
This is a totally different part or
a strain of the quarter sub smasher,

211
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:56,970
right?

212
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,990
It doesn't have the Zombie properties.

213
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,010
Does it have hints of it?

214
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,540
Like a hint of mint?

215
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,710
It just a little kid,

216
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,643
a little assets,

217
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,060
essence of Zombie.

218
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,320
Could you imagine if the Zombie apocalypse

219
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,940
lips was all started by
a fitness supplement?

220
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,211
Well,

221
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:14,290
mushrooms are fucked up,

222
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:14,471
man.

223
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,071
When you think about it,

224
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:17,260
some of them get you high as fuck.

225
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,510
Some of them will kill you immediately.

226
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,940
Some of them will give you endurance.

227
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,640
Some of them are great
for your immune system.

228
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,190
You're turning into a dark day,

229
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,050
but you're controlling.

230
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,820
You're going to have a galactic army.

231
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,390
I think Darth Vader just use the forest,

232
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,850
so I don't think he
had mushrooms involved.

233
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,880
Intimidation that mushrooms,

234
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,310
you know,

235
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,230
Terence Mckenna believed that mushrooms
were an alien species for one good

236
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:41,950
reason.

237
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,820
The four Fox,

238
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,850
four [inaudible] and
dimethyltryptamine than this.

239
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:50,851
The scientific designation of it and it's
the only is the only plant with a four

240
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:57,721
and the phosphorous position and the
known on earth and he believed that it's

241
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,850
possible that spores
could survive in a vacuum.

242
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:01,684
We like pants.

243
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,321
Yeah,

244
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:03,154
that's definitely true.

245
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,570
If that's true,

246
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,950
it's real possible.

247
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:10,210
If panspermia is real and amino
acids and building blocks of life,

248
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:10,990
I've actually come here.

249
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,840
Even possibly living things
were spores from other planets.

250
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,170
Why wouldn't some of have
been magic mushrooms son?

251
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,143
Dude,

252
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,350
you would

253
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,200
check the genes for,

254
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,850
yeah.

255
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,620
Yeah.

256
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:21,980
Well,

257
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,410
well,

258
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:22,800
yeah.

259
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,633
Well that's why.

260
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,451
I mean,

261
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:26,970
how do we know though if
Panspermia we checked the jeans,

262
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,640
I mean if everything
comes from other planets,

263
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,200
all kinds of common shit or that random
coincidence that something that comes

264
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:39,120
from space is as related to us
as we are to like our plants.

265
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,103
Like that would be odd.

266
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,371
It would be,

267
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,930
unless life was pretty uniform.

268
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah,

269
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,633
that's true.

270
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,220
All over the galaxy.

271
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,290
There's like coincidental little
parts of the DNA and either way,

272
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:49,740
folks,

273
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,030
you don't have to worry about that.

274
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,020
We had honor and not trying to get you
to grow elk horns out of the end of your

275
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,043
spider legs

276
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,750
turned into Tron,

277
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,570
that guy super.

278
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,570
He's got a horns coming out of him.

279
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,700
I don't hate on superhuman dudes.

280
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
He's an extra man like neon light,

281
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,360
glowy radio.com you fucks use a code name,

282
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:13,060
Rogan and save 10% off
any and all supplements.

283
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,781
All right,

284
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:14,171
my pal,

285
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:15,190
J D is here.

286
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,360
We know this fucker a long time and uh,

287
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,270
we're fitting to get busy.

288
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,353
Hit The music prime.

289
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,513
Okay,

290
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,701
well,

291
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:26,534
good experience.

292
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,220
I met this young man

293
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,800
when he was a,

294
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,551
what do you,

295
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,140
what would you like 17
or something like that?

296
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:41,100
1717.

297
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,230
During the first Houston circle jerk of,

298
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,030
was that pre 2001?

299
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,790
Was that precepting oh two or something?

300
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,400
Was it the Houston circle jerk was out to,

301
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,193
um,

302
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,011
he was,

303
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:53,300
uh,

304
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,430
you were like 17 back then
and a high school student.

305
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,860
Right now you're like an actual physicist.

306
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,730
And uh,

307
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,230
his name on my message board,

308
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,064
it's WIC.

309
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,971
And this is,

310
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:03,750
this sounds like the,

311
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,090
the dorkiest beginning of a podcast ever.

312
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:06,961
But,

313
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:07,794
um,

314
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,750
my message boards is a very strange place.

315
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:14,490
It's a very odd community and I've tried
to keep it as positive and healthy as

316
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:15,031
possible,

317
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,120
but there's always going to be a certain
amount of constant creeps and there's

318
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:20,940
always going to be a certain amount of
obsessed people and there's always going

319
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,350
to be a certain amount of Weirdos.

320
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,840
But there's also a lot
of cool people there too.

321
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,291
It's a,

322
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,291
an interesting place and a place where
some pretty intense stuff gets discussed

323
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,790
by some really intelligent people.

324
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,710
Definitely.

325
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,090
I learned so much,

326
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,830
especially in my early years of like being
on the board and like 2001 when there

327
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:41,690
was barely anybody on
the internet already,

328
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:44,420
but they had all these
smart people on your board,

329
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,860
like twice my age,

330
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,410
having conversations about shit
that I had never heard in my life.

331
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,321
Yeah.

332
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:51,090
And I don't know how it happened either.

333
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,400
So the way it happened is very strange.

334
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,190
It's like that message board
almost like wanted to be born.

335
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,110
I don't even remember how I got on it.

336
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,770
Well,

337
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,260
I don't remember how I got out.

338
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,980
I had a free [inaudible]
easy board before that.

339
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,870
Like there was a whole
board before the board,

340
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:07,890
you were on the easy board,

341
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:08,280
right?

342
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,850
Briefly,

343
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,620
like rally a couple of weeks or something.

344
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:11,070
It was,

345
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,270
it was just html,

346
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,710
basic comments,

347
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:14,450
thread shit.

348
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:14,661
Yeah,

349
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:15,060
it was sue.

350
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,440
I wouldn't,

351
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,621
yeah,

352
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,150
I would need to go back
and find that thing.

353
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:22,151
But then it went to this like a different
format where it sort of just got

354
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,470
spread around and I
don't know what happened.

355
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,363
It just,

356
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,170
all these strange,

357
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,290
odd people just started showing up like
Voodoo chicken who's been on forever.

358
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:34,560
It was like,

359
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,020
yeah,

360
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,070
he was a big inspiration
in my early years.

361
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,150
And he's a good friend now.

362
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:38,511
I mean,

363
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:38,840
uh,

364
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,510
I hang out with them every
time I go to Seattle and moot.

365
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:41,960
And,

366
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,550
uh,

367
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,980
you know,

368
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,370
so many of these other people that we've
met off the angry Amadeus and all these

369
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,930
different folks that
we've met from the board.

370
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,561
And,

371
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:49,070
uh,

372
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,521
it just,

373
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:49,791
it's,

374
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,121
it's,

375
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:50,954
uh,

376
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,371
it's,

377
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,204
uh,

378
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,431
I know,

379
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:53,790
you know,

380
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,050
when I,

381
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,420
when I say I don't know how it started,

382
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:56,254
I really don't.

383
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,790
And even though it's my board,

384
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:57,971
you know,

385
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:58,990
it has my name on it,

386
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,080
I keep it up and everything like that.

387
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,870
I guess I'm sorta responsible
somewhat to the tone,

388
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,360
the guiding force.

389
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,870
Like I don't know if you like before you,

390
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,020
you instituted the porn role where you
had to postpone within 10 posts or you

391
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:15,254
were the band.

392
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,290
I don't think like it was already in a,

393
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,203
uh,

394
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,890
an agreed upon.

395
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,420
Yeah.

396
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,700
Yeah.

397
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,120
People would just get shit
that was crescent wrenches.

398
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,320
I believe it was his idea.

399
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:26,681
I can't,

400
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:27,370
you know,

401
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,680
we're,

402
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,000
we're talking about a message
board that was started in 1998.

403
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,710
That's when my message board was started.

404
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,573
Before Facebook,

405
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,640
before Google for everything
before I can go for my space.

406
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:37,571
Yeah.

407
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,590
It was before all that shit.

408
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,873
And um,

409
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,923
when did,

410
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,823
when it was started,

411
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,580
we would get all these annoying people
and then everyone was assuming everyone

412
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,650
was sure that fear factor
was going to kill it.

413
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,030
This is going to be the 10th of the board.

414
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,560
His board is going to suck now.

415
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,140
But that's when we
instituted the porn rule.

416
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,520
It was like right around then.

417
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,050
It was like right around
the fear of failure.

418
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:56,770
We're scared of him.

419
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,580
We were scared of the wave of incoming
fear factor fans and the porn rule was

420
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,810
you had to prove that you weren't
a tight ass by by putting porn,

421
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,630
some kind of porn during your first
10 to be deemed acceptable too.

422
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,050
It's not just like a tiny
little thumbnail of some chicks,

423
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:11,500
tits.

424
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,771
No.

425
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,950
So dudes would completely
overdo it where their first,

426
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:19,951
this is my first offering and it would
just be Jeff Cox and miles and common

427
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,470
phases and fucking gang bangs and then
embed videos and then people would just

428
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:26,081
go,

429
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:26,920
well done sir.

430
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:27,680
Well done.

431
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,850
Welcome aboard.

432
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,290
You know,

433
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,490
one day I went and I looked at my board
and it was just the most ridiculous

434
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:36,520
fucking resource of porn on
the Internet and I'm like,

435
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:37,450
what happened here?

436
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,280
And a lot of people like it worked.

437
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:44,050
They weren't allowed at work to use my
board because you would open a thread and

438
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,090
just randomly there'd be Cox.

439
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,020
Any thread could be the least appropriate.

440
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,940
It would be to put point in that thread.

441
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:54,580
The more likely it would be that there
would be pointing pointed that thread and

442
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:55,450
still is.

443
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,390
I mean at any point in
time you go to that board,

444
00:13:58,391 --> 00:13:59,201
you open a thread,

445
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,870
someone's talking to cock
and no one takes that out.

446
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,630
And you know if my manager
found out about that,

447
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,180
if they actually went in
there and started like going,

448
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,510
do you know that there was pornography
all throughout your message board?

449
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:11,011
The Tom,

450
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:11,390
Tom,

451
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,223
Tom,

452
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,060
he would,

453
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,590
he would get all Joe Friday on me.

454
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,290
I remember one of my favorite points that,

455
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,790
I mean before video,

456
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,540
so it was just like pictures and a lot
of gay porn cause it's hilarious straight

457
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,860
people and it was one,

458
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:28,660
it was just a a black dude with like a
really small Coty and it was just coated

459
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:29,494
in calm.

460
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,430
It was just a little come
sash and that just for months.

461
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,090
That might've been my favorite
thing to just see similar posts.

462
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,930
The Internet to me will always be
represented by that one photo of that guy

463
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,810
spreading his asshole
apart with his fingers.

464
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,160
But not him.

465
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,880
It's a different,

466
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,050
it's like a similar,

467
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,090
it might not be gutsy,

468
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,790
but it's a,

469
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,790
it's a guy doing that and they Photoshop
the kid's face and the kid's like,

470
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,050
eyes are open and his
mouth is always like,

471
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:57,884
what the fuck?

472
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
And right underneath that it says,

473
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,470
welcome to the Internet.

474
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,090
That will always be the internet.

475
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:05,361
To me,

476
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,260
when I think of the Internet,

477
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,094
I think of that,

478
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,650
this fucking the Internet.

479
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:11,540
I think of the worst things in the world.

480
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,171
Goatee or,

481
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,250
or Dick Nipples,

482
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,330
shedding technicals.

483
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:14,810
Well,

484
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,940
we don't even realize that when,

485
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,540
well I guess you don't realize it because
you sort of grew up with the Internet,

486
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,740
but when I was a kid,

487
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,460
you'd never got to see any of the
things that people are so conditioned to

488
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,230
seeing today as far as like dead people.

489
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:30,830
And I mean,

490
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,690
I remember when faces of death came out,

491
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,070
it was the craziest set.

492
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,740
A friend that had a v Vcrs,

493
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,690
VHS tape,

494
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,210
right?

495
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,481
Whatever.

496
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,000
There's a called the looking
at a dead person was like,

497
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,751
oh my God,

498
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:43,070
it's a dead body.

499
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,320
Like they're showing
dead bodies on a video.

500
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,470
By the time you're 16 in America,

501
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,080
how many fucking dead bodies
have you seen on the Internet?

502
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,790
How many people sent you fucked up
images of gory things that have happened?

503
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,030
Car accidents and wolf
attacks and you know,

504
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:00,290
thought fuck man.

505
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,050
On just like,

506
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,521
right.

507
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,610
Like I got on the Internet when I was 13,

508
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,080
so like 98.

509
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,790
So like I,

510
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,190
and I was in Kansas or I lived in Kansas.

511
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,170
So like we're a little
behind the times anyway.

512
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,200
Do you remember that first video of that?

513
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,034
Um,

514
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,610
the reporter was the reporter or a
journalist that was killed during the

515
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,360
beginning of the Iraq war.

516
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,000
Daniel something or another.

517
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,390
But they cut his head off with a knife

518
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,770
and they showed his head like they
held his head up and you're like,

519
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:34,850
Whoa,

520
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,890
Holy Shit.

521
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,800
Want to spread the fuck all over the,

522
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,440
yeah.

523
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,273
That might've been the first,

524
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,690
the first be heading on the Internet.

525
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,583
I think it,

526
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,580
well,

527
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,150
I don't think it was just
the biggest headache.

528
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,790
There was the biggest cause it was a,

529
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,200
you know,

530
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,630
it was a big deal that this guy was an
American who was kidnapped and murdered.

531
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,040
But the,

532
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,420
the photo,

533
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,900
um,

534
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,171
there was,

535
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:57,760
or there was a video rather a shorter
video that was on an Internet of a

536
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,663
Russian,

537
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,390
uh,

538
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,940
soldiers stabbing a guy in the neck,

539
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,670
like holding the guy down with his
boot and stabbing them in the neck.

540
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,620
And that was the first
one that I had ever seen.

541
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,870
But by now those,

542
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:09,261
there's this,

543
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,580
how many of those are out there?

544
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,660
How many of those a Mexican drug
lord ones are there with chainsaws?

545
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,061
Shit.

546
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:16,600
Now though,

547
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,241
like nowadays,

548
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:20,510
like I had like a few years where I
just saw every horrible thing that could

549
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:21,470
happen and now I just,

550
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,130
it like,

551
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,341
you know,

552
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,240
it fucks you up a little bit.

553
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,230
It definitely does.

554
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,280
Do you feel like that's
like how like you're,

555
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,201
you know,

556
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:27,531
in,

557
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:31,880
in Holland where pot is everywhere
and hookers are everywhere,

558
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,640
they have the lowest levels of aids,

559
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
infection or HIV infection
in all of Europe.

560
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,880
They also have the lowest
numbers of heroin addiction.

561
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,260
And I think,

562
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,191
you know,

563
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:46,130
when we had boss root non from Holland
he was talking about like they don't have

564
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,710
a drinking age like you,

565
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,390
like it'd be 12 and have a beer
and that because of that we,

566
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,621
you know,

567
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:55,230
we're weird if you tell us we're
not supposed to do something,

568
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:58,170
we want to do it in really
indulgent as a culture,

569
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,330
as over cheese.

570
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,820
But as a species I think the human animal
when you tell us not to do something

571
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,773
like fuck you.

572
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,110
I mean that's how it is with kids.

573
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,160
I mean I you see it so clearly
with children when you're
raising a little babies

574
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:12,510
and you see them from the get go,

575
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:13,680
like from the womb boom,

576
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:13,861
boom.

577
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,510
When you see like cause
and effect with them.

578
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,350
It's so fascinating that we are hardwired
to not want to do what other people

579
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:20,184
tell us to do.

580
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,790
So as soon as someone comes
along and says don't drink,

581
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,660
don't smoke,

582
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:25,261
don't do this,

583
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:25,900
don't do that.

584
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,060
Those are the things you want to do.

585
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,570
And because of the fact that you
never had anybody telling you,

586
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:30,961
hey,

587
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,260
don't watch beheadings online because
your parents probably had no idea the

588
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,160
headings online.

589
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,480
If you were a normal person in the 1990s
and you were out there working a job,

590
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,940
you know you didn't have time to
come home and watch beheadings,

591
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,781
you know you didn't,

592
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:45,910
you didn't know what the fuck your kid
was doing on style project dot Carr to

593
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:47,370
find hard to find some time.

594
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,810
But you're a good example of a guy who
grew up during the part of the Internet.

595
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:56,280
Like you can't the first wave before
anybody understood what was happening,

596
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,061
you know,

597
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,410
and now everybody's like,

598
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:02,280
they're trying to lock it down and price
regulation and tried to figure things

599
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,920
out and just like authority figures
didn't know where we're going on.

600
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,731
Nobody didn't know.

601
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:06,840
But like it was still,

602
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,000
it was still something nerds did.

603
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,240
It was going on the Internet,

604
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,930
but you got an email
address like why I but and,

605
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,120
and if you had a website back then,

606
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:15,690
if you,

607
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,860
if you did anything,

608
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:21,000
like if anything got like viral in
any sort of a way in a bunch of people

609
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:21,834
downloaded it,

610
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,140
you would be crushed with a bill that
would fucking bankrupt your whole family.

611
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,060
Yeah,

612
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,750
I would,

613
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,470
I would put out like one
blog and someone would read,

614
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,790
would,

615
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,151
you know,

616
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,930
we're re posted somewhere on some famous
website and then all of a sudden your

617
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,270
bandwidth costs would be fucking insane.

618
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,790
Like thousands and thousands
of dollars a month,

619
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,040
hundreds of megs
downloaded from their site.

620
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,450
What's wrong with hundreds of megs?

621
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,870
Could you see that fit photo that someone
had on Twitter the other day of the

622
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,600
thing being loaded onto it?

623
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,050
You knew it was funny
about the message board.

624
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,741
Like you said,

625
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:59,580
the rules that you used to have where
you had to post 10 photos before you post

626
00:19:59,581 --> 00:19:59,701
it,

627
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:00,441
but also the,

628
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:00,580
the,

629
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:00,790
the,

630
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,170
there was a website that everyone passed
around called black people loves us.

631
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,443
So whenever,

632
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,450
whenever somebody posted something
that everyone has already seen or it's

633
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,590
already been posted before,

634
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,551
everyone would just be like,

635
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:15,490
black people loves you or black people
loves pie or whatever the thing is,

636
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,711
it would be black.

637
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:19,160
You bill loves us and then it became BP.

638
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,830
Yeah.

639
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,161
Yeah.

640
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:20,960
It got so,

641
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,630
so stay so natural for us because
the black people loves us.

642
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,460
Website was so silly.

643
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,380
It was just a bunch of
white people that were,

644
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,243
you know,

645
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,360
photos of black people looking
ridiculously uncomfortable
and it hasn't been

646
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,660
updated since it was made
maybe 2003 or something like,

647
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,840
well we price obviously
bringing it up a parody site.

648
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:39,961
Yeah,

649
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,651
it's going down.

650
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:41,484
Right.

651
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,443
For sure.

652
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,770
But that become,

653
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,210
it became a,

654
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,950
an infraction on our message.

655
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,131
If you,

656
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:48,940
uh,

657
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,500
if you post something too many times
when it's already obviously old,

658
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,790
it becomes black peopled.

659
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,853
Yeah.

660
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,940
It seems so racist,

661
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:02,050
but it's not at all unless you let her
side of a black person once hosting.

662
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,220
It's not what it is.

663
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:03,511
If you,

664
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:03,911
you need,

665
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:04,550
it's a website.

666
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,060
It's in reference to a website.

667
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,450
It's not in reference to black people.

668
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,530
It's,

669
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,363
this is the day,

670
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,071
you know,

671
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:10,904
it's uh,

672
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,400
I feel like the,

673
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,590
one of the weird things that's
happened because of the Internet,

674
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,620
I feel like people are more sensitive
than ever and more quick to be outraged

675
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:21,094
than ever.

676
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,750
It seems like even though there's so
much crazy shit that you could say at any

677
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,261
point in time,

678
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:27,670
and it should give us a,

679
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,220
a sort of a broader perspective on things.

680
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,140
I feel like people are more easily outrage
or at least they'll see it as a green

681
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,090
light to plot out.

682
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,350
It's like you can be proud of,

683
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,390
of identifying victim hood.

684
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:40,871
Yes.

685
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,250
Like you don't even have to be the victim.

686
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,970
You can just,

687
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,803
you can just,

688
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,830
yeah.

689
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,880
You're going to hurt somebody's feelings.

690
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,151
Yeah.

691
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,590
You have clout from that.

692
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:47,741
Oh,

693
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,090
this is the transgender thing.

694
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,040
He's we bringing that up.

695
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,470
All right.

696
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,770
This is the second biggest story on TMZ,

697
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:53,981
right?

698
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:54,221
Yeah.

699
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,120
People are upset.

700
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,811
Well,

701
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,980
96% of the people on
fucking TMZ agree with me.

702
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,310
I typed him.

703
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,791
Great Point.

704
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,670
I've never seen that far of a sweat.

705
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,533
Usually.

706
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,720
Usually it's like 42% versus you know,

707
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:11,320
7% are regarding video
contains explicit language.

708
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,590
While the video was me and
David Lee Roth actually getting,

709
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,473
talking about,

710
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,811
don't,

711
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,561
don't click on it.

712
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:18,394
We don't need to.

713
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,110
I'll explain exactly what I said.

714
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,380
I'm fully in favor of someone
being a transgender person.

715
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,950
I feel like you should be able to do
whatever you want to do with your body.

716
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm covered in tattoos.

717
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:28,940
Who,

718
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,590
what?

719
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,921
You know,

720
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,100
maybe for some people that might be more
horrific than chopping your dick off.

721
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,860
You know,

722
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,390
I don't know.

723
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,110
I wouldn't,

724
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,190
I wouldn't want you to do anything
you don't want to do and a,

725
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,660
I wouldn't want to stop you from
doing something you truly want to do.

726
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,040
I don't know how your mind works.

727
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,330
I Dunno how your body works.

728
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,790
I don't know what's in your soul.

729
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,740
I don't know if you,

730
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,100
you,

731
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,160
you know you have all
whatever makes you happy.

732
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:49,994
It's what I'm trying to say.

733
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,320
My issue is the mechanical advantage that
a female has over a man and people are

734
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:55,661
saying,

735
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:58,540
do research out of a
transgender woman or yeah,

736
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,890
male rather has over a few wall.

737
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,520
Um,

738
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,350
the mechanical advantage
of male has over a female.

739
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,900
The people are like
tweeting means saying like,

740
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:05,950
do some research.

741
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,130
It's been proven that when a woman takes
hormones or bone density decreases and

742
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,970
decreases,

743
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,500
doesn't even out.

744
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,520
It just doesn't,

745
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,390
that's nonsense.

746
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,493
See that?

747
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,210
That's not a woman's hand.

748
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,290
Okay,

749
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:20,800
that's,

750
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,260
that's way too big to be a woman's hand.

751
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,060
And if I chop my dick off,

752
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,050
I would still have that.

753
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,200
And that's a big one.

754
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,550
The Tan,

755
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,383
very easily

756
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,330
mechanical advantages and
the width of the shoulders,

757
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:34,781
the,

758
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,010
that doesn't go away.

759
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,000
There's mechanical advantages in the
strength of the jaw that the way it's

760
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,361
built,

761
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,680
you can absorb more punches.

762
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,240
There's even 135 pound
woman who's in really fit,

763
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:47,931
strong,

764
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:48,950
like healthy shape.

765
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,820
She's not as strong as 135
pound man who's in fit,

766
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:53,181
strong,

767
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,014
healthy shape.

768
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,100
We're just built different.

769
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,841
The,

770
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:59,900
the advantages will diminish
someone with hormone treatment.

771
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,940
And,

772
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,750
uh,

773
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,650
a man who goes through the transgender
operation will certainly become more like

774
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,460
a woman.

775
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,330
But at the end of the day,

776
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:08,841
he has an x,

777
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,460
y chromosome that,

778
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,390
and that's reality.

779
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,560
It's not double x.

780
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,281
That's not a woman.

781
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:14,114
That's a man.

782
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,400
And if you're happier that way,

783
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
Dan is fine.

784
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:18,950
If you're a transgender though,

785
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,240
you're not a male.

786
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,510
I don't that it's
driving me fucking crazy.

787
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:28,511
The idea that you're hurting people's
feelings by saying the exact correct

788
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,800
scientific distinct term
for what the fuck they are,

789
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,250
which I don't think you're hurting a
lot of transient transgendered people's

790
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,150
feelings directly.

791
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:38,570
I'm sure.

792
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,770
Cause they're mad at me on Twitter.

793
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,880
People are calling me a pig there.

794
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,910
Call me and asymptotically
transgendered people specifically.

795
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:47,300
And specifically because I
said that it's not a woman.

796
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,700
They're like a transgender
woman is a woman.

797
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:49,971
No,

798
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,120
you want to feel like you're a woman
and that's all good in the hood.

799
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,440
But that's bullshit.

800
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,940
That's like,

801
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,773
it's just where

802
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,111
it's just like we're,

803
00:24:58,111 --> 00:24:58,850
we're,

804
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,210
we're behind the times where like
we get to make new kinds of people.

805
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:02,361
Like,

806
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:05,090
I think it's awesome that we
can have any kind of that what,

807
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,590
this is so crude,

808
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:07,311
it's something new.

809
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:08,090
It's not,

810
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,890
not that they shouldn't
be called women heard,

811
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,361
right.

812
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:11,150
It's like new.

813
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,200
It is going to take the whole culture a
little getting used to and I feel like

814
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,180
it's just the beginning and one day we'll
look back on this and mock it the way

815
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:22,910
we look at horrible operations
that they used to do.

816
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,790
Remember when they used to do hair
plugs where they have like doll hair,

817
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,860
a circular,

818
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,750
they would take a circular plug.

819
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,030
I have a friend who has
them all over his head.

820
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:32,600
It's,

821
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,871
it's,

822
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:33,171
you know,

823
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:37,360
it's very unfortunate because it
grows like 30 hairs in one tweet.

824
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,470
Just patch.

825
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,410
Even like weeds,

826
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:41,270
like a bamboo forest.

827
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,130
It doesn't make any sense.

828
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,640
Can you get it taken out or anything?

829
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,230
Yeah,

830
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,620
he could.

831
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,310
That's the only way.

832
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,360
That's the only thing you can do.

833
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,650
You can actually get the,

834
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,521
the thing taken out,

835
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,770
but my point is that's
an ancient operation.

836
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:52,800
They don't do it that way now.

837
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,080
Really?

838
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,940
That's like really old.

839
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,043
You know?

840
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,910
It's really old,

841
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,020
but that's how we're going to look at
transgender operations in the future.

842
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,380
There's not gonna be like a
physical change with a scalpel.

843
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,300
They're going to be able
to change your genetically.

844
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:07,460
They're going to be able to
actually make you a woman.

845
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,690
You will actually put that,

846
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,591
and by the way,

847
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,970
you might be able to try it out and say,

848
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:11,451
you know what?

849
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:12,021
This sucks.

850
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:12,950
Can I get my Dick back?

851
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,821
Boom.

852
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,440
And they turned you back into a man again.

853
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:15,840
I mean,

854
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,020
I think for the most part we like there.

855
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,340
There's clearly neurological differences
and somebody that thinks they're a

856
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,450
woman like that,

857
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,250
it's more similar to a woman.

858
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,700
I don't think you can generalize
because I don't think it's uniform.

859
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,850
I don't think one
person's feeling of that.

860
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,550
I feel like I'm a woman is
the same as another person's.

861
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,500
I just don't think how that,

862
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,780
I don't see how that can be possible.

863
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:36,820
This is a fucking green light,

864
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:39,200
green light time to cut off my dick.

865
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,681
You know?

866
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,514
It's like,

867
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,480
you know,

868
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,691
well,

869
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:42,890
we've looked at your brain.

870
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:44,050
The green light switch is

871
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,883
off.

872
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,140
We doubt your intentions.

873
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,283
What nightclub?

874
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,800
They take this photo I when you too.

875
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:51,461
Or is this way?

876
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:51,760
Whoa.

877
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,593
We were dancing.

878
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,820
You know I don't mind
dancing with trainees.

879
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,480
That's actually Photoshop.

880
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,563
That's not,

881
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,653
that's real.

882
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,620
We were right there together.

883
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,380
They were dancing.

884
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,320
Just getting down.

885
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,450
Look at her dancing hands.

886
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,880
That's the Shittier Photoshop and the
one with Lee Harvey Oswald holding a gun.

887
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,850
Like tone your face or at least match it.

888
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,100
Yeah.

889
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,300
No,

890
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,730
they didn't want to
make it look realistic.

891
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,560
People halfass a Photoshop like clearly
you can mount up sale chair on that

892
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,394
layer.

893
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,130
This is tmz.com this is a real website.

894
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,273
People go here.

895
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,760
Shitty this photo real website.

896
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,960
Here's the biggest

897
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,630
issue with this whole training thing.

898
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,160
That woman,

899
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,160
whatever you want to call her.

900
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:35,740
A transgender woman fought three women
without letting them know she used to be

901
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,660
a man and beat the fuck out of them.

902
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,050
Knock them all out brutally quickly
and cause damage to their brain.

903
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,350
Jesus.

904
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,860
Yeah.

905
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,693
That's a man.

906
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,020
A man beat the fuck out of some
women has present anything to it yet.

907
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,893
No.

908
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,431
You know what,

909
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:51,820
man,

910
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,540
look if there's any confusion about
me in the gay community whatsoever.

911
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,700
It's because of things I've said,

912
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,320
but it's,

913
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,700
I can see how they would be confused.

914
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,230
It's also how I look.

915
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,150
It's also what I do

916
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,681
do.

917
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:05,981
I'm a,

918
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:07,600
I'm a not just a standup comedian,

919
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,050
which are,

920
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,420
we were always known
for being rude cause we,

921
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,740
that's part of what's the art of
standup comedy is saying Rude Shit.

922
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:17,470
Sometimes I enjoy people
that say root shit.

923
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:19,210
I think it's funny and it's an art form.

924
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,140
Just like,

925
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,660
I like Johnny Cash singing
about shooting men in Reno,

926
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,760
but I don't think he really
did shoot a man in Reno.

927
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,310
Okay.

928
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,350
Robert Johnson singing,

929
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,690
chasing is women around with a gun cause
she's got a smaller gun then he does.

930
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,160
He might have actually done that though.

931
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,080
Robert Johnson was living the life.

932
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,923
It's still good for him.

933
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,420
But my point is,

934
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,453
uh,

935
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,363
and you know,

936
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
their connection to the
cage fighting and all that,

937
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:43,440
but I am absolutely 100%
not homophobic at all.

938
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,730
I have gay friends,

939
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,050
I have lesbian friends.

940
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:46,880
I do not.

941
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
Speaking of the board,

942
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:50,190
do you remember that time
when you and Crypto or you,

943
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,500
you painted your,

944
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,570
your fingernail for one of
the members of the board?

945
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,340
[inaudible] yeah.

946
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,200
Then you guys had a
little fake kissy photo.

947
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,161
If that's true,

948
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:58,390
Joe,

949
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,060
then why did you,

950
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,930
where's my painting?

951
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:00,201
My words,

952
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,080
my gay drawing.

953
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,120
I took that down.

954
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:02,954
It was offensive.

955
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,501
Got bored with it.

956
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:08,220
Man.

957
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,810
It's hard to look at behind me.

958
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,250
Cartoon of Cock behind you.

959
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,010
I don't care what anybody does.

960
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:14,820
I really don't.

961
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,653
I'm not,

962
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,630
I'm not a homophobic person at all.

963
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,051
You know?

964
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,520
And that's what something that homophobic.

965
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,750
So I always say every racist,

966
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,561
I'm not racist.

967
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:23,394
I have a black friend,

968
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,521
but I,

969
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:25,260
I really,

970
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,400
I grew up in San Francisco from the
age seven to 11 and I grew up in a gay

971
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:33,930
neighborhood and my next door neighbors
were gay and they used to get naked with

972
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,480
my aunt and smoke pot and play the bow,

973
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,740
the Bongo drums together.

974
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,560
It was so weird,

975
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,873
was like

976
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,673
weird at the time.

977
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,310
Like you're like,

978
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,190
this isn't what people use

979
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,151
get naked.

980
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,530
They didn't show me the Kochs or anything.

981
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,610
My,

982
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,920
my aunt didn't show me
her naked body either,

983
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:51,820
but they let,

984
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,170
she let me know what they did.

985
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,450
Like she thought it was
awesome because she was like,

986
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:58,750
at the time she was probably like 18,

987
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,291
something like that.

988
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:02,410
She was pretty young and when
she was staying with us and um,

989
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,800
you know,

990
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,160
she would go next door and smoke weed
with the gay guys and play Bongos.

991
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:06,700
I just thought,

992
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,533
what the fuck.

993
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,630
So like my whole introduction to gay
people came really early and it was in San

994
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,540
Francisco where it was really accepted.

995
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,190
San Francisco was a great place for me
to grow up when I was a small boy between

996
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,270
like seven and 11.

997
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:22,380
Well,

998
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,040
it was a pretty sweet
time from San Francisco.

999
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,090
Yeah,

1000
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,130
it was post Vietnam war,

1001
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,430
you know,

1002
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,590
everybody had sort of
relaxed a little bit and,

1003
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,980
but the gang thing and the racism thing,

1004
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,700
San Francisco is remarkably
unraced remarkably.

1005
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,030
And I didn't realize it myself
until I moved to Florida.

1006
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:41,080
When I moved to Florida.

1007
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,920
Um,

1008
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,690
I was in school and I asked,

1009
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:46,030
I had came home to ask
my mom what a nigger met.

1010
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:46,960
Oh Shit.

1011
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,231
Yeah,

1012
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:47,621
I didn't,

1013
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:48,401
and she was mad at me.

1014
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:48,641
She's like,

1015
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,241
you know what it means?

1016
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:49,481
I'm like,

1017
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,500
I don't know what it means.

1018
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,334
What does it mean?

1019
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,500
And she said it's a derogatory term for
a black person and I want what I was

1020
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:56,711
like,

1021
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:57,460
wow.

1022
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,290
Cause a bunch of kids in my class,

1023
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,630
we're calling somebody that
I didn't know what it meant.

1024
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:03,130
So I had to go home and ask my mother.

1025
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,470
It's because between seven and 11,

1026
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,640
when I lived in San Francisco,

1027
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,660
I didn't hear that.

1028
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,400
I didn't hear it in school.

1029
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,700
I was in a normal public
school mixed with black kids,

1030
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:13,301
white kids,

1031
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,134
Asian kids.

1032
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,240
I never heard that word.

1033
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:16,591
See,

1034
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:17,880
I kind of headed different,

1035
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,520
I just grew up around a lot
of really nice white people.

1036
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,870
So it just didn't come up.

1037
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:22,440
Like I,

1038
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,230
there were a couple of
black kids in my school and,

1039
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,093
but I didn't,

1040
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,690
I didn't really like pick up on that,

1041
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,310
that they were different or anything.

1042
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,820
But it wasn't until I was like 10 or 11
that I realized that the reason there

1043
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:33,450
would be Annie,

1044
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,330
any animosity between white and
black people was because of slavery,

1045
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,830
because that when I was a kid,

1046
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:38,400
I was just like,

1047
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,233
Oh,

1048
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,020
Europeans took Africans to America to be,

1049
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,230
to make them slaves and it like the
black white thing didn't occur to me.

1050
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:49,650
I just knew Africans were brought over
here and it didn't realize that they

1051
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:49,931
came,

1052
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:51,390
like I knew they were darker or whatever,

1053
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:54,480
but it hadn't occurred to me that
like that was a racial thing.

1054
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,171
It was just like,

1055
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:55,321
oh,

1056
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,850
Africans were enslaved.

1057
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,410
Not necessarily black people

1058
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,390
where,

1059
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,141
where did you grow up?

1060
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:01,160
You grew up in Kentucky,

1061
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,641
Kansas,

1062
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:02,180
Kansas.

1063
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,651
You might as well,

1064
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:03,131
we can talk.

1065
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,700
It's like,

1066
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,170
Whoa,

1067
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:04,400
what?

1068
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,770
What's all those flatter?

1069
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,430
It was realizes that I would never go.

1070
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,293
It's really nice.

1071
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,440
Kansas is really nice.

1072
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,520
They're very polite people.

1073
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,900
They're very polite people,

1074
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,580
but not a lot of shit goes on,

1075
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:13,880
right?

1076
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,210
No,

1077
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,043
nothing that I know of.

1078
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,780
Barbecue Barbecue's great
barbecue and drinking,

1079
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:18,590
right?

1080
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,850
Occasional mechanical bowl.

1081
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:21,581
Yeah.

1082
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:22,140
About that.

1083
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,351
I mean,

1084
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:22,591
you know,

1085
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:23,220
it was,

1086
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,080
it was the first free state or that was,

1087
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,610
that chose to be a free state.

1088
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,031
Really.

1089
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:28,230
Kansas was when,

1090
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:32,460
when states started getting the choice
between being a slave or free state.

1091
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:32,800
But

1092
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,870
would you ever go back there?

1093
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,020
What if the Zombie apocalypse happened?

1094
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,000
Then you had a fucking farm
where he could hold out.

1095
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,893
It'd be pretty good.

1096
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,611
I mean,

1097
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:41,480
it's super flat.

1098
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,703
Chris Hilton.

1099
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,983
No.

1100
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,933
What does it say?

1101
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,773
Condos?

1102
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,580
Do you sell condos?

1103
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:49,731
Do you,

1104
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,361
what does it say?

1105
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:51,194
I just kidding it.

1106
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,873
Does that,

1107
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,500
is that like comes supposedly on my face.

1108
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,401
Paris Hilton.

1109
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:00,050
Does he like just puts a couple of drops?

1110
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,060
I Dunno.

1111
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,130
I like for his help.

1112
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,620
I hope it doesn't get mad at me for this.

1113
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I hope nobody gets mad at me for this
cause I'm not telling anybody what to do

1114
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:09,110
other than men shouldn't
be able to beat women up.

1115
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,740
You're the best producer ever,

1116
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,290
Brian.

1117
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,500
It's probably as good as it gets.

1118
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,620
I haven't looked around for that reason.

1119
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,723
He's a gem.

1120
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,520
Um,

1121
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,540
so anyway,

1122
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,420
that was just me explaining
my position on gay people.

1123
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,253
I don't give a fuck.

1124
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,220
I want everybody to be happy and um,

1125
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,780
this has nothing to do with that.

1126
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:34,100
To me it has to do with the mechanical
advantages of being in a male frame.

1127
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,350
And if you want to
consider yourself a woman,

1128
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,213
that's cool.

1129
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,180
I think someday we're going
to be able to fix anything.

1130
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,710
I think if you lose your leg,

1131
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,820
they'll be able to grow your new one.

1132
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,810
If you decide to be a woman,

1133
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:45,644
they'll be able to do that.

1134
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,390
If you look at what we can do now,

1135
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,070
we're printing off skull parts,

1136
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,540
hearts and livers and shit.

1137
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,620
Crazy.

1138
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,990
Really creating human bladders,

1139
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,720
you know that that can be
surgically implanted in people.

1140
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,980
There's a lot of nutty,

1141
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:00,770
nutty shit that's going on and it's really
going to start wrecking shop on what

1142
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,670
it means to be a person.

1143
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,390
Well,

1144
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:02,661
you know,

1145
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:03,494
someone said,

1146
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,910
could you ever see what,

1147
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:06,530
what's going to go on in a year from now?

1148
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:07,551
Well,

1149
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:07,880
no,

1150
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,840
not really anymore.

1151
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,471
It used to be,

1152
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,220
yeah,

1153
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,020
it used to be like in 1978
the most between 1978 1979.

1154
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:15,854
What's going to happen was,

1155
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,100
you know,

1156
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,770
maybe someone would
come up with a new car,

1157
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,500
you know,

1158
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,010
there might be a fucking better
eight track that was invented.

1159
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:22,550
I mean that was,

1160
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,710
it wasn't a lot of crazy shit going on,

1161
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,040
but every day there's some new insane
invention or discovery or proclamation

1162
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,390
that makes you go,

1163
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:34,730
what the fuck is going to
happen a year from now?

1164
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,750
All these different like fields have
been like merging together and computer

1165
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:42,260
scientists contributing to
neuroscience and everything else.

1166
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:45,410
Everybody's helping each other and they've
all been developing like really well

1167
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:46,310
as their own fields.

1168
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,960
And there's this weird synergies
like Kurt's while going to Google,

1169
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,801
you know,

1170
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,240
like he works for Google now.

1171
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,810
The Guy who wants the technological
singularity to include you downloading

1172
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:00,380
yourself into a fucking computer,

1173
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,930
just started working at sky net.

1174
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,493
I mean,

1175
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,280
nobody's even pick these dudes are
fucking all planning the takeover.

1176
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,380
And then they brought in Lex Luther,

1177
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,520
he's sitting there eating
a hundred pills with lunch,

1178
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:19,150
trying to stay alive
for an extra five years.

1179
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:19,984
So I love that shit.

1180
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,480
Yeah,

1181
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,290
I love Google.

1182
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,680
I,

1183
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,513
you know,

1184
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,840
I keep thinking about how like whatever
information they end up being forced to

1185
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,660
share with the government or something
like how much information if they given

1186
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:30,360
us,

1187
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,330
like I got here on Google maps,

1188
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,770
like half the stuff I like.

1189
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:34,880
Everything I look up is on good.

1190
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,680
They give me information
for free all the time.

1191
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,100
Right.

1192
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,260
So if they want some mind
that's I'm okay with that.

1193
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:40,471
Well,

1194
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:45,471
honestly I think we're in a state where
the ability of the average person is

1195
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:49,320
closing in so fast on the ability of the
government that they're going to merge

1196
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:52,830
sort of like Fahrenheit and Celsius
when they hit 40 below zero,

1197
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,940
the same temperature.

1198
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,910
I think technology is going to the,

1199
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,773
the,

1200
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,760
the boundary breaking
qualities of technology and
the ability to connect people

1201
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,260
is going to eventually hit a critical
point where it's not gonna matter if you

1202
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,190
work for the government.

1203
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,160
It's like I am going to
be able to read your mind.

1204
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,620
I'm not going to need to go to the
database that they're building in Utah.

1205
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm going to be able to access
information everywhere all the time.

1206
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,560
There's going to get to that point and
you could see like that it's getting away

1207
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,090
even from the government itself,

1208
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,620
because look at like what happened?

1209
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:29,700
Well,

1210
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,080
look at what the CIA guy,

1211
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,430
what the fuck's his name?

1212
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:36,300
That that got busted with a the
email exchange with the mistress.

1213
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,610
Oh,

1214
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,490
the fuck is his name.

1215
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,343
The big guy.

1216
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,490
The Big Patraeus.

1217
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:41,900
Thank you.

1218
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,590
Yeah.

1219
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:42,990
Yeah.

1220
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,823
Betray us.

1221
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,540
That's to me,

1222
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,660
when the number one spook the CIA,

1223
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,930
the number one spa intelligence
blasted because the FBI looks into him.

1224
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,420
I mean,

1225
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,250
Jesus fucking Christ.

1226
00:36:59,460 --> 00:36:59,761
They're,

1227
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,001
they're,

1228
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,590
they're cannibalizing themselves.

1229
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,140
The government themselves
as cannibalize themselves.

1230
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,900
They don't know what they're doing anymore
than anybody else does in this brave

1231
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,850
new world is that all this
technology and everything,

1232
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,450
everybody there,

1233
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,220
especially the ones that
are holding onto power,

1234
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:12,054
they're in a panic.

1235
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,481
Yeah,

1236
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,190
and in doing something like that,

1237
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,690
I think they showed their pants.

1238
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,150
I think they dropped their
pants and they're idiots.

1239
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,020
Yeah,

1240
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,681
absolutely.

1241
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:20,221
First of all,

1242
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:23,700
because I never knew that the
CIA and the FBI didn't get along.

1243
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,080
Did you know that?

1244
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,490
I kind of heard things,

1245
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:29,570
but I don't know if it was just like an
x files thing that's gotta be turned off

1246
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:29,971
TV.

1247
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:30,300
I don't know.

1248
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,120
I don't really know.

1249
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,090
That's the dumbest fucking Shit
I've ever heard in my life.

1250
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,160
You concert supposed to be Americans,

1251
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,761
you know,

1252
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:39,780
and anybody who would dare call someone
like me unpatriotic because I think that

1253
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:42,900
the government feel mostly with idiots
and make terrible decisions based on

1254
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:43,734
money.

1255
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,820
You're,

1256
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,653
what are you doing?

1257
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,000
The FBI and the CIA don't like each other.

1258
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,640
Well you fucks have a softball
game and work that out.

1259
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,230
Jesus Christ.

1260
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,460
Your whole summary from each other
because you don't want this person to move

1261
00:37:56,461 --> 00:38:00,270
ahead with that person to get a job in
the next administration that maybe you

1262
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:03,390
think you could've gotten there
competing with each other over.

1263
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,823
What the fuck?

1264
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,600
It's just like office politics or like,

1265
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,943
or like a,

1266
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,350
you know,

1267
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,110
a hunting lodge or something.

1268
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:11,880
Just competing with some
other hunting lodge.

1269
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:16,770
Like it's just most ducks and then a guy
like Dick Cheney shoots his friend in

1270
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:17,604
the face.

1271
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,750
That's what that Shit's from.

1272
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,300
Be a little more an alcohol.

1273
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:21,780
How,

1274
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,950
how drunk was Dick Cheney?

1275
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:24,210
And he shot his friend
in the face probably.

1276
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,710
Fuck,

1277
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,690
we got really smooth pacemaker
thing he's got going on.

1278
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,820
He's got a heart.

1279
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,500
But he had a,

1280
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,410
he had a pacemaker that was so fucking
strange that it didn't leave him with a

1281
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:36,380
heartbeat as smooth.

1282
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,390
It didn't have a heartbeat.

1283
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,730
It was just a constant flow of blood.

1284
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,290
That's gotta be in the Bible,

1285
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,903
right?

1286
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,953
The one that,

1287
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,533
yes,

1288
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,710
he take you out the heart of another
and implanted in this tissue.

1289
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,210
I just do a joke about how,

1290
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,510
uh,

1291
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,010
Dick Cheney had one extra secret service
agent that came with them everywhere

1292
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,820
and the dude was only unhealthy food
and they made them jog every day.

1293
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:01,181
And he's like,

1294
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:01,661
what the fuck?

1295
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:02,860
Why can't I have a burger shut up,

1296
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,790
run.

1297
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,200
And then they followed him everywhere.

1298
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:05,811
He went with a,

1299
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,930
a giant cooler filled with ice.

1300
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,630
And then the moment Dick Cheney drops,

1301
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,790
they got to fucking cut
that kind of like a fish,

1302
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,270
pull out his ticker and stuffed it in
that old man's cavity that I wouldn't,

1303
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,743
I wouldn't doubt it.

1304
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:20,640
You know,

1305
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,670
people would but see soon,

1306
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:22,421
just like you were saying,

1307
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:25,420
eventually we will all have a cooler
full of extra Oregon's just in case.

1308
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,410
Well I think it's going to
be even crazier than that.

1309
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:30,070
And they're going to be able to inject
something into your body and you're just

1310
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,990
to agree grow stem cells or the one you
have all of a sudden starts functioning

1311
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:36,130
like really awesome.

1312
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:36,880
You know,

1313
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,020
40 beats per minute.

1314
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:42,550
I'm more excited about not like
fixing stuff but making stuff better.

1315
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,960
Like I want,

1316
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,150
I want octopus size or something.

1317
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,770
I want something powerful.

1318
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,190
Octopus eyes are very similar to humanize.

1319
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,550
And one of the weirdest things
about octopus is that w we,

1320
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,600
we branched off from there evolutionary
line like hundreds of millions of years.

1321
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,840
13 I think the last I saw it was like 13
to 40 times independently and they all

1322
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:12,781
use the same crystals and molecules to
make the lenses and everything else cause

1323
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:13,900
they,

1324
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,340
cause they work the same for everybody.

1325
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,380
That's why I was interested
in what we were talking about,

1326
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:17,860
um,

1327
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,140
during the commercial
part about Panspermia,

1328
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:24,240
about the idea of spores and different
things coming from other planets and seed

1329
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:25,210
and life on earth.

1330
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,160
If that really did happen,

1331
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,310
how strange would it be of life
really is just sort like this,

1332
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:30,731
this is,

1333
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:31,600
this is the kind of thing,

1334
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:32,231
this is life.

1335
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:33,064
This is how it grows.

1336
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,370
I think when we do find some other life,

1337
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,260
it will look really similar.

1338
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:38,810
Well,

1339
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,200
could we find here like,

1340
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,050
look,

1341
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,270
if you look at like placental and uh,

1342
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,020
uh,

1343
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,280
marsupial mammals,

1344
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,610
like they split or like from an early
point and yet you have like placental deer

1345
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,180
and marsupial deal deer and they have
all these like kind of really similar

1346
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:57,610
animals because it works the same.

1347
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,653
So like that's,

1348
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,940
that's the conclusion you would nature
comes to for like some sort of projects.

1349
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:04,480
So why wouldn't that work elsewhere?

1350
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,021
Right.

1351
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:09,010
And think about what we know has
existed and what currently exists.

1352
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,980
Think about the immense variety.

1353
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,280
Like I was playing with my daughter
today at her school had this,

1354
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,500
they have a big bucket of dinosaurs,

1355
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,360
dinosaur like toys,

1356
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:19,840
you know,

1357
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,673
kids to play with.

1358
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,730
And uh,

1359
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:21,941
you know,

1360
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:22,451
she's asked me,

1361
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:22,690
well,

1362
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,650
what's this one called with that.

1363
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,481
So we're going over the,

1364
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,600
all the little dinosaurs and I'm like,

1365
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:26,291
Jesus Christ,

1366
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,880
how many of these fucking
things were there?

1367
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:28,931
And I'm crazy.

1368
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:29,171
They,

1369
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:34,171
this giant ass flying lizard and it's
huge fucking thing with a monster face.

1370
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:35,300
And you know,

1371
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,320
you're looking at all these different
things like just the variety of them is so

1372
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:39,950
alien.

1373
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,210
Yeah.

1374
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,110
They were around for like a
hundred some million years.

1375
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:42,410
Yeah.

1376
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,640
And they had all kinds of times,

1377
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:44,630
shit that's still here.

1378
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Elephants and crocodiles and people like
just the wide variety that exists right

1379
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:49,941
now,

1380
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:50,750
but yet,

1381
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,470
so similar carbon based life form
a lot of different variables.

1382
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,161
Some of them,

1383
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:55,401
you know,

1384
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,181
cold blooded,

1385
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,200
some warm blooded,

1386
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,150
some [inaudible] work.

1387
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,620
And so they keep doing it.

1388
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,101
Yeah.

1389
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,500
It's just a wonder if like you said,

1390
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,470
like it all,

1391
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:06,260
it needs similar,

1392
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,910
but you know,

1393
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,210
but pretty different conditions I think.

1394
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,020
I think we'll,

1395
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,530
we'll,

1396
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,900
I mean we'll definitely
find plants another planet,

1397
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:15,171
right?

1398
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:20,171
Because chlorophyll is somewhat easy to
make and absorbing light from the sun is

1399
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,380
a really smart thing to do.

1400
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,380
I don't even have to be
the way to do it though.

1401
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,830
I mean we've shown in this
world that in the vents,

1402
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:28,760
the volcanic vents,

1403
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,070
bottom of the oceans where
no light reaches at all,

1404
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,060
they've all,

1405
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,130
all life needs apparently his energy,

1406
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,020
we used to think it needed light
but all life needs is some sources.

1407
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,230
As long as there is light,

1408
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,030
there'll be ones taking advantage of it.

1409
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,331
Yeah.

1410
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,300
If there is light and if they're taking
advantage of something like sunlight,

1411
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:45,230
they're going to do really,

1412
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,950
really well and the only life that
competes with them is going to be going

1413
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,230
underground to thermal
events and shit like that.

1414
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,070
Like it.

1415
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,390
If it works really well,

1416
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,450
then they'll keep doing it right in the,

1417
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,810
the,

1418
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,550
the other issue is that the life,

1419
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,760
unless it comes up with some
other way to manufacture things,

1420
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,310
it's not going to the,

1421
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,520
the life that lives in the bottom of the
ocean near those events is not going to

1422
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:10,700
have the same ability to progress is
something that there's no stimulation to

1423
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:11,534
change.

1424
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,400
They say that about the ocean,

1425
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,234
that there's,

1426
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,420
there's less diversity in the species
down there because there's less like a

1427
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,500
need for change.

1428
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:26,300
Like up here we have all this geographic
mountains and deserts and forests and

1429
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:27,320
lakes and all this other shit.

1430
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:30,020
And down there you just have
like up and down basically.

1431
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:32,340
And then when you get down
to the surface Godzilla,

1432
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,141
oh yeah,

1433
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:33,974
that's right.

1434
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,710
You got to compete with that motherfucker.

1435
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,021
Oh,

1436
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:36,980
you got to go a little shirt on.

1437
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,373
What are the odds?

1438
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,583
Crazy.

1439
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,820
Yeah.

1440
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,270
Um,

1441
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,100
from radiation and from its,

1442
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,990
it was forced to change from Fukushima,

1443
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,560
well I think it was
Gonzolo was nuclear bombs,

1444
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,130
but I'm sure the Japanese is probably
coming up with some new monster movies

1445
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:52,580
now.

1446
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:52,970
Right.

1447
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,380
Cause based on Fukushima.

1448
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,880
Oh,

1449
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,300
I bet.

1450
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,560
I guess so you'd have to human gods,

1451
00:43:58,561 --> 00:43:59,394
Philippine.

1452
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,900
But I bet a lot of people probably
upset that Godzilla wasn't real.

1453
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,490
Nothing has happened like that.

1454
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:05,060
Like no,

1455
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,541
there's no,

1456
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:05,841
see,

1457
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:06,710
I told you a moment.

1458
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,280
Well yeah,

1459
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,850
that and,

1460
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,260
and Bruce Banner getting irradiated
and Spiderman getting bitten by an

1461
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:13,730
irradiated fucking spider.

1462
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,870
Like that makes any sense.

1463
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:15,860
Yes.

1464
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,530
Unfortunately radiation
doesn't really seem to do that.

1465
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,550
I felt it was very weak that the new
Spiderman had a new way he got bid.

1466
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,160
Oh yeah.

1467
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,110
You didn't see that?

1468
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,660
No.

1469
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,100
No.

1470
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,380
Why would I just see it bro
and new Spiderman movie.

1471
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:29,643
How dare you

1472
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,010
so

1473
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,480
rude out.

1474
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:38,481
Tobey Maguire's dancing from Spiderman
three and then I have no problem at Tobey

1475
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:38,760
Maguire.

1476
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,590
Who's being Spiderman in this new guys?

1477
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:41,340
Just twilight.

1478
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,580
I think we've talked about
this twilight Parker.

1479
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,630
That's what it felt like.

1480
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,420
Like it's all sparkly
and it's got good hair.

1481
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,560
It's just like overdramatic to
sexy and it's a love story also.

1482
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:54,654
He's a superhero.

1483
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,500
I liked them.

1484
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,410
I have no problem with him.

1485
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:58,180
Calm though.

1486
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,013
But so how'd he,

1487
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,293
how'd he get bit,

1488
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,820
why'd you say Congo condos?

1489
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,280
That doesn't make sense.

1490
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:05,940
What does that,

1491
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,751
what did that mean?

1492
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:07,420
That condos,

1493
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,640
a long time ago we talked about condos
and I was like let's buy them condos and

1494
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:13,140
then I think it for Chrysler
or something like that.

1495
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,940
It was so random access.

1496
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:19,200
I was going to say maybe like you were
like if Joe was going to have sex with a

1497
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:20,580
guy that would be his,

1498
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:20,960
his,

1499
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
oh scream.

1500
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,360
I wouldn't be condos.

1501
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,620
I bet there's a tumor the size of a
bowling ball and that kids had no,

1502
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,750
I bet there's something in there now.

1503
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,030
It's in my ass alien and that's why
we think there is one in the boat.

1504
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,700
Me and Ari just started this new research
project or you might be able to help

1505
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:39,031
us out.

1506
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,390
When we were talking about it last night
that we both realized that we had her

1507
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:46,290
but periods the same weekend and somebody
told me it might have something to do

1508
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,740
with the moon at like the distance
of the moon is that you actually buy.

1509
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,280
But what do you mean by out of your ass?

1510
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,580
Like me and Ari both.

1511
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,500
Have you guys both go
to Chipolte Portland?

1512
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,200
No.

1513
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,491
No.

1514
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:57,580
It had nothing to do with that.

1515
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,160
Does this happen so often that you
think you could say it on a podcast?

1516
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,130
We both had our but periods and
the photos hall would be like,

1517
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:06,740
yeah,

1518
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,620
I know what he's saying.

1519
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,930
Like periods too.

1520
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,880
A lot of people over
the age of 35 Oh Brian,

1521
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,631
I've never,

1522
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:16,020
I don't know anybody that's shitting blood
unless something really bad happened,

1523
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,480
but I think you get a,

1524
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,740
I will ponder this.

1525
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,940
I think it has something to do.

1526
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,050
Your research is about,

1527
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,170
it's about the moon you think?

1528
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:26,810
Yeah,

1529
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,160
I think it has something to do with the
distance of the moon because both me and

1530
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:29,340
art,

1531
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,210
so we're going to start like,

1532
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,660
you know,

1533
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,170
putting it on our calendars every time
we ever bought periods and then you know,

1534
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,800
see what else we were eating around
that time where I was going to put,

1535
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,220
cause already made this great thing.

1536
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:41,010
It's like just put everything that
you were doing at that time period.

1537
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:42,180
Then after a while you'll see,

1538
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:43,470
you have to remember
where it was going on.

1539
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:43,651
Like,

1540
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:43,831
you know,

1541
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:45,790
the past day or two
before I used it as well.

1542
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,030
You should just be fucking hemorrhoid.

1543
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:49,680
Why are you even debating him on this?

1544
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,514
This is crazy.

1545
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,910
Do you start with have hemorrhoids?

1546
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:53,783
Oh yes,

1547
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,820
but they're internal so I don't think,

1548
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,393
right.

1549
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,480
They breed inside and
then you shit it out.

1550
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:03,420
Like coated in a really
fine plastic layer of shit.

1551
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:06,150
And it's really weird.

1552
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,190
I think we've already figured this out.

1553
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:11,880
But if it happens at the same
time as your blood brothers,

1554
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:15,100
what you should do is both
caught you're assholes pushing,

1555
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,880
rub them together and then tie him up
like an Indian would with some buckskin

1556
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:24,420
and you need to stop grinding over and
making your butt's make out and rubbing

1557
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:25,080
them together.

1558
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,350
No,

1559
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,520
that's how you become blood brothers.

1560
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,220
You gotta tie your ass
cheeks together and then,

1561
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,053
uh,

1562
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,720
then you have to go through that speech
when the outlaw Josey Wales just seeing

1563
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,730
if there's something that's there,

1564
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,750
there's iron in your words of truth.

1565
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,003
It's caught your APP.

1566
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,360
Not Saying don't do the science.

1567
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm just saying you may.

1568
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,430
What if there was a connection?

1569
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,600
There was no science to,

1570
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,750
I don't know why you talking
to this no science yet.

1571
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,273
It's sort of saying,

1572
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,320
why don't you have control over is Mike,

1573
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,550
have you never have you not

1574
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,330
asked point,

1575
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,360
not trying quiet.

1576
00:47:58,361 --> 00:48:01,900
I'm that much trying to encourage
him to think that people are actually

1577
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:02,734
listening.

1578
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,270
There's probably better
ways to go about this navy.

1579
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,011
So it turns out,

1580
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,030
I have to say one thing,

1581
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:15,230
it turns out that that story about the
Harvard doctor that wanted to implant a

1582
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,190
neanderthal baby,

1583
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,810
a woman's body,

1584
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,070
it turns out it's bullshit.

1585
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:21,340
Yeah.

1586
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:21,850
Well he,

1587
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,190
he,

1588
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,023
he's,

1589
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:23,410
yeah,

1590
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,430
pretty much it's not,

1591
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,310
it's not bullshit that he
wouldn't like to do it.

1592
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:27,911
It's that there,

1593
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:29,350
there isn't really a plan.

1594
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,311
He just said,

1595
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:30,551
you know,

1596
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:31,630
that maybe we could,

1597
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,260
yeah.

1598
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,170
Maybe we have enough neanderthal DNA
or whatever that we could do that.

1599
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,651
Yeah.

1600
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:40,240
What happened was Blue Daily
Mail apparently picked up on,

1601
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,570
uh,

1602
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:45,570
this guy's conversation or have
ever listened to Daily Mail.

1603
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,121
Yeah.

1604
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:47,980
The Daily Mail's a bunch of cunts.

1605
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,630
These fucks they,

1606
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:50,410
um,

1607
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:50,651
here,

1608
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:50,791
I'll,

1609
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:51,510
I'll pull up.

1610
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,343
Ah,

1611
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,251
okay.

1612
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,084
Not True.

1613
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,303
I'll see your file.

1614
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,120
I can Google so I can get the whole story.

1615
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,410
They were just talking about reviving
some extinct species that like we kind of

1616
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,590
killed out a few decades ago.

1617
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,570
Had just did that with a frog.

1618
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,760
They just created the embryo of a frog.

1619
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,970
We had Jacob Board from Popular
Science magazine yesterday.

1620
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,160
Apparently what happened
was that there was a,

1621
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,670
it was lost in translation
that it was originally,

1622
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,480
it was for a,

1623
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:23,780
uh,

1624
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,780
a German language magazine called Der
Spiegel and was poorly translated about

1625
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,940
the possibility of one
day cloning a neanderthal.

1626
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,670
And they just ran it
through Google translation.

1627
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:37,550
He,

1628
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:37,900
you know,

1629
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,350
and he,

1630
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,190
when they asked him,

1631
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:39,611
the guy said,

1632
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:39,731
well,

1633
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,020
I'm certainly not advocating,

1634
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,860
but I'm saying that it's technically
possible Sunday if it is technically

1635
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:49,180
possible someday we need to start talking
about it today and that we would need

1636
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:50,560
a really adventurous woman.

1637
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,800
So then they put out this thing saying,

1638
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,960
asking for an adventurous woman
who wants to give birth to him,

1639
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,700
murdering monkey man,

1640
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,913
giant eyes.

1641
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,090
They're murdering.

1642
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,050
They might've been very peaceful.

1643
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,640
I think everybody is a murderer back then.

1644
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,120
Well,

1645
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,930
there's that too.

1646
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:05,330
Wouldn't need,

1647
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:05,950
apparently they were,

1648
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:06,783
they were very,

1649
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,180
like,

1650
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,290
they might have been ahead of,

1651
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:08,980
uh,

1652
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,670
uh,

1653
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,690
the other group of,

1654
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,550
of humans at that point.

1655
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,740
Like they might've been a little more
advanced in terms of tool making.

1656
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:17,170
And that's why as such a small group,

1657
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,900
we let them like
interbreed with our heart,

1658
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,561
not with ours,

1659
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:21,394
they're both ours,

1660
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,080
but like they integrate it.

1661
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,410
The other group that was larger still
accepted them because they were so useful.

1662
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,500
And that's how we got them.

1663
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,490
The neanderthal

1664
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,630
blood in us.

1665
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,910
Yeah.

1666
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:31,390
Yeah.

1667
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,970
There's interbreeding
that's a possibility.

1668
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:38,050
And the other possibility is just that
we share and even more similar common

1669
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:40,240
ancestor and that there was a branch,

1670
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:40,821
you know,

1671
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:42,470
this way and that way and this way.

1672
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:42,751
I mean,

1673
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:46,000
like Africans don't have
the same neanderthal DNA.

1674
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:46,760
Right,

1675
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,060
right.

1676
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,560
Your opinions and everybody else does.

1677
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah.

1678
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,181
Yeah.

1679
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:52,660
There's thoughts that humans grew
in a variety of different forms,

1680
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:54,900
including ones that we haven't
even totally discovered it.

1681
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:55,541
You know,

1682
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:55,841
that,

1683
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:56,170
uh,

1684
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,800
that Homo Floresiensis really throw a
monkey wrench into a lot of people's ideas

1685
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,720
of the human past as well.

1686
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,460
Cause they found a human,

1687
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,170
a type of human,

1688
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,550
this really tiny little human
that lived on one island,

1689
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,250
um,

1690
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,680
in the florists islands.

1691
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,850
Is that when it's something like that?

1692
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,150
Yeah,

1693
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:13,870
something like that.

1694
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,510
There's a weird thing that
happens to things on islands.

1695
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,090
They get smaller except blizzards.

1696
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,320
Lizards get bigger.

1697
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:20,920
Is that right?

1698
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,670
Yeah.

1699
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:21,971
Yeah.

1700
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:25,120
That's why the Komodo dragon so
fucking big and it's all stuck on one.

1701
00:51:25,121 --> 00:51:27,040
I wonder if that has to do with it cold,

1702
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,010
warm blooded thing or wonder.

1703
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,761
But it's a,

1704
00:51:29,761 --> 00:51:30,020
I,

1705
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,870
it's called island dwarfism and there's,

1706
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:32,170
um,

1707
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,750
there's like a dwarf elephants and theirs.

1708
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:35,620
That's adorable.

1709
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:35,821
Yeah.

1710
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:37,060
The little adorable elephants.

1711
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,250
There's all these weird
things that happened.

1712
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,980
There's like little small deer
and all these different animals,

1713
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,990
monkeys and shit like that.

1714
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,210
But this little human
was the weirdest one.

1715
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,620
Little fucker innate.

1716
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,090
There's a tiny human next time you got
to Houston or anybody in Houston and you

1717
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:53,080
should go take out the,

1718
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,580
the Museum of natural science.

1719
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:55,600
They have this huge,

1720
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:56,531
huge,

1721
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:56,680
uh,

1722
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:56,920
uh,

1723
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,310
Paleontology holiday that just opened
up with like a massive train of stories

1724
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,990
and like 40 some fossils,

1725
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:04,720
but they also have this
huge history and lineage of,

1726
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,440
of humans and they have this big
light cluster of them and I mean they,

1727
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:13,470
they've got like 20 different kinds of
skulls or models of skulls in there and

1728
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,560
all variety of shapes and sizes with
big ridges on their heads and shit like

1729
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:18,370
that.

1730
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,210
It's really interesting,

1731
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:22,870
which they have this big ridge right in
the middle of their head to keep their

1732
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,750
skull from breaking when
they chew on tough things.

1733
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,870
Jesus Christ and a big ridge to keep their
skull from breaking when they chew on

1734
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,580
the,

1735
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,413
what the fuck.

1736
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,343
A lot of the,

1737
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,860
the hominids ha had this just like a
little extra ridge and it was just so when

1738
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:40,180
you chew like the way you're,

1739
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,920
you're bending your skull and shit,

1740
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:42,400
it could,

1741
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,233
it could just crack.

1742
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,080
Wow.

1743
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,570
How fascinating is that?

1744
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:46,940
Pretty,

1745
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,850
just think about the,

1746
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,240
uh,

1747
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,830
the idea of back then.

1748
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,340
Did you have no stores?

1749
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,270
No.

1750
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,260
No metal,

1751
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,550
no nothing,

1752
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,070
no obligations except eating and shit.

1753
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,470
Fucking like nobody
asks you to do anything.

1754
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,304
You just,

1755
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:04,450
yeah.

1756
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,100
You only lived to be like 18.

1757
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:10,300
If you're lucky and you're just running
around trying to catch shit to eat.

1758
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:11,740
I,

1759
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,430
although I don't know.

1760
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,550
I don't know how long it
stretches back on the,

1761
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,870
the age think they like it.

1762
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,630
If you factor out baby death,

1763
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,120
then the averages go up a whole lot.

1764
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,280
Cause it's just fucking easy for a baby.

1765
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:24,761
It's dykes.

1766
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:25,594
They're so,

1767
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,010
I

1768
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,311
mean it,

1769
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:28,350
it should be inside a womb and,

1770
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:29,460
but the way,

1771
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,330
the way that we,

1772
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,570
we develop it comes out of the
womb and is still developing.

1773
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:33,841
Well,

1774
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:34,471
you know what man,

1775
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:38,530
it's almost like nature knew that it
was a mistake to make people though,

1776
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:41,610
like this fucking thing is
eventually going to blow us up.

1777
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,410
Now it's just really hard to make people,

1778
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:44,520
cause we're so fucking smart.

1779
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:45,031
Yeah,

1780
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:45,691
I know that.

1781
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:47,280
But it's also the nature said,

1782
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,020
let's make it easy to kill these fucks.

1783
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,830
Yeah.

1784
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,420
So you're seeing the onion article where
they compared the babies of various

1785
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:56,760
species like in survival traits.

1786
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,300
And there was one where they would put
the baby on top of a big pile of dirt and

1787
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,051
let it rain in.

1788
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:02,700
Every human baby would just sink in,

1789
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:03,750
fucking drown in the mud.

1790
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,043
All right.

1791
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,651
I have no kids.

1792
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,550
And you're both retarded.

1793
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah.

1794
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,900
So it goes

1795
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,733
the,

1796
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,520
yeah,

1797
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:14,731
the,

1798
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:19,731
I think that it's easier for people to
die because if people could live like

1799
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,380
easily,

1800
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,980
if someone could create
what humans can create,

1801
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,750
can be as smart as humans can,

1802
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:32,040
can be able to alter their environment
as much as humans can and then also be

1803
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:32,281
like,

1804
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:35,230
is it vulnerables or rhino
thinking about how fun,

1805
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,420
but it wouldn't be,

1806
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,310
it's not so much,

1807
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,090
uh,

1808
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:39,391
you know,

1809
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,650
nature meaning it's like,

1810
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,280
it's a really precarious
balance to make it like,

1811
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:44,760
you know,

1812
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,480
like something like a third of our energy
consumption through day to day life.

1813
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:50,370
It goes to our brain like,

1814
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,520
and goes to keeping that your bets,

1815
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,653
Huh?

1816
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,580
Well he's got all that
carbon monoxide in there.

1817
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,510
Keeping things running,

1818
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,620
keeping it lubed up.

1819
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,460
Yeah.

1820
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,600
Sometimes you sneezing,

1821
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:01,620
smokes comes out,

1822
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,120
he hasn't even smoked.

1823
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,200
That does happen.

1824
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,450
No.

1825
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,300
Like if you smoke a cigarette and then
like three minutes later you just pick

1826
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,880
bourbon and a bunch of smoke comes like,

1827
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,011
like,

1828
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:10,311
Whoa,

1829
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:11,600
what the fuck was that dude?

1830
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:12,470
It's called cancer.

1831
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:17,390
So I just learned something crazy that
there's a chemical and Gatorade that's

1832
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:19,400
banned in like most countries,

1833
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:19,760
uh,

1834
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,500
from consuming including like Brazil,

1835
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:22,041
Japan,

1836
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:22,491
Canada,

1837
00:55:22,491 --> 00:55:23,300
India,

1838
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,280
because it's bad for you,

1839
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,840
like fucks with your thyroid.

1840
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,980
It could get like transfer through
breast milk and I could fuck with your

1841
00:55:30,981 --> 00:55:34,610
neurological impairment
or impairment and uh,

1842
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,350
it does all this bad shit to you
and it's in fucking Gatorade and uh,

1843
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,810
you have to drink a lot of it to call.

1844
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:42,440
Um,

1845
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,273
it's called,

1846
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,120
uh,

1847
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:44,953
let's see.

1848
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,280
Um,

1849
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,370
brominated vegetable oil,

1850
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,920
like bro Broner aid,

1851
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,523
like bromine.

1852
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,200
But uh,

1853
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,920
it's,

1854
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,131
yeah,

1855
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:56,841
it's supposedly though,

1856
00:55:56,841 --> 00:55:57,260
I guess,

1857
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:57,750
uh,

1858
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,040
um,

1859
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,930
Gatorade about to remove the ingredient,

1860
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:02,540
but you know how long I had been around.

1861
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,381
I know in this,

1862
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:06,980
isn't Gatorade supposed
to be like drinking large
quantities because you're in

1863
00:56:06,981 --> 00:56:09,560
sports and you're like
getting dumped on your head.

1864
00:56:09,561 --> 00:56:10,820
And then if it comes true,

1865
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:11,200
yeah.

1866
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,530
But if it transfers to breast milk,

1867
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:13,730
like what's it do to the little babies?

1868
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:14,301
Your mom drinks,

1869
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:17,410
like she's doing yoga and she drinks like
Gatorade and then transfers it through

1870
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:18,244
a breasts.

1871
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,670
What would it do to the baby?

1872
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:20,743
Probably nothing good.

1873
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,583
Yeah.

1874
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,740
Or maybe filter it out.

1875
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:23,980
We'll

1876
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,210
when body's pretty resilient.

1877
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,080
I don't know ruminated what vegetable oil.

1878
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,310
It's just something they used the process
and I also just found out that equal,

1879
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:33,611
uh,

1880
00:56:33,611 --> 00:56:35,300
just started re released,

1881
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:35,920
uh,

1882
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,560
stick to Stevia version of a Stevia.

1883
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,690
They changed their formula
already have a second brand now.

1884
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:42,610
So equal now has stevia.

1885
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,830
Stevia is way better,

1886
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:45,430
man.

1887
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,263
Yeah,

1888
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,300
it's a pretty good and
he uses an equal anyway.

1889
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:49,620
Equal,

1890
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,381
equal is smart.

1891
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:52,600
They would just replace all
their equals with Stevia.

1892
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,860
Well equal as a totally different
substance and they own a patent on it.

1893
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:01,890
The problem with Stevia is it's just
a naturally occurring plant extract.

1894
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:03,581
Yeah.

1895
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:05,680
But isn't there a problem
with every one of them?

1896
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:09,130
Like equal might lead to this
sweet and low might lead to this.

1897
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:11,110
A lot of things might lead to like

1898
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,020
Tim Ferriss or he says there's
no biological free ride.

1899
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,531
If you,

1900
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:17,890
uh,

1901
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,820
if something tastes sweet,

1902
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,780
it doesn't do anything bad to you.

1903
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,650
You should fucking be scared.

1904
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,091
Yeah,

1905
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:24,960
you should be a little Frankie.

1906
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:25,794
It's planning,

1907
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,753
it's camping,

1908
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,120
camping inside you planning.

1909
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:28,954
It's attack

1910
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,720
laying in a dormant state.

1911
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:32,500
There's,

1912
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:32,831
I mean,

1913
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:33,111
we,

1914
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:37,690
we get so over fed on the information
because there's like so many things you

1915
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:38,890
could put into your body now.

1916
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,310
Yeah.

1917
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,420
But we don't,

1918
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,590
we don't know what it is for like
everybody let alone or anybody like,

1919
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,610
we don't know what Stevia,

1920
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,070
Stevia is good or bad for everybody.

1921
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:50,560
We don't know if this food
is good or bad for everybody.

1922
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:53,980
Like we're all so individual and we don't
know the quantities and we don't have

1923
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:56,440
the time to test all this new
shit that's out on the market.

1924
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:01,710
So we're like over saturated
with information that is
kind of useless almost.

1925
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:06,100
And like how many people have actually
died from a lot of the shit that we're

1926
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:06,934
scared of?

1927
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,680
Like who's died from diet coke?

1928
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:10,283
Hmm.

1929
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:10,730
No,

1930
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,640
everybody's telling me that aspartame
is terrible as per tank as you can.

1931
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:14,140
So I'm like,

1932
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,580
why does everyone have cancer?

1933
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,400
Because motherfuckers just
drink diet coke everywhere.

1934
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,151
Everywhere you look.

1935
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:19,984
People drink.

1936
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,920
And someone said to me,

1937
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:21,090
the,

1938
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,230
the Tammy Baker and I said,

1939
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:23,770
what?

1940
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,131
He said,

1941
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:25,120
Tammy Faye Baker,

1942
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,961
she got cancer.

1943
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,820
She drank like a case of diet coke a day.

1944
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:28,871
Yeah.

1945
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:29,651
That's the other problem.

1946
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:31,930
Like you don't know if that did that,

1947
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:33,220
especially with medical things.

1948
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:33,521
He like,

1949
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:35,860
you can't make that
connection unless it's like,

1950
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,050
like the guy who figured out that uh,

1951
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,453
uh,

1952
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,240
stomach,

1953
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,680
there were certain kinds of stomach
bacteria or viruses that caused ulcers and

1954
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:45,910
everybody said it was bullshit.

1955
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:50,440
And so he just took a very large dose
of the bacteria and he thought he would

1956
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:51,990
wait a few weeks and,

1957
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,870
and check out,

1958
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:53,920
get like a colonoscopy,

1959
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:54,371
gastro,

1960
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:55,204
whatever.

1961
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,073
And uh,

1962
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,430
the next day he started
having stomach pains and,

1963
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:03,250
and got checked out and he had a bunch
of holsters and his stomach and then,

1964
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,690
and then he went to Nobel prize.

1965
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:06,183
Wow.

1966
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,720
For having the balls to step up.

1967
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:09,100
But that that was a very obvious,

1968
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,320
directly correlated this did that.

1969
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,200
And 99% of shit is nothing like that.

1970
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:14,590
Yeah.

1971
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,290
And Tammy Faye Baker
was fucking Jim Baker,

1972
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:17,950
you know,

1973
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,000
and she was crazy.

1974
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:20,560
She was a religious evangelists.

1975
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,070
Who knows what gave that

1976
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,420
lady cancer brain cancer.

1977
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,560
Maybe that's why she was so crazy.

1978
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,300
I don't know what kind of
cancer should cancel it.

1979
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:26,870
Right.

1980
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,970
So I have to correct
something I said earlier,

1981
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,490
a gentleman from Holland said
that there is a drinking age,

1982
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:36,430
16 for wine and beer and 18 for hard
liquor and it's apparently boss route.

1983
00:59:36,431 --> 00:59:39,580
And it was giving us dense this
information when he said there was no,

1984
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:39,860
uh,

1985
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,290
drinking some like rural area.

1986
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,630
Apparently he's just
very loosely enforced.

1987
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,501
They're not that,

1988
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:46,190
uh,

1989
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,930
they don't really give a fuck that much,

1990
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,370
but that's pretty bad ass.

1991
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,300
You can go to a bar,

1992
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:52,880
have a beer when you're 18 or 2016 rather.

1993
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:54,243
That's,

1994
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:54,750
I said,

1995
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,720
that's just hiding out
in your buddy's basement.

1996
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,790
You know what I think you shouldn't
be able to do when you're 18?

1997
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,650
I think you shouldn't
be able to make a porno.

1998
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,490
I think that the team,

1999
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,343
but yes,

2000
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,240
it's the visually,

2001
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,660
the most to me later.

2002
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:07,790
Yeah.

2003
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:11,360
But that's when people should
be getting watched younger.

2004
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:11,721
No,

2005
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:12,081
what I'm saying,

2006
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:14,210
if you're a girl and um,

2007
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:14,541
you know,

2008
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:17,900
someone's going to exploit you and make
a film with you getting Gangbang by 50

2009
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:19,970
dudes and they're all
nuts and your eyeballs,

2010
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,650
I think you'd have to wait to be 21 point.

2011
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,680
Make the decision 2142 we coded in common
at least three years of dudes lying

2012
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:29,601
too,

2013
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:30,680
so they can fuck you.

2014
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,160
Yeah.

2015
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,290
At least three more years where you go,

2016
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,070
hmm,

2017
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,110
there might be some fuckery afoot here.

2018
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:40,580
I might be getting hosed
literally and figuratively.

2019
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,931
You know,

2020
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,950
just so you know,

2021
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,090
it just,

2022
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:47,060
what I saw that miss teen
Delaware or whatever it was,

2023
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,030
was the young girl that
did a porn when she was 18,

2024
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:51,620
like she's 18.

2025
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,330
You imagine if we all were held to the,

2026
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,650
we all just should be
judging those people.

2027
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:00,370
Like we shouldn't judge people if they
want to fuck on or off camera anyway.

2028
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:03,070
And if socially we were fine with it,

2029
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,810
then we,

2030
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,321
you know,

2031
01:01:05,321 --> 01:01:06,100
we wouldn't,

2032
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,640
it wouldn't have been so shitty for her
to be found out that she was in a porn

2033
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:10,420
like nobody,

2034
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,500
nobody should give a shit

2035
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,450
really,

2036
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,970
except someone hired her,

2037
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:15,661
recruited her,

2038
01:01:15,661 --> 01:01:16,171
do that.

2039
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:17,004
Exploited her.

2040
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,603
Yeah.

2041
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,500
The summing.

2042
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:19,831
Look,

2043
01:01:19,831 --> 01:01:24,120
if someone owns some multimillion dollar
porn company and there were recruiting

2044
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:26,490
18 year old girls and they're
profiting off of them,

2045
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,540
that's exploitation off of someone who's
fairly ignorant because they haven't

2046
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:31,500
had a long life.

2047
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,560
There's something about
that that I find offensive.

2048
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:34,980
Maybe,

2049
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,010
maybe they should be towards
education and not the choice itself.

2050
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,800
That's 18 year olds are driving around
and better cars and all of us though,

2051
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,663
you know,

2052
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,160
they're driving a better car than me.

2053
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,023
He stopped.

2054
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:45,211
Well,

2055
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:46,200
I mean most people,

2056
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:46,500
you know,

2057
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,210
I mean like a lot of fucking money.

2058
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:50,160
They don't make a lot of mine.

2059
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:50,671
That's not true.

2060
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:52,830
They make $1,000 a scene if they're lucky.

2061
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:53,430
Right.

2062
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,330
It's not a lot of money.

2063
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,780
It's not like practice for further career.

2064
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,270
There might be,

2065
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,910
don't get you're right about that,

2066
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:01,800
but you're also riding
with like 18 years old,

2067
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,360
I was getting paid $7 an hour.

2068
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:05,430
These girls are getting paid $3,000.

2069
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:05,821
You know,

2070
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:07,040
it stopped for three hours.

2071
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,040
So it doesn't mean anything.

2072
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:08,471
That's,

2073
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:11,050
so they're making enough
money to live temporarily.

2074
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:12,430
They're not getting rich off of this shit.

2075
01:02:12,431 --> 01:02:14,170
You're acting like they're
driving rolls Royces.

2076
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:14,720
Yeah.

2077
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,100
Girls are not making that much money.

2078
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:16,340
Yeah.

2079
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,170
Like their fill all
players making millions.

2080
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,350
How often do they work?

2081
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:19,740
You know,

2082
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,040
if you

2083
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,600
worked every day of your life,

2084
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:25,260
it's $365,000 a year to just
get gang bang constantly.

2085
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,180
But nobody's really going
to pay you that anyway.

2086
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,750
No.

2087
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,890
And that would be exhausting.

2088
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,341
Yeah,

2089
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:29,791
you would do.

2090
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:30,480
You would be dead.

2091
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,940
You'd be dead by super aids
by the time you hit 17.

2092
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,560
I just think it's,

2093
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:35,010
um,

2094
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:37,260
it's not that anybody
shouldn't be having sex.

2095
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:38,094
It's not that.

2096
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:38,310
Yeah,

2097
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:38,761
that's fair.

2098
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:41,460
That taking advantage of
other people should be,

2099
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:46,461
I guess proper agencies like with few
psychiatrists on hand talk with them and

2100
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,470
try to do the psych work.

2101
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:54,740
People want to hit her porn and decide
whether or not there they're available or

2102
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,500
uh,

2103
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,400
or viable shit.

2104
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:02,700
How do you decide to cut out the dumb
ones without cutting out the crazy ones?

2105
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,570
Cause the crazy ones,

2106
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,560
clearly you got to keep

2107
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,040
fuck how do you,

2108
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,840
because some of the
crazy ones are awesome.

2109
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,850
Why can't you just have the crazy ones?

2110
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,020
But how do you,

2111
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,970
when do you know how to cut someone loose?

2112
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:15,781
Go.

2113
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:16,051
Yeah,

2114
01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:18,990
she's just free spirited and you know,

2115
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,610
what she needed to do was just sorta,

2116
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:25,050
she's thinking about hitchhiking across
the country where their cousin or,

2117
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,973
you know,

2118
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,260
she wants to fuck 500 guys in a day.

2119
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,460
Let's just let her,

2120
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,110
yeah,

2121
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,080
the veteran filming,

2122
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:31,890
you know,

2123
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,210
it's not even necessarily crazy.

2124
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:36,540
Just a very peculiar and very significant.

2125
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:41,040
Did you ever see that documentary came
out a few years back about Annabella

2126
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,280
Chong?

2127
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,000
I didn't even know that.

2128
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,980
She's the one that was the first.

2129
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:44,870
Um,

2130
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:48,450
and she was the first gal to do
one of those crazy gang bang thing.

2131
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:49,284
I'm my Jags,

2132
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:53,520
she knows her Houston at the age of 21.

2133
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,880
She had sex with a 251 sex acts
with 69 men over a 10 hour period.

2134
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,373
Wow.

2135
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,600
And it was called the
world's biggest gang bang.

2136
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:07,434
Since then,

2137
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,480
gals have a,

2138
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,250
they've taken it to the next level

2139
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:13,880
and they,

2140
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,211
they,

2141
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:14,700
um,

2142
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,150
now I think like a Houston
did like 500 sex acts.

2143
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,920
They pretend it's 500 guys.

2144
01:04:19,921 --> 01:04:22,490
But just like these poor guys have
to go back for a second sister.

2145
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,340
I did not know that.

2146
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,451
And these gals,

2147
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:24,721
by the way,

2148
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:28,560
if you've never seen one of those
Nutty Gang Gang Bang thingamajigs it is

2149
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,720
fucking in sanity.

2150
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,860
I mean completely insanity.

2151
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:33,631
It's like medical.

2152
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:34,500
It's like who's turn is it?

2153
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:37,250
Your turn hop on up Phil.

2154
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,860
And it's completely crazy.

2155
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,160
There's all these people
waiting like my friend,

2156
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:44,994
um,

2157
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,323
um,

2158
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:46,920
his,

2159
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,490
um,

2160
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,121
Tyler Knight,

2161
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:49,290
is this a porn name?

2162
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,390
We've had him on the podcast for good guy.

2163
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:54,600
He wrote a m a blog entry.

2164
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:55,860
Fine.

2165
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:56,041
Yeah,

2166
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:56,520
the great,

2167
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,290
great stuff.

2168
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:01,230
He wrote a blog entry about his
time in the line on a gang bang.

2169
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:02,340
And he couldn't do it.

2170
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,174
He couldn't get it up.

2171
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:07,890
But it said it was just the most
wretched experience that you could ever

2172
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:08,691
possibly imagine.

2173
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:12,390
And he wrote about like being poor and
needing this money and standing in spoons

2174
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:14,460
and shuffling his way to
the front of the line.

2175
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:16,980
And I remember him writing
something about how you need to,

2176
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:18,050
to bring flip flops

2177
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:18,770
to the porn set.

2178
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:19,460
Yes.

2179
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,760
That terrified me right there.

2180
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:26,000
Especially certain gang bangs walking
through the carpet and the carpet's light.

2181
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,140
It's not wet until you
step on it cause he like,

2182
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:29,570
seeps out and then seeps back in.

2183
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:30,980
Awful.

2184
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,813
This Gal,

2185
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:33,660
Bella Chong who did this,

2186
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:33,960
uh,

2187
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:34,530
she was,

2188
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:34,800
uh,

2189
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,210
she's very intelligent.

2190
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,780
It was really weird.

2191
01:05:37,781 --> 01:05:37,850
I,

2192
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:42,090
and I'm pretty sure that she was attending
UCLA when she did this or she went to

2193
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:43,770
UCLA or something like that.

2194
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,900
See now she should totally be USC
graduate work gender studies at USC.

2195
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:50,250
Wow.

2196
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,150
Was that her thesis?

2197
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:53,443
That's funny.

2198
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,080
John presented her work in pornography
as an attempt to challenge with settled

2199
01:05:57,081 --> 01:05:58,540
notions of assumptions of what you,

2200
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,380
yours is about female sexuality.

2201
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:01,214
For example,

2202
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:06,550
her conception of a gang bang was
based on the example of Mess Alina.

2203
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:07,341
Uh,

2204
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:11,840
wife of the emperor of
Claudius historically mess
Alina had suffered a poor

2205
01:06:11,841 --> 01:06:12,740
reputation.

2206
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,530
The fact that some attributed
at least partly to gender bias,

2207
01:06:15,531 --> 01:06:16,460
according to Chung,

2208
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,670
she sought to question the
devil standard at design.

2209
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,401
Denies Women.

2210
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:24,050
The ability to exhibit the same sexuality
as men by modeling what a female stud

2211
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:24,884
would be.

2212
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:29,480
So she's saying she's a female stud by
letting the 69 homeless guys shoot loads

2213
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:30,314
and your hair,

2214
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,370
that's not even a guy that
shows up and bank 69 women.

2215
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:38,821
You're going to go,

2216
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:39,391
hey dude,

2217
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:40,224
what are you doing?

2218
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,160
That dude,

2219
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:41,993
I don't know if that,

2220
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:42,600
okay,

2221
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,510
well famously there was that guy with
the Houston game pain that like went down

2222
01:06:45,511 --> 01:06:45,691
on it,

2223
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:45,901
right?

2224
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,160
Brought her flowers number.

2225
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:48,780
Like two 71 or something?

2226
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,633
No.

2227
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,070
Oh my crimee they brought her flowers.

2228
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,770
Which do you think is
weird or the flowers?

2229
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:57,870
It's just she could buy
that at a store that,

2230
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,370
that could even leave that.

2231
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,220
Well obviously you know those
flowers meant something to him,

2232
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,620
but he went down on her.

2233
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,210
What if he locked onto a pussy,

2234
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:08,910
like a pit bull and it couldn't pull
him off and all the other guys and she's

2235
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,540
screaming,

2236
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,410
he's biting her pussy.

2237
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,480
I'm sure it was too
slick for him to really,

2238
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:12,901
yeah,

2239
01:07:12,901 --> 01:07:15,120
he's probably a fucking fish.

2240
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:18,160
Try catching a fish eye.

2241
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,610
Has anybody ever jumped in the river
and caught a fish with their teeth?

2242
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,833
Western happened.

2243
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,310
It must have happened at least once.

2244
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:30,240
I had this a Hawaiian teacher
and elementary school that uh,

2245
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:30,870
he,

2246
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:33,120
he told us these stories
about like the 15 year olds,

2247
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,680
I don't know if this was bullshit.

2248
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:35,663
I don't think so though.

2249
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,930
But the teens would like swim out into
really shallow waters with like three

2250
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:44,931
foot sharks and they would swim next
to them and then and bite their eye and

2251
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,140
when you punched her their eye,

2252
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:46,974
they just like,

2253
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,950
they just stopped moving completely
and then you can grab them by the,

2254
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,800
by the tail and just drag them on
cause they won't move or anything.

2255
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,023
I Dunno.

2256
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:54,780
Wow.

2257
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,120
Bold people before us and
figure these things out.

2258
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:58,140
Well,

2259
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,760
once you started swimming
with sharks and you're like,

2260
01:07:59,790 --> 01:07:59,911
ah,

2261
01:07:59,911 --> 01:08:01,050
sharks are also delicious.

2262
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:04,230
They are tasty and there's a
lot of meat to those fuckers.

2263
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,050
It makes sense if you could figure
out how to get them on the boat.

2264
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,430
That's the hard part.

2265
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,030
Yeah.

2266
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:09,863
Sharks tastes good.

2267
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:10,970
It tastes like swordfish.

2268
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,110
I didn't have a lot of
things age sharks before.

2269
01:08:13,111 --> 01:08:13,944
There were boats.

2270
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:14,371
Yeah.

2271
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:15,204
Right.

2272
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:15,880
Yeah.

2273
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,030
Can you imagine how different the world
was until people figured out how to make

2274
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:23,210
metal things and me for
the longest time it's like,

2275
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,871
oh,

2276
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:24,411
what'd you do?

2277
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:26,210
You made a knife with a rock.

2278
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,650
Congratulations Pussy.

2279
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:29,790
You have nobody.

2280
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:33,020
Nobody was really worried and then as
soon as they started figuring out how to

2281
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:34,070
melt down metal,

2282
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:34,670
then it was like,

2283
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:35,503
Ooh,

2284
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,520
what can we do with that?

2285
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,580
Fucking cities within cities,

2286
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:43,340
a rubbed guns start going off.

2287
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:44,480
Planes are flying,

2288
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,860
dropping bombs,

2289
01:08:45,861 --> 01:08:50,420
nuclear fucking re rate the rest
of the world that he's crazy.

2290
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:50,901
Monkeys.

2291
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:52,130
Look at the fuck they did.

2292
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,083
We got smile.

2293
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:54,590
Just figured out how to make metal.

2294
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,800
That's all metal and then electricity.

2295
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,161
It's like,

2296
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:58,431
okay,

2297
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:01,130
we need to put these two together
and see what the fuck is up.

2298
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:02,820
Very clever on that front too.

2299
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,690
The nuttiest monkeys out of all time.

2300
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:09,620
And although we used to think some
pretty stupid shit about like all,

2301
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,420
I mean we,

2302
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:15,420
we used to think cold was a thing and
like w cold was a thing with and the way

2303
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:20,300
that heats kind of a thing or a descriptor
of a thing were hotter things move

2304
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:20,571
more.

2305
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:21,051
We used to think,

2306
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:21,401
oh,

2307
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:22,580
it's like a thing.

2308
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:24,410
And here did have the absence of heat.

2309
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:24,711
Yeah.

2310
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:25,330
And they,

2311
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:28,300
they would like put buckets of like a uh,

2312
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,870
ice or something up high and then they
would watch the steam roll down and then

2313
01:09:32,871 --> 01:09:35,090
go see like cold is heavy.

2314
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,680
Cold is heavier than heat.

2315
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,060
So that's why it falls.

2316
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:38,451
Oh,

2317
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:39,260
that's interesting.

2318
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,100
They didn't realize that.

2319
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:40,760
It was just the,

2320
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,760
the act of just the characteristic
steric statistical function of the heat.

2321
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:51,490
You know what I found out today that
sulfur has to boiling points is a very

2322
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:54,080
strange thing that sulfur,

2323
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,130
when you heat it,

2324
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,260
it becomes like this liquid.

2325
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,300
And then if you heat it again,

2326
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:00,980
the liquid becomes a solid,

2327
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:02,840
like the solid rock solid.

2328
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,210
And then if you heat it again,

2329
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,470
it becomes a liquid again.

2330
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,950
It re re forms into different things.

2331
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:13,160
I think that's so cool about like Adams.

2332
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,140
There's just like three things basically.

2333
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:15,351
And um,

2334
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:16,310
it's just electrons,

2335
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:17,480
protons and neutrons.

2336
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:22,990
And you just change the number of those
and the behavior radically changes.

2337
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,490
You have chlorine,

2338
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,580
which has got like 11,

2339
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,360
11 protons in it and
it's like a noxious gas.

2340
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,480
It's like kind of green.

2341
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:34,161
It can kill.

2342
01:10:34,161 --> 01:10:34,340
Yeah.

2343
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,173
Shit like that.

2344
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,260
And then you have sodium,

2345
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:39,460
which is like 17 protons
and it's solid and a,

2346
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,210
it reacts with water to ignite.

2347
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,920
It actually ignites with water.

2348
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,900
And then you put them together
and you get table salt.

2349
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,093
No fucking sense.

2350
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:52,190
Well how about the fact that they can
take things that are absolutely illegal

2351
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,580
and then just change a little bit
of them and then sell them as bath,

2352
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:56,810
salt research chemicals,

2353
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:57,660
sir?

2354
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,880
Research Chemicals.

2355
01:10:59,060 --> 01:10:59,571
Now remember,

2356
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:02,030
we used to be able to get DMT online,

2357
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:02,571
not,

2358
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:02,900
not,

2359
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,190
not regular DMT,

2360
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:08,490
but five methoxy DMT used to be able to
go to the American Chemical Company and

2361
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,860
by research chemicals,

2362
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:10,941
that's what they were calling.

2363
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:13,800
There's still places like they
cause like their laws are about,

2364
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:15,270
uh,

2365
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,601
you know,

2366
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:19,050
they make a law about the chemical and
then somebody makes an analog when they

2367
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:21,810
change one of the pieces out and then it,

2368
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,070
it is technically illegal,

2369
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,940
but not until somebody says specifically
that that chemical's illegal.

2370
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:27,510
So,

2371
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:31,290
so they have that amount of time to
sell it and market it or whatever.

2372
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,520
And then they catch up
to it and then they,

2373
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:33,000
oh okay,

2374
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,730
we'll switch out this one and
they keep going down the line.

2375
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:36,751
Yeah.

2376
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:41,700
Well that's what they do with those
dick hardening pills to Brian buys these

2377
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:45,120
fucking things that like Brian was
telling me some lovely stories.

2378
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,860
The prize of the gas stations,

2379
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,940
the apparently those are the ones who
want the gas stations that are owned by

2380
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,630
real dude's 76 is the best one to go to.

2381
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:57,060
The gas station Shell Shell and seven 11.

2382
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:57,870
Don't get the good ones.

2383
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,730
You've got to get the real sketchy joints,

2384
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,200
liquor stores,

2385
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:03,750
those ones that'll bump liquor
stores real sketchy jointly.

2386
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:06,720
And what it is really is just Viagara.

2387
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:12,020
They just buy bulk Viagra or Cialis
and it's cheaper for them to sell that.

2388
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:14,580
Like they'll sell you a tense night.

2389
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,110
Incredibly illegal or anything.

2390
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:16,944
It's totally illegal.

2391
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,770
But they don't even get in trouble
for it because nobody's doing tests.

2392
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:20,610
Yeah,

2393
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,660
they get two warnings.

2394
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:23,400
Warnings.

2395
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,060
That's awesome.

2396
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,860
And then that just name the company.

2397
01:12:25,861 --> 01:12:26,910
But these things,

2398
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,750
you know,

2399
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,250
as long as people know they work,

2400
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:31,860
like he found out they
work in this motherfucker,

2401
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:36,570
he's like he's taking stock in the
company if you are temporary stock.

2402
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:37,800
But if you like,

2403
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:42,801
if they were doing that and selling
it as Viagara or selling it at Cialis,

2404
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,340
it's way cheaper.

2405
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,610
So it's actually more
profitable for them to sell.

2406
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:50,130
They're nutty Dick Pills
and like a little package.

2407
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,490
So an impulse buy and they're always
like right in front of you when you go to

2408
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:54,230
pay.

2409
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,560
They don't hide those bitches.

2410
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:59,010
They're right in front next to like the
energy pills and you already spending

2411
01:12:59,011 --> 01:12:59,251
money,

2412
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,330
you're going to get a pack of gum lighter.

2413
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,970
Let me get my 30 pills.

2414
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:03,960
They cards.

2415
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,793
Yeah.

2416
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:05,610
Um,

2417
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:07,650
apparently GNC and uh,

2418
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:08,310
um,

2419
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:12,990
the company that make Jack Three d is
getting sued again cause another dude

2420
01:13:12,991 --> 01:13:13,560
died.

2421
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,950
So I think they're going to pull that
if they haven't pulled that shit off all

2422
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:17,784
stores.

2423
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:20,060
I think they're going what
was in there like good.

2424
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,353
All the good stuff.

2425
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,033
Good.

2426
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,480
Anything good gets taken away.

2427
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,920
So we lost a few.

2428
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:26,401
Okay.

2429
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,121
Listen folks,

2430
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:30,780
think about how many we helped
get rolling the dice every day.

2431
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:31,830
Rolling dice.

2432
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,663
Exactly.

2433
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:33,721
I mean,

2434
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:35,460
people have died from Viagra to,

2435
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:36,421
but people like,

2436
01:13:36,421 --> 01:13:36,840
you know what?

2437
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,440
It's worth it.

2438
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,980
But the old white dudes are in charge and
they loved their Viagara and old white

2439
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:44,130
dudes are the ones that die anyway and
they figure fuck those other old white

2440
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:44,391
dude.

2441
01:13:44,391 --> 01:13:45,600
So I'm tired of this bullshit.

2442
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:48,840
Yeah.

2443
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,560
Especially old white dudes just barely
hanging on and looking at this crazy

2444
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,790
stack of cash thinking,

2445
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:54,181
okay,

2446
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,820
what I've got maybe six years left.

2447
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,400
Who can I put a fucking two right now.

2448
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:02,250
I've got a bunch of money and
I still don't feel like a man.

2449
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,910
Just some assistance.

2450
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,710
Well it would be nice if they actually
had clarity and if they realize

2451
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:08,011
listening,

2452
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:10,830
which just go balls out and then
run this bitch right into the,

2453
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:12,091
you know,

2454
01:14:12,091 --> 01:14:14,400
just fucking hit the throttle
until we hit the beach.

2455
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,241
Something more fun.

2456
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:16,320
I mean when once you,

2457
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:20,010
like if you stopped caring about sex and
stop getting hard on like how much shit

2458
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:20,844
would you get done?

2459
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,100
Nothing.

2460
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,430
Cause you would have no drive.

2461
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:25,830
This is what I say one thing for sure.

2462
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:26,910
When you stop fucking,

2463
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:29,160
you should stop driving at that age.

2464
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:30,241
They should,

2465
01:14:30,241 --> 01:14:30,480
uh,

2466
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,410
which they should do is instead of a
test to see if you know how to drive

2467
01:14:34,411 --> 01:14:35,670
fucking guy's 80 years old,

2468
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,490
they should know how to drive and
get them in a room with like Alexis,

2469
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:39,324
Texas.

2470
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:40,403
Okay.

2471
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,050
And you know your higher yeah.

2472
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:46,860
Hired to just gently rub his balls and
say sweet things to him and suck on his

2473
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:47,400
ears.

2474
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,400
And if his dick gets hard and,

2475
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:50,670
and he can have sex with her,

2476
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,930
give him his license.

2477
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,573
If not,

2478
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,780
get the fuck out of here.

2479
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:59,250
I'm super glad to don't run shit and if
he can up super glad I'm not serious.

2480
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:01,291
But if he could,

2481
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:02,124
uh,

2482
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,430
if as long as even if he could
take Viagra and stay alive,

2483
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,293
he can drive.

2484
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,820
But if you stop fucking get off the road,

2485
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,800
fuck off the road,

2486
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:11,980
what are you doing?

2487
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,560
And you getting to just
think about what the end,

2488
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:14,610
because you're driving around.

2489
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,300
How do I know you're not just going to
hit the fucking gas and drive right into

2490
01:15:18,301 --> 01:15:19,134
a bank?

2491
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,653
I don't know.

2492
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,470
How do I know life is over?

2493
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,730
How do I know your motivation?

2494
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,433
I think that's,

2495
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:26,161
you know,

2496
01:15:26,161 --> 01:15:29,280
I mean it's one of the most standard

2497
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:31,830
things.

2498
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:34,830
What do you think about
like angry people standard?

2499
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:37,230
You think about them being unfuckable,

2500
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,250
you know,

2501
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:38,911
the no one,

2502
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:39,900
no one wants them.

2503
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:40,561
They're lonely.

2504
01:15:40,561 --> 01:15:41,394
They're desperate.

2505
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:42,750
Angry people on the Internet.

2506
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:42,931
I mean,

2507
01:15:42,931 --> 01:15:44,280
how much of a cliche is that?

2508
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,971
The meanest,

2509
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:45,571
nastiest,

2510
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:50,240
angry people who have zero chance of
getting any pussy ass beating their Dixon

2511
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:51,600
to the ground on porn,

2512
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:52,201
on the Internet,

2513
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:54,600
and then yelling at people
and no one loves them.

2514
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:56,383
Rylands

2515
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:58,913
yeah.

2516
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,210
Then what happens?

2517
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:00,960
Huh?

2518
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,950
Then what happens

2519
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,710
is poor fox,

2520
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,750
they get all angry and they get crazy.

2521
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:09,030
Get nutty.

2522
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,650
If we could just find people to fuck them,

2523
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,480
look at settle the whole thing down.

2524
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:14,780
But the problem is they
might be your kids.

2525
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,010
J D absolutely not.

2526
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,270
Most kids are anybody's kids.

2527
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,410
It could be anybody's kids.

2528
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:20,670
You say absolutely not yours,

2529
01:16:20,671 --> 01:16:21,510
but one day,

2530
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,490
maybe so and then one day.

2531
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,570
What if you know,

2532
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:29,630
we need people to volunteer for the armed
service in Iraq or the department of

2533
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,390
motor vehicles to fuck all people.

2534
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,990
What would you take?

2535
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,650
Do you want your [inaudible] Glenn?

2536
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:39,690
I would want my kid going to the DMV.

2537
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:39,960
Yeah,

2538
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:40,680
absolutely.

2539
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:40,981
I mean,

2540
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:41,970
sex above violence.

2541
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,340
Sex with old is probably violence.

2542
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:44,610
Hell,

2543
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:45,690
don't blow people up.

2544
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:46,800
He's just blow them

2545
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,870
and keep our roads safe.

2546
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,090
Keep everybody happier.

2547
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,200
A lot of people going be happy.

2548
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:56,100
Well that's the problem with,

2549
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:56,933
with uh,

2550
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:59,270
prostitution to prostitution's legal.

2551
01:16:59,271 --> 01:16:59,521
I mean,

2552
01:16:59,521 --> 01:17:01,680
somebody is fucking somebody's kid,

2553
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,480
but I mean somebody who's probably doing
that anyway and I kids enjoying it.

2554
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:08,070
But what if that kid's
doing it for a living?

2555
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,623
It's good.

2556
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:10,921
Are they good at it?

2557
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:11,070
To me,

2558
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:15,800
there isn't a natural though that we
have this aversion to that prostitution.

2559
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,790
Yeah.

2560
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:18,410
I'd been prostituted if I was a girl.

2561
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:18,621
No,

2562
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:19,251
I don't think there's any,

2563
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:19,491
no,

2564
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:20,150
get me wrong.

2565
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,920
I don't think there's anything
wrong with prostitution,

2566
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:23,270
but I think there is,

2567
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:27,590
there's a natural aversion to
everything I think are in his gun.

2568
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:28,251
Sound fucked up.

2569
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:31,760
But I think our system exactly as it
is right now is absolutely natural.

2570
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:32,961
Our jealousy,

2571
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:33,711
I nonsense.

2572
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:36,470
Our hypocrisy are every,

2573
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:41,500
every weird aspect about our culture
from feminism to progressive's to

2574
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,380
Republican ards to,

2575
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:45,770
you know,

2576
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,720
to the top,

2577
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:48,171
to the bottom,

2578
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:49,220
from conservative to liberal.

2579
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,090
I think it's all natural.

2580
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:54,750
I think we are in charge of the actual
is I'm a wolf colony in the islands

2581
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,480
valence natural,

2582
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,960
like aren't we a little smarter than that?

2583
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:58,401
Yeah,

2584
01:17:58,401 --> 01:17:59,121
I would think so.

2585
01:17:59,121 --> 01:17:59,541
Yes,

2586
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:03,920
but I'm not sure because I'm thinking
sometimes I think yes we are because we're

2587
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:04,790
self aware,

2588
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:08,540
but look at how everything continues
to move basically in the same sort of

2589
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:09,374
interaction.

2590
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,670
It's the mass.

2591
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:12,210
It's definitely moving as one.

2592
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:12,680
I'm like,

2593
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,280
yes,

2594
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,280
not really paying attention clearly as
one despite the massive access to it that

2595
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:20,090
we have now and I wonder it's,

2596
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,910
but I want you to think of that me be,

2597
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:26,360
but I wonder if also even that is a
part of the process that the access to

2598
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:30,140
information like slowly but surely a
truth evolves it into another thing and

2599
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:33,920
that all of these are natural reactions
is just so complex and multifaceted and

2600
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:38,000
fractal that from the outside looking
in or even from the inside looking out,

2601
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,160
it's very hard to
understand and recognize.

2602
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,330
That's why all natural,

2603
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,320
I'm pretty like,

2604
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:45,830
I'm not super interested
in like getting to,

2605
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:46,071
like,

2606
01:18:46,071 --> 01:18:50,150
I don't want to lead any movements or
anything because shit's just like the

2607
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:52,100
human race is going to
do what it's going to do.

2608
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,091
And I mean,

2609
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:53,990
I could tweak it,

2610
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:58,970
but I'm kind of content to just watch
and see because it's going to develop or

2611
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:00,860
we're going to crash into the dirt.

2612
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:01,970
But it,

2613
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,470
the human race is moving.

2614
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,183
It's like,

2615
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,470
like trying to stop a flood.

2616
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,553
Yeah.

2617
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,620
Who was it that said that was an Einstein?

2618
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,310
Someone said that the
human races involved in,

2619
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:13,730
uh,

2620
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:17,240
human beings are involved in a race
between education and catastrophe.

2621
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,130
I don't think I've heard that.

2622
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:20,600
Someone said it wasn't Sam.

2623
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:21,010
Truthfully,

2624
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,070
there's someone like him,

2625
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:22,993
so great man.

2626
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,253
Um,

2627
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,630
I don't remember who the,

2628
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,690
but I've always felt that when
I first read that I was like,

2629
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,200
yes,

2630
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,880
that's what I've always felt like,

2631
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:32,151
man,

2632
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:34,160
I hope we get it together first.

2633
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:34,611
You know,

2634
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:36,170
like I always felt like
when I was growing up,

2635
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,460
when I was a kid in high school,

2636
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,300
um,

2637
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:43,070
it was the red scare and everyone was
really legitimately worried that we're

2638
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,930
going to have a nuclear war with Russia.

2639
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,070
Like you'd go to school,

2640
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:51,071
you go to history lessons and they would
show you Hiroshima and Nagasaki and you

2641
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:51,231
know,

2642
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:53,450
the effects of nuclear
bombs and you're like,

2643
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:54,284
whoa.

2644
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:57,470
And everybody was terrified when
I was in school that we were,

2645
01:19:57,471 --> 01:20:00,260
and that's where red dawn came
from and all that crazy shit.

2646
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:01,490
Everyone was scared.

2647
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,673
Um,

2648
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:07,690
but I think sometimes when
you look at human behavior,

2649
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:13,860
when you look at just even the
most fucked up aspects of it,

2650
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,820
I really do wonder if all that
shit is not a natural part of our,

2651
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,710
like our motivation to,

2652
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,571
to move forward.

2653
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:25,300
Like why would

2654
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,440
careful how we got here,

2655
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:30,010
why we wouldn't be here
if we weren't successful.

2656
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:33,250
And we have to assume that just about
everything that people do is part of that

2657
01:20:33,251 --> 01:20:33,671
success.

2658
01:20:33,671 --> 01:20:35,740
Otherwise it would have
been weaned out somewhere.

2659
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:36,550
So it,

2660
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:39,040
so it was useful like for survival.

2661
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,240
And then the night,

2662
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:41,410
now we've got some new,

2663
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:44,620
there's also that aspect of humans
where we don't really get anything done

2664
01:20:44,621 --> 01:20:45,460
unless we're desperate,

2665
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:46,540
you know?

2666
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:46,841
I mean,

2667
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:48,100
when do you reactionary,

2668
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,830
when you're fat and rich and
you've got all the money you need,

2669
01:20:50,831 --> 01:20:53,020
how motivated are you to get up and run?

2670
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:53,963
I'm all good.

2671
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,600
If you live in a warm climate and you've
got to stick to pull termites off of

2672
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:58,471
out of a hill,

2673
01:20:58,471 --> 01:20:59,040
like why,

2674
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,780
why do anything?

2675
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:00,040
Yes,

2676
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,020
you can eat those termites.

2677
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:01,980
Well,

2678
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:02,611
have you ever,

2679
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:03,040
you know,

2680
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,930
you know those things that people do,

2681
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:06,340
like when they lose a job,

2682
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,930
where they get their shit together,

2683
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:11,170
like they get fired from a job and all
sudden they'll tell you a year later it

2684
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:13,570
was the best thing that ever happened
to me and made me get my shit together,

2685
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:14,620
made me getting gear.

2686
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:16,630
I started pursuing the
career I really wanted.

2687
01:21:16,631 --> 01:21:17,560
Now I'm super happy.

2688
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,150
But for awhile there,

2689
01:21:19,151 --> 01:21:19,540
man,

2690
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,800
I was fucking scared.

2691
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:23,260
And that is what motivated people.

2692
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,150
That's,

2693
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,090
that's what motivated,

2694
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:25,630
uh,

2695
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:25,841
I've,

2696
01:21:25,841 --> 01:21:27,700
I've talked to so many people
that have had that issue.

2697
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,361
Breakups.

2698
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:29,140
Do it too.

2699
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:32,610
You get dumped and then you realize I
am kind of a fucking loser and you need

2700
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,580
your shit together.

2701
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,040
It's like it's super

2702
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:35,920
common with people.

2703
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,690
It's not until you get
it pointed out to you,

2704
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:38,110
you know,

2705
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:39,640
like not until he gets scared.

2706
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,503
Yeah.

2707
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,251
Desperate.

2708
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:42,600
Whether you're scared of the Russians,

2709
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:43,980
are you scared of the North Koreans?

2710
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:45,330
Are you scared of Al Qaeda?

2711
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:50,490
It's almost like these sort of scenarios
and situations are almost like put in

2712
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:52,080
place in order for us to continue,

2713
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:54,630
continue this movement as a whole.

2714
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:55,464
This bizarre.

2715
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:56,810
Yeah.

2716
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:57,140
Yeah.

2717
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,490
If not that something else,

2718
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,530
like something needs to come along or,

2719
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:00,951
I mean,

2720
01:22:00,951 --> 01:22:01,161
you know,

2721
01:22:01,161 --> 01:22:01,550
we,

2722
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,680
if we keep just doing the same
thing over and over and over,

2723
01:22:03,681 --> 01:22:04,250
as we,

2724
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,630
as everything else keeps growing,

2725
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:10,970
like that one behavior isn't going to
fit the same pattern when it's larger.

2726
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:11,960
So we have to,

2727
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,010
it's like switching gears.

2728
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,760
You've got to constantly find something
new to deal with the new environment,

2729
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:17,690
steel with new,

2730
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,553
the new everything.

2731
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,420
So you a,

2732
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:23,650
I know that you listen to this podcast
on occasion and I know also in the,

2733
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:28,430
you're a very bright young man and also
a tad skeptical or share a little bit.

2734
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:32,060
Is there anything that
really stood out recently?

2735
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,600
Anything where you were listened
to the podcasts were like,

2736
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,473
yeah.

2737
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:36,560
Yeah.

2738
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:36,941
Well I,

2739
01:22:36,941 --> 01:22:39,080
I mean the easy ones career I guess,

2740
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:40,430
but we could talk a little bit.

2741
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,620
What are you trying to say sir?

2742
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,553
Uh,

2743
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:45,380
I mean that guy was obviously a shyster.

2744
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,560
How dare you,

2745
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,160
how dare bulls.

2746
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:50,994
Are you

2747
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:56,390
trying to educate the world
about the alien invasion?

2748
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,200
Possible?

2749
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:01,520
Imminent alien invasion doesn't seem as
worried and this is perhaps someone else

2750
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,410
because he's huge.

2751
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:03,141
But yeah,

2752
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:03,974
he's pretty good.

2753
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,160
It's got a giant arms and shit.

2754
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:07,110
He's ready to fight anybody.

2755
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,750
He just sounds like all of the
other scammers doesn't eat.

2756
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:10,810
I got a little bit,

2757
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:11,640
uh,

2758
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,870
he's got DNA evidence.

2759
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:17,650
Apparently he hasn't put
out soon to be released.

2760
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:20,920
I don't think that she
is soon to be released.

2761
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:21,820
But if the mood,

2762
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,990
like why would you wait?

2763
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,003
Skeptical.

2764
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,233
Skeptical.

2765
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:26,990
He's get a DNA.

2766
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:27,790
DNA.

2767
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,920
You remember recently the,

2768
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:29,171
the,

2769
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:29,710
the,

2770
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,270
the big foot DNA thing?

2771
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:31,781
Yes.

2772
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:32,740
Melba catch him.

2773
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:33,120
Yeah.

2774
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:33,490
Yeah.

2775
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,470
And you know what they
did was they made up,

2776
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,500
have their own journal and made up
their own journal and then you go to the

2777
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:41,680
journal and you go to the list of
articles and it's just that one fucking

2778
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:42,280
article.

2779
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,840
And even there they didn't
put like they don't,

2780
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,220
why wouldn't you put the information out?

2781
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,520
Aren't,

2782
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:45,860
aren't they?

2783
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,390
Why aren't these people
are always concerned about
information about information

2784
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:50,260
being free and shit.

2785
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,140
The,

2786
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:53,650
the big foot thing is very funny.

2787
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:56,800
I Wa I have gotten to the point where,

2788
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:57,730
um,

2789
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:59,800
I watch finding bigfoot,

2790
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,000
I fucking Dvr,

2791
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:01,863
Dvr it.

2792
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:06,190
And I just fast forward to the parts
where they in the woods with a night

2793
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:06,760
vision.

2794
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:11,200
Cause these mother fuckers
never see shit ever.

2795
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:14,620
But they'd been on for two seasons now.

2796
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,800
So it's two seasons of every week.

2797
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,060
They're in the woods,

2798
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:20,470
every week's cheapest shit.

2799
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:21,550
Like why would they cancel?

2800
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:24,620
It was just two assholes in the
woods with some night vision.

2801
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:25,080
How that,

2802
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,410
you'd know that.

2803
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:31,440
The crazy thing about that show is that
even more so than like storage wars,

2804
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:32,711
you know,

2805
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:34,330
they're really not finding anything.

2806
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:36,130
And if they did find it,

2807
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,660
you would hear about it on TV.

2808
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,370
Just like the ghost hunters.

2809
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,233
Yes.

2810
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,620
Well the ghost hunters,

2811
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:42,723
you know,

2812
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:44,770
the ghost hunters are really interesting.

2813
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,650
I watched a,

2814
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,530
I don't remember which show it was,

2815
01:24:47,531 --> 01:24:48,820
but that the guys act,

2816
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:50,380
I think his name is Zack Baggins.

2817
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:51,580
He's the head guy.

2818
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:51,991
It seemed,

2819
01:24:51,991 --> 01:24:52,691
it was a fun show.

2820
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:55,540
They were drinking and
doing shots and shit.

2821
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:55,811
I was like,

2822
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:55,991
wow,

2823
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:58,090
this isn't your regular
a ghost hunter show.

2824
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:59,800
But then they went to this,

2825
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:00,190
uh,

2826
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:03,640
this place that was supposed to be
haunted and they recorded a sound like you

2827
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,260
could hear like a woman's voice.

2828
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:06,310
And I was like,

2829
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:06,640
wow,

2830
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,121
that's fucked.

2831
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:08,380
I wonder what the fuck that really was.

2832
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:09,580
Whether it's fuckery,

2833
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:10,091
whether it's,

2834
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:10,301
you know,

2835
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:11,650
someone's playing games,

2836
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:12,340
whether,

2837
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,990
whether the house has a memory,

2838
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:17,620
but I still have never seen a fucking,

2839
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:18,530
something like Gumroad.

2840
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,710
Deltoros Mama,

2841
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,123
you know,

2842
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,890
running the camera like the best,

2843
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,830
the best evidence they can ever give
you is we don't know what it is.

2844
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,210
Like it's either like you,

2845
01:25:29,211 --> 01:25:29,891
fos it's,

2846
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:30,551
you could point out,

2847
01:25:30,551 --> 01:25:31,301
oh maybe it was this,

2848
01:25:31,301 --> 01:25:32,134
maybe it was that.

2849
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,490
But you can never,

2850
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,660
it's never any better than,

2851
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,440
I don't know.

2852
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:35,681
Yeah.

2853
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:37,910
But the UFO places that they,

2854
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:41,770
when the or the ghost places
when they go looking for them,

2855
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,170
they like look for heat
signatures and shit like that.

2856
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:44,620
And they,

2857
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:44,980
they,

2858
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:49,980
they wear these clothes that actually
have like thermometers on the close to

2859
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:52,390
detect cool breezes and shit.

2860
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:55,420
Oh,

2861
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:55,781
cool.

2862
01:25:55,781 --> 01:25:58,030
Breeze indicates of ghostly presence.

2863
01:25:58,031 --> 01:25:58,900
I don't know if he knew that.

2864
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,140
I didn't know that.

2865
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:00,580
You know,

2866
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:04,430
you can detect magic
with machinery is scary.

2867
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,540
Cool breeze could be um,

2868
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,140
a voice from beyond.

2869
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:13,580
So every evening I'm
enjoying the ghostly manners.

2870
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,010
Sopping up from a lake side or something.

2871
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,053
A joke.

2872
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:20,990
You posted a photo of you eating
a raw horse meat the other day.

2873
01:26:20,991 --> 01:26:22,640
Why the fuck would you do that?

2874
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:22,940
Like,

2875
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,050
why would you like that?

2876
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:25,550
Is this a disgusting?

2877
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:29,210
But that's pretty scary to do
because of the parasites and shit.

2878
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:30,141
No,

2879
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:33,710
actually I'm a horse doesn't
really have parasites.

2880
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:36,890
Well you have to worry about parasites
in mostly carnivorous animals.

2881
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,840
Like you have to worry
about parasites and pigs.

2882
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:39,650
That's what pigs,

2883
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:42,920
it's very important to cook them all the
way through because you can get strict,

2884
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:43,480
uh,

2885
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,680
or trigger gnosis.

2886
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:49,690
And that's an horse chicken Dosa
that's found in horse a lot actually.

2887
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,010
And Horsley cross contamination.

2888
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:55,460
It's probably a shitty
a place that doesn't,

2889
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:56,240
um,

2890
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:56,391
winning,

2891
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:57,050
we'll call it,

2892
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:57,380
uh,

2893
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,070
take care of the meat.

2894
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,820
Right.

2895
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:59,091
But,

2896
01:26:59,091 --> 01:26:59,271
uh,

2897
01:26:59,271 --> 01:27:00,140
with cows,

2898
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,070
um,

2899
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,120
people do it all the time.

2900
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:04,250
I think the real thing
to worry about the cows,

2901
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:05,020
he lie.

2902
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,440
I don't think you have to
worry about tricking houses.

2903
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:07,760
Yeah,

2904
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,000
it should.

2905
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,530
We do with bears you deal with,

2906
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,251
you deal with horse.

2907
01:27:10,251 --> 01:27:11,420
It's actually pretty common.

2908
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,120
Uh,

2909
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,070
it also,

2910
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:14,330
it's a bait.

2911
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,870
There's no way for them to test
what drugs the horse had had,

2912
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:17,100
had,

2913
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:17,890
had been given.

2914
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:20,060
I had heard my horse had all the drugs,

2915
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,223
how it helps.

2916
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,490
Like it could be given some,

2917
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:22,701
some,

2918
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:23,630
some bad shit.

2919
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:24,470
And it maybe,

2920
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:25,311
you know what,

2921
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:25,611
we,

2922
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:25,761
uh,

2923
01:27:25,761 --> 01:27:26,810
we ended at Joe Beef,

2924
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:30,170
this place of Montreal and I had
horse meat the last time I was there.

2925
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:31,460
I had a like,

2926
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:33,350
cooked and this time they served at Ra.

2927
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,150
We just ate everything they brought over.

2928
01:27:35,151 --> 01:27:37,340
We didn't question cause they're awesome.

2929
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,140
These guys are that we had,

2930
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:39,950
um,

2931
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:41,780
we had veal that wasn't,

2932
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,673
uh,

2933
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:44,390
like when you think of veal,

2934
01:27:44,391 --> 01:27:48,380
you think of a baby cow that they take
and they tie it up and they feed it milk.

2935
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:49,910
This was just a baby cow.

2936
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:50,631
That's kind of,

2937
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:50,991
I was like,

2938
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:51,181
man,

2939
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:51,981
that's kind of fuck up.

2940
01:27:51,981 --> 01:27:53,060
They killed his cow young.

2941
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:54,500
But then it's like,

2942
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:56,720
why is it better lives to be 10?

2943
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:57,380
And then they kill it.

2944
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,213
Like I don't get,

2945
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,213
it doesn't really,

2946
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,333
they're killing them.

2947
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,633
It's not like,

2948
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,440
you know,

2949
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:02,790
it's not,

2950
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:02,920
well,

2951
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:07,130
it's not like it missed out
on like football games and TV.

2952
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,220
I don't think they traipse
through daisies or anything.

2953
01:28:09,221 --> 01:28:10,220
I don't know how much their life,

2954
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:10,740
they're really,

2955
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:11,100
I mean,

2956
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:11,660
I wouldn't,

2957
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,980
I wouldn't have done it myself,

2958
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:13,970
but they had already killed it,

2959
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:14,804
so I hate it.

2960
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:15,763
Um,

2961
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:16,551
and then they had,

2962
01:28:16,551 --> 01:28:17,030
um,

2963
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:19,160
a bunch of other weird shit
that they brought over.

2964
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:20,180
But the restaurant,

2965
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:21,260
if you're ever in Montreal,

2966
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:21,861
you got to go there.

2967
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:22,730
It's called Joe Beef.

2968
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:23,840
The place is incredible.

2969
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,460
It looks really good.

2970
01:28:25,461 --> 01:28:26,294
It's amazing.

2971
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,860
The horse thing gets to me.

2972
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:30,830
I want to just wanna eat
horse and to eating it raw.

2973
01:28:30,831 --> 01:28:33,920
Just I'd like when I was a little weird.

2974
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,390
It's fucking delicious,

2975
01:28:35,391 --> 01:28:35,661
man.

2976
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:36,141
I'm telling you.

2977
01:28:36,141 --> 01:28:36,950
It's delicious.

2978
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:38,930
It's really tasted ice cream,

2979
01:28:38,931 --> 01:28:40,820
both cooked and raw,

2980
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:42,343
um,

2981
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:42,851
that uh,

2982
01:28:42,851 --> 01:28:43,970
that Joe beef place.

2983
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:44,241
Oh,

2984
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:47,600
the other thing they have is this
thing called the fog was double down.

2985
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:51,200
You know how like Kentucky Fried Chicken
has that double down where it's too

2986
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:53,930
chicken patties and cheese
and ridiculously decadent

2987
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,060
chicken.

2988
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:56,220
Yeah,

2989
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:56,370
yeah,

2990
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:56,661
yeah.

2991
01:28:56,661 --> 01:28:57,890
The bread becomes chicken.

2992
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:58,281
Well,

2993
01:28:58,281 --> 01:28:59,810
they did that with fall.

2994
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:02,490
Guam with Fagua is,

2995
01:29:02,491 --> 01:29:02,910
um,

2996
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:03,240
it's,

2997
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,870
this should be a better way to say that.

2998
01:29:04,871 --> 01:29:06,660
It doesn't sound so fucking pretentious.

2999
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,170
I'm having Fagua Darling in a Chablis.

3000
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,820
It's a Ross.

3001
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,230
It's duck liver.

3002
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:18,300
They take a duck's liver and it actually
became illegal in California recently.

3003
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,320
My favorite place to get it
at this restaurant doesn't
serve it anymore because

3004
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:23,410
people became p,

3005
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:23,850
uh,

3006
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,770
like Peta and animal rights people.

3007
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:26,690
Um,

3008
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:27,050
they,

3009
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,050
they made this campaign,

3010
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:30,960
it tried to stop people from doing it
because they force feed these ducks,

3011
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:33,990
they force feed them and their
livers blow up their livers.

3012
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,160
Livers get huge.

3013
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:37,110
And when is it a duck or geese?

3014
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,860
Duck.

3015
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,360
Duck.

3016
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,193
Okay.

3017
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:39,690
Right.

3018
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:40,650
I think my biggies,

3019
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:41,400
let's,

3020
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,320
let's bow tie V,

3021
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:43,591
e,

3022
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:43,831
r,

3023
01:29:43,831 --> 01:29:44,011
a,

3024
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:44,844
s,

3025
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:45,690
m,

3026
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:46,660
whatever it is.

3027
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:48,510
It could be both.

3028
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:49,291
It's both actually.

3029
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,730
You've both duck or goose.

3030
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,873
Um,

3031
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:52,720
they,

3032
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,120
they,

3033
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,060
they force feed them.

3034
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:57,510
They put it like a feeding tube down
their throat and they pump them up with

3035
01:29:57,511 --> 01:30:00,210
food and then it makes
their liver grow huge.

3036
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,010
And then you take that
liver and you cook it.

3037
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,040
What's really fucked up is
you can't do that anymore,

3038
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:08,050
but you can still eat them
so you can still kill him.

3039
01:30:08,051 --> 01:30:10,280
But now you got to throw
away their liver out.

3040
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,280
Yeah.

3041
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,130
You can't even have like
organically harvested,

3042
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,540
non forced fed.

3043
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,990
They can't even do liver.

3044
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:17,430
No,

3045
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,990
you just can't eat duck liver.

3046
01:30:18,991 --> 01:30:20,430
Whether or not it's being force fed.

3047
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,440
I don't think you're allowed to
sell it at a restaurant anymore.

3048
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,210
I mean I think if it's your own duck.

3049
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,073
What's that?

3050
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,943
I just thought it's something,

3051
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:30,540
I think if it's your own duck and maybe
like you're slaughtering your own duck,

3052
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,680
you're allowed to eat it's liver,

3053
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:36,710
but I'm pretty sure the band
is not just because of um,

3054
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,670
first aid and force feeding.

3055
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,510
And by the way,

3056
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:40,890
if you see a farm,

3057
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:42,380
these um,

3058
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:47,130
the like these animals actually hover
around the force feeding tube because they

3059
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:47,964
want to get fed.

3060
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,450
Well,

3061
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:48,900
it's easy.

3062
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:49,260
Sure.

3063
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,310
It's not only that,

3064
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:54,120
it's like it looks horrific to us that
they take a tube and throw it down.

3065
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,560
They don't have gag reflexes.

3066
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:55,960
They don't look,

3067
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:00,180
they don't have an awareness that like
all it's doing is making their liver fat

3068
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:00,841
like,

3069
01:31:00,841 --> 01:31:01,321
and we're like,

3070
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:02,670
it's so horrible.

3071
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:06,390
What about the fact that we're going
to cut it fucking head off and cook it?

3072
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:07,190
Is that,

3073
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:08,280
what should we stop doing that?

3074
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,440
I mean it's step one to stop doing that.

3075
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:11,041
It's what it is.

3076
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:15,060
It's like a slow road to someone telling
you there's something wrong with it.

3077
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,800
Like sweet killed all their predators.

3078
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,960
And then I guess it's our
responsibility to be killing them.

3079
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:19,903
We asked to kill them,

3080
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,480
but even if we don't kill their predators,

3081
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:22,500
what predators are ducks?

3082
01:31:22,501 --> 01:31:23,191
How also ducks,

3083
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:24,024
her rapist,

3084
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:25,803
brutal rubbish.

3085
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:27,870
But they don't have a lot of predators.

3086
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,630
I mean the once we want to bring
crocodiles to every fucking pond,

3087
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,000
the,

3088
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,120
the number one Predator
for ducks as humans,

3089
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,070
there's really not a lot of other things.

3090
01:31:35,071 --> 01:31:35,611
Killing ducks.

3091
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:36,540
I think cars,

3092
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,161
you know,

3093
01:31:37,161 --> 01:31:37,440
I mean,

3094
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,300
what the fuck is it
getting killed by a duck?

3095
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,690
That just made me really sad killing.

3096
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,240
I think I've ever seen
a duck hit by a car.

3097
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:43,403
Really.

3098
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:48,470
It's like this and then its feathers
and shit and you're not even allowed to

3099
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:51,660
pick that duck up and cook
it with strange people.

3100
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:52,620
I've been talking to,

3101
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:52,980
um,

3102
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,311
you know,

3103
01:31:53,311 --> 01:31:53,421
I,

3104
01:31:53,421 --> 01:31:55,020
I went hunting and I shot that deer,

3105
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:56,970
that deer head that's right there.

3106
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:58,290
And I've had,

3107
01:31:58,291 --> 01:31:59,050
um,

3108
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,700
some legit conversations

3109
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:05,700
with people that are intelligent
people that actually are upset by that.

3110
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,160
And even people that eat meat.

3111
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,623
And I'm like,

3112
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,650
why you,

3113
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,450
you know that if you eat meat,

3114
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,010
somebody had to do that.

3115
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,920
So many different though
between knowing yeah.

3116
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,410
Was right in front of you.

3117
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:25,000
Like I'm most me is like unrecognizable
and it looks like Plato where something

3118
01:32:25,001 --> 01:32:26,560
like a steak burger.

3119
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:26,891
Yeah.

3120
01:32:26,891 --> 01:32:27,724
Right.

3121
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:32,730
But that disconnect between the person
and the act of actually doing the thing

3122
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:35,650
and killing the thing anyway.

3123
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,700
Fuck Wad double down.

3124
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:37,511
If you're in Montreal,

3125
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:38,770
it's the shit they take.

3126
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:39,100
They,

3127
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,290
they deep fry a piece of fog wall with
like Kentucky Fried Chicken type of

3128
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,790
breading on the outside
with cheese in the center.

3129
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,460
It's unbelievable.

3130
01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:48,370
It's so good.

3131
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,391
Yeah.

3132
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:51,460
There's a photo of our eating it on my,

3133
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,380
my not my own on a tumbler,

3134
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,850
my whatever the fuck it is.

3135
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,650
Uh,

3136
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:57,250
Instagram,

3137
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,470
there's Instagram and
there's this group and,

3138
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:00,910
and Houston that uh,

3139
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:02,323
uh,

3140
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,950
like once a month they get together and
everybody brings like meat and food and

3141
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,270
they slice it up and,

3142
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:09,940
and share like everybody shares
all the food they bring in.

3143
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,900
And the guy that heads it,

3144
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:11,561
uh,

3145
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:12,040
he,

3146
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:15,520
he picked up some rabbits from a pet store
and he's been breeding them for food.

3147
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:16,723
Whoa.

3148
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:17,903
It's pretty neat.

3149
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,461
Pretty tasty.

3150
01:33:18,461 --> 01:33:18,891
I had some,

3151
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:19,240
uh,

3152
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,300
it might've been liver or something.

3153
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:22,340
I don't know if it's worth a little bit,

3154
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,171
a little bit,

3155
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:23,611
but then you,

3156
01:33:23,611 --> 01:33:24,161
you come in,

3157
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:24,911
you're hanging out with people,

3158
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:25,744
you learn a little bit.

3159
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:26,650
Some,

3160
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:28,030
isn't it weird though this um,

3161
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:28,420
this,

3162
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,910
this distinction we have
one way or the other,

3163
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:32,770
you know like rabbit,

3164
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,470
Ooh you're crossing into gray area.

3165
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:36,720
But if you kill the cat,

3166
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:37,630
hey man,

3167
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,740
don't kill cats.

3168
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:39,450
Like,

3169
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:41,770
like there aren't too many cats.

3170
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:42,880
Can't kill a dog.

3171
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:47,620
But I watched Ted Nugent shoot a coyote
and the head today he has traps set up

3172
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:48,454
around his property.

3173
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:53,560
I think that's actually part of a lot
of like the reason people and in urban

3174
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:56,680
areas are like environmental activists.

3175
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,520
Like most of the environmental activist
are there cause cause we killed all the

3176
01:34:00,521 --> 01:34:02,020
unpleasant animals that live in cities.

3177
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:05,740
It's just like squirrels
and birds tweeting around
and everything's lovely and

3178
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:06,310
adorable.

3179
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:08,970
You never seen a wolf
ripping a cow apart backyard.

3180
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,660
No asshole animals live in the city.

3181
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:11,494
We got rid of him.

3182
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,330
Yeah.

3183
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:14,080
So that's your view of nature.

3184
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:15,130
It's just really pleasant.

3185
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,660
I posted this thing about wolves and
they got into this sort of debate about

3186
01:34:19,661 --> 01:34:21,100
wolves when people were talking about,

3187
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:21,810
you know,

3188
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:22,643
like uh,

3189
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:24,670
plans on killing wolves and people here,

3190
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:25,180
the tar,

3191
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,170
how could you kill a wolf?

3192
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:26,820
How could you,

3193
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:31,820
and then I posted this list of people
killed by wolves throughout history and

3194
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:33,370
it's a pretty fucking substantial,

3195
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:33,940
is that right?

3196
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:38,860
The reason why we have these like Little
Red Riding Hood and the big bad wolf

3197
01:34:38,861 --> 01:34:43,510
and all these wolf images in and
our past and stories and stuff,

3198
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,540
it's because wolves were
killing people all the time.

3199
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,460
I mean it was fairly common.

3200
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:53,380
There was a time in France where in
Paris a wolves killed more than 40 people

3201
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,140
huffing and puffing and Park in Paris.

3202
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:58,170
Mac when it looked

3203
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:01,700
like a gangs of New York neighborhood.

3204
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:02,460
Yeah,

3205
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:02,971
exactly.

3206
01:35:02,971 --> 01:35:03,880
What that showed.

3207
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:08,900
You see this dog or this a dog whisperer
video that they posted recently of him

3208
01:35:09,421 --> 01:35:10,530
getting attacked by a dog?

3209
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:11,340
No Way.

3210
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:11,770
Yeah,

3211
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:13,230
I won't play the audio so it won't,

3212
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,370
so hopefully you won't get pulled,

3213
01:35:14,371 --> 01:35:14,820
you know.

3214
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:15,180
Uh,

3215
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:19,930
but it's called dog whisperer show
down with Holly and Holly Band.

3216
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:24,860
It gets pretty crazy cause he was saying
like how this dog is barking and he'd

3217
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:29,861
look like try it bites him right there
and then he kicks the dog dog fucked him

3218
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:31,260
up.

3219
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,130
And then if,

3220
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:36,740
if after a while his hand starts
getting really swol and uh,

3221
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:37,710
just starts bleeding,

3222
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,370
blood just starts pouring out of his hand.

3223
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:42,250
His hands fucked right now dog.

3224
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:43,380
No,

3225
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,730
that dog bit the shit out of him,

3226
01:35:44,731 --> 01:35:44,971
man.

3227
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:46,110
I taught clamped on outlook.

3228
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:46,760
What's up?

3229
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:46,960
Yeah,

3230
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:47,820
he's cornering it.

3231
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,080
He's been standing there for me.

3232
01:35:49,081 --> 01:35:49,914
See if this works.

3233
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:51,660
His genitals right?

3234
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,173
Yeah.

3235
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,570
She's still not submissive.

3236
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,453
Damn.

3237
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:56,523
Um,

3238
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:57,181
yeah,

3239
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:57,480
he's,

3240
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,790
why would you even get
so close to look at that?

3241
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:00,270
Oh,

3242
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:01,710
he's a strange cat.

3243
01:36:01,711 --> 01:36:02,544
This guy,

3244
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:05,210
you're seeing the things he does with
dogs and one of the things he does is he

3245
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,400
kicks them on the side.

3246
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:06,800
Yeah,

3247
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,100
you just tapped him on the side,

3248
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:12,270
which I actually took some on the
body that I don't like kick it hard,

3249
01:36:12,271 --> 01:36:16,140
but my dog and my parents' dog when we're
like playing tug of war and I just tap

3250
01:36:16,141 --> 01:36:17,160
her as she gets pissed,

3251
01:36:17,161 --> 01:36:17,994
but she doesn't want to let go.

3252
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:18,550
Right,

3253
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:18,850
right,

3254
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:19,683
right.

3255
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:20,300
Yeah.

3256
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,390
When there's a domination,

3257
01:36:21,391 --> 01:36:22,410
does she bite him again?

3258
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:22,860
No.

3259
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:23,340
No.

3260
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:26,250
Does he see now is when
she started smiling?

3261
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,140
So now you can't look
at it took five minutes,

3262
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:30,240
but just staring at the dog until he,

3263
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:31,860
whatever turns around.

3264
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:32,261
Yeah,

3265
01:36:32,261 --> 01:36:33,310
that's a pussy dog.

3266
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:34,211
Try that shit.

3267
01:36:34,211 --> 01:36:38,260
What a rottweiler or a pit bull that grabs
a hold of your hand and won't let go.

3268
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:43,320
I a Ui Ouchie Ouchie yeah,

3269
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,360
that guy.

3270
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,950
Uh,

3271
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:45,430
he's,

3272
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,970
you know,

3273
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:46,803
it's a dog.

3274
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,450
You can't always get a dog
to do what you want to do.

3275
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,510
Their fucking head.

3276
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:51,820
You gotta be a weird dude.

3277
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,833
Maybe that's what that is.

3278
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,630
So this a episode of the Ted
Nugent show that I watched today.

3279
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:56,560
He's a,

3280
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,270
he's got these traps set up all around
his property because he lives on hundreds

3281
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:03,790
of acres and he hunts in his
yard like Montana or something,

3282
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:03,970
right?

3283
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:04,480
No,

3284
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,650
he's got two places.

3285
01:37:05,651 --> 01:37:08,350
He's got a place in Michigan
but he doesn't live in anymore.

3286
01:37:08,351 --> 01:37:13,351
And now he lives in Texas and in
Texas he lives outside of Waco and um,

3287
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:15,190
he's got this huge ranch,

3288
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:18,340
like hundreds of acres with wild animals
running around all over the ranch.

3289
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,960
And it's Kinda crazy.

3290
01:37:19,961 --> 01:37:21,760
Like it's a hunting show.

3291
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,391
Okay.

3292
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:24,370
But then it's not really
any hunting going on.

3293
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,820
They sit out there waiting for the animals
to show up for the food and then they

3294
01:37:27,821 --> 01:37:28,654
fucking shoot him.

3295
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:29,650
And he does.

3296
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:32,160
It's the same show every week?

3297
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:32,741
No,

3298
01:37:32,741 --> 01:37:33,880
it's fishing in a barrel.

3299
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,350
It's fishing than you toilet bowl.

3300
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,720
It's taking a carp and throw
it into the toilet bowl.

3301
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:39,123
It's,

3302
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:39,761
it's crazy.

3303
01:37:39,761 --> 01:37:39,971
I mean,

3304
01:37:39,971 --> 01:37:41,350
it's a great way to get meat,

3305
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:42,371
but I mean,

3306
01:37:42,371 --> 01:37:43,810
I'm watching what he does everyday.

3307
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,250
Literally walks to corn,

3308
01:37:45,251 --> 01:37:45,811
won't do that.

3309
01:37:45,811 --> 01:37:47,800
He gets into a tree stand.

3310
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,400
Okay.

3311
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,190
And he's got a dude with them when the
camera and then he fucking leaves the

3312
01:37:51,191 --> 01:37:52,590
food up and you know,

3313
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:54,580
every week he's successful,

3314
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,920
he gets skunked.

3315
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,360
I mean this the show,

3316
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:58,320
I was on the show,

3317
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:00,840
a meat eater when we shot
this deer and it was,

3318
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:01,380
you know,

3319
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,970
we had a hike for three days.

3320
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:03,810
We're in Montana.

3321
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:04,071
It's,

3322
01:38:04,071 --> 01:38:08,010
it's difficult like you have to pull
to actually get a shot on an animal.

3323
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:09,690
You have to go through a
lot of work to get there.

3324
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:10,890
Ted Nugent,

3325
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:12,150
it takes 10 minutes.

3326
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:13,830
He sits at his tree stand.

3327
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,840
Every show is the same fucking thing.

3328
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,040
They come to the food,

3329
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,750
he shoots them and he's like,

3330
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:19,770
can you believe that?

3331
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:25,060
He gets all crazy that we got and we got
and we got 'em we got 'em like he was

3332
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:26,370
right there.

3333
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,140
If they are coming to eat food,

3334
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:28,800
like it's kind of,

3335
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,240
it's the whole thing is kind of crazy.

3336
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,350
But he's got,

3337
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:33,300
I would hope he gets that
excited off camera too.

3338
01:38:33,301 --> 01:38:36,090
Like that's just him I
think maybe a little bit.

3339
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:36,990
I mean he look,

3340
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:38,220
bowhunting is fun,

3341
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,701
you know,

3342
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:39,930
I'm sure you get a little bit excited,

3343
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:42,000
but a little bit is of him
being corny for the camera.

3344
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:43,160
But before,

3345
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:43,993
um,

3346
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,230
that's the beginning of the episode.

3347
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:47,190
Then later in the episode,

3348
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:48,210
he's got his dogs with him.

3349
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,920
He's talking about great dogs are,

3350
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:51,570
and then he goes and shoots a coyote,

3351
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,270
which looks just like his fucking dogs.

3352
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:54,820
I mean,

3353
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:55,410
they're there.

3354
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,760
They're real similar,

3355
01:38:56,970 --> 01:38:59,370
but it's that thing where
we make a distinction.

3356
01:38:59,460 --> 01:38:59,821
You know,

3357
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:01,470
we decide like you're my friend.

3358
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:03,120
You can go fuck yourself.

3359
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:06,090
You're going to eat rabbits that
you found from the pet store.

3360
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:06,631
Ooh.

3361
01:39:06,631 --> 01:39:09,210
I don't know how many
to cow that I raised.

3362
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:09,301
Well,

3363
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:10,134
that's normal.

3364
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,393
You know,

3365
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:15,030
we have like animals that
are our buddies and animals,

3366
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,370
like a coyote that looks
like a fucking Cali.

3367
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,150
I mean,

3368
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:22,050
how was it coyote that dissimilar
from a German shepard or a coyote?

3369
01:39:22,051 --> 01:39:23,160
Just slightly less friendly.

3370
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:24,043
Yeah.

3371
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:24,720
Yes.

3372
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,770
They don't care for us either.

3373
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:26,663
Maybe that's part of it.

3374
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:27,900
Squirrels are into us.

3375
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:28,980
Coyote is not so much.

3376
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:31,650
I understand what Ted Nugent
is killing the coyote.

3377
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,610
He's killing the coyote because he has a
huge piece of property filled with deer

3378
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,260
and coyotes eat the Fonz.

3379
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,310
That's like,

3380
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:38,770
um,

3381
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:39,360
the,

3382
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,970
and he was saying that before
he bought this property,

3383
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,770
the people that owned it before him,

3384
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:44,281
you know,

3385
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:45,420
like that's what you buy.

3386
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:48,240
You're buying like these
deer management land,

3387
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:48,960
uh,

3388
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,660
things.

3389
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,390
And the people that owned it before him,

3390
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:52,111
they,

3391
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:52,560
um,

3392
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,670
they didn't trap so they
never killed the coyotes.

3393
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,450
So they just,

3394
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:59,100
they lost every fall and they ever had,

3395
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:03,120
so every year the coyotes would come
in looking for fonts and snatch him up.

3396
01:40:03,121 --> 01:40:04,170
So whenever the,

3397
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:05,220
the deers would,

3398
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:05,970
uh,

3399
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:06,660
give birth,

3400
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:08,550
the entire population will be decimated.

3401
01:40:08,551 --> 01:40:09,780
So all they have is old deer.

3402
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:10,650
So he had to go.

3403
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,010
So,

3404
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:12,120
so people don't understand,

3405
01:40:12,121 --> 01:40:14,710
like why would someone go around
and she's tired cause his knee,

3406
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,170
they're like managing the deer.

3407
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,760
And yet if they kill all the funds that
then what you kill all your deer off to

3408
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:19,851
the,

3409
01:40:19,851 --> 01:40:20,684
you'd have nothing left,

3410
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,480
but you only need to kill
it one or two deer a year.

3411
01:40:22,481 --> 01:40:22,740
And he's,

3412
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,090
I think he's got hundreds of them.

3413
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,890
But the point is like,

3414
01:40:25,891 --> 01:40:29,010
someone from an urban environment
would not understand that.

3415
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:29,731
They would say,

3416
01:40:29,731 --> 01:40:29,851
well,

3417
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:31,560
why do you have to kill the coyote?

3418
01:40:31,561 --> 01:40:32,520
Don't kill a coyote.

3419
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:32,971
Okay,

3420
01:40:32,971 --> 01:40:35,820
you're going to sit back and
watch the coyote kill baby deer.

3421
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:36,151
What do you,

3422
01:40:36,151 --> 01:40:37,560
what do you more happy about?

3423
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:37,781
Yeah.

3424
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:41,280
Then under c that they never have
to address nature killing nature.

3425
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:41,740
Exactly.

3426
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,490
Just never have to train and killing
nature because we're not nature.

3427
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:47,160
We're not unnatural nature
killing nature with its face,

3428
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:49,810
which I surely do if I could.

3429
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,960
I certainly four and 14,

3430
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:52,794
50.

3431
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,380
Um,

3432
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,350
if you look up wolves
of Paris in Wikipedia,

3433
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:56,921
there's a pretty,

3434
01:40:56,921 --> 01:41:01,750
a detailed depiction of what
happened in the winter of 1450.

3435
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:02,441
Uh,

3436
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:06,490
there was breaches in the walls
of that's not good of Paris.

3437
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:07,301
And,

3438
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:07,660
uh,

3439
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:10,030
there was one wolf is really fucked up.

3440
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:12,670
This wolf was like
missing part of its tail.

3441
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:13,930
And that was the,

3442
01:41:13,931 --> 01:41:14,051
uh,

3443
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:16,270
the leader of the pack of these wolves.

3444
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:16,961
And,

3445
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:17,320
uh,

3446
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:21,010
they went into the city of Paris and
they started fucking killing people.

3447
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:22,540
And so they,

3448
01:41:22,541 --> 01:41:22,870
uh,

3449
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:23,380
they,

3450
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:23,711
the,

3451
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:25,020
the Persians,

3452
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:27,640
because 40 fucking people were killed.

3453
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:32,680
They learned these wolves into the heart
of the city and they stoned and speared

3454
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:35,530
them to death in front of
the Notre Dame cathedral.

3455
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,633
It's for Roxanne.

3456
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:37,563
Yeah.

3457
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,850
Throw rocks and spears is,

3458
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:40,190
that's all.

3459
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:40,810
Yeah.

3460
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:41,590
Well I don't think they,

3461
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:42,850
they have guns in 14,

3462
01:41:42,851 --> 01:41:43,570
15.

3463
01:41:43,570 --> 01:41:44,403
I don't think so.

3464
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:44,790
No,

3465
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:45,090
no,

3466
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:45,310
no,

3467
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,440
I think and,

3468
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,280
and when did they invent the gun?

3469
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,120
Uh,

3470
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,470
not that long ago.

3471
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:54,190
1450 was like when it was invented.

3472
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:55,391
I mean,

3473
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:56,224
that was like

3474
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,260
bad days for technology
and checking on back.

3475
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,470
1464,

3476
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:03,580
1464 now.

3477
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:03,870
Shit.

3478
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:04,240
Yeah.

3479
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:04,870
The first gun.

3480
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:05,050
Yeah.

3481
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:10,050
The first time at Thompson 1464 human
history to history cast from bronze.

3482
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:13,203
Yeah.

3483
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,460
Um,

3484
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:15,900
that broke all the fucking time.

3485
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,121
Yeah,

3486
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:17,890
those probably sucked with,

3487
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,420
makes sense though because like
a canon is basically a gun.

3488
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:24,520
Just a big stupid gun.

3489
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:25,900
I like a grant.

3490
01:42:25,901 --> 01:42:26,351
Morrison,

3491
01:42:26,351 --> 01:42:27,280
that comic writer,

3492
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:27,820
he has a,

3493
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:30,730
he has a quote about guns that
it's an explosion in one direction.

3494
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:31,841
Wow.

3495
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:32,591
Even crazy.

3496
01:42:32,591 --> 01:42:36,580
They had something called the
hand cannon from the Chinese.

3497
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,810
Why you a n?

3498
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:41,560
It's won dynasty as one where
stick the little match in there.

3499
01:42:41,670 --> 01:42:42,160
Yeah.

3500
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,350
And it was like they
held it in front of them.

3501
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,780
It's like a two foot long tube.

3502
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:47,980
And that was a,

3503
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:50,110
that was 1271.

3504
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:51,850
Clever,

3505
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:52,150
clever.

3506
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:53,770
The Chinese man,

3507
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,000
that's insane.

3508
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,520
The Chinese came up with a gun and 12,

3509
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:57,880
seven.

3510
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,480
Wow.

3511
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,350
They were smart as fuck.

3512
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,490
And those days when Europe
was not something within that,

3513
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:04,031
listen to this,

3514
01:43:04,031 --> 01:43:05,910
the earliest depiction of gunpowder,

3515
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,160
weapon of a gunpowder weapon
as the illustration of a fire.

3516
01:43:09,161 --> 01:43:13,150
Lance on a mid 10th century Silk Banner.

3517
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,160
So 9,000.

3518
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:17,440
That's insane.

3519
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,720
And it was a,

3520
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:20,011
uh,

3521
01:43:20,011 --> 01:43:20,390
uh,

3522
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:20,491
uh,

3523
01:43:20,491 --> 01:43:25,491
somehow I guess at the end of it it was
like a lance and at the end of it it had

3524
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:30,360
gunpowder and fucking did
something and shot something out.

3525
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:35,020
How proud would you be the first person
that like went to their king or whatever

3526
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:35,411
and was like,

3527
01:43:35,411 --> 01:43:35,681
dude,

3528
01:43:35,681 --> 01:43:36,514
you,

3529
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,660
you want to look at this?

3530
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,370
I'm about to get all the bitches,

3531
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,210
dude,

3532
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:43,750
I just flipped the script
through the game on its head.

3533
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:46,180
Motherfucka I was going to ask you,

3534
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:48,490
do you have any questions
about the Goswami?

3535
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:50,440
Oh yeah.

3536
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:50,681
Well,

3537
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:52,170
you're a physicist.

3538
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,010
Yes.

3539
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,390
Now I feel good.

3540
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:54,991
Yeah.

3541
01:43:54,991 --> 01:43:56,550
Technically less legit than him.

3542
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:57,360
Yeah.

3543
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,080
Well he's,

3544
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,700
he's written books and
shit and then your money.

3545
01:43:59,701 --> 01:44:00,630
He did a very nice guy.

3546
01:44:00,631 --> 01:44:01,140
That guy,

3547
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:01,890
I would imagine.

3548
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:02,723
Yeah.

3549
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:05,700
Interesting cat.

3550
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:06,630
Um,

3551
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:07,380
no I didn't,

3552
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:08,071
I didn't have,

3553
01:44:08,071 --> 01:44:08,500
um,

3554
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:08,850
uh,

3555
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:09,211
any,

3556
01:44:09,211 --> 01:44:10,410
any questions per se.

3557
01:44:10,411 --> 01:44:13,350
But one thing that I'm actually,

3558
01:44:13,351 --> 01:44:18,351
you were the first guy to educate me on
was the observer effect being bullshit.

3559
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:20,731
You know,

3560
01:44:20,731 --> 01:44:24,900
that's something that like Dr Quantum
and all these guys like make a big deal

3561
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:27,000
that when you look up
double slit experiment,

3562
01:44:27,001 --> 01:44:28,200
that's the first one.

3563
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:28,550
Yeah.

3564
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,480
It comes up and it's always
been that way with the doctor,

3565
01:44:30,481 --> 01:44:30,931
Colleen,

3566
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:34,380
that to people so they know what I'm
talking about because that I have said so

3567
01:44:34,381 --> 01:44:35,790
many people tweet me that dude,

3568
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:36,021
do that,

3569
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:36,631
check this out.

3570
01:44:36,631 --> 01:44:37,470
It's amazing.

3571
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:39,870
It's dog to quantum to the
whole double slit experiment.

3572
01:44:39,871 --> 01:44:40,704
Yeah.

3573
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,560
It's really the act of measuring it.

3574
01:44:43,561 --> 01:44:44,380
The changes it,

3575
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:44,700
yeah.

3576
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:44,970
Yeah.

3577
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:45,481
It will.

3578
01:44:45,481 --> 01:44:46,080
I mean,

3579
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,190
because what does it mean

3580
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:48,180
measure something?

3581
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,110
Uh,

3582
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,300
like say you're measuring
the position of something,

3583
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,300
then you've got to hit
it with light and then

3584
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,730
get a lot of folks who don't even know
what the fuck we're talking about.

3585
01:44:56,910 --> 01:44:58,230
We're talking about Subatomic,

3586
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,213
um,

3587
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:00,083
observing,

3588
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:00,740
um,

3589
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:01,320
uh,

3590
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:03,270
in a subatomic conditions.

3591
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:03,720
Yeah,

3592
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:03,931
yeah.

3593
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:04,380
Just very,

3594
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:04,711
very,

3595
01:45:04,711 --> 01:45:05,280
very,

3596
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,540
very tiny things that technically
you can't see in any other sense.

3597
01:45:09,541 --> 01:45:10,020
But,

3598
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:10,650
but you,

3599
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:14,190
you hit it with light and then
the light comes back and you know,

3600
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,800
approximately where it was,

3601
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:17,280
uh,

3602
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,113
because it's,

3603
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:20,820
there's actually vertical virtual
particles and other southern stuff.

3604
01:45:20,821 --> 01:45:21,780
You can kind of think of it as,

3605
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:22,441
as a,

3606
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:23,670
as a little wave function.

3607
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:27,480
So there's an uncertainty when
you hit it and it comes back and,

3608
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:28,890
but when you're not hitting it,

3609
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:30,540
it exists in a,

3610
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:35,070
in a slightly larger wave function
is not exactly a particle.

3611
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:37,590
It stretches out a little bit.

3612
01:45:37,591 --> 01:45:40,110
It's as nothing interacts with it,

3613
01:45:40,111 --> 01:45:42,090
the uncertainty grows to a certain limit.

3614
01:45:42,091 --> 01:45:44,100
So it's got some elbow
room where it could be.

3615
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:45,563
And uh,

3616
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,280
so the double slit experiment is from
when we were trying to figure out if

3617
01:45:50,281 --> 01:45:51,870
things were waves or particles.

3618
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:54,300
And like some people
thought light was a wave,

3619
01:45:54,301 --> 01:45:58,080
some people thought it was a particle
in a wave being something that grows

3620
01:45:58,380 --> 01:45:59,400
outward and it,

3621
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:00,450
and it spreads.

3622
01:46:00,451 --> 01:46:00,721
Like,

3623
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:05,070
like when you dip your finger in water
and the little circles spread out.

3624
01:46:05,071 --> 01:46:07,560
That's basically what
we thought light did.

3625
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:11,270
And we had really good reason
to believe that like uh,

3626
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:12,421
if I,

3627
01:46:12,421 --> 01:46:14,460
if I shone some light at your laptop,

3628
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,280
there would actually be light on you.

3629
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:21,600
But like in like white
spreads around corners too.

3630
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:24,780
So it actually does kind of act
like a wave to some certain extent.

3631
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:26,153
So if you put,

3632
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:27,743
so if you have,

3633
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:29,130
and just imagine water,

3634
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:33,810
if you have some sort of source like
behind a wall with the little slit in it

3635
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:36,390
and the sources is causing these waves,

3636
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:40,290
the waves go to the water and then at
that little slit the waves come out of

3637
01:46:40,291 --> 01:46:42,510
there and they spread also.

3638
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:45,090
And then if you have two slits then,

3639
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:45,781
then you know,

3640
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:46,111
when you,

3641
01:46:46,111 --> 01:46:48,480
like when you put two
fingers in the water,

3642
01:46:48,481 --> 01:46:52,830
they were kind of little lines that come
off of the two circles where the two

3643
01:46:52,831 --> 01:46:55,290
circles interact in certain ways.

3644
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:56,770
Yeah.

3645
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:57,750
You see these little,

3646
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,810
these little patterns and uh,

3647
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:00,693
uh,

3648
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,410
so we saw,

3649
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:02,340
you can see those,

3650
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,440
uh,

3651
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:03,750
uh,

3652
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,140
wow.

3653
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,250
I totally lost my train of thought.

3654
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:07,943
But uh,

3655
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:09,210
so you,

3656
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,110
so you don't,

3657
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:10,740
so they,

3658
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,190
they,

3659
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:12,750
the water goes through both slits.

3660
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:16,890
The wave goes through both slits and you
get this interference that you can see

3661
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:18,720
on the other way on the other side.

3662
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:20,820
And if you shoot a particle through,

3663
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:25,821
these are at the sleds and it bounces
through one and then it comes out and it

3664
01:47:27,421 --> 01:47:30,200
hits a spot and like
shooting bullets through it,

3665
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,150
they're going to go to
a very specific area.

3666
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:34,080
But,

3667
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:34,410
uh,

3668
01:47:34,410 --> 01:47:37,410
so you would think that was what
that would be what a electrons do.

3669
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,190
Uh,

3670
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:39,480
or any other particle really.

3671
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:40,950
But it's not,

3672
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,400
they,

3673
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,840
they do waves too.

3674
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,640
And if you slow it down.

3675
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:45,690
So like with light,

3676
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:48,990
we were treating these
light beams like waves,

3677
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:54,230
but if you slow down the light
beam so much that only one part,

3678
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,290
only one little bit of light
is going through at a time,

3679
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:00,510
it still looks like it interferes.

3680
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,980
It still creates an interference pattern.

3681
01:48:01,981 --> 01:48:03,780
If you do that with electrons,

3682
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:07,740
it interferes and it still
creates an interference pattern.

3683
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,930
So you don't know which,

3684
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:11,160
which slit it's going through,

3685
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:12,270
but you know there's only one of them.

3686
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:13,411
So you say,

3687
01:48:13,411 --> 01:48:13,651
well,

3688
01:48:13,651 --> 01:48:14,484
how could this be?

3689
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:17,010
So you set up the experiment
to try to met her,

3690
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:19,080
which slit it comes out of.

3691
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,840
And to do that you have a little,

3692
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:26,850
a little beam of light watching one of
the slits waiting for it to come through

3693
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:27,870
or to not come through.

3694
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,730
But when that light gets there,

3695
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:35,150
what used to be the wave collapses down
to the particle and then it acts like a

3696
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:36,324
particle.

3697
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:39,420
And so it's not,

3698
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:42,840
it's not that we don't know
which slid it's going through.

3699
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:45,720
It's that it is going through both when,

3700
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,910
when we're not interacting with it.

3701
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:49,650
So long as they're left
to their own devices,

3702
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:54,720
they are going through even particles
like electrons are going through both

3703
01:48:54,721 --> 01:48:55,890
slits at the same time.

3704
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,570
But if you're measuring it,

3705
01:48:57,630 --> 01:49:02,460
if you're hitting it with light then
then they act like particles and,

3706
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:03,403
and uh,

3707
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:04,673
why is that?

3708
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:08,460
Well that's not what I said too,

3709
01:49:08,461 --> 01:49:09,780
by the way when he was talking about that.

3710
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:13,250
Like what about the accuracy of
the laser that you shooting on?

3711
01:49:13,251 --> 01:49:14,310
He's like a hundred percent accurate.

3712
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:15,300
Isn't that what you're talking about?

3713
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:15,661
No,

3714
01:49:15,661 --> 01:49:15,811
no,

3715
01:49:15,811 --> 01:49:15,990
no.

3716
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:18,180
That was the measurement of Adam.

3717
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:22,500
Things moving like inanimate objects
that there's a constant movement in

3718
01:49:22,501 --> 01:49:23,880
everything he was talking about,

3719
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:24,541
you know,

3720
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:27,050
millions of an inch shares.

3721
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:27,960
Yeah.

3722
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,220
Everything has it's own little.

3723
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,063
Uh,

3724
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:31,101
yeah.

3725
01:49:31,101 --> 01:49:34,340
And you were talking about accuracy of
the measurement of that being the issue

3726
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,540
now where he's talking about the,

3727
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:36,690
the uh,

3728
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,680
observation of subatomic
particles and wave experiments.

3729
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:40,400
So,

3730
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,170
so the,

3731
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:41,570
the,

3732
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,110
the,

3733
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,430
the two interacting with each other.

3734
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,210
The measurement,

3735
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:47,000
interacting with the particle
changes the behavior of the particle.

3736
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:48,143
Uh,

3737
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:49,450
um,

3738
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:49,810
yeah.

3739
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,130
Yeah.

3740
01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:50,770
Effectively.

3741
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:53,890
But it's not observing
like a person's mind.

3742
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:54,161
No,

3743
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:54,910
you don't need to,

3744
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:56,300
nobody needs to be there for,

3745
01:49:56,301 --> 01:49:56,490
right.

3746
01:49:56,490 --> 01:49:56,800
Okay.

3747
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,800
So this is where the issue is
with this doctor quantum shit.

3748
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,480
And for folks who don't know,

3749
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:01,890
uh,

3750
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:03,160
I know you got real pissed when,

3751
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:04,150
what the bleep do you know,

3752
01:50:04,151 --> 01:50:07,420
came out and I did as well when
I found out that that ramp,

3753
01:50:07,421 --> 01:50:08,690
the guy is,

3754
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:11,090
well there's a girl
that calls herself ramp.

3755
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:12,760
So I thought it was just like,

3756
01:50:12,761 --> 01:50:13,594
that was her name.

3757
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,160
She calls.

3758
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,070
It was funny,

3759
01:50:15,071 --> 01:50:15,401
it was like,

3760
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:17,860
I watched that documentary and I was like,

3761
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:19,720
well a lot of people are
saying a lot of cool shit.

3762
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:24,130
But then there's that weird chubby blonde
lady who just seems like a huckster.

3763
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:24,671
I'm like,

3764
01:50:24,671 --> 01:50:26,170
she's seems so full of Shit.

3765
01:50:26,171 --> 01:50:28,780
Like all my alarms are going
off to meaning meaning,

3766
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,900
but she's in this awesome movie
so I guess she's not full of Shit.

3767
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:36,190
And then I go and look up
that ramp thought is actually
a woman who's channeling

3768
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:41,400
fucking alien or something from like
5,000 years ago or some shit and she's in

3769
01:50:41,861 --> 01:50:44,530
the same movie with all these other people
and they don't have a problem if they

3770
01:50:44,531 --> 01:50:45,400
don't even know,

3771
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:46,060
I don't think.

3772
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:46,321
No.

3773
01:50:46,321 --> 01:50:46,630
Yeah,

3774
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:48,940
they did do a lot of deceit
and making that movie.

3775
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:49,661
Oh sure.

3776
01:50:49,661 --> 01:50:50,494
They didn't know.

3777
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,820
They probably just weren't and wanted to
be interviewed on quantum mechanics and

3778
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:57,700
they just so excited that people want
to talk about some people got quoted out

3779
01:50:57,701 --> 01:50:58,151
of context.

3780
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:59,410
There are certain lens like that doctor,

3781
01:50:59,411 --> 01:51:03,430
he modo with the water that that detects
your feelings and shit like that.

3782
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:03,700
Like yeah,

3783
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,370
that guy has like the
message in the water.

3784
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:07,450
He has a whole book on that.

3785
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,640
That's is that quoted out of context?

3786
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:10,391
No,

3787
01:51:10,391 --> 01:51:10,601
no.

3788
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:11,830
That guy thinks that.

3789
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:12,250
Yeah,

3790
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:12,760
he does.

3791
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,920
That's one of those deals.

3792
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:14,800
Are you a different guy?

3793
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:15,723
He Moto.

3794
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:16,840
Is he full of Shit?

3795
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,753
Yeah.

3796
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,080
I mean I haven't gotten
anybody experiment myself.

3797
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,820
Why don't you try to do that but see,

3798
01:51:24,821 --> 01:51:25,300
because,

3799
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,560
well actually he's already explained that
you really need to mean it when you're

3800
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:32,320
thinking positive or
negative thoughts as these,

3801
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:32,980
as these,

3802
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:33,980
as this water freeze.

3803
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:34,530
So I'm,

3804
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:35,363
I'm,

3805
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:36,250
I,

3806
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,860
I don't think I would be capable of doing,

3807
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:40,120
but I'm fine with that if you can,

3808
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:42,600
if he could replicate Vudu
if you don't believe in it,

3809
01:51:42,601 --> 01:51:43,434
it doesn't work for you.

3810
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:43,931
Right.

3811
01:51:43,931 --> 01:51:45,400
But we're talking to is a good question.

3812
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:47,020
Probably like what are
they even talking about?

3813
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,690
We're talking about is there
was a guy who wrote this book,

3814
01:51:49,691 --> 01:51:51,310
I believe it's called
the message in the water.

3815
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:56,311
And what he did was he would like
write love on like a bucket of water or

3816
01:51:56,981 --> 01:51:59,320
whatever the fuck it was or
label whatever the container was.

3817
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:00,490
And one would be hate one,

3818
01:52:00,491 --> 01:52:01,030
it'd be love.

3819
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:04,420
And he would think about these
different things while he,

3820
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:04,810
you know,

3821
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:09,810
had this water there and then when it
would freeze the ice crystals would form

3822
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:13,150
completely different geometric patterns.

3823
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,133
Ugly,

3824
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:14,950
ugly,

3825
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:15,431
angry,

3826
01:52:15,431 --> 01:52:15,820
passionate,

3827
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:16,653
zoomed in.

3828
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,170
So you know,

3829
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:22,310
you don't know like I don't know if he
shipped with show like the whole thing.

3830
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:23,070
No,

3831
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:23,190
no,

3832
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:23,370
no,

3833
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:23,521
no,

3834
01:52:23,521 --> 01:52:23,711
no,

3835
01:52:23,711 --> 01:52:24,070
no.

3836
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:25,750
But somehow we always
manage to find a spot.

3837
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:26,441
Yeah.

3838
01:52:26,441 --> 01:52:28,900
I probably just went to
the most evil looking ones.

3839
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:32,890
It's confirmation bias
and a crystal form lunacy.

3840
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:33,340
Yeah.

3841
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:35,040
But I don't know what it is but,

3842
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:37,660
but that guy made a whole
book about that Shit.

3843
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:40,270
It's really easy to get a book published.

3844
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:41,201
Yeah.

3845
01:52:41,201 --> 01:52:43,120
He's got to prove that
he could settle book.

3846
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:43,470
Right?

3847
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:43,660
Yeah.

3848
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:44,140
That's it.

3849
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:46,030
Just proof of people it and you know,

3850
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:49,220
I mean they already have
like the alternative science
section or whatever it is.

3851
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:52,910
Why doesn't that fucking guy does he,

3852
01:52:52,911 --> 01:52:54,560
is he tried to do that again or is he,

3853
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:55,930
I think he did a,

3854
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:58,400
but I mean it's even,

3855
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:00,770
it's even hard to like
verify in any context.

3856
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:03,080
And it is and yeah,

3857
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:06,230
I mean it's hard to do but you would
think you would think you would be able to

3858
01:53:06,231 --> 01:53:11,231
develop other experiments where your
mind could like just automatically

3859
01:53:11,511 --> 01:53:13,540
influenced and he,

3860
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:15,860
he's been doing this for
years but he doesn't,

3861
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:16,701
as far as I know,

3862
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:17,900
talk about the mechanism of it.

3863
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:18,770
Like how does it work?

3864
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:20,720
Like what's happening?

3865
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:24,250
Like that's the one thing about
the mind because it's not,

3866
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:26,840
it can't be quantum mechanics
because his mind doesn't,

3867
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:30,470
what's freezing it to the
fucking temperature that's
freezing it and he's not

3868
01:53:30,471 --> 01:53:31,340
bugging it out.

3869
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:32,270
I like,

3870
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,760
and if he was bothering the water at any
point you would be able to detect that

3871
01:53:35,761 --> 01:53:37,670
and the vibration or the
heat or something else.

3872
01:53:37,671 --> 01:53:41,690
And you'd be able to find other real
parts other than just a fucking picture.

3873
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:46,220
I you would be able to posit some
sort of mechanism behind the behavior.

3874
01:53:46,221 --> 01:53:47,360
And that's what a lot of these guys,

3875
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,640
they never tell you what it is.

3876
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:52,490
Measurable that that is good.

3877
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:57,520
Like what's like how do they get their
evidence up to par with actual science?

3878
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,410
Like they don't cause they,

3879
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,980
they personally don't have that,

3880
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:03,050
that criteria of evidence.

3881
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:06,440
They're fine with look at the
picture and oh it must be true.

3882
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,240
And they just keep doing it.

3883
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:09,231
Yeah.

3884
01:54:09,231 --> 01:54:10,010
There's,

3885
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,650
there's a lot of that going on these days.

3886
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:13,251
Like,

3887
01:54:13,251 --> 01:54:13,640
um,

3888
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:16,790
when quantum physics sort
of came into the mainstream,

3889
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:17,990
I mean I guess,

3890
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:18,440
you know,

3891
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,210
fine one was talking about it during the,

3892
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,100
during the fifties and sixties,

3893
01:54:22,101 --> 01:54:22,530
right?

3894
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:24,530
Oh well quantum mechanics
started at the beginning of it,

3895
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,970
of the 19 hundreds.

3896
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:29,690
But I mean like him in Pablo popular
culture and pop filing or I don't know

3897
01:54:29,691 --> 01:54:30,000
about that,

3898
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,320
the first people to sort
of make it a mainstream.

3899
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,650
Although I don't know how
mainstream he was at the time,

3900
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:39,170
but he was definitely one of
the ones talking about in those,

3901
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:42,020
in those days because he was
definitely at the forefront of it.

3902
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:42,690
Right.

3903
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:45,080
My point was that today though,

3904
01:54:45,110 --> 01:54:47,420
something seems to have
happened over the past,

3905
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:49,310
like say 10,

3906
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:54,311
15 years where people are like looking
for like more mystical answers for shit.

3907
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:56,421
Well,

3908
01:54:56,421 --> 01:54:57,410
it's got a queue in it.

3909
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:59,540
And I think that helps a
lot because I think if we,

3910
01:54:59,570 --> 01:54:59,870
yeah,

3911
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:02,330
I think if we called it discreet physics,

3912
01:55:02,331 --> 01:55:03,200
which is what it is,

3913
01:55:03,201 --> 01:55:04,940
it like people think quantum,

3914
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:09,080
it means waves and it means uncertainty
and it means fit whatever bullshit you

3915
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:10,040
want in,

3916
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,470
in the cracks of this mysterious physics.

3917
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:16,190
But it really just means
that things come in chunks,

3918
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:21,320
like they're not just waves that
like even waves are like pinched.

3919
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:23,000
You would think of them
as pinched at the end.

3920
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:24,380
So they're very well defined.

3921
01:55:24,381 --> 01:55:25,610
Like waves are very,

3922
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:27,890
very well defined.

3923
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:28,790
Like exactly,

3924
01:55:28,791 --> 01:55:29,870
precisely described.

3925
01:55:29,871 --> 01:55:31,790
Even like we talked about probabilities.

3926
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:33,860
It's got a probability of
being here or being there,

3927
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:37,070
but it's got an exact probability
of being here or being there.

3928
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:40,670
The probability wave is
exact the but the problem,

3929
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:41,990
but it's a probability.

3930
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:43,380
So we think can just,

3931
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:45,990
so they think they can just fit
whatever the fuck they want to.

3932
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,970
But if you call it a discreet physics,

3933
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:51,140
nobody would really care and nobody
would be interested because it,

3934
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:52,163
they wouldn't.

3935
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,640
It's awesome when it's defined.

3936
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:56,800
The the things that we do know
about it or so mysterious.

3937
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:59,770
There's so many quotes about from people,

3938
01:55:59,771 --> 01:56:00,340
you know,

3939
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:01,900
if you think you understand
quantum mechanics,

3940
01:56:01,901 --> 01:56:02,380
you don't,

3941
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,280
nobody understands,

3942
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:04,930
nobody understands quantum mechanics.

3943
01:56:04,931 --> 01:56:08,470
And it's kind of a term because you
can't develop an intuition for it

3944
01:56:08,471 --> 01:56:09,040
whatsoever.

3945
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,950
Like the only reason we
understand it is the math,

3946
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:12,850
right?

3947
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:16,870
And the only way you could ever build an
intuition from it is understanding the

3948
01:56:16,871 --> 01:56:17,331
math because it,

3949
01:56:17,331 --> 01:56:17,860
it's,

3950
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:19,540
it's the most Matt,

3951
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,840
like nobody wanted it to
be true in the beginning,

3952
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:23,171
you know,

3953
01:56:23,171 --> 01:56:25,210
quantum physics because
it's so fucking weird.

3954
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:29,800
But we kept stumbling on all these
different pieces of mathematics,

3955
01:56:29,801 --> 01:56:33,430
all these different parts
of these languages that were
being developed that kept

3956
01:56:33,431 --> 01:56:36,850
giving us the right answers
and kept saying like you would,

3957
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:38,680
they would come up with some,

3958
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:41,890
some sort of model and
mathematics and they would say,

3959
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,580
Oh hey,

3960
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:45,370
that looks a little bit like
this thing we see sometimes.

3961
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:46,960
And then it turns out to be true.

3962
01:56:46,961 --> 01:56:48,790
And then it tells us all these
other things when we got all well,

3963
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:49,330
that's bullshit.

3964
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:50,140
That couldn't be there.

3965
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:53,590
And it is because our
intuition just sucks at it.

3966
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,280
But the math is his exact,

3967
01:56:57,281 --> 01:56:58,300
the math has precise,

3968
01:56:58,301 --> 01:57:00,760
like it's not mysterious in that sense.

3969
01:57:00,761 --> 01:57:01,960
Like what?

3970
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:03,130
Yeah,

3971
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:03,963
there's no,

3972
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:05,470
it's hard to say why.

3973
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:06,790
Like you can't ask why.

3974
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:07,810
That's not the question there.

3975
01:57:07,811 --> 01:57:08,111
There's,

3976
01:57:08,111 --> 01:57:10,510
there are certain people
that they are the quote,

3977
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:11,890
it gets attributed to a lot of people,

3978
01:57:11,891 --> 01:57:16,210
but it's shut up and calculate is the
answer to why does it work that way?

3979
01:57:16,211 --> 01:57:17,021
How does it work that way?

3980
01:57:17,021 --> 01:57:19,950
Just shut up and do the math cause
you're not gonna think it through

3981
01:57:20,030 --> 01:57:20,271
very,

3982
01:57:20,271 --> 01:57:23,240
what is it though that led to this whole,

3983
01:57:23,241 --> 01:57:26,390
what the bleep do we know
sort of ideology behind it.

3984
01:57:26,391 --> 01:57:30,890
Like it sort of got twisted into the
secret and to this idea that you're

3985
01:57:30,891 --> 01:57:34,250
controlling the world with
your mind and that these uh,

3986
01:57:34,251 --> 01:57:39,251
these possibilities and probabilities are
all defined and described in the human

3987
01:57:39,351 --> 01:57:40,280
imagination.

3988
01:57:40,281 --> 01:57:41,360
And that's,

3989
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:41,811
you know,

3990
01:57:41,811 --> 01:57:44,840
and that's where they wanted to come up
with something like this doctor quantum

3991
01:57:44,841 --> 01:57:45,674
thing,

3992
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,860
server changes the experiment.

3993
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:49,550
Like,

3994
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:51,560
I don't know that the origin of it,

3995
01:57:51,561 --> 01:57:52,130
but I mean,

3996
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:52,341
you know,

3997
01:57:52,341 --> 01:57:54,620
there's always been ideas about,

3998
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:55,070
about,

3999
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:55,670
uh,

4000
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:57,920
the mind having control over,

4001
01:57:58,070 --> 01:58:00,140
over reality and things like that.

4002
01:58:00,141 --> 01:58:04,280
And I think the observer effect and
words like uncertainty and quantum and

4003
01:58:04,281 --> 01:58:07,520
everything else gave them a chance
because it's not like they understand it

4004
01:58:07,521 --> 01:58:08,330
either for the most part,

4005
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:09,260
like Goswami does,

4006
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:13,610
but 99% of the people you hear talk about
it don't understand it at all either.

4007
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:18,380
But so the people they're explaining it
to definitely don't fucking understand

4008
01:58:18,381 --> 01:58:18,740
it.

4009
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,670
So it gives them,

4010
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:25,240
it gives them credibility
that that isn't theirs.

4011
01:58:25,461 --> 01:58:25,761
But it,

4012
01:58:25,761 --> 01:58:26,240
it's,

4013
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,020
it's science,

4014
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:29,930
it's scientific and it's new
and all this other shit it,

4015
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,780
and since I don't know what it means,

4016
01:58:32,781 --> 01:58:36,530
but I can insert certain of my
beliefs within things and then say,

4017
01:58:36,531 --> 01:58:36,861
oh yeah,

4018
01:58:36,861 --> 01:58:39,020
because it's quantum and then nobody,

4019
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:40,970
nobody can call your
bullshit because nobody,

4020
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:42,290
it that

4021
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:43,700
when Deepak Chopra,

4022
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:44,540
um,

4023
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:48,570
did you ever see that there was a
talk where Depok show Oprah was a,

4024
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:52,840
there was a guy in the
audience who writing a book
with Stephen Hawkings and he

4025
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:53,421
start in the,

4026
01:58:53,421 --> 01:58:55,240
ask them to define what he meant.

4027
01:58:55,250 --> 01:59:00,250
He's like quantum in the quantum with
quantum knowledge in quantum consciousness

4028
01:59:00,501 --> 01:59:02,210
being non local and quantum.

4029
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:03,321
And he goes,

4030
01:59:03,321 --> 01:59:03,651
well,

4031
01:59:03,651 --> 01:59:05,360
I understand those words that you said.

4032
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,670
I don't really know what you're saying.

4033
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:09,380
Thank you in that order.

4034
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,371
It makes no sense.

4035
01:59:10,371 --> 01:59:11,001
But that's a,

4036
01:59:11,001 --> 01:59:15,680
that's a weird trickery thing where people
use that word quantum and they start

4037
01:59:15,681 --> 01:59:16,910
tossing it around,

4038
01:59:16,911 --> 01:59:17,630
you know,

4039
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:18,500
that it,

4040
01:59:18,570 --> 01:59:19,010
it,

4041
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:21,410
it almost allows for

4042
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:26,660
it 89% of the people listening to it and
not going to know what the fuck you're

4043
01:59:26,661 --> 01:59:27,081
saying.

4044
01:59:27,081 --> 01:59:28,700
So people just allow you to say it.

4045
01:59:28,701 --> 01:59:28,800
Yeah.

4046
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:33,120
Quantum physics seems like it makes
all of classical physics make no sense.

4047
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,930
Right.

4048
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:36,930
So that's a perfect place
to put your pet theory.

4049
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:40,530
It's a place that is already
eliminated the legitimacy of,

4050
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:43,530
of all of we what we understand now.

4051
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:46,110
Like it's a window of
opportunity for them.

4052
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:46,961
Yeah.

4053
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:48,940
And there's a certain arrogance to that.

4054
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:50,440
Oh that woundedness,

4055
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:51,160
you know,

4056
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:56,160
which always that wound blueness always
wants to debunk science that will wound

4057
01:59:56,951 --> 01:59:59,140
it screamed the mainstream
is always wrong.

4058
01:59:59,170 --> 02:00:00,130
It's time for a change.

4059
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:05,220
Well and I could see what they're saying
is that science cannot define a lot of

4060
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:09,880
the human existence.

4061
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:11,140
That's that is,

4062
02:00:11,141 --> 02:00:16,141
is very real intangible like love and
emotions and experiences and you know,

4063
02:00:17,010 --> 02:00:18,970
but we are getting there getting close.

4064
02:00:18,971 --> 02:00:19,241
Right?

4065
02:00:19,241 --> 02:00:19,750
Yeah.

4066
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:20,530
Getting real good at that.

4067
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:23,410
But their idea of,

4068
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:24,130
you know,

4069
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:25,310
science is being this,

4070
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:26,350
this rigid,

4071
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:27,453
you know,

4072
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:32,850
non understanding
numerical sort of approach,

4073
02:00:35,740 --> 02:00:39,610
which it can be whenever anyone's
in any sort of a position of power,

4074
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:44,290
whether a new scientific formula comes
by the way of some people who either

4075
02:00:44,291 --> 02:00:48,160
haven't done the research you've done
to describe it and they're skeptical lie

4076
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:50,260
occasionally they make up data.

4077
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:50,711
Sure.

4078
02:00:50,711 --> 02:00:52,210
Remember when a cold fusion,

4079
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:56,620
when everyone's was a hot on the cold
fusion trail and people were claiming to

4080
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:56,861
have,

4081
02:00:56,861 --> 02:00:57,250
uh,

4082
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,450
created cold fusion.

4083
02:00:59,370 --> 02:00:59,530
Yeah.

4084
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:01,990
There's always weird things
like that where people not sure,

4085
02:01:02,410 --> 02:01:04,240
but at the end of the day,

4086
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:08,610
science is responsible for every single
fucking thing that's in front of you.

4087
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:11,220
The flaws of it come from people not from,

4088
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:13,260
not from the method itself.

4089
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:13,570
Yeah.

4090
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:15,120
That's cause that's the funny thing.

4091
02:01:15,121 --> 02:01:15,954
Whenever,

4092
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:19,020
whenever something like
that gets overturned,

4093
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:20,850
like when somebody gets in,

4094
02:01:20,851 --> 02:01:23,880
science gets corrected or found
out that they were making,

4095
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:25,410
making up data or doing,

4096
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:28,830
doing shady shit or they were
mistaken or anything like that.

4097
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:32,820
It's never these people complaining about
mainstream science that correct them.

4098
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:34,040
It's always other scientists.

4099
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:34,590
Yeah.

4100
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:36,870
Because that it's a self correcting thing.

4101
02:01:36,871 --> 02:01:41,871
It's it as so long as you no presumption
except that if you keep asking the

4102
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:45,710
universe it will give you the answer.

4103
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:46,550
But that's

4104
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:48,380
dia behind science is brilliant.

4105
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,860
The idea behind the,

4106
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:55,070
the understanding of the world
due to measurement is perfect.

4107
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,600
The real problem is the fucking humans
measuring it and the ego and all the

4108
02:01:59,601 --> 02:02:01,820
other nonsense that comes
along with being a person.

4109
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:05,690
And that's where people tend to get upset.

4110
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:07,340
And that's where,

4111
02:02:07,341 --> 02:02:07,701
you know,

4112
02:02:07,701 --> 02:02:12,620
the quantum Wu talk sorta like fills the
gap by the people that are disenchanted

4113
02:02:12,650 --> 02:02:14,750
disillusioned by the system,

4114
02:02:14,751 --> 02:02:19,010
the rigid system that they see not being
able to understand psychics are Tarot

4115
02:02:19,011 --> 02:02:21,440
card reading astrology.

4116
02:02:22,150 --> 02:02:22,421
Yeah,

4117
02:02:22,421 --> 02:02:23,080
exactly.

4118
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:23,770
And it's like,

4119
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:24,370
you know,

4120
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:29,320
astrology has been around for thousands
of years and they never told us anything

4121
02:02:29,321 --> 02:02:30,270
about those stars

4122
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:32,430
and the Ching,

4123
02:02:32,431 --> 02:02:33,810
the Chinese method of divination.

4124
02:02:33,811 --> 02:02:35,370
How long has that been
around and how much,

4125
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:35,940
you know,

4126
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,230
I've always wondered about that.

4127
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:37,650
You know,

4128
02:02:37,650 --> 02:02:38,160
the,

4129
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:43,160
the idea that there's been methods
of divination that people have used

4130
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:49,490
throughout history and one theory
is that in order to bypass the,

4131
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:56,460
the human ego and our limited grasp on
the understanding of the world that we

4132
02:02:56,611 --> 02:02:57,360
live in,

4133
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:01,890
there's a certain amount of knowledge
that can be pulled out of any sort of a

4134
02:03:01,891 --> 02:03:04,410
situation by a method of divination.

4135
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,710
And that what you're really doing by
this method of divination is allowing the

4136
02:03:07,711 --> 02:03:09,060
universe to give you data.

4137
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:14,250
I think because I mean most of our brain
isn't part of the conscious part but,

4138
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:18,280
but it's still thinking like
nobody really considers that.

4139
02:03:18,281 --> 02:03:22,240
But like your subconscious
mind is thinking all the
time and communicating all

4140
02:03:22,241 --> 02:03:22,950
the time.

4141
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:23,620
It might be doing,

4142
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:28,090
it might be juggling certain thoughts
for like weeks and then gives it to you

4143
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:29,950
fully fleshed out and you're like,

4144
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:30,101
oh,

4145
02:03:30,101 --> 02:03:31,060
I just had a brilliant idea.

4146
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:31,800
Right?

4147
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,950
The rest of your brain
has been thinking about.

4148
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:33,370
So,

4149
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:36,970
and it's take interpreting and taking
in a lot of information and a lot of

4150
02:03:36,971 --> 02:03:39,610
different ways that it's not telling
you about because you don't need to know

4151
02:03:39,611 --> 02:03:40,390
about it.

4152
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:42,700
So in certain senses,

4153
02:03:42,701 --> 02:03:45,430
our intuition can become extremely useful.

4154
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:47,440
Like especially with dealing with people,

4155
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:51,340
like there's all sorts of stuff going
on with other people's faces and body

4156
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:55,240
language is that you don't have to
know about to pick up on and then go,

4157
02:03:55,241 --> 02:03:56,920
that guy's a creep and I don't know why.

4158
02:03:57,490 --> 02:04:00,700
It's because other parts of your
brain are doing this thinking for you.

4159
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:01,291
Yeah.

4160
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:02,550
That is the weirdest thing.

4161
02:04:02,551 --> 02:04:04,440
When someone's being shifty and you,

4162
02:04:04,441 --> 02:04:05,410
if you tried to explain,

4163
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,520
explain subtle shiftiness to someone,

4164
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,980
you know when you're talking to
somebody like get the fuck no,

4165
02:04:10,981 --> 02:04:12,030
you can't get in my car.

4166
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:16,440
That weird feeling where you just felt
like someone's just fucking shifting,

4167
02:04:16,590 --> 02:04:19,980
but try writing down on paper and try it.

4168
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:25,030
What tools on their pupils
dilating their cores swelling up?

4169
02:04:25,031 --> 02:04:25,181
Like,

4170
02:04:25,181 --> 02:04:25,670
I don't know,

4171
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:28,890
just the weird social scenarios that
you're getting from the one that,

4172
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:33,310
the tension from the communication where
you know that they're trying to keep it

4173
02:04:33,311 --> 02:04:36,010
together or would they
or they might hit you.

4174
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:39,330
You know that weird you're had been
around someone you think is going to hit

4175
02:04:39,331 --> 02:04:39,870
you.

4176
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:41,820
There's that weird charge in the air,

4177
02:04:41,821 --> 02:04:42,210
like a,

4178
02:04:42,210 --> 02:04:43,560
you might hit me right now,

4179
02:04:43,561 --> 02:04:43,840
like I,

4180
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,750
I feel some weird shit going on here.

4181
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,250
Try describing that.

4182
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,200
Yes.

4183
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:48,830
I mean,

4184
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:49,071
so,

4185
02:04:49,071 --> 02:04:51,710
so I think when it comes to like,

4186
02:04:51,711 --> 02:04:56,711
like certain things about
like a shaman type characters,

4187
02:04:57,741 --> 02:05:02,741
like dealing with people or community
issues or even to some extent like nature,

4188
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:07,850
like maybe their body is picking up on
the fact that like 20 years ago there was

4189
02:05:07,851 --> 02:05:12,380
a flood for a really regular reason and
now it's coming up again or something

4190
02:05:12,381 --> 02:05:12,801
like that.

4191
02:05:12,801 --> 02:05:15,170
Like they could have an intuition
that they don't know about,

4192
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:16,550
but they've been working on it.

4193
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:20,120
They've been trying to develop
their intuition so much.

4194
02:05:20,121 --> 02:05:21,260
Like that's what they do.

4195
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:24,560
So they keep working these parts of their
brain until they are actually good at

4196
02:05:24,561 --> 02:05:24,861
something.

4197
02:05:24,861 --> 02:05:26,090
They have no idea what they're doing.

4198
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:27,523
Huh.

4199
02:05:27,710 --> 02:05:28,610
Just like anything else,

4200
02:05:28,611 --> 02:05:30,890
they keep working it and
keep trying to be intuitive,

4201
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:33,380
like cold reading and stuff like that.

4202
02:05:33,381 --> 02:05:35,420
Like you keep doing it and
you keep getting good at it.

4203
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:38,510
And whether or not you
even know that that light,

4204
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:38,820
you're,

4205
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:39,653
you're,

4206
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:40,641
you know,

4207
02:05:40,641 --> 02:05:40,801
you're,

4208
02:05:40,801 --> 02:05:43,790
you're manipulating these people around
you telling them about their dead

4209
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:45,740
relatives or anything
and you get good at it.

4210
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,580
And it's not because you're getting a
stronger intuition with dead people.

4211
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:51,890
It's because you're getting
stronger intuition with them,

4212
02:05:51,891 --> 02:05:53,600
whether or not you're actually
doing it deliberately.

4213
02:05:54,190 --> 02:05:54,611
Yeah.

4214
02:05:54,611 --> 02:05:54,731
I,

4215
02:05:54,731 --> 02:05:58,060
I think that any person who's a huckster,

4216
02:05:58,570 --> 02:06:02,050
if you have been deceiving people for,

4217
02:06:02,051 --> 02:06:02,350
you know,

4218
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:05,170
x amount of years and pulling shit
out of your ass or x amount of years,

4219
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:06,340
you're going to get good at it.

4220
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:07,780
Just like anything else,

4221
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:11,610
you probably do get sort of an
idea of like your grandmother,

4222
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,610
Mrs You,

4223
02:06:12,910 --> 02:06:14,110
my grandma died last year.

4224
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:14,963
Yeah.

4225
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:15,591
And they're,

4226
02:06:15,591 --> 02:06:15,891
you know,

4227
02:06:15,891 --> 02:06:16,940
there are people that have prime.

4228
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:17,361
They're already,

4229
02:06:17,361 --> 02:06:18,400
they're thinking about their dead.

4230
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,030
What always fascinates me,

4231
02:06:21,090 --> 02:06:22,440
I've had a friend that,

4232
02:06:22,441 --> 02:06:22,710
uh,

4233
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:22,981
he's,

4234
02:06:22,981 --> 02:06:24,900
he's gone to psychics
before and he's like,

4235
02:06:24,901 --> 02:06:25,110
dude,

4236
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,160
you wouldn't believe man,

4237
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:27,270
she knew everything about me.

4238
02:06:27,271 --> 02:06:27,571
Match,

4239
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:28,440
just totally legit.

4240
02:06:28,730 --> 02:06:30,570
Starts telling me about
the psychic and I go,

4241
02:06:30,571 --> 02:06:32,190
did she know anything
that you didn't know?

4242
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:33,421
He goes,

4243
02:06:33,421 --> 02:06:33,710
no,

4244
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:34,531
like a little fucking good.

4245
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:35,364
As she's

4246
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:36,961
telling you,

4247
02:06:36,961 --> 02:06:40,050
she's telling you some shit you already
knew about your all family perfect.

4248
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:40,680
He just,

4249
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:44,660
he just paid to have someone
remind you of your memories.

4250
02:06:45,610 --> 02:06:48,720
So the dumbest things ever size that wolf.

4251
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:49,583
Oh my God.

4252
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:51,480
Wilson one shot.

4253
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:53,023
It's crazy.

4254
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:54,450
It was fucking scary,

4255
02:06:54,451 --> 02:06:54,810
man.

4256
02:06:54,810 --> 02:06:56,760
Can we just killed them off.

4257
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:59,160
We killed them off in
America for the longest time,

4258
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:02,230
but thankfully now because
of animal activists,

4259
02:07:02,231 --> 02:07:03,480
they've reintroduced the wolf,

4260
02:07:04,850 --> 02:07:06,900
they're decimating deer
populations throughout the metro.

4261
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:08,670
That desire for control,

4262
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:09,750
it's really strong in us.

4263
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,711
Like even even,

4264
02:07:10,711 --> 02:07:11,011
you know,

4265
02:07:11,011 --> 02:07:12,060
progressive people,

4266
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:12,931
kind people.

4267
02:07:12,931 --> 02:07:13,930
It's that,

4268
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:15,030
that desire to control.

4269
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:16,640
Cause I mean as Kay,

4270
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:19,020
like they think nature is like balanced.

4271
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:22,620
Like people talk about balance in nature
like that is ever fucking existed.

4272
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:26,010
Nature has been a struggle for
three and a half billion years.

4273
02:07:26,011 --> 02:07:30,630
That's why it is as crazy and weird as
it is now because things keep competing

4274
02:07:30,631 --> 02:07:31,291
for space,

4275
02:07:31,291 --> 02:07:32,130
for resources,

4276
02:07:32,131 --> 02:07:32,731
for everything else.

4277
02:07:32,731 --> 02:07:33,600
If I eat a steak,

4278
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:34,840
you can't eat that state.

4279
02:07:34,841 --> 02:07:35,350
Yeah.

4280
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:36,010
And that's a fucking

4281
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,843
problem for you.

4282
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:37,151
Yeah.

4283
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:37,841
And again,

4284
02:07:37,841 --> 02:07:38,111
you know,

4285
02:07:38,111 --> 02:07:40,180
as we were talking about before this,

4286
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:41,220
this balance,

4287
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,000
it's a natural cycle and it's probably
natural that we want to interrupt the

4288
02:07:46,001 --> 02:07:47,530
balance by bringing back the mammoth.

4289
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:50,190
You know that's probably
all some natural are weird.

4290
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:51,130
Again,

4291
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:52,000
I think we should,

4292
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:53,590
I think we should totally take control.

4293
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:55,840
Like not for the same reason
like progressive's too,

4294
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:56,350
but I just,

4295
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:57,183
I think we should.

4296
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:02,210
Scientific reasons and interest
reasons like let's just it a cork,

4297
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:03,490
let's just make it a cool,

4298
02:08:03,550 --> 02:08:04,121
cool world.

4299
02:08:04,121 --> 02:08:04,720
When we're in,

4300
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,160
we're in control so you know,

4301
02:08:06,161 --> 02:08:07,570
you start switching out trees,

4302
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:12,571
maybe maybe start some
genetically modified trees
that leak MDM a or something

4303
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:16,240
Dunkin at the idea this planet,

4304
02:08:16,241 --> 02:08:17,110
like an experiment,

4305
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:18,280
like the experiment that it is.

4306
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:23,340
Dunkin of the idea of
engineering a psychedelic virus
like a even bola and just

4307
02:08:25,111 --> 02:08:28,810
like starts forming acid Ebola
instead of killing people.

4308
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:31,060
Just fucking gives everyone to acid trips.

4309
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:33,850
That sounds more damaging
than a Zombie apocalypse.

4310
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,210
Well it would definitely cut back.

4311
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:40,810
A lot of the work would be
a lot of shit done done.

4312
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:42,070
But at this point in time,

4313
02:08:42,071 --> 02:08:42,904
man,

4314
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,540
think about all the fucking
things that you can buy right now.

4315
02:08:46,870 --> 02:08:48,460
How many of the things that you can buy,

4316
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:52,060
do we actually need or how many of them
will be buying just because they're new?

4317
02:08:52,270 --> 02:08:53,960
I mean if there are things right,

4318
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:56,110
the way the world is right now,

4319
02:08:56,111 --> 02:08:58,420
this very moment today on March,

4320
02:08:58,421 --> 02:08:58,751
what is it?

4321
02:08:58,751 --> 02:09:02,530
The 19th March 19th,

4322
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:03,610
2013 the way things are today,

4323
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:08,910
if we all agree that no one would innovate
and create anything new for one whole

4324
02:09:09,281 --> 02:09:13,720
year and for that next year we work
entirely on getting our shit together.

4325
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:14,620
I have beautiful,

4326
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:15,453
it would be amazing.

4327
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,230
Why do they keep putting
out cars every year?

4328
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:19,140
So many fucking cars.

4329
02:09:19,141 --> 02:09:19,970
It's pretty good.

4330
02:09:19,970 --> 02:09:20,470
Yeah.

4331
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:23,250
They're super great
right now are pretty bad.

4332
02:09:23,251 --> 02:09:26,830
They really long time and I like new cars.

4333
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:27,580
Don't get me wrong.

4334
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:31,960
I like the idea of the new technology
of like the the innovation.

4335
02:09:31,961 --> 02:09:34,540
I like the new stereo
systems and their navigation.

4336
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,250
I love all that stuff,

4337
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:41,310
but if we only have the cars that we
have made already for the next 10 years,

4338
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:43,563
we would be fine.

4339
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:44,620
We'd totally be fine.

4340
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:45,723
But then we never,

4341
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:48,010
we never look at a cell phone and go,

4342
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:48,251
okay,

4343
02:09:48,251 --> 02:09:48,850
we're good.

4344
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:49,470
We got this,

4345
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:50,303
we're good.

4346
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,800
I was thrilled and I still am to love it.

4347
02:09:52,801 --> 02:09:57,430
It's still a galaxy two goddamn
fucking like seven years.

4348
02:09:57,431 --> 02:09:58,690
And then that pitch died on me.

4349
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:01,420
I was extremely sad because
of economic reasons.

4350
02:10:01,421 --> 02:10:02,980
If you are some multimillionaire,

4351
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:05,050
you would have some dope ass crazy phone.

4352
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:06,780
Don't you shake your head at me.

4353
02:10:06,781 --> 02:10:07,540
You son of a bitch.

4354
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:08,650
I don't like new stuff too.

4355
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:10,690
Would order it on Amazon
in the middle of the night.

4356
02:10:10,691 --> 02:10:11,381
I got my room,

4357
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:14,920
I got books and like my laptop tissues.

4358
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:16,900
That's what you got a lot of tissues.

4359
02:10:17,490 --> 02:10:19,480
No Lube Dry Jack.

4360
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:20,410
That's like,

4361
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:21,400
that's how a man does it.

4362
02:10:21,490 --> 02:10:23,500
I would say I sound all those Weirdos,

4363
02:10:23,501 --> 02:10:27,810
lube it up their deck and
clean up all that preparing.

4364
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:28,420
I don't want to,

4365
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,560
I don't want to clean it up at all.

4366
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:32,050
Mining waste of fucking time.

4367
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:32,950
Um,

4368
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:34,100
I know you're skeptical,

4369
02:10:34,101 --> 02:10:34,934
uh,

4370
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:39,140
when it comes to why a lot of things
that haven't been proven by science,

4371
02:10:39,141 --> 02:10:42,320
but what do you this subjects from
coming up and over and over again,

4372
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:43,370
the idea of um,

4373
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:44,720
remote viewing.

4374
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:46,100
Do you think that's all horse shit?

4375
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:47,030
Have you looked into that at all?

4376
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:47,551
I,

4377
02:10:47,551 --> 02:10:50,750
I'm not as much as I
suppose I should cause it,

4378
02:10:50,751 --> 02:10:53,750
it gets in that like if I
look at every club fuckery,

4379
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:54,260
yeah.

4380
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:56,600
I would rather look at things
that somebody knows it's true.

4381
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:57,260
You know,

4382
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:57,501
like,

4383
02:10:57,501 --> 02:10:58,700
cause that reveals more.

4384
02:10:58,701 --> 02:10:59,534
But I,

4385
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:00,553
I think,

4386
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:05,770
I think like the idea of say you being
in a room and there's somebody at the

4387
02:11:06,981 --> 02:11:08,840
doorway and sometimes you notice that,

4388
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:11,090
I think that sounds reasonable.

4389
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:12,223
You know,

4390
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:13,940
that person's disturbing the air.

4391
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:14,901
They're making noise.

4392
02:11:14,901 --> 02:11:16,310
Even if you can't quite hear it.

4393
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:17,180
Like they're,

4394
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:18,013
they're affecting it.

4395
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:19,610
But here's what they should do.

4396
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:21,710
If they think remote
viewing is a real thing,

4397
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:22,830
they,

4398
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:23,930
they should try to figure out,

4399
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,010
like I said earlier,

4400
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:25,910
the mechanism for it.

4401
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,070
Like if you can do remote viewing,

4402
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:29,330
can you do it through glass?

4403
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:29,920
Can you do it through?

4404
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,500
It would,

4405
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,520
can you do it through metal,

4406
02:11:31,690 --> 02:11:32,060
right.

4407
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:34,190
Does it work differently
under these circumstances?

4408
02:11:34,191 --> 02:11:36,290
Why does it work differently
in these circumstances?

4409
02:11:36,291 --> 02:11:37,310
Do the people know each other?

4410
02:11:37,311 --> 02:11:38,210
Do they not know each other?

4411
02:11:38,211 --> 02:11:39,021
Did they have like,

4412
02:11:39,021 --> 02:11:41,900
there are so many questions you could ask
and every time you ask a question that

4413
02:11:41,901 --> 02:11:42,890
you can answer,

4414
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:46,940
you refine your understanding
of what is actually happening.

4415
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:49,250
So they should be doing that

4416
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:51,420
[inaudible] I no not right,

4417
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:53,220
but maybe they don't want,

4418
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:55,230
so it doesn't make any sense.

4419
02:11:55,231 --> 02:11:57,090
Why would they not want
people to know the results?

4420
02:11:57,810 --> 02:12:01,740
I guess there's no profit in
proving that you can remote view.

4421
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:01,991
Yeah.

4422
02:12:01,991 --> 02:12:03,210
And it's not necessarily profit.

4423
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,540
Like I'm sure there's
a lot of people that,

4424
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:05,740
that belief in what they're doing,

4425
02:12:05,741 --> 02:12:08,360
but I think a lot of times they have a,

4426
02:12:08,410 --> 02:12:13,410
a much lower threshold for evidence then
then the scientific community would ask

4427
02:12:15,011 --> 02:12:15,844
of them.

4428
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:16,300
Like,

4429
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:16,541
you know,

4430
02:12:16,541 --> 02:12:21,010
like we did two experiments with some
guy sitting in a room and he noticed the

4431
02:12:21,011 --> 02:12:23,710
guy who was sitting in
another room 60% of the time.

4432
02:12:23,711 --> 02:12:25,510
Like that's slightly peculiar,

4433
02:12:25,511 --> 02:12:26,440
but there's like there,

4434
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:27,220
there's these,

4435
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:28,690
the law of rare events,

4436
02:12:28,930 --> 02:12:29,620
which is like a,

4437
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:32,410
a way of statistically analyzing data.

4438
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:37,660
And like just by the nature of statistics,

4439
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:40,210
you would expect uncommon
things to happen.

4440
02:12:40,660 --> 02:12:42,820
Like somewhat regularly light,

4441
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:44,800
like say with like
basketball making shots.

4442
02:12:44,980 --> 02:12:48,940
Like you would expect that sometimes
somebody makes 10 shots in a row or with a

4443
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:49,660
coin toss,

4444
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,130
you would expect that sometimes,

4445
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:51,820
uh,

4446
02:12:51,820 --> 02:12:53,170
you would get 10 heads in a row.

4447
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:56,580
It would be weird if you didn't
like that would be inexplicably,

4448
02:12:57,010 --> 02:12:59,800
if you never got like 10 heads
in a row after you flipped,

4449
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:02,800
flipped a coin and say a thousand times
or something like that would be the

4450
02:13:02,801 --> 02:13:03,550
weird thing.

4451
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:06,070
So when they do really small tests,

4452
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:06,941
like,

4453
02:13:06,941 --> 02:13:10,240
like say with just a few
people you don't know,

4454
02:13:10,630 --> 02:13:12,580
like if that was an an anomaly,

4455
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:13,750
if it was a curiosity,

4456
02:13:13,751 --> 02:13:14,860
if it was an actual effect,

4457
02:13:14,861 --> 02:13:17,560
you don't know until you keep getting
more and more and more and more data.

4458
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:18,843
And then you refine it.

4459
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:20,343
The Higgs Boson,

4460
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:23,620
they did like billions,

4461
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:23,740
hundreds of billions,

4462
02:13:23,740 --> 02:13:25,140
maybe more uh,

4463
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:26,800
experiments hitting,

4464
02:13:26,830 --> 02:13:28,880
hitting proton beams together to,

4465
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:29,733
to get the,

4466
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:31,770
to get the energy of the Boson out.

4467
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:32,693
How many they do.

4468
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:35,460
I think they do like
billions a day or something.

4469
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:37,050
I can't really remember.

4470
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:37,913
They do what?

4471
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:41,100
Fucking lot billions of impacts a day.

4472
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:42,570
Shit,

4473
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:45,260
I don't actually remember but
they have over time at least done.

4474
02:13:45,261 --> 02:13:45,390
Huh?

4475
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:46,320
Like hundreds of billions.

4476
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,730
They do a lot because I mean it's not,

4477
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,020
it doesn't take a whole lot.

4478
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:51,960
Once you've got the whole setup
going and you just accelerate them,

4479
02:13:51,961 --> 02:13:52,860
smash them together,

4480
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:53,611
data,

4481
02:13:53,611 --> 02:13:56,010
all records and then you load up another,

4482
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:59,400
another round of Proton beams or whatever
it is and you keep doing it over and

4483
02:13:59,401 --> 02:13:59,980
over and over.

4484
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:03,470
And because the Higgs is supposed
to be really hard to find B,

4485
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:03,990
it was,

4486
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:05,490
and it was only supposed to happen.

4487
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:09,660
It was a very rare event just by
the nature of the quantum mechanics.

4488
02:14:09,661 --> 02:14:14,100
Like they smash all these things together
and sometimes you smashed two protons

4489
02:14:14,101 --> 02:14:18,450
together and you get these certain types
of Bose ons and a Neutrino or sometimes

4490
02:14:18,451 --> 02:14:21,490
you smash them together and you get
a bunch of neutrinos and photon and

4491
02:14:21,491 --> 02:14:21,991
something else.

4492
02:14:21,991 --> 02:14:26,400
Like there are different
different combinations of
things you can get once you

4493
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:28,050
create all that,

4494
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:30,860
when to get that amount of mass or of,

4495
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:35,980
of energy of charge distribution of all
these other little quantum effects span

4496
02:14:36,211 --> 02:14:36,841
and everything else.

4497
02:14:36,841 --> 02:14:39,030
When you get them in like one little area,

4498
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:42,070
you get different things
popping out of it.

4499
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:45,390
And popping the Higgs bows on
out was very rare effect that

4500
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:49,100
Boson is one fascinating
thing that they discovered.

4501
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:52,010
Another fascinating thing
was that cork gluon plasma.

4502
02:14:52,670 --> 02:14:53,271
That's a,

4503
02:14:53,271 --> 02:14:54,620
that's some intense shit man.

4504
02:14:54,621 --> 02:14:57,860
What does it like some
insane amount of weight,

4505
02:14:57,861 --> 02:14:59,120
like a sugar cube?

4506
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:00,281
Have you dropped it?

4507
02:15:00,281 --> 02:15:02,060
It would fall straight to
the center of the earth.

4508
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:04,580
Like it's fucking trillions of tons.

4509
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,011
Uh,

4510
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:05,390
yeah,

4511
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:05,550
I,

4512
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:06,850
I don't know specifically about it.

4513
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:07,470
I mean,

4514
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:08,880
so court,

4515
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:09,511
okay.

4516
02:15:09,511 --> 02:15:14,511
So Adam's are made up of electrons on
the outside and shells and then protons

4517
02:15:14,671 --> 02:15:17,370
and neutrons inside protons
having a positive charge,

4518
02:15:17,371 --> 02:15:19,400
neutrons being neutral and a,

4519
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:22,920
the protons and neutrons are
not fundamental particles.

4520
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:23,754
The way the,

4521
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:25,140
the electron is,

4522
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:26,580
the electron is appoint particle,

4523
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:28,080
which I mentioned in a second,

4524
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:28,621
but,

4525
02:15:28,621 --> 02:15:28,810
uh,

4526
02:15:28,810 --> 02:15:31,740
the proton and the neutron
are made up of three quarks,

4527
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:36,210
each of different kinds of different
configurations of these three quirks and

4528
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:37,800
they're just more fundamental particle.

4529
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:42,630
And what's keeping them together is the
strong force and what the strong and the

4530
02:15:42,631 --> 02:15:44,970
strong force is mediated by,

4531
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:46,320
by a blue ones.

4532
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:47,401
In the same way that,

4533
02:15:47,401 --> 02:15:52,170
like we talked about photons and the
electromagnetic field and light is the

4534
02:15:52,171 --> 02:15:55,500
interaction isn't electromatic
magnetic interaction.

4535
02:15:55,501 --> 02:15:56,620
Photons are,

4536
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:57,640
are,

4537
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:00,930
are the mediator of electric fields and

4538
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:01,871
far down,

4539
02:16:01,871 --> 02:16:05,110
can they get where they're going
to actually still see these things?

4540
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:09,460
Like how small does it get
before you're just guessing?

4541
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:11,003
Hmm.

4542
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:11,401
Well,

4543
02:16:11,401 --> 02:16:13,110
I mean his drink theory is guessing,

4544
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:13,500
right?

4545
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:13,681
Well,

4546
02:16:13,681 --> 02:16:14,514
a string theories.

4547
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:15,050
Yeah.

4548
02:16:15,050 --> 02:16:15,660
String theories.

4549
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:16,051
Guessing.

4550
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:16,231
But,

4551
02:16:16,231 --> 02:16:16,590
uh,

4552
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:18,900
I mean like until then,

4553
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:23,760
like that's several orders of magnitude
lower than the subatomic particles.

4554
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:27,240
Like electrons for now as it is,

4555
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:28,230
uh,

4556
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:29,650
they seem to be point particles,

4557
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:32,050
which means there are
zero dimensional there.

4558
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:33,430
They don't have a size,

4559
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:34,610
they don't have a,

4560
02:16:34,610 --> 02:16:35,290
a depth,

4561
02:16:35,290 --> 02:16:36,820
they don't have a surface at all.

4562
02:16:36,890 --> 02:16:37,850
That shit's ridiculous.

4563
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:39,290
I know that's the most,

4564
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:42,290
that's the lowest
measurable point of reality.

4565
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,550
And it's up to Voodoo.

4566
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:44,670
Yeah.

4567
02:16:44,670 --> 02:16:45,090
It's,

4568
02:16:45,090 --> 02:16:45,990
you should think of it as,

4569
02:16:46,020 --> 02:16:50,130
as an intersection of all the different
qualities that makes up and electron

4570
02:16:50,430 --> 02:16:50,671
like,

4571
02:16:50,671 --> 02:16:50,961
but it,

4572
02:16:50,961 --> 02:16:51,320
it,

4573
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:52,590
it doesn't have a surface and we,

4574
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:55,440
and even if it does have a surface,

4575
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:58,600
we can't get close enough to it because
of the whole uncertainty principle with

4576
02:16:58,601 --> 02:16:59,460
him trying to hit it.

4577
02:16:59,461 --> 02:17:01,650
Like if you want to get really close,

4578
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:04,680
like whites got different wavelengths,

4579
02:17:04,710 --> 02:17:04,951
right?

4580
02:17:04,951 --> 02:17:09,900
Like radio waves have a wavelength of
like meters long and then like you squeeze

4581
02:17:09,901 --> 02:17:13,320
them together and you get up to microwaves
and then up to visible light and then

4582
02:17:13,321 --> 02:17:15,000
like ultraviolet light and it's just the,

4583
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:15,121
uh,

4584
02:17:15,121 --> 02:17:17,370
higher wavelength gives
them a higher energy.

4585
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:19,290
So with like a really long wave length,

4586
02:17:19,291 --> 02:17:21,060
it's like having a
really long meter stick.

4587
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:22,550
So if you're trying to measure,

4588
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:27,560
say like the width of your
foot with a yard steak,

4589
02:17:27,931 --> 02:17:30,090
you're going to get a
really inaccurate answer.

4590
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,320
So you want something smaller.

4591
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:33,090
And that's the same thing
with measuring position.

4592
02:17:33,091 --> 02:17:35,730
You want something smaller to measure
it and that's a smaller wavelength.

4593
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:37,440
But as you do that,

4594
02:17:37,441 --> 02:17:38,880
you get a much higher energy.

4595
02:17:39,090 --> 02:17:42,900
So they smash into that fucking electron
and then you're not quite sure what the

4596
02:17:42,901 --> 02:17:44,220
fuck happened there because it hit it.

4597
02:17:44,221 --> 02:17:45,054
So

4598
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:49,730
basically we'll then be able to figure
things out better in the future with more

4599
02:17:49,731 --> 02:17:50,750
accurate measurement.

4600
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:51,281
Hopefully.

4601
02:17:51,281 --> 02:17:51,610
Well,

4602
02:17:51,610 --> 02:17:52,510
I mean what we,

4603
02:17:53,410 --> 02:17:54,940
I mean and that's not,

4604
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:56,050
not in that way.

4605
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:57,640
Like we're never going to be able to,

4606
02:17:57,820 --> 02:18:02,820
like we can create the whole spectrum
of light gamma rays being being the most

4607
02:18:04,271 --> 02:18:04,501
dense.

4608
02:18:04,501 --> 02:18:08,740
And if you tried to put more energy
into that and to such a small area,

4609
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,360
you'll start getting like particles.

4610
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:12,310
Cause it's too,

4611
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:13,240
too much energy.

4612
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:14,890
I'm like their light,

4613
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:16,750
it'll just turn into a particle.

4614
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:18,280
So when they see an electron,

4615
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:19,810
like when they can measure an electron,

4616
02:18:19,811 --> 02:18:21,250
what exactly do they really say?

4617
02:18:21,950 --> 02:18:22,783
The,

4618
02:18:22,990 --> 02:18:25,960
the electrical resistance
of it to the photon.

4619
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,190
Wow.

4620
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:27,610
Yes.

4621
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:28,540
And so,

4622
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:29,740
uh,

4623
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:34,740
we know now that like virtual particles
are popping out of these things all the

4624
02:18:34,841 --> 02:18:35,141
time.

4625
02:18:35,141 --> 02:18:39,370
Like they talk about the
electric field of the electron,

4626
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:43,000
but that field is chunky.

4627
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:45,530
It's quantized right it,

4628
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:50,580
so it's not smooth and it just doesn't
like start dense and like fade out as it

4629
02:18:50,651 --> 02:18:51,010
goes.

4630
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:55,870
It's all these little virtual particles
that are go and they go out and then

4631
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:56,704
they fall back in.

4632
02:18:56,710 --> 02:19:00,960
It's until something else hits the
average person who's driving in their car

4633
02:19:00,961 --> 02:19:03,930
right now listening to you
talk to understand what the
fuck you're even saying.

4634
02:19:03,931 --> 02:19:05,340
I have no idea where to start.

4635
02:19:05,341 --> 02:19:05,551
Yeah.

4636
02:19:05,551 --> 02:19:06,870
It's like that's the hardest part.

4637
02:19:06,871 --> 02:19:08,910
Like this is your educational background,

4638
02:19:08,911 --> 02:19:13,911
which trying to dense it or condense it
rather to these sort of understandable

4639
02:19:14,311 --> 02:19:19,290
terms where someone without a great
deal of education and it can understand

4640
02:19:19,291 --> 02:19:19,401
that.

4641
02:19:19,401 --> 02:19:19,670
Yeah.

4642
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:19,941
Yeah.

4643
02:19:19,941 --> 02:19:20,390
So,

4644
02:19:20,390 --> 02:19:22,820
so if you think of any,

4645
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:27,020
any electron and it's got this charge
and a lot of people kind of know that and

4646
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:29,210
deal with static charge
and shit like that.

4647
02:19:29,211 --> 02:19:31,790
So it's got this field emanating from it.

4648
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:34,430
And for a while we thought it
was just a really smooth field,

4649
02:19:34,431 --> 02:19:38,540
kind of the way you would imagine like
an aura of sorts emanating from this

4650
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:39,200
thing.

4651
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:43,010
But then with quantum mechanics and
then later quantum field theory,

4652
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:45,620
we realized that even that is not true.

4653
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:46,880
Even that's not smooth.

4654
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:52,150
It's made up of this chunky super position
of of other particles that kind of

4655
02:19:54,261 --> 02:19:56,930
behaves like a field until you
get really detailed with it.

4656
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:57,440
Right.

4657
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:58,273
And so it's,

4658
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:02,870
it's emanating and reabsorbing all of
these little particles all the time.

4659
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:06,110
And so when you try to hit
it with another particle,

4660
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:07,820
you don't know which of these particles,

4661
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:10,910
which momentum or anything like
that are going to interfere with it.

4662
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:12,080
And this is kind of,

4663
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:16,400
we're a part of the uncertainty comes
from like you don't know when and where

4664
02:20:16,610 --> 02:20:21,110
these little bits are coming out of the
electron and when they're absorbing in

4665
02:20:21,111 --> 02:20:23,210
or where it's jumping around
and all this other shit.

4666
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:25,130
So they're,

4667
02:20:25,131 --> 02:20:29,390
they're just being created and usually
they get reabsorbed but if something else

4668
02:20:29,391 --> 02:20:30,830
gets in there then they,

4669
02:20:30,831 --> 02:20:33,770
you start hitting back on it and
then when that light comes back,

4670
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:36,170
that's the surface that we
see when we try to measure it.

4671
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:41,340
So fucked up that you think is of the
nature of reality at its smallest point is

4672
02:20:41,341 --> 02:20:44,910
that it really is like
little crazy magical elves.

4673
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,141
Yeah,

4674
02:20:45,141 --> 02:20:45,974
it's kind of a bummer.

4675
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:47,213
Why is it a bummer?

4676
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:48,350
So it's super embarrassing.

4677
02:20:48,450 --> 02:20:49,680
Like it could have been much easier,

4678
02:20:50,250 --> 02:20:51,120
but it's amazing.

4679
02:20:51,121 --> 02:20:51,601
It is amazing.

4680
02:20:51,601 --> 02:20:52,261
It's amazing.

4681
02:20:52,261 --> 02:20:54,960
It's amazing that most
things are filled with space,

4682
02:20:55,320 --> 02:20:56,153
empty space,

4683
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:59,220
even hard things or the
majority of it is just nothing.

4684
02:20:59,360 --> 02:20:59,750
Yeah.

4685
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:03,540
All this thinking of things is solid
is just a really good approximation for

4686
02:21:03,541 --> 02:21:04,374
things our size.

4687
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:04,800
I'm like,

4688
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:05,940
that's why we developed that.

4689
02:21:05,941 --> 02:21:06,540
It's just,

4690
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:06,841
I mean,

4691
02:21:06,841 --> 02:21:08,040
because effectively it is,

4692
02:21:08,550 --> 02:21:10,320
but it's just an electric field.

4693
02:21:10,430 --> 02:21:11,263
That tour we're hitting.

4694
02:21:12,210 --> 02:21:13,020
It's too crazy.

4695
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:15,170
Sometimes it makes me tired like this one,

4696
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:17,970
just this podcast just made
me tired cause I'm like,

4697
02:21:17,971 --> 02:21:18,781
it's just too much.

4698
02:21:18,781 --> 02:21:19,614
It's just too nutty.

4699
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:21,300
And this is all I think about everyday.

4700
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:23,700
All me to that in um,

4701
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,350
simulation theory simulation.

4702
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:28,440
The other thing that's been bounced
around in my head all day that's a,

4703
02:21:28,470 --> 02:21:29,820
that James Gates Shit.

4704
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:30,723
Yeah.

4705
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:34,530
Superstring the James kept
correcting computer code.

4706
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:35,310
Yeah.

4707
02:21:35,310 --> 02:21:37,510
And I certainly don't know
enough about string theory

4708
02:21:37,610 --> 02:21:40,790
or computer code to really comment on it.

4709
02:21:40,791 --> 02:21:42,650
But I think it's
interesting cause it's like,

4710
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:43,723
it's not like,

4711
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:47,300
like what would be the difference
between this universe in a real one?

4712
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:48,620
Like would that,

4713
02:21:49,010 --> 02:21:51,680
would those characteristics
exist in a real one?

4714
02:21:51,681 --> 02:21:52,730
If we were in a fake one?

4715
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:53,331
And by the way,

4716
02:21:53,331 --> 02:21:53,540
I'm,

4717
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:54,490
I'm sure we're,

4718
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,393
we're real

4719
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:57,260
and I'm also sure it
doesn't really matter.

4720
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:58,183
I'm not sure.

4721
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:59,210
I don't think it matters.

4722
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:01,280
I doesn't matter if it's this good.

4723
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:01,870
Hm.

4724
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:02,361
Doesn't matter.

4725
02:22:02,361 --> 02:22:04,430
I mean it is most
certainly its own universe.

4726
02:22:04,431 --> 02:22:05,720
Like unless there was something

4727
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:07,860
that could cease it,

4728
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:10,290
like I don't see any reason to not.

4729
02:22:10,291 --> 02:22:12,540
Thank you mean by sees it
like in the universal media.

4730
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:15,520
Well then why would it have to do that
if you've curse while I was working for

4731
02:22:15,521 --> 02:22:18,820
Google in my leaves might get
assimilated into the program.

4732
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:19,510
The,

4733
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:22,990
the idea that technology
is ever increasing,

4734
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:27,030
exponentially constant never going change
unless there's a natural disaster or

4735
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:28,710
nuclear bombs or whatever
the fuck happens.

4736
02:22:29,070 --> 02:22:31,640
If that does happen it will be inevitable.

4737
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:32,250
But we have,

4738
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:36,420
well first we have to assume that
that is actually something that,

4739
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:39,150
that somebody could do is
create a perfect simulation.

4740
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:40,230
I mean we assume so,

4741
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:43,260
but we haven't seen
anybody say that though.

4742
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:48,800
Given all the time in the world it's
inevitable without interference.

4743
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:49,840
I don't know cause I don't know.

4744
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:51,510
It's like I don't,

4745
02:22:51,511 --> 02:22:52,800
I don't know how to make a universe.

4746
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,473
I know we,

4747
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:56,370
we could assume something but I have not.

4748
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,750
And also besides that,

4749
02:22:57,751 --> 02:22:58,171
like you know,

4750
02:22:58,171 --> 02:22:59,820
Lauren's crafts in the
universe from nothing.

4751
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:00,350
Yes.

4752
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:05,350
Like those universes that just pop out
of nothing seems like they would probably

4753
02:23:06,721 --> 02:23:11,721
be way more common than created universes
because there's a lot of space for an

4754
02:23:11,761 --> 02:23:13,110
entire new universe to grow in.

4755
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:16,230
But ultimately it doesn't even matter
whether it's more common as long as it

4756
02:23:16,231 --> 02:23:17,420
happens once you,

4757
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:21,510
as long as one species that's super
intelligent and keeps going on and on

4758
02:23:21,511 --> 02:23:22,440
without interruption.

4759
02:23:22,441 --> 02:23:26,280
But natural disaster for the next
hundred thousand years and computer power

4760
02:23:26,281 --> 02:23:30,000
exponentially increases to the point
where video games become virtual reality

4761
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:30,873
versions.

4762
02:23:30,990 --> 02:23:31,410
Like,

4763
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:32,850
like for all we know,

4764
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:37,730
I mean this universe is extremely large.

4765
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:39,230
Took a lot of energy.

4766
02:23:39,231 --> 02:23:40,064
It's infinite.

4767
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:41,000
Yeah.

4768
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:41,690
It's like,

4769
02:23:41,690 --> 02:23:44,090
and fractal meaning infinite universes.

4770
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:45,393
Wow.

4771
02:23:46,430 --> 02:23:47,263
Well,

4772
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:48,530
okay.

4773
02:23:48,530 --> 02:23:48,690
I,

4774
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:50,010
I don't think we really,

4775
02:23:50,370 --> 02:23:52,080
we really know that about fracking.

4776
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:52,560
I mean,

4777
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,610
they're fractal.

4778
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:58,200
All the natural fractals are limited
to a certain number of scales,

4779
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:59,310
like the random fractals,

4780
02:23:59,311 --> 02:23:59,831
like the mantle,

4781
02:23:59,831 --> 02:24:02,460
but mental broad set and the
Julia sets and stuff like that.

4782
02:24:02,461 --> 02:24:03,294
Those are infinite.

4783
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:05,730
But we've never seen an
infinite fractal in nature.

4784
02:24:05,731 --> 02:24:06,870
We see stuff like ferns,

4785
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:08,220
which makes sense on the leaf.

4786
02:24:08,350 --> 02:24:09,183
The branch.

4787
02:24:09,470 --> 02:24:09,681
Yeah.

4788
02:24:09,681 --> 02:24:09,900
Yeah.

4789
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:10,050
We,

4790
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:10,310
we,

4791
02:24:10,310 --> 02:24:12,060
we see it in certain places,

4792
02:24:12,061 --> 02:24:13,740
but there's always a
top and a bottom to it.

4793
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:14,940
I get it never goes.

4794
02:24:15,150 --> 02:24:16,610
It's never infinite scales.

4795
02:24:16,890 --> 02:24:17,460
Right.

4796
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:18,120
It,

4797
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:18,510
so,

4798
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:21,810
but the idea of the
universe being fractal,

4799
02:24:21,811 --> 02:24:22,321
isn't it?

4800
02:24:22,321 --> 02:24:25,890
That the black holes are
gateways to another universe.

4801
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:29,730
Each black hole contains
hundreds of billions of galaxies,

4802
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,640
each with a black hole inside of them
with hundreds of billions of galaxies

4803
02:24:32,641 --> 02:24:33,474
inside of it.

4804
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:38,600
And since that may not be necessarily
infinite but in measurable.

4805
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:41,340
Gotcha.

4806
02:24:41,340 --> 02:24:41,700
Well,

4807
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:42,150
I mean,

4808
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:43,980
black holes do have a finite energy,

4809
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:45,150
right?

4810
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:45,910
They do it,

4811
02:24:45,910 --> 02:24:46,151
it,

4812
02:24:46,151 --> 02:24:46,650
it,

4813
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:47,640
it defines their,

4814
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:48,533
their side,

4815
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:52,250
maybe 1% of the mass of
the galaxy that exists.

4816
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:53,671
Yeah.

4817
02:24:53,671 --> 02:24:54,750
Super massive black holes.

4818
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:55,081
So,

4819
02:24:55,081 --> 02:24:55,831
so it is defined.

4820
02:24:55,831 --> 02:25:00,831
So maybe like if there's other
universes inside a black hole,

4821
02:25:01,390 --> 02:25:02,223
like

4822
02:25:04,060 --> 02:25:07,240
the universe itself inside the black
home may be defined by the size of the

4823
02:25:07,241 --> 02:25:08,074
black hole.

4824
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:09,011
Yeah.

4825
02:25:09,011 --> 02:25:13,270
But it's like we have all these
black holes in our universe,

4826
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:13,571
right?

4827
02:25:13,571 --> 02:25:15,970
So if our universe was
inside a black hole,

4828
02:25:15,971 --> 02:25:19,900
it would have to contain all the
energy of all those black holes also,

4829
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:23,300
unless it's just popped out of nothing.

4830
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:23,990
And then

4831
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:25,220
if it's popping out of nothing,

4832
02:25:25,221 --> 02:25:26,900
then we don't need to
be inside a black hole.

4833
02:25:26,901 --> 02:25:28,100
We don't need to be inside.

4834
02:25:28,101 --> 02:25:30,800
Anything inside may be a
completely arbitrary concept.

4835
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,630
Yeah,

4836
02:25:31,630 --> 02:25:32,180
it may be.

4837
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:32,870
Yeah,

4838
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:36,720
it's a part of like these
are doorways and I mean like,

4839
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:41,770
like the whole other things that
indicate that maybe our universes is just

4840
02:25:42,381 --> 02:25:46,670
generated out of nothing is the fact
that if you take all the energy and

4841
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:47,180
there's,

4842
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:50,960
there's positive energy of all the
stuff and there's negative energy from,

4843
02:25:51,050 --> 02:25:54,650
from relationships between gravitation
and like the location of things.

4844
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:55,641
If you add it all up,

4845
02:25:55,641 --> 02:25:56,870
it seems to add up to zero,

4846
02:25:57,470 --> 02:26:02,470
which is say that our universe has
a net total energy content of zero,

4847
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:06,290
which is kind of what you would expect
for something that came from nothing.

4848
02:26:07,010 --> 02:26:07,843
Nothing at all.

4849
02:26:08,210 --> 02:26:08,930
Rather than,

4850
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:11,720
than being generated by a computer
program or anything like that.

4851
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:14,400
The wackiest theory of
the world has ever known.

4852
02:26:14,401 --> 02:26:16,980
Forget about Jesus and Moses and Thor.

4853
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:20,130
How about the fact that the
fucking scientific community,

4854
02:26:20,310 --> 02:26:21,150
the communities,

4855
02:26:21,210 --> 02:26:26,210
number one theory on the creation of
the universe is the Big Bang theory?

4856
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:26,900
Yeah,

4857
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:27,560
yeah,

4858
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:27,880
yeah.

4859
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,110
It,

4860
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:28,760
I mean,

4861
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:29,593
but it's,

4862
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:31,490
it's where all the evidence pointed.

4863
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:31,760
Yeah.

4864
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,451
Like that's the thing,

4865
02:26:32,451 --> 02:26:33,560
like we couldn't make it up.

4866
02:26:33,561 --> 02:26:35,420
It's just seems to be like,

4867
02:26:35,421 --> 02:26:35,840
it's not,

4868
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:36,770
it's not scientist fault.

4869
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:37,810
That's so insane.

4870
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:41,920
The idea that the universe was smaller
than literally the head of a pin.

4871
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:43,300
The entire universe,

4872
02:26:43,630 --> 02:26:44,830
infinitely dense,

4873
02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:47,920
smaller the head of a pin and go.

4874
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:48,610
Yeah.

4875
02:26:48,610 --> 02:26:52,270
I mean technically we're still
pretty uncertain about that first,

4876
02:26:52,271 --> 02:26:53,190
like second or two,

4877
02:26:53,470 --> 02:26:54,303
right.

4878
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:56,180
Most of the universe we,

4879
02:26:56,181 --> 02:26:59,830
we understand pretty well up until
you get to like that first second.

4880
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:01,510
But isn't it funny that people like,

4881
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:02,141
Oh,

4882
02:27:02,141 --> 02:27:04,690
you really believe Jesus
came back from the dead?

4883
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:08,920
That so unlikely.

4884
02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:09,470
Well,

4885
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:10,303
is it,

4886
02:27:10,930 --> 02:27:15,930
is it any more unlikely than the whole
fucking universe existing out of a tiny

4887
02:27:16,691 --> 02:27:18,430
things smaller than the head of a pin,

4888
02:27:18,431 --> 02:27:20,620
which explodes for no apparent reason.

4889
02:27:21,070 --> 02:27:22,000
No University?

4890
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:22,351
Well,

4891
02:27:22,351 --> 02:27:24,000
we know at least one universe exists.

4892
02:27:24,030 --> 02:27:26,100
We don't know at least one person
that's come back from the dead.

4893
02:27:26,190 --> 02:27:26,940
That's true.

4894
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:27,773
Yeah.

4895
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:30,870
You gotta go where the evidence hasn't
come right from the dead and we know the

4896
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:34,410
billions of people have lived and died
and none of them have told us about her

4897
02:27:34,411 --> 02:27:34,760
plan like,

4898
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:34,841
well,

4899
02:27:34,841 --> 02:27:35,491
you don't know,

4900
02:27:35,491 --> 02:27:36,210
man.

4901
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:40,060
I saw this Morgan back from the dead
and then he took his body to heaven.

4902
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:43,830
He took the evidence to have an like an
ass Holsten you people are not ready for

4903
02:27:43,831 --> 02:27:44,664
him yet.

4904
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:47,730
We've got to wait till we get our
shit together and they'll come back.

4905
02:27:48,810 --> 02:27:49,201
Great.

4906
02:27:49,201 --> 02:27:53,400
If like God didn't realize that people
were too dumb to get the message.

4907
02:27:54,090 --> 02:27:55,140
2000 years ago,

4908
02:27:55,141 --> 02:27:55,500
he was like,

4909
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:55,951
oh my God.

4910
02:27:55,951 --> 02:27:56,880
These people are fucking idiots.

4911
02:27:57,410 --> 02:27:59,130
They've been worshiping cows for while.

4912
02:27:59,131 --> 02:28:02,130
I think if God really wanted
us to get the message,

4913
02:28:02,131 --> 02:28:04,020
she would probably tell us all the time

4914
02:28:05,690 --> 02:28:07,530
back when people didn't have phones.

4915
02:28:07,590 --> 02:28:07,741
Yeah,

4916
02:28:07,741 --> 02:28:12,600
it's either that or he's a gigantic
Dick is going to punish you for all of

4917
02:28:12,601 --> 02:28:16,470
eternity based on some hearsay you're
going to get from people who fuck kids.

4918
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:21,770
If there's self-aware organisms in the
universe and you made the and you give a

4919
02:28:21,871 --> 02:28:23,600
shit about anything they do.

4920
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:24,220
Yeah.

4921
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:25,053
Just bring it up.

4922
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:25,261
Yeah.

4923
02:28:25,261 --> 02:28:28,740
Don't leave them with a book that's been
translated three different times and

4924
02:28:28,741 --> 02:28:31,710
three of them different fucking languages
that are thousands of years old.

4925
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:33,450
Microsoft updates like every four years.

4926
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:37,560
If God really was that guy like,

4927
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:38,010
man,

4928
02:28:38,010 --> 02:28:38,251
what?

4929
02:28:38,251 --> 02:28:43,251
How bad would that suck if we really
were under the the complete power of some

4930
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:44,743
Dick of

4931
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:48,740
3000 years ago I came down,

4932
02:28:48,741 --> 02:28:50,000
I gave you a Zombie.

4933
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:51,320
He came back to life.

4934
02:28:51,321 --> 02:28:52,190
You don't pay attention.

4935
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:53,180
Fuck you.

4936
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:53,541
Fuck you.

4937
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:54,440
Then burn in hell.

4938
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:56,540
What about the baby's awesome?

4939
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:58,353
He has a very,

4940
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,440
very low criteria.

4941
02:29:00,690 --> 02:29:01,480
Maybe he has done,

4942
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:02,313
you don't even know.

4943
02:29:02,910 --> 02:29:07,800
The most mind blowing thing that I ever
heard when in relationship or in that

4944
02:29:07,801 --> 02:29:10,020
relates to the size of
the universe was on that.

4945
02:29:10,050 --> 02:29:12,120
Even watch that Morgan
Freeman show through the,

4946
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:13,860
through the worm hole or whatever it is,

4947
02:29:14,010 --> 02:29:14,720
really shit.

4948
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:19,170
They had these scientists that
were trying to explain infinite.

4949
02:29:19,830 --> 02:29:23,010
They're trying to explain the the
infinite nature of the universe.

4950
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:28,880
And he said that infinite is so big
and this is so hard to understand.

4951
02:29:29,791 --> 02:29:34,791
But what infinite means is that not
only is there an exact version of earth

4952
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:41,540
somewhere but the exact series of
events exactly as they've happened here,

4953
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:48,200
happened there like there are so many
earths that would be so many environments

4954
02:29:48,871 --> 02:29:53,040
that are exactly like ours because you're
dealing literally with something that

4955
02:29:53,041 --> 02:29:54,120
has no end.

4956
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:59,210
So in the insanely vast
distance of forever literally.

4957
02:30:00,810 --> 02:30:04,560
And we could still say that there are
certain things that wouldn't be like there

4958
02:30:04,561 --> 02:30:06,180
wouldn't be yes and maybe no,

4959
02:30:06,330 --> 02:30:10,110
maybe everything would happen exactly
as it did on this in this earth.

4960
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:13,920
But right next door
there's a fucking earth,

4961
02:30:13,950 --> 02:30:18,720
you know a couple of trillion light years
away that everything happened up until

4962
02:30:18,721 --> 02:30:19,531
a certain point.

4963
02:30:19,531 --> 02:30:24,270
And then you got ahold of some Parkinson's
disease medication that turned you

4964
02:30:24,271 --> 02:30:28,140
into a gay sex and gambling addicts and
your life went off the fucking rails.

4965
02:30:28,650 --> 02:30:29,161
Things like that.

4966
02:30:29,161 --> 02:30:29,521
But like,

4967
02:30:29,521 --> 02:30:32,730
there wouldn't be a universe where you
and I are having this conversation except

4968
02:30:32,731 --> 02:30:37,731
Brian is a pink hippo like mine because
the laws of the universe that made us

4969
02:30:39,450 --> 02:30:41,190
don't include pink hippos.

4970
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:42,450
Hippo produced can talk,

4971
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:45,061
he's all bummed out.

4972
02:30:45,061 --> 02:30:47,760
He wanted to be a pink
hippo is pink hippo.

4973
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:49,530
That's why they wanted to be a dolphin.

4974
02:30:52,170 --> 02:30:53,280
A dolphin.

4975
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:53,791
Oh,

4976
02:30:53,791 --> 02:30:55,050
you want to be in a dolphin?

4977
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:56,760
But no,

4978
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:57,150
uh,

4979
02:30:57,150 --> 02:30:57,610
uh,

4980
02:30:57,610 --> 02:30:58,730
there was this conversation on,

4981
02:30:58,731 --> 02:31:01,980
on the board recently where
I brought up the thing about,

4982
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:02,833
uh,

4983
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:04,740
if you had a thousand
monkeys on typewriters,

4984
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:07,530
eventually they would write the works of
Shakespeare given an infinite number of

4985
02:31:07,531 --> 02:31:08,640
time or amount of time.

4986
02:31:08,670 --> 02:31:09,720
I think that's horse shit.

4987
02:31:10,230 --> 02:31:12,690
But it is true because an
infant in a number of time.

4988
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:13,723
Yeah,

4989
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:15,650
because if you had like it,

4990
02:31:16,050 --> 02:31:17,700
let's just take out the monkeys and say,

4991
02:31:17,701 --> 02:31:19,140
you have one computer program.

4992
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:22,020
You imagine that a monkey really did,

4993
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:22,771
right?

4994
02:31:22,771 --> 02:31:24,300
Like Romeo and Juliet.

4995
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:27,120
You just left this monkey in a
fucking room of the Thai baht.

4996
02:31:27,121 --> 02:31:28,830
And most of it was dog shit.

4997
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:31,740
Most of them just a Dcsi.

4998
02:31:31,770 --> 02:31:32,041
Why,

4999
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:32,700
why?

5000
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:37,110
But one day that monkey just got it right
and his little fucking eyes rolled in

5001
02:31:37,111 --> 02:31:39,450
the back of his head like a slot
machine and he starts typing.

5002
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:45,180
It just can't even right at the end of
midsummer night's dream car about Romeo.

5003
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:46,201
I mean,

5004
02:31:46,201 --> 02:31:46,771
the question is,

5005
02:31:46,771 --> 02:31:47,340
you know,

5006
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:50,130
like say you're randomly
selecting characters,

5007
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:54,480
like each character is randomly selected
and you do this for an infinite string

5008
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:55,523
of characters,

5009
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:57,900
then not only would you get,

5010
02:31:58,430 --> 02:31:58,950
uh,

5011
02:31:58,950 --> 02:32:00,480
the entire works of Shakespeare,

5012
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:02,580
but you would get an
infinite number of times.

5013
02:32:02,670 --> 02:32:04,740
You would get it backwards
an infinite number of times.

5014
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:06,330
You would get every
chapter in every order,

5015
02:32:06,331 --> 02:32:09,780
an infinite number of times you would
get everything that's ever been written

5016
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:13,920
and every single order that you could
ever think to put it in an infinite number

5017
02:32:13,921 --> 02:32:15,390
of times by much sweat,

5018
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:16,253
infinite.

5019
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:17,363
That monkeys,

5020
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:18,870
well,

5021
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:19,703
he's on a typewriter.

5022
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:20,670
I would use chimps,

5023
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:22,220
but yeah,

5024
02:32:22,260 --> 02:32:22,560
they're,

5025
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:24,060
they wouldn't hurt their little fingers.

5026
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:24,940
Monkeys,

5027
02:32:24,940 --> 02:32:25,980
they're little tiny hands.

5028
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:27,031
Yeah,

5029
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:27,570
man,

5030
02:32:27,570 --> 02:32:29,370
that's the word.

5031
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:30,190
Yeah.

5032
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:35,100
Even that it doesn't even begin to
describe it and that that word is a real

5033
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:35,940
problem word.

5034
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:36,471
We don't,

5035
02:32:36,471 --> 02:32:37,050
we really,

5036
02:32:37,050 --> 02:32:38,400
that doesn't register with me.

5037
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:39,660
When I say infinite,

5038
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:41,380
I might just like space.

5039
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:44,700
It's like until I can think
about it and then it keeps going.

5040
02:32:45,450 --> 02:32:48,960
I mean even just like when you see
those videos of like they send a probe,

5041
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:52,050
like an artificial probe like to show
you what it looks like when they leave

5042
02:32:52,051 --> 02:32:56,130
earth and then it sees the moon and it
sees the other outer planets and then it

5043
02:32:56,131 --> 02:32:56,730
sees,

5044
02:32:56,730 --> 02:32:57,031
you know,

5045
02:32:57,031 --> 02:32:57,271
the,

5046
02:32:57,271 --> 02:32:58,560
the galaxy from a distance.

5047
02:32:58,561 --> 02:32:59,610
Then it keeps going and going.

5048
02:33:00,030 --> 02:33:01,050
That doesn't work.

5049
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:02,320
It doesn't get in there.

5050
02:33:02,370 --> 02:33:03,140
It doesn't get in there.

5051
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:03,880
I mean that they're,

5052
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:06,810
they're so fucking far away when you
have to start thinking about the speed of

5053
02:33:06,811 --> 02:33:07,410
light,

5054
02:33:07,410 --> 02:33:10,680
like the fact that the sun is
like eight light minutes away.

5055
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:13,050
Maurice is like 30 light minutes away.

5056
02:33:13,051 --> 02:33:17,490
Pluto is like 18 hours
away in terms of lights.

5057
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:17,791
We'll,

5058
02:33:17,791 --> 02:33:19,470
Dr Greer's going to let us know,

5059
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:21,300
goodness,

5060
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:26,300
how big the universe is when reveals
what the aliens have been telling him and

5061
02:33:26,941 --> 02:33:27,350
uh,

5062
02:33:27,350 --> 02:33:29,790
which you would think he would
know so much that he actually,

5063
02:33:29,791 --> 02:33:31,590
he meditated and contacted them.

5064
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:32,680
That's the way to do it.

5065
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:33,690
You know,

5066
02:33:33,690 --> 02:33:35,880
you really should have asked
him some of their new science.

5067
02:33:35,881 --> 02:33:38,580
Like surely they know some
things that scientists don't.

5068
02:33:38,581 --> 02:33:39,720
That would really help us long.

5069
02:33:39,810 --> 02:33:40,800
Well they know how to come here.

5070
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:42,370
Well they're really good us.

5071
02:33:42,380 --> 02:33:43,260
We knew how to go there.

5072
02:33:43,950 --> 02:33:45,690
Do you really want to
go there though dude?

5073
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:46,800
Cause what if you get stuck?

5074
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:47,491
I don't know.

5075
02:33:47,491 --> 02:33:48,360
Maybe that's why they're here.

5076
02:33:48,361 --> 02:33:49,260
Cause it fucking sucks.

5077
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:53,090
Could be they don't have
gazelles or anything there.

5078
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:53,431
Yeah,

5079
02:33:53,431 --> 02:33:54,460
they probably just all of them,

5080
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:56,790
they've,

5081
02:33:56,790 --> 02:34:01,020
they've bred themselves to the point with
a uniform that either they're all just

5082
02:34:01,021 --> 02:34:03,120
great things with a big
fucking stupid heads.

5083
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:04,530
No muscles.

5084
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:06,120
Do you ever say years ago they had a,

5085
02:34:06,121 --> 02:34:11,121
that thing about if you
distorted a person's face and
the way that a baby's fit,

5086
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:17,980
what happened to

5087
02:34:18,410 --> 02:34:19,243
it?

5088
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:23,760
Because you use in a fucking shitty
Samsung device instead of a God damn apple

5089
02:34:23,761 --> 02:34:24,270
iPad.

5090
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:24,451
No,

5091
02:34:24,451 --> 02:34:26,540
I'm using the iPad but the,

5092
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:27,080
the uh,

5093
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:27,913
uh,

5094
02:34:28,050 --> 02:34:29,850
the way the babies visual system,

5095
02:34:29,851 --> 02:34:31,380
it's like inaccurate.

5096
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:33,360
Like it's weak in various areas.

5097
02:34:33,361 --> 02:34:35,280
And if you do that to
an image of a person,

5098
02:34:35,550 --> 02:34:38,940
you get something like
it kind of bends outward.

5099
02:34:38,941 --> 02:34:40,530
So it kind of seems like
they have a larger head,

5100
02:34:40,531 --> 02:34:43,470
their eyes get much bigger because
they're very prominent in that part of the

5101
02:34:43,471 --> 02:34:44,940
brain that recognizes faces.

5102
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,510
Hmm.

5103
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:49,110
And A and it gets a little colorless
and they kind of look like aliens.

5104
02:34:50,130 --> 02:34:51,450
That was an assumption.

5105
02:34:51,451 --> 02:34:52,080
That was years ago.

5106
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,640
I Dunno if they follow it up.

5107
02:34:53,670 --> 02:34:54,451
Well that's interesting.

5108
02:34:54,451 --> 02:34:59,451
So the images that we have from our
early childhood might sort of be the

5109
02:34:59,970 --> 02:35:00,803
archetype.

5110
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:06,320
Some reason for angels and aliens and
Demons and all these other make believe

5111
02:35:06,671 --> 02:35:09,790
things that people keep thinking they're
interacting with throughout history.

5112
02:35:09,791 --> 02:35:10,624
Like there's,

5113
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:11,770
there's some sort of reason for that.

5114
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:14,980
What do you think it is neurologically?

5115
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:17,630
Do you think it also the extrapolation,

5116
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:19,120
like the idea that you're,

5117
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:22,880
your body knows where it's going
and that that's the future.

5118
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:24,650
Like if we look at chimps,

5119
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:25,610
lower primates,

5120
02:35:25,611 --> 02:35:26,444
whatever it is,

5121
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:28,670
and then we look at human
beings and following the trend.

5122
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:30,231
If you look at that,

5123
02:35:30,231 --> 02:35:30,981
that is the trend.

5124
02:35:30,981 --> 02:35:32,540
I mean we are the the ape man.

5125
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:33,403
Maybe you know,

5126
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:34,040
it's the trend.

5127
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:34,560
Like we're,

5128
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:35,670
I think,

5129
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:38,370
I think that would be great if we start
going in space and we lose all our

5130
02:35:38,371 --> 02:35:39,240
muscle mass in our,

5131
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:42,180
in our hair and our
guys are dicks to dude.

5132
02:35:42,181 --> 02:35:43,014
They have no decks.

5133
02:35:43,050 --> 02:35:43,680
Dude.

5134
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:48,680
Imagine the processing power
of their internal pornography.

5135
02:35:49,890 --> 02:35:50,670
Yeah.

5136
02:35:50,670 --> 02:35:53,580
I think it just touch you on your nose
and you'd come in your pants but you

5137
02:35:53,581 --> 02:35:54,450
wouldn't even have pants.

5138
02:35:55,050 --> 02:35:55,351
God,

5139
02:35:55,351 --> 02:35:56,700
that's the best x man ever.

5140
02:35:58,770 --> 02:36:02,580
Who would make you come with rob banks
just to make sure that x man showed up?

5141
02:36:03,130 --> 02:36:03,963
Yeah.

5142
02:36:04,350 --> 02:36:07,950
If you look at a gorilla and you look
at a person and you look at an alien,

5143
02:36:08,190 --> 02:36:10,820
we're closer to the alien yard from,

5144
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,850
from man.

5145
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:16,850
We aren't we closer to the look of an
a gray alien than we are to a gorilla.

5146
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:18,430
Pretty seamless.

5147
02:36:18,430 --> 02:36:22,380
Others that shaved or that
hairless hairless chimp
that looked quite a bit like

5148
02:36:22,381 --> 02:36:22,900
a person.

5149
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:23,370
Yeah.

5150
02:36:23,370 --> 02:36:24,203
Yeah.

5151
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:25,021
That thing would work.

5152
02:36:25,021 --> 02:36:25,790
Brock Lesnar

5153
02:36:25,790 --> 02:36:28,360
[inaudible] if you took
away the sword Tattoo.

5154
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:30,060
Yeah.

5155
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:30,381
Those.

5156
02:36:30,381 --> 02:36:30,900
Look,

5157
02:36:30,900 --> 02:36:31,600
why didn't,

5158
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,250
I would love to see
that chimp with tattoos.

5159
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:34,540
Even just like fake tattoos.

5160
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:34,781
Yeah,

5161
02:36:34,781 --> 02:36:35,980
tribal dollies.

5162
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:37,960
Barbed wire and shit.

5163
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:40,570
How scary would it be if you had
a Mike Tyson Tattoo on his face

5164
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:42,640
shape?

5165
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,230
What those Mike Tyson tribals.

5166
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:45,300
That'd be terrible.

5167
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:45,530
Oh,

5168
02:36:45,530 --> 02:36:46,750
I'm scare the fuck out of it.

5169
02:36:46,751 --> 02:36:48,850
Wasn't there a story about Mike
Tyson went and fight attempt?

5170
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:52,040
I'm sure he probably back in early,

5171
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:52,050
early years,

5172
02:36:52,050 --> 02:36:55,390
he was like offering like 10,000 the
only way it would work as if they,

5173
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:59,020
they closed the mouth of the champ and
they didn't teach them how to fight.

5174
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:00,013
Fuck that.

5175
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:01,180
All you'd have to do is the chimp.

5176
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:02,710
All we'd have to do is
get ahold of you though.

5177
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:04,720
The thing is get ahold of me.

5178
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:05,471
Anybody?

5179
02:37:05,471 --> 02:37:06,304
I don't know about Mike,

5180
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:07,600
I don't know Tyson,

5181
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:10,480
but can they take a punch like
I know they can take some abuse,

5182
02:37:10,481 --> 02:37:11,140
but has it,

5183
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:11,800
has any,

5184
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:16,130
has any chimp just like really fucking
right hooked and other champion

5185
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:16,860
that job,

5186
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:19,190
do they have that button
that just puts them out?

5187
02:37:19,410 --> 02:37:20,121
What's a good question.

5188
02:37:20,121 --> 02:37:20,901
And also the,

5189
02:37:20,901 --> 02:37:21,261
the,

5190
02:37:21,261 --> 02:37:23,740
the size of their head and
bone structure and everything,

5191
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:25,580
that kind of damage that Tyson can do,

5192
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:27,590
like as they're closing
the distance on you.

5193
02:37:27,591 --> 02:37:31,970
If Tyson on corks with like a right
left combination palm home straight,

5194
02:37:31,971 --> 02:37:32,660
right ham,

5195
02:37:32,660 --> 02:37:34,040
power left hook behind it,

5196
02:37:34,041 --> 02:37:34,970
boom.

5197
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:36,380
Right to the chimps dome.

5198
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:37,490
Can a chimp take it?

5199
02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:39,560
I wonder if there's a little really good.

5200
02:37:40,510 --> 02:37:41,570
That is why we need science.

5201
02:37:41,610 --> 02:37:42,080
Yeah.

5202
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:43,220
Needing it to answer that.

5203
02:37:43,221 --> 02:37:46,970
Quite take a chimp and lets
them do tee off on a chimp.

5204
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:50,330
Just say let Leo a chimp.

5205
02:37:50,570 --> 02:37:51,390
Well that's the only way to do,

5206
02:37:51,390 --> 02:37:52,850
unless you want to sacrifice the man.

5207
02:37:53,090 --> 02:37:56,430
I don't think anybody's gonna allow
you to let a champ lose to fuck.

5208
02:37:56,431 --> 02:37:57,560
Cause the first thing that
chimps going to do is,

5209
02:37:57,561 --> 02:37:59,870
but I don't think anybody's gonna
allow you to tie up at champion,

5210
02:37:59,871 --> 02:38:01,190
punch it in the fucking face.

5211
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:02,510
I would think that would happen.

5212
02:38:04,130 --> 02:38:08,570
It would be more likely to happen than
to have a cage fight with a chimp or a

5213
02:38:08,571 --> 02:38:12,560
boxing match with a chimp
Southeast Asian country.

5214
02:38:13,130 --> 02:38:14,090
It probably already did it.

5215
02:38:14,190 --> 02:38:14,420
Well,

5216
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:16,430
I think they did that with
the rang of tanks in boxing.

5217
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:18,020
But they don't really rip things right?

5218
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:18,381
No.

5219
02:38:18,381 --> 02:38:20,880
When they give him gloves and then
about monkeys are kind of person.

5220
02:38:20,890 --> 02:38:21,170
He's like,

5221
02:38:21,170 --> 02:38:21,471
yeah,

5222
02:38:21,471 --> 02:38:22,970
they're not biters like humans.

5223
02:38:23,050 --> 02:38:23,390
I was like,

5224
02:38:23,390 --> 02:38:23,570
God,

5225
02:38:23,570 --> 02:38:25,280
chimpanzees or humans for that matter,

5226
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:26,900
chimpanzees are rude.

5227
02:38:27,650 --> 02:38:28,880
They just go right for your tech.

5228
02:38:28,881 --> 02:38:29,714
Rip that off.

5229
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,680
Rip Your feet off,

5230
02:38:30,770 --> 02:38:31,730
bite your fingers off.

5231
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:32,960
Novas are so nice.

5232
02:38:32,961 --> 02:38:35,210
And we're as related to
each of them equally.

5233
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:38,510
But nobos the,

5234
02:38:38,511 --> 02:38:41,870
they can't even have Benobos in a
fucking zoo cause it just start with the

5235
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:45,410
hanging can't have them cause
they just start fucking,

5236
02:38:45,411 --> 02:38:47,750
they fuck everywhere and jerk
off in front of everybody.

5237
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,130
I do think it's a good reminder though,

5238
02:38:49,131 --> 02:38:51,410
like when people bring up how
violent chimps are and they're like,

5239
02:38:51,411 --> 02:38:51,621
you know,

5240
02:38:51,621 --> 02:38:53,150
there our closest cousin like,

5241
02:38:53,151 --> 02:38:54,050
so where'd that violent?

5242
02:38:55,010 --> 02:38:55,970
We're also close to the,

5243
02:38:56,210 --> 02:38:57,710
to the do nothing but fuck all day.

5244
02:38:57,950 --> 02:38:58,520
Yeah.

5245
02:38:58,520 --> 02:38:59,390
What happened?

5246
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:00,820
How'd that it's like,

5247
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:03,290
it's almost like they're their bolt.

5248
02:39:03,291 --> 02:39:08,291
They both represent the closest living
primate to us and yet they both represent

5249
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:14,300
the total opposites of the spectrums
of human behavior and almost that

5250
02:39:14,301 --> 02:39:15,350
particular circumstance.

5251
02:39:15,351 --> 02:39:15,831
I'm sure they have,

5252
02:39:15,831 --> 02:39:16,041
you know,

5253
02:39:16,041 --> 02:39:20,930
similar social structure
fight and Alpha males do.

5254
02:39:20,931 --> 02:39:21,231
Right.

5255
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:23,000
Elphaba aren't they matriarchal though?

5256
02:39:23,290 --> 02:39:23,450
No.

5257
02:39:23,450 --> 02:39:23,840
Goes.

5258
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:24,201
Yeah.

5259
02:39:24,201 --> 02:39:24,951
I think the uh,

5260
02:39:24,951 --> 02:39:27,200
the females are a charge.

5261
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:28,520
That might be the issue too.

5262
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:29,420
That comes up a lot.

5263
02:39:29,420 --> 02:39:30,253
Yeah,

5264
02:39:30,290 --> 02:39:31,850
I think that would definitely help.

5265
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:32,091
I mean,

5266
02:39:32,091 --> 02:39:34,340
surprise the ones that
give birth run show,

5267
02:39:34,820 --> 02:39:38,090
well the only other matriarchal society
that I know of in the animal kingdom is

5268
02:39:38,091 --> 02:39:38,924
hyenas.

5269
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:39,861
Lions too,

5270
02:39:39,861 --> 02:39:40,694
right?

5271
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:41,330
No,

5272
02:39:41,330 --> 02:39:41,631
no,

5273
02:39:41,631 --> 02:39:41,781
no,

5274
02:39:41,781 --> 02:39:41,960
no,

5275
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:42,051
no.

5276
02:39:42,051 --> 02:39:43,070
I thought the mail was a bitch.

5277
02:39:43,730 --> 02:39:44,211
He likes,

5278
02:39:44,211 --> 02:39:45,270
stayed home and took care of the guilty,

5279
02:39:45,271 --> 02:39:46,280
takes care of everything.

5280
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:47,390
The males are enormous,

5281
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:48,253
but it doesn't kill,

5282
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:49,430
well he does occasionally,

5283
02:39:49,431 --> 02:39:52,370
but mostly kills like predators
and hyenas and shit like that.

5284
02:39:52,670 --> 02:39:53,271
But the males,

5285
02:39:53,271 --> 02:39:55,310
the king of the jungle and
he's the biggest motherfucker.

5286
02:39:55,370 --> 02:39:56,120
He's the baddest,

5287
02:39:56,120 --> 02:40:00,050
he protects the other lions
from encroaching mails and
things along those lines.

5288
02:40:00,410 --> 02:40:05,150
But Hyenas are actually matriarchal in
that the female is larger than the male.

5289
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:07,730
And actually has a foe penis.

5290
02:40:08,510 --> 02:40:09,690
She dominates the mail.

5291
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:13,100
She gets on top of them and
fucks him with her fake.

5292
02:40:13,310 --> 02:40:14,140
She pegged him.

5293
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:14,381
Yeah.

5294
02:40:14,381 --> 02:40:15,370
It's huge.

5295
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:16,283
If you're seeing it,

5296
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:17,291
hold on,

5297
02:40:17,291 --> 02:40:19,810
I haven't seen puts your boner female.

5298
02:40:19,811 --> 02:40:20,021
Yeah,

5299
02:40:20,021 --> 02:40:21,160
it's like a pussy boner.

5300
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:22,340
But it's bigger than a real

5301
02:40:22,410 --> 02:40:22,711
Boehner.

5302
02:40:22,711 --> 02:40:22,861
I mean,

5303
02:40:22,861 --> 02:40:23,551
it's enormous.

5304
02:40:23,551 --> 02:40:25,770
It's like an arm may female,

5305
02:40:25,771 --> 02:40:26,604
Hyena,

5306
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:27,990
penis,

5307
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:28,823
hyenas.

5308
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:30,173
Huge.

5309
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:30,820
It's shoe.

5310
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:32,310
It's bigger than the males like this.

5311
02:40:32,340 --> 02:40:32,610
Yeah.

5312
02:40:32,610 --> 02:40:32,821
Yeah.

5313
02:40:32,821 --> 02:40:33,654
It's a bigger than the males.

5314
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:34,320
Awesome.

5315
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:34,440
What?

5316
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:35,273
She's bigger.

5317
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:38,080
And the reason why is because
the life of a heinous,

5318
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:38,911
so ruthless,

5319
02:40:38,911 --> 02:40:41,850
the female has to be large to keep
the males from eating the babies.

5320
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:46,320
So the females have to run things cause
the hyenas just live in the most nasty

5321
02:40:46,321 --> 02:40:47,400
world possible.

5322
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:52,730
Everything is just stealing meat and
biting things and then snapping bones,

5323
02:40:53,191 --> 02:40:55,650
running away with chunks of carpets,

5324
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:59,010
your predators and even killing them.

5325
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:02,300
Have you ever seen that video
where a bunch of Hyenas Corner,

5326
02:41:02,330 --> 02:41:02,880
uh,

5327
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:03,960
hurt female lion?

5328
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:05,520
It's fucked up.

5329
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:06,001
There's a,

5330
02:41:06,001 --> 02:41:11,001
there's a cool documentary on hyenas and
lions and it was all about how there's

5331
02:41:11,970 --> 02:41:15,030
a constant struggle between the
hyenas and lions and hyenas.

5332
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:15,391
Well,

5333
02:41:15,391 --> 02:41:16,490
like circle eight.

5334
02:41:16,491 --> 02:41:17,280
Look at that.

5335
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:18,390
Look at that fake penis.

5336
02:41:19,710 --> 02:41:20,543
Look at that thing.

5337
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:25,140
That's a fake female
penis and it's enormous

5338
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:27,880
little turd shooting in Andover.

5339
02:41:27,970 --> 02:41:28,830
See what it gets hard.

5340
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:30,030
That debit is just walking.

5341
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:31,470
I guess it doesn't come
out of Harvard Tiger,

5342
02:41:31,471 --> 02:41:31,631
right?

5343
02:41:31,631 --> 02:41:32,610
It's just like dangling off.

5344
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:34,350
It's just like a horn.

5345
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:37,800
It's not like [inaudible]
or something like a what?

5346
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:42,920
Cloe Aka the holes that birds have and
I think some fishing and never heard of

5347
02:41:43,771 --> 02:41:43,920
that.

5348
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,260
It's like they have internal genitalia.

5349
02:41:46,470 --> 02:41:46,771
Oh,

5350
02:41:46,771 --> 02:41:47,430
I see what you're saying.

5351
02:41:47,430 --> 02:41:50,850
And that's the little hole like crocodiles
that when they sex the crocodile,

5352
02:41:50,851 --> 02:41:52,770
they have to stick their
finger in their cloaca.

5353
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:54,960
I don't know if they call
it a Clo Waco with it.

5354
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:56,550
That's how they milk them.

5355
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:56,700
Well,

5356
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:59,320
that's how they figure out if there's
like what's in those sex sexual

5357
02:41:59,510 --> 02:42:00,343
orientation.

5358
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:01,230
Yeah.

5359
02:42:01,230 --> 02:42:02,280
That's fascinating man.

5360
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:04,190
It's a god.

5361
02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:05,530
What's my,

5362
02:42:05,530 --> 02:42:07,680
to just look up her up looking at China.

5363
02:42:07,860 --> 02:42:08,750
China's female.

5364
02:42:09,490 --> 02:42:09,840
Oh,

5365
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:10,673
same as down.

5366
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:11,513
Don't put that.

5367
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:12,590
Is that bigger than that?

5368
02:42:12,591 --> 02:42:12,980
He knows.

5369
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:14,110
It's about the same behind.

5370
02:42:14,670 --> 02:42:15,420
It's aggressive.

5371
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:16,590
I think that's a good way to end the show.

5372
02:42:16,591 --> 02:42:17,820
It's like a hitchhiker stumps.

5373
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:18,541
Then they show it.

5374
02:42:18,541 --> 02:42:22,020
China's giant Dick Jay Dee.

5375
02:42:22,021 --> 02:42:22,591
Thanks for doing this,

5376
02:42:22,591 --> 02:42:22,950
man.

5377
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:23,461
Absolutely.

5378
02:42:23,461 --> 02:42:24,480
This would wonderful time.

5379
02:42:24,510 --> 02:42:25,343
Yeah,

5380
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:28,680
we confused and put bored the shit
out of people for a little bit.

5381
02:42:28,681 --> 02:42:29,010
Cool.

5382
02:42:29,010 --> 02:42:30,510
I hope most of them enjoyed it.

5383
02:42:30,511 --> 02:42:34,140
It's possible to that all that that
when you get into that kind of stuff,

5384
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:34,800
it's been,

5385
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:36,140
you've been talking about dark matter.

5386
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:37,490
Ooh,

5387
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:38,011
come back.

5388
02:42:38,011 --> 02:42:38,830
We'll do it again man.

5389
02:42:38,830 --> 02:42:39,360
Sounds great.

5390
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:39,541
Yeah,

5391
02:42:39,541 --> 02:42:40,290
for sure.

5392
02:42:40,290 --> 02:42:40,920
All right brother.

5393
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:44,190
We'll see you a in cyberspace
and in real life on occasion.

5394
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:44,410
Yeah.

5395
02:42:44,410 --> 02:42:46,560
Tell your Mama I said hi to
absolutely got a cool month.

5396
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:48,583
That was a little weird.

5397
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:50,400
Tell your Mama I said Hi.

5398
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:54,240
You still have a short,

5399
02:42:54,241 --> 02:42:55,170
how dare you,

5400
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:57,690
son of a bitch.

Listen to this podcast and has
no relation whatsoever to works.

5402
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:04,680
Mom,

5403
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:06,600
there's none of this was real.

5404
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:08,160
We're just joking around.

5405
02:43:08,430 --> 02:43:09,450
If you listen to this,

5406
02:43:09,930 --> 02:43:10,111
uh,

5407
02:43:10,111 --> 02:43:12,160
this podcast is to you by hover.

5408
02:43:12,470 --> 02:43:12,940
Uh,

5409
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:14,320
if you go to,

5410
02:43:14,321 --> 02:43:14,681
hold on,

5411
02:43:14,681 --> 02:43:15,514
let me pull that up.

5412
02:43:16,110 --> 02:43:18,250
I'm terrible at
remembering all this stuff.

5413
02:43:18,730 --> 02:43:19,560
Uh,

5414
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:19,741
her,

5415
02:43:19,741 --> 02:43:19,961
her,

5416
02:43:19,961 --> 02:43:20,161
her,

5417
02:43:20,161 --> 02:43:20,391
her,

5418
02:43:20,391 --> 02:43:21,224
her,

5419
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:23,230
oh,

5420
02:43:23,230 --> 02:43:23,501
oh yeah.

5421
02:43:23,501 --> 02:43:24,041
Let's ask.

5422
02:43:24,041 --> 02:43:24,521
Throw it out there.

5423
02:43:24,521 --> 02:43:25,970
I saw that you were
putting that on anything.

5424
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,450
I have someone who wants
to murder Bryan's truck.

5425
02:43:29,050 --> 02:43:31,270
I have a bright orange Ford
edge and it's just like,

5426
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:31,721
you know,

5427
02:43:31,721 --> 02:43:33,030
I know in the car now it's,

5428
02:43:33,090 --> 02:43:35,410
I might as well do
something with the color.

5429
02:43:35,411 --> 02:43:38,110
And then somebody told me that you can
just put a wrap on your car and then when

5430
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:38,681
you sell it,

5431
02:43:38,681 --> 02:43:38,991
if you,

5432
02:43:38,991 --> 02:43:40,120
you could just peel it off.

5433
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:42,880
It's called murdering it.

5434
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:45,310
You put a matte black color,

5435
02:43:45,490 --> 02:43:46,323
all that car,

5436
02:43:46,610 --> 02:43:47,443
all you're murdering,

5437
02:43:47,540 --> 02:43:49,120
if anyone knows how to do it or

5438
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:49,471
oh,

5439
02:43:49,471 --> 02:43:50,450
for sure there's a lot of play,

5440
02:43:50,451 --> 02:43:52,960
but it's how the red band Ari Dba on,

5441

5442

02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:29,990
the,

5465
02:44:29,990 --> 02:44:31,140
the primal chimp,

5466
02:44:31,260 --> 02:44:32,080
a kettle,

5467
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:34,710
kettle bells come out tomorrow.

5468
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:35,940
Supposed to talk about them on it.

5469
02:44:35,970 --> 02:44:36,720
We can talk about it.

5470
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:37,770
We launched them tomorrow.

5471
02:44:37,950 --> 02:44:41,220
There's only a thousand stock now though
with a thousand more are arriving in

5472
02:44:41,221 --> 02:44:43,210
two weeks and 5,000 in two months.

5473
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:45,090
Very difficult to fucking
make these things.

5474
02:44:45,450 --> 02:44:48,900
But we have a kettle bells that
look like furious chimp heads.

5475
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:49,970
They're,

5476
02:44:49,970 --> 02:44:50,840
they're dope.

02:44:50,990 --> 02:44:51,823
You got to love them.

5478
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:53,160
Why you're not gonna use it.

5479
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:53,341
No,

5480
02:44:53,341 --> 02:44:54,121
I will.

5481
02:44:54,121 --> 02:44:55,290
I just want to in my living room.

5482
02:44:55,291 --> 02:44:57,240
I think that's a good thing to
just to put on the bookshelf.

5483
02:44:57,241 --> 02:44:58,120
That's good.

5484
02:44:58,130 --> 02:44:58,930
Seriously.

5485
02:44:58,930 --> 02:44:59,560
It is good for

5486
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:00,430
blocking books.

5487
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:01,000
Yeah.

5488
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,040
And scaring neighbors.

5489
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:02,621
All right,

5490
02:45:02,621 --> 02:45:03,430

5491
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:04,330

Ben Hoffman from the new comedy central
show that I don't know the title

5493
02:45:08,250 --> 02:45:08,550
I heard.

5494
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:11,490
He doesn't like weed or mushrooms
and what's he's against it.

5495
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:12,221
He's again,

5496
02:45:12,221 --> 02:45:13,320
somebody tweeted that to me today.

5497
02:45:13,940 --> 02:45:14,940
I mean against it.

5498
02:45:14,941 --> 02:45:15,330
I don't know.

5499
02:45:15,330 --> 02:45:16,850
Is he going to try to
stop you from doing it?

5500
02:45:16,851 --> 02:45:17,580
I don't know.

5501
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:19,860
He's allowed to have my own
tastes and point of view.

5502
02:45:19,861 --> 02:45:20,694
Brian.

5503
02:45:20,750 --> 02:45:21,240
Hey,

5504

02:45:32,671 --> 02:45:33,504
Can't figure that out.

5509
02:45:33,750 --> 02:45:34,490
That's fine.

5510
02:45:34,490 --> 02:45:34,920
Yeah,

5511
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:35,751

5512
02:45:35,751 --> 02:45:36,584
It's on my Twitter.

something that you're listening to many,

5515
02:45:48,201 --> 02:45:50,420
many years in the future
when Twitter was just a joke,

5516
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:51,800
ha ha,

5517
02:45:51,830 --> 02:45:52,880

5518
02:45:53,330 --> 02:45:55,760
Well fuck you smarty
pants from the future.

5519
02:45:56,300 --> 02:45:57,530
I don't need your bull shit.

5520

02:45:59,181 --> 02:45:59,930

5522
02:45:59,930 --> 02:46:00,381
Okay.

5523
02:46:00,381 --> 02:46:04,550
I'm stuck here at 2013
trying to make do with this.

5524
02:46:05,020 --> 02:46:05,271
All right,

5525
02:46:05,271 --> 02:46:06,104
let's fucking show's over.

5526
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:07,193
I'm talking nonsense.

5527
02:46:07,390 --> 02:46:08,151
