1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,080
Then there's Amish porn.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,340
Yeah.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,510
I don't think they're really Amish.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,400
I don't think you're allowed
to fuck in front of a camera.

6
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:08,880
If you're Amish.

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,990
I think it steals your soul.

8
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,040
Or is that Indians?

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,031
How's that work?

10
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,361
Asian.

11
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:12,990
I thought,

12
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,261
no,

13
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,441
no,

14
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:13,591
no,

15
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:13,810
no.

16
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,191
The Asian.

17
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,450
You're not allowed to see the vagina.

18
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,061
You know the law.

19
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,090
See pubic hair or the genitals,

20
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,330
they,

21
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,530
they blur all that out.

22
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,221
You can have,

23
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,054
would you,

24
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,380
why would you want to see generic?

25
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,540
Doesn't look weird or it does look weird.

26
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,850
Are you being racist or
you're talking about energy?

27
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:27,900
I go to Panda Express.

28
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,230
God,

29
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,870
he's had some pics pixelation
in his mouth from a man.

30
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,910
I have not and that's,

31
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,670
that's nice.

32
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,930
Why would you even say that?

33
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,540
If you don't take that back,

34
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,430
that's going to get out there.

35
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,830
I had that has never ever happened
and I never ever wanted to do that.

36
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,340
So out there,

37
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,830
thanks to percent,

38
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,733
you just put it out there.

39
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,180
What does this 10% you keep saying,

40
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,520
why do you keep saying 10% well,

41
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,050
why is Brian keeps saying 10% it's
a running joke based in truth.

42
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,100
I had some issues.

43
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:04,101
I had some situations in my life and I
like to put numbers on things and based

44
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:08,760
on these factors and experiences
and thought processes,

45
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,960
we came to the number of a

46
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,990
10% uh,

47
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,521
gay.

48
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm open with it.

49
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,403
You know it.

50
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,890
It's not just say it's not.

51
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,300
I understand what you just said.

52
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,660
What you just said was a statement that
would really work if everybody knew what

53
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,494
you were saying,

54
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,550
but I don't know what you're saying.

55
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,440
So we were saying is a 10% gay?

56
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,071
I'm open with it.

57
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:29,904
What does that mean?

58
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,560
Does that mean you're 10% gay?

59
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,753
Yes.

60
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,990
I came out on my podcast
probably like six months ago.

61
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,940
You came out 10% yes.

62
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,853
What's so funny?

63
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,581
Is there any beers in there?

64
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,230
Jamie,

65
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,063
you'll get me a beer.

66
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,180
You need a beer on this one?

67
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:51,271
Yeah.

68
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,240
This is going to get ridiculous.

69
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,680
No,

70
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,050
we don't have to talk in that
and that ashtray over this way.

71
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,410
An ashtray who needs
a beer and an ashtray.

72
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,420
I need a cigar cigar.

73
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,800
Uh,

74
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,590
and it's also based on when you
were in the Philippines or a Taiwan,

75
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,453
wasn't it

76
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,050
that you the,

77
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,421
yeah,

78
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,830
that that factored into,

79
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,330
did you know that Joe?

80
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,410
Did you know any of this part?

81
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,293
This story?

82
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,990
I heard rumors online,

83
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:20,760
but since I love Brody like a brother,

84
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,960
since we were brothers in the art of
standup comic comedy since we were old

85
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,390
school comedy store brethren,

86
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,620
it's having fun,

87
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,360
having fun matters.

88
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,050
It does.

89
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,870
And that's why you should tell us
about what happened in Thailand.

90
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,970
What wasn't fun.

91
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,370
It was you enjoyed it.

92
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,270
No.

93
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,930
To completion.

94
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,763
Everybody.

95
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,510
People hung out.

96
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,740
You know,

97
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,573
it's,

98
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,820
that's the cops come fuck a
building's on fire bodies everywhere.

99
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,693
What happened?

100
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,690
People hung out.

101
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,351
Look,

102
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:52,900
without getting,

103
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,733
hey,

104
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,211
without,

105
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,500
without giving too much away.

106
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,480
We do explain it in my show.

107
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,703
Um,

108
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,123
when you go to bed,

109
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
can I leave us hanging?

110
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:01,801
You know,

111
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:02,311
I'll tell you,

112
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,440
but I don't want to give it away
because if people see you on the show,

113
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:05,550
you've got a big audience.

114
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,290
They'll see it on the show is again,

115
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,750
while enjoying even the boy.

116
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,210
Okay.

117
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,631
Trust me,

118
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:12,780
this is a puzzling case cause people are
gonna want to examine this from every

119
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,140
angle.

120
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,070
They're gonna want to find out.

121
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,001
I guarantee you the,

122
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:17,170
the amount of people that
download that icehouse chronicles,

123
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,940
we brought this up,

124
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,691
they're going to go through the roof.

125
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:19,524
What number of Brown?

126
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,473
Uh,

127
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,410
40 to figure it out.

128
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,520
Google it.

129
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,821
Okay.

130
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:24,420
All I'm saying,

131
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,890
and as I went to Bangkok,

132
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,420
we had fun.

133
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,100
You go to an area where they,

134
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:30,840
all these different bars and they have,

135
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
they have the get togethers,

136
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,670
the ping pong balls,

137
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,001
the,

138
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:36,834
uh,

139
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,430
the,

140
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,730
the young Vietnamese girls who
will sit next to you for Coca Cola,

141
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,080
that kind of thing.

142
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:44,660
May you watch them dance.

143
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:45,720
So dance for you.

144
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:46,860
They'll sit by your side.

145
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:47,970
They smell good.

146
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,430
Sometimes her top less.

147
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,320
If you really want to be with them,

148
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,210
you can spend the money.

149
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:56,820
And it's actually not that much.

150
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,450
Okay.

151
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,320
I want to say that.

152
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,290
So they have a few areas like that.

153
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,640
A lot of the westerners
hang out and go there.

154
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,241
It's fun,

155
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:03,991
it's different.

156
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:04,650
It's simple,

157
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,310
simple.

158
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
It's simple.

159
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,860
And then you go upstairs and
then it's a little different.

160
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,030
You're getting a little like,

161
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,850
well that looks a little different
in there that the bone structure's

162
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,431
interesting.

163
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,950
But I see some other people dancing.

164
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,460
And then there's this one club
that you go in and it's like,

165
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,900
I guess the best one up there.

166
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,680
And it's just,

167
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,790
they're having a party.

168
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,810
It's fun.

169
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,320
The girls look like girls.

170
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,560
But you can tell like
maybe some are guys I gas,

171
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,970
but it was one of these lady boy bars
and were hanging out there having fun and

172
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:39,811
they'll,

173
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:40,111
you know,

174
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:40,680
they,

175
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,121
they,

176
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,330
they will touch you.

177
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,620
They're very forward.

178
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,300
They will touch your leg.

179
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,830
But they looked like girls.

180
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,180
They smell like girls.

181
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,100
They look like girls.

182
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,250
Dave had the treatments and you're sitting
there and you're alone by yourself.

183
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:56,791
You're in,

184
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,110
you're in Bangkok,

185
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,060
you're working on hangover too.

186
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,070
They,

187
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,270
um,

188
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,140
touch and it,

189
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,551
I,

190
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:06,450
it's normal.

191
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:07,620
They get aroused.

192
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,130
And it was interesting.

193
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:16,131
And I knew I was 16 hours away time zone
from America and I know Comedians have

194
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,960
gone down to Brazil or Thailand.

195
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:20,160
There's a whole history of it,

196
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,700
so I didn't really pursue it there,

197
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,670
but I thought about it and then
maybe I came back on another night.

198
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:27,031
I go,

199
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:27,241
you know,

200
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:28,420
people thought I was waiting.

201
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,020
You said maybe no,

202
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,560
you came back right while I was
there for like two weeks in Thailand.

203
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,130
Can you saying maybe I came back my
maybe you're making the story confusing.

204
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,491
Okay,

205
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,470
well I want one.

206
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,830
All right.

207
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,690
I came back another night.

208
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,570
I said maybe I will come back this solid.

209
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,790
You said it's a reason why I stopped too,

210
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,410
so I want this to be for,

211
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:53,411
I mean at that point I'd probably
3% gay and that's based off I

212
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,600
getting picked on as a kid like Brody,

213
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,770
you walk a girl,

214
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,500
you understand

215
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,410
Joe Rolling up in Tarzana.

216
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,990
I got picked on a lot.

217
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,530
You saying that someone can
make you homosexual by if
they picked on you enough.

218
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,880
3% would be a hundred no,

219
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,260
3% wouldn't make it a 100
but if somebody as a child,

220
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,930
you're in third grade and
there's a group of girls,

221
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:15,621
or even guys,

222
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,040
you go,

223
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,251
oh,

224
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:16,761
look at Brodie.

225
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:16,911
Oh,

226
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
he walks,

227
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,920
he looks like he's gay.

228
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,780
You walk like a gay gay kid.

229
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,830
You're always smiling.

230
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:22,241
And it was like,

231
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,360
it was a nice kid.

232
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,480
And then I guess because
of a tilted pelvis,

233
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,270
I walked weird and he
got picked on for that.

234
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,410
So I always felt like,

235
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,071
wow,

236
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,020
I guess I think I,

237
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,841
I'm gay.

238
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,800
Maybe.

239
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,580
Um,

240
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,391
get some gay,

241
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,050
I don't know.

242
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,441
Wow.

243
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:36,981
Wait a minute.

244
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,350
So there is this like the secret is this,

245
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:42,380
the power of suggestion is
that one of those things I,

246
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,060
it's a power of being bullied.

247
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,640
So being bullied can turn you homosexual.

248
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,120
It didn't wait 3% 3% yes.

249
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,790
If they're saying it,

250
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,500
if enough people are saying,

251
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,520
Brody,

252
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,530
you Wa if I saw myself walk,

253
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,720
if I sat and I saw myself walk,

254
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:03,140
I would think skywalks a little gay.

255
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,561
Well,

256
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:04,394
if he,

257
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,930
if you think that,

258
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,330
why wouldn't you change your walk?

259
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,111
I tried.

260
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:12,571
Why not?

261
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:15,020
How I tried to get like in my shoe,

262
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,900
which side is tilted?

263
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,861
What's one's down?

264
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,221
Which ones?

265
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,630
I think my right shoulder.

266
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,100
You think I'll show it to you?

267
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you know for sure?

268
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,100
Is this just go to a Voodoo doctor?

269
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,791
It's not a food.

270
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,890
It's like they're almost
being a chiropractor.

271
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,920
The chiropractor.

272
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,230
This is like a physical thing.

273
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,260
Chiropractors are a lot
like Voodoo doctors.

274
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,400
This is a lot of chiropractors that
just fucking move your neck around,

275
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,263
take your money.

276
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,060
Not a lot going on.

277
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,510
I've been there,

278
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,600
good chiropractors and I've been the
chiropractice when you're like what?

279
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,650
What just happened?

280
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,920
Did I just give that guy $60
to rub my neck for 15 seconds?

281
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,150
Cause that's what it feels like.

282
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:47,391
Oh,

283
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm going adjust your agree,

284
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,050
your anterior posture,

285
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,560
your [inaudible] throw some terms at
you that are like completely unnecessary

286
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,060
and very verbose and long.

287
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,030
And then the cracking that grow couldn't
crack crack and it kinda feels good.

288
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,451
I love,

289
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,470
and they correct the neck.

290
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:00,741
Yeah.

291
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,150
It kind of feels good
when they crack your neck.

292
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,133
But uh,

293
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm not sure if it works.

294
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,970
I'm not relieves like
it's like a relief as it,

295
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,190
I do that.

296
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,160
But sometimes it does.

297
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,450
Some guys would do good at it,

298
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,220
but sometimes it's like,

299
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,570
what?

300
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,390
What just happened there?

301
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,490
I'd like to get a chiropractic massage.

302
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,320
That'd be good.

303
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,831
From the dude.

304
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,730
Take care of myself.

305
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,560
I don't care if it's a guy miss miss.

306
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:21,920
Ah,

307
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,460
I don't care.

308
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,030
Like take them.

309
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,220
I don't care if it's a guy chiropractor.

310
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,173
Okay,

311
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,920
I'll take a female Mizuho's
you don't like I'm a sutures.

312
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,150
I would take it like massage,

313
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,520
but not like it for a baseball team.

314
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:34,641
Like,

315
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:34,971
hey bro,

316
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,470
you were hanging out with
the baseball players.

317
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,240
Uh,

318
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,430
do your hmis or here's a,

319
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,050
I'm a sue.

320
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,511
So yeah,

321
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:40,730
if you get a massage from a dude,

322
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,080
you want the lights to be on.

323
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,320
Do you want like fucking Motley
Crue playing in the back?

324
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,470
It's got to be in the mall.

325
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,530
You don't want any scented
candles are fucking,

326
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,050
you know,

327
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,940
great music.

328
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,140
Thanks.

329
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,710
So anyway,

330
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,830
you go back to this place and you're
pretty much aware that you're hanging out

331
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,560
with lady

332
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,640
at this boy.

333
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,510
Let me tell you the 5% gay,

334
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:03,140
and that's due to due to things
in college due to two comments,

335
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:07,520
mostly to calm down from three to
five like immediately the smell.

336
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,950
Do you want to give me a real number
so we could fucking move on with

337
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:10,784
confidence?

338
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,810
Joe,

339
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,530
I'm feeling factory and I'm
factoring in the bullying ness.

340
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm factoring some baseball.

341
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,780
I bullying you because I don't
want to be a part of the year.

342
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,880
You're not pulling,

343
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,140
right.

344
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,841
You know I love you,

345
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:21,270
right?

346
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,800
Okay.

347
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,670
I went there,

348
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,810
let's say 6% gay six Jesus Christ.

349
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,890
By the end of this story,

350
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,490
we're going to be at
86% I went to Bangkok,

351
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,020
6% gay and I go,

352
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:34,591
you know what?

353
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm in Bangkok.

354
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Let me push it to the limit and
see what happens and if I like it,

355
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,090
I'm into it or if it humiliates me.

356
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,610
No one's around.

357
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,440
This is my big opportunity

358
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,780
and I really didn't do that
much and I had the chance.

359
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,700
So they didn't do that much.

360
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,070
You said you got to Bangkok,

361
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,540
you were 66% 6% 6% when
you got to Bangkok.

362
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,520
But then when you went to the place,

363
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,470
you knew they were lady
boys and you went back.

364
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,010
When you say you would have to say you
went a little gayer than you were when

365
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:11,630
you got there.

366
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,350
We'll go,

367
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:12,650
well,

368
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,240
it was more out of experience.

369
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,370
I like to check this experience out.

370
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,660
Check me out,

371
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,650
take the temperature.

372
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,010
But it was a good experience.

373
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,163
It was,

374
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:22,581
I mean,

375
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,440
what do you define as a gay experience?

376
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,970
There's a guy in you.

377
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,381
All right,

378
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,214
hold on.

379
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,410
Is a transsexual a guy?

380
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,350
Um,

381
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,450
it's way closer to a guy than me.

382
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,213
Okay.

383
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,610
Have guys been fooled?

384
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,090
Does he make any sense?

385
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,400
Have you guys for you
to listen to be bold?

386
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,870
You don't even listen to people.

387
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,290
I said,

388
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,940
I made and made an error.

389
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,570
I said,

390
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,890
is it a transsexual guy?

391
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,041
No,

392
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,860
it's not as close to a guy's me.

393
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,733
Correct.

394
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,930
It's more a woman eliminate as a man.

395
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,030
It looked and felt like a woman.

396
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,690
Here's the reality of transsexuals
did just the cold hard reality.

397
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
It's just chromosomal.

398
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,143
That's it.

399
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,330
And as far as like behavior and
appearance and maybe even like,

400
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,200
like sex,

401
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,020
like you might enjoy
certain aspects of sex,

402
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:18,021
more the transsexual than you would an
angry overweights cigarette smoking woman

403
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,220
who's got a head like a frying pan,

404
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,121
you know,

405
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:21,954
if you found,

406
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,430
what does that transgender woman,

407
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,570
this is the picture that
goes with why it's Brian.

408
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:27,801
Come,

409
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:28,950
c'mon man.

410
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,150
What has the Internet,

411
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,230
you can't do that.

412
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,110
You're going to ruin
everything for every buddy.

413
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,921
Keep going.

414
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:39,921
My point is I would rather have a sexual
experience with a transgender that was

415
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:46,461
really sexy and sweet rather than a big
angry woman that's built like a football

416
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,430
player.

417
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,001
Okay.

418
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:48,834
I'm with you.

419
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,730
If you wanted to have a sexual experience,

420
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,361
if you're a man,

421
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:53,830
most likely you want to have a sexual
experience with something feminine.

422
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,340
Yes.

423
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,190
And the reality of femininity
versus masculinity.

424
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,920
There's a line where shit gets blurry.

425
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,250
Yeah.

426
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,450
And that that rhyme,

427
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,950
that line is big.

428
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,470
Angry Fred Flintstone looking women.

429
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,100
Yes.

430
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,740
Versus like Thai lady.

431
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:09,041
Boy,

432
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,210
that's actually very cute.

433
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,110
Yes.

434
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,230
It's,

435
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,063
where do you go?

436
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,050
You're in top.

437
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,170
You're in fucking off the screen urine.

438
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,230
You're in Thailand,

439
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,660
you're,

440
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,493
you're alone.

441
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,830
Tiny Thailand.

442
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,010
And if you're not a Thailand,

443
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,701
if you're anywhere,

444
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,290
if it's the only three
people on the planet,

445
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,100
it's you,

446
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,990
the the Thai lady boy and the
big Fred Flinstone looking angry.

447
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,381
Okay,

448
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,890
she's on her way now I'm going to meet
with a Fred Flintstone or boogers in your

449
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:33,221
nose.

450
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:33,760
I won't be,

451
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,870
I won't be breath.

452
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,280
I'll let her give me a massage.

453
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,660
Her feet smell,

454
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,500
ugh.

455
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,680
Why is this going to transgender on the
regular girl that there was those two,

456
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,330
you could probably cut out
a nice young ones he thinks.

457
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,770
I think that would be,

458
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,311
you know,

459
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,150
a different thing.

460
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,170
I think also there's the feeling of
exploitation that comes with having a,

461
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,100
uh,

462
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,700
having a sexual experience
with a prostitute that's a
female that you don't get

463
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,290
if it's a prostitute that's a male,

464
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,070
you know,

465
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,590
if you go to a female prostitute,

466
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,650
like there's this thing where,

467
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,030
you know,

468
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,290
if you think about the
concept of prostitution,

469
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,210
you think that women are being exploited.

470
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,270
That's like one of the main
negative aspects of prostitution.

471
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,000
And then also as a father
you start thinking,

472
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,121
well,

473
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,410
why are they prostitutes?

474
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,200
Most likely because they didn't
have a good family structure.

475
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,880
They didn't have a good father figure.

476
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,780
They didn't have a good mother.

477
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,643
Whatever it was,

478
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,610
it's not good.

479
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,500
Most likely there could be some weird
people that just enjoy sacks and don't

480
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,570
mind getting paid for it because
it's better than being a waitress.

481
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
That's possible too.

482
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,150
But when you think about a woman,

483
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,210
most likely you're thinking about someone
being sexually manipulated and some of

484
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:41,211
them being taken advantage
of and objectified and you
think of a bad situation,

485
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,970
but you don't think about that with a guy.

486
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,321
You don't.

487
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:49,150
Especially a guy that used to be a guy
who used to be a guy and then became a

488
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,630
girl like and decided to do
it because he wanted to do it.

489
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,970
Like he made the choice wanting to do it,

490
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,530
felt like that's who he is.

491
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,830
He's better suited to,

492
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,410
made me want it to be.

493
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,710
Or did he like made a choice that you
definitely make the choice to have surgery

494
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,070
and you feel it almost like
you have to get it done?

495
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,180
I can't tell.

496
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,760
I mean there's no way I could
tell you what they feel,

497
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,860
but I would assume that
they're telling the truth.

498
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,300
And when I've talked to,

499
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:18,301
I mean we had bucking Joel on the podcast
who's a transgender woman to man and

500
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,061
you know,

501
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:22,600
he says that he's always known
inside that he should to be a man.

502
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,290
I mean his personality was always,

503
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,000
and that's the only time he was ever
happy was when he was allowed to be a man.

504
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,490
It does.

505
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,800
This person feel real.

506
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,210
Brody went out,

507
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,060
call eight from the path here.

508
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,450
Let's not deviate from the
path here because I think
what we're talking about is

509
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,740
actually a very important subject.

510
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,570
You have to define it very clearly.

511
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:40,790
No,

512
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,861
no,

513
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:41,080
no.

514
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,770
Hold on a second.

515
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,390
You have to define this is the pee.

516
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,171
Go Pee pee.

517
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:44,381
Okay.

518
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:48,100
Can we come right back now we're not
gonna let you back in this door out there

519
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,323
punching a code.

520
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,710
I don't think that any one of us can
tell someone what they feel inside their

521
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:56,211
body.

522
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,940
And I've talked to way too
many people that say that they,

523
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,790
they know that they should have been a
man or they know that they should have

524
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,624
been a woman.

525
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,590
If that's the case,

526
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,240
if they're saying that you,

527
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:05,421
you,

528
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:06,110
you,

529
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,370
you can't argue with that.

530
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,690
The,

531
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,270
the host,

532
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,760
if you look at the
spectrum of human fuckups,

533
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,391
you know,

534
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:16,391
the genetic and Amalities de variations
in color of skin and color of hair and

535
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,970
the size of teeth and all the
different variations of human beings.

536
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,380
Of course,

537
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,200
some people were supposed to
be boys and didn't come out.

538
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,240
Boys absolutely no doubt about it.

539
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,980
And I think one day they're going to
be able to do something where they give

540
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,790
these people some sort of
a genetic manipulation and
they're going to literally

541
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,280
turn them into double x chromosome women.

542
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,120
And I think,

543
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,740
I think that's not the thing,

544
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,430
that's the beginning of like the
ability to manipulate the human genome,

545
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,230
the ability to change a person's DNA,

546
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,671
but it,

547
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,300
til then what do they have?

548
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:51,134
They have,

549
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,381
they,

550
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:51,651
you know,

551
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,930
they have surgery and
they have a hormonal,

552
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,550
you know,

553
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,700
hormone hormonal treatments.

554
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,020
But if you had to choose
between a guy who did that,

555
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,890
a fee,

556
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,890
a male born male who did that and
became like a really sexy transgender or

557
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,310
disgusting angry woman who hates men,

558
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,170
discussing,

559
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,760
discussing angry women that hates women.

560
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,840
He would go with that.

561
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,330
I'll fucking hilarious.

562
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,403
You're hilarious.

563
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,250
There's only three people on
the planet wait on the planet.

564
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,890
So it's through the angry fucking project.

565
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,120
You're going to try to turn it into a
lady with where their big giant stinky

566
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,910
feet or a really beautiful lady.

567
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,540
Boy.

568
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,620
Definitely number one.

569
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,510
I would definitely be with a woman show.

570
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,990
Why you wouldn't be able to lady boy
you don't even like if I saw one of the

571
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,910
posts like penises,

572
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,520
you know like post surgery penises.

573
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,900
I wouldn't even look at it cause
you don't have to look at it.

574
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,670
How about you don't have to look at it.

575
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,210
How about she comes
with special cockles so,

576
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,700
so Brian like those three
d glasses and look at it.

577
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,510
She looks perfect.

578
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,581
Question Brian.

579
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,020
And look at the three
people on the whole planet.

580
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:57,130
Most likely I'd kill myself.

581
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,241
Let me tell you something.

582
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,110
It's three people on the planet.

583
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:00,910
I'm going to go to the
highest fucking mountain.

584
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,670
I'm going to stand there and look at it
and I'm going to say fuck it and take a

585
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,040
swan dive and then we're
going to have to start fresh.

586
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,170
Cause I'll be the last bail on the planet.

587
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,480
There'll be no impregnated people and
those two people are going to die.

588
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:11,261
And that's going to be a wrap.

589
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:15,400
Unless they milk my balls for sperm when
they find my dead body within 24 hour

590
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,170
period and my sperm staying alive,

591
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,410
most likely the human species ends there.

592
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:19,851
Brian's,

593
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:20,010
yeah.

594
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,471
So yeah,

595
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,400
I'd go with the trainee.

596
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,383
Is that okay?

597
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,320
No transgender.

598
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:23,801
Pardon me?

599
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,650
You fucking can I ask one quick question?

600
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,470
I'd be sitting there eating that big fat,

601
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,270
real pussy getting bitched at.

602
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,610
I don't,

603
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,270
it was real.

604
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,980
Please show,

605
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,340
even when,

606
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,140
obviously I'm talking about on the
podcast and let's say this topic does,

607
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,730
uh,

608
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,360
appear on my show.

609
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,010
This lady boy,

610
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:49,150
10% issue.

611
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,250
Am I going to receive

612
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,660
a lot of heat on it?

613
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,280
Not only because

614
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,203
from who?

615
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,250
I don't know for America.

616
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,990
Fuck them,

617
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,750
man.

618
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,820
You're going to receive heat
from people no matter what.

619
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,840
No matter what you do,

620
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,700
there's going to be people
that don't like this.

621
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,040
They're going to be people
that don't like that dude.

622
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,390
He can't avoid heat.

623
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,171
If you're public,

624
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,004
you get heat.

625
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,061
Yeah,

626
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,840
but this is,

627
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,710
this is personal.

628
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,021
Public.

629
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,990
I've seen Neil degrasse Tyson take heat.

630
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,453
Who's that?

631
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,293
How dare you?

632
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,373
You don't know anything.

633
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,011
I don't know what.

634
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:17,360
Don't say.

635
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,750
I don't know anything.

636
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,490
I follow sports show.

637
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,383
That's his fall.

638
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,350
Nothing about science.

639
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,213
Nothing about space.

640
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,730
I've heard of stuff.

641
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,211
I heard a bill.

642
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,044
Nye.

643
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,700
I love weather.

644
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,970
I love geography.

645
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,170
I liked geography.

646
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,130
I'm into the moon.

647
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,243
Hi.

648
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,550
Okay,

649
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,770
so you're in Thailand.

650
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,040
Gosh.

651
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,360
Hey,

652
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,000
you go.

653
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,260
You're with the lady boy.

654
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,100
You go back,

655
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,940
you go to the club,

656
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,430
right.

657
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,160
Sit down.

658
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,771
How would it been?

659
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,570
Do you know right away
that this used to be a guy?

660
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,201
Oh,

661
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:49,950
definitely.

662
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,071
Well,

663
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:50,440
you know,

664
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:50,810
no,

665
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,060
no,

666
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,181
no.

667
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:51,841
Let me tell you something,

668
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,180
man.

669
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,350
Yeah,

670
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,140
it used to be is whatever.

671
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,550
I didn't see an Adam's apple.

672
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,390
Do you remember the episode the
man show that we did with that?

673
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:00,370
A transgender woman who is beautiful.

674
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,820
Her name was like vanity
or something like that.

675
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,750
Vaguely.

676
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,950
Remember that dude.

677
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,820
She was like really pretty like,

678
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,731
like Whoa,

679
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:14,500
like stunningly beautiful and was born
a man and we did a segment where the guy

680
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,610
got strapped to a table,

681
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,910
it's called make me hard and we put a,

682
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,150
I was strapped to a table,

683
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:23,140
we put a light box over his dick with
a light bulb go off when he got an

684
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:23,974
erection.

685
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,200
So of course we controlled the button,

686
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:27,720
so it'd be like whenever like major,

687
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,930
it's where eating bananas or we have
this transgender get out and the

688
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:35,800
transgender does a dance for this guy
and then she puts a whip cream on her

689
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,680
nipples and the guy sucks the
whipped cream off her tests.

690
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,530
She had big fake tits and
then she pulls out a peanut.

691
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:43,900
I remember that she pulls out a penis at
the end of this and the fucking light,

692
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,130
the light starts flashing.

693
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:45,531
May May,

694
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:45,741
may,

695
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:45,931
may,

696
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:49,120
may was saying that her penis looked like,

697
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,153
like a,

698
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,350
like a primate penis
that had been poisoned.

699
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,940
Like if you took a champ and you poisoned
the champ and he saw his dick after he

700
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:59,050
was dying of poisons.

701
00:19:59,051 --> 00:19:59,884
Let me ask a question.

702
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,880
What happens to the penis was just a
regular looking penis on a beautiful woman

703
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:05,900
with breasts.

704
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,290
Good skin issue.

705
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,473
Hair.

706
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,590
Okay.

707
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,000
The penis would be an issue for sure.

708
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:13,110
If you had to do something with it.

709
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,230
Like if the deal was like gotta like she,

710
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,041
she's beautiful,

711
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,080
but she's got a deck and
she's going to blow you,

712
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:20,040
but you've got to blow her.

713
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,953
No,

714
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,223
I'm out.

715
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,090
I'm out.

716
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,190
You said that's where you're out.

717
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,780
You're out on that.

718
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,341
Okay.

719
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:29,180
If you're at on that,

720
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:30,014
I'm at with you.

721
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,591
Okay.

722
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,424
We're both out.

723
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,290
I guess I'm 10%.

724
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:33,581
Yeah.

725
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,414
Yeah.

726
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,870
There you go.

727
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,030
I guess sometimes we second you.

728
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,810
Um,

729
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,510
so you know it's a he,

730
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,501
yes.

731
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,370
So you sitting there?

732
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,120
Yes,

733
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,110
I loved it.

734
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,811
And what,

735
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,170
what,

736
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,003
uh,

737
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,040
did

738
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,340
you,

739
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,480
were there any of them in,

740
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,810
they're actually born women
or was it all lady boys?

741
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,340
Do you know?

742
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,390
I probably,

743
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,240
I mean most likely all lady
running the place was a,

744
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:58,931
was a woman,

745
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:01,850
but I think most of the dancers were,

746
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,220
were,

747
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,900
were male at birth and um,

748
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,000
but it's part of that
culture just to let you know,

749
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:12,001
it's very accepted to see ladyboys
all around working at Starbucks,

750
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,600
walking down the street.

751
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,800
Why do you think that is?

752
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,641
I don't know.

753
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,181
It's just,

754
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,140
uh,

755
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,561
I don't know.

756
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:19,120
It's a different culture over there,

757
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,560
but is it a cultural choice or is it
a genetic thing where there's a great

758
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:26,320
percentage of people that feel
like they should have been a woman?

759
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,870
I think there's something about genetics.

760
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,970
I don't know about the,

761
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,250
I don't know if like Asians
are the Thai people are more,

762
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,730
you know,

763
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,060
apt to having that chain.

764
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,830
I would wonder if there's some stats
for that as far as like women to men,

765
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,390
transgenders like buck,

766
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,313
buck angel.

767
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,720
I wonder if there's some stats that show,

768
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,380
like what countries have more
transgender women to men.

769
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,570
If Thailand question,

770
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,571
I would have talent.

771
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,510
Does Thailand actually
have more transgender men?

772
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,190
An accepted part of the culture?

773
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:59,050
I mean I bet you down in Brazil there's
a lot and it's accepted and may be

774
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,010
accepted down there.

775
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,820
Right.

776
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,900
So um,

777
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,050
you can tell us as much as you want about
this experience or you could end right

778
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:05,320
here.

779
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,540
I I'm willing to talk.

780
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,730
The only thing I'm thinking about is I
don't want to give too much away on the

781
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:14,050
show and I going to see the show.

782
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,830
Keep going.

783
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,000
People are going to see the show anyway.

784
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,900
It's going to be awesome.

785
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,460
You've actually already said
it on a podcast before and
we got you up to 12% gay

786
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,590
when you brought him up to 12 yeah,

787
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,140
we got him up to 12 because there was
something else that he does like Pr.

788
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,000
I got confused.

789
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,020
He'll sell peer pressure.

790
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:32,290
I feel like you guys go down a couple
more questions and we'll bullied them into

791
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,760
an extra percentage of being gay.

792
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,200
That's how he eat here.

793
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,650
He said he got bullied and to be in three
and then you might've bought it how it

794
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,640
was walking.

795
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,130
I think it was because you still like pot.

796
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,430
Click on like guy porn
at home or something.

797
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,490
I forget what it,

798
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,500
I have to run out here.

799
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,883
What

800
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,621
you click on?

801
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,790
What that,

802
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,960
that's a percentage.

803
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,000
That's residue percentage.

804
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,720
What are you working at?

805
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,553
Chernobyl

806
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,350
and not describing
fucking nuclear power pal.

807
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,100
All right.

808
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,660
I came about being gay.

809
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,790
Reza jewel came back quantum
energy and came on his back.

810
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,820
I had at quantum gayness is what we had
access to you porn and I did wander and

811
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,324
click.

812
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,230
It's something I would never
ever do and it's something that

813
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,280
it's,

814
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,731
you know,

815
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:34,091
it's like,

816
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:35,680
did people see Brokeback mountain?

817
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,010
Did it any straight guy?

818
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:38,470
See Brokeback mountain.

819
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,910
I'm sure there were.

820
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,390
I'm sure they saw two guys making
love in the movie or whatever and they

821
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,244
actually

822
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:51,310
felt good about knowing these guys loved
each other and it may even aroused a

823
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:57,140
straight guy knowing that two guys were
passionately in love with each other.

824
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:57,380
Okay,

825
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:57,890
let me show you.

826
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,723
Do what.

827
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,601
Let me tell you from here.

828
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,434
First of all,

829
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,630
if you felt that from watching a movie,

830
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:06,140
it means you don't have a sense of humor
and you probably weren't there with

831
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,300
another man who also has a sense of humor.

832
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,960
Because if you did as soon
as the Jake Ellenberger,

833
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,620
no,

834
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,161
what's his name?

835
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:13,790
Jake Gilman.

836
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,071
All,

837
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:14,361
sorry.

838
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,194
Jake Ellenberger,

839
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,440
who's an MMA fighter.

840
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:17,430
Drake Gillen Berger.

841
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,650
Alan Burger.

842
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,550
It's a professional mixed
martial arts fighter.

843
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,220
Gillen Hall spits on his hand and
then shoves his Dick Right into that.

844
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,030
Into that.

845
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,590
Yeah,

846
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,371
right into heath.

847
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,590
But I don't think you would.

848
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,790
You'd have to laugh a little.

849
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:32,810
I mean,

850
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,780
I didn't see the movie.

851
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,610
We're only human.

852
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,010
I'm saying somebody got aroused by that.

853
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,040
Who is not gay Su boy,

854
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm not sure I agree with you there.

855
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,740
I think give that,

856
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,120
that scene a rouse you,

857
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,140
I think you're probably good

858
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,320
saying the scene arouse you,

859
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,600
maybe that to humans
are and so love together

860
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,480
and it's,

861
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,940
it's passionate and it's almost wrong.

862
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,220
It's taboo.

863
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,143
Taboo.

864
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,113
There you go.

865
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,940
It's almost taboo to say that.

866
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:04,774
You know what,

867
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,520
that scene from Brokeback mountain

868
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,770
it is

869
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,300
did start something.

870
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,020
I,

871
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,561
but it didn't,

872
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:12,760
I never saw the movie,

873
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,010
never saw them.

874
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,390
I saw the relationship between heath
herring and Jake [inaudible] hall was very

875
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:23,360
similar to one of my
jokes is that I think,

876
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,010
I don't believe in bisexual men.

877
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,070
I think there's gay men and then there's
really gullible straight dudes who get

878
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,510
talked and the blowing crafty gay guy,

879
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,000
not me.

880
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,890
I'm 10% gay and I'm not
sure what that movie was,

881
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,130
was Jay Gillen Hall was
the really crafty gay dude.

882
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,260
And he's like,

883
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:41,751
Richard,

884
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:42,584
what is his name?

885
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,030
Heath Ledger Ledger.

886
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,421
Keith,

887
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:44,931

888
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,830
I call them the heath herring.

889
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,260
Heath herring.

890
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,513
He floods your,

891
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,473
sorry heath.

892
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,530
He's herrings.

893
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Another MMA fighter.

894
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,030
He's ledger was just like sort of a,

895
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:58,130
a nine volt battery brain dude.

896
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,180
Just kind of a,

897
00:25:59,181 --> 00:25:59,750
uh,

898
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,010
do wasn't that smart.

899
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,090
And he was out there alone and hanging
out with this guy and a bunch of fucking

900
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,830
sheep around and it just got into it.

901
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,993
Fuck it.

902
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,960
Get talked into it.

903
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,310
But it ruined his life,

904
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,630
wrecked his life.

905
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,920
He really wasn't even gay.

906
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,440
He was talked into doing shit.

907
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,250
Who's key had a family.

908
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,453
They just

909
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,380
see.

910
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,660
I want to get talked into it.

911
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,440
You want to,

912
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,310
it would not.

913
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,760
Oh,

914
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,600
I thought you said I want,

915
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,491
I'm hearing.

916
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:25,970
Thanks.

917
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,280
Okay.

918
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,113
Hi.

919
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,490
Take it back to silence.

920
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,670
You went the way lady boy
and how does it escalate?

921
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,010
What did the second floor,

922
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,120
what do you think of when
you're walking up those stairs?

923
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,950
Biggest mistake of my life.

924
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,310
You know what?

925
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,720
I'll tell you what I wanted to

926
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,431
see.

927
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:47,100
If I can not get it up.

928
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,271
She,

929
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:48,481
I,

930
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,920
if I had the temptation,

931
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,540
I could do whatever I want.

932
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,800
This is my big chance.

933
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,030
Everyone says Brodie,

934
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:54,751
you're gay,

935
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,590
you're gay.

936
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,770
I know it's eight now
I'm in a room in Thailand

937
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,200
and you're like,

938
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,100
I'll show you

939
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,143
Brody

940
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,450
and you know what?

941
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,430
I don't need to go into detail,

942
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,580
but I pushed it to the limit.

943
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,250
I went as far as I could go.

944
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,350
Okay,

945
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,430
did I perform?

946
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,780
I will go on record saying,

947
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,351
no,

948
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:27,190
I did not.

949
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,120
Never have,

950
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:32,440
don't want to perform oral on a man.

951
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,880
Can I go on record saying that?

952
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,421
I got you,

953
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:35,500
but what happened?

954
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,810
Well that didn't happen.

955
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,470
Okay.

956
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,350
Well it didn't happen.

957
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:43,390
Also is kissing.

958
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:43,841
Kissing.

959
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:44,120
Didn't,

960
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,030
I don't want to kiss a man.

961
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:46,864
Let's be clear.

962
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,980
There was no kissing,

963
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,701
no kiss,

964
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:49,211
no race.

965
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,140
Car driving,

966
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,090
no meteorite impact.

967
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,590
Many other things didn't tell you.

968
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,820
Make an unromantic.

969
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,443
Ooh,

970
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,253
Ooh,

971
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,553
Ooh.

972
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,091
I'm sorry.

973
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:08,924
I apologize.

974
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,700
I'm very romantic guy

975
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,323
going

976
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,250
and you know some stuff I tried,

977
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:21,763
you know,

978
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
touch this.

979
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,560
Not,

980
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,460
I'll be honest,

981
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,570
I looked,

982
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,560
I looked at it.

983
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,113
How close?

984
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,691
No,

985
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:29,881
no,

986
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:30,101
no.

987
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:30,934
Her scope.

988
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:31,610
No.

989
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,210
No.

990
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,200
Probably.

991
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,623
What is that?

992
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,560
Three feet?

993
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,240
Two and a half feet from the ass
or the Dick looked at the penis.

994
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,330
I said difference because if
you're three feet from the Dick,

995
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,120
that's a safe judgment
time you can use left.

996
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:47,511
He can move,

997
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:47,751
right?

998
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:48,320
Correct.

999
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,670
Three feet from the ass.

1000
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,030
No,

1001
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,680
I wasn't there.

1002
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,663
You're basically there.

1003
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,010
Okay.

1004
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,211
No,

1005
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:53,331
no,

1006
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:53,511
no.

1007
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:54,080
Timeout.

1008
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,561
Timeout.

1009
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:56,600
Are you saying three feet?

1010
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,860
I'm talking about my face.

1011
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,731
Your face.

1012
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:00,350
Three feet from his dick or his ass.

1013
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,630
Can I say another thing?

1014
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:02,931
Yes.

1015
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:03,800
You can see whatever you want.

1016
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:04,730
Never did.

1017
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Nor do I want to take my face
and put it in the the man's ass.

1018
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,220
Okay.

1019
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,940
Can I go on record saying that now we
know if there was any debate before it's

1020
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:17,690
been squashed.

1021
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,523
Okay,

1022
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,000
now your turn it around and
I'm in Bangkok and I go,

1023
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,250
well people say I'm gay.

1024
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,703
Turn around,

1025
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,830
let me look at it.

1026
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,880
Well,

1027
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,713
how far away?

1028
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,593
How far away?

1029
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,250
Three feet from the deck?

1030
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,140
Yeah.

1031
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,831
What's it look like?

1032
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:37,311
Is it hard?

1033
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:39,650
At least I'll tell you what.

1034
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,400
No,

1035
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,350
it was,

1036
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,780
it was what you described.

1037
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:44,561
It wasn't normal.

1038
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:45,610
Something happened to,

1039
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:46,980
it has been poisoned.

1040
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,801
Whatever.

1041
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:48,400
There's some calc,

1042
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,680
chem,

1043
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,430
you start injecting
your body with estrogen.

1044
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,170
I would assume your Dick shrivels up.

1045
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,150
It's not necessary
anymore and it knows it.

1046
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,150
Just like when you inject
your body with testosterone.

1047
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:58,781
If you're a woman,

1048
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,600
you're not supposed to have
men's levels of testosterone.

1049
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,460
Plus those women in bodybuilders,

1050
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:03,601
they,

1051
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,650
they grow dicks.

1052
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:04,990
They,

1053
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,190
their clinic stands.

1054
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,190
It's like when do you find like a dead
body hanging for like that's been there

1055
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:09,701
for a week.

1056
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,950
It's stretched and different.

1057
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,793
Dank,

1058
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,753
different things.

1059
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,531
Different thing.

1060
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,364
Brian.

1061
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:16,631
Okay,

1062
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,640
so the Dick was soft.

1063
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,930
We didn't touch it.

1064
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,291
Okay.

1065
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:20,771
But when,

1066
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:24,910
when you tapped it just to see
what it's like to be touched,

1067
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,110
it will never touched a man's penis ever.

1068
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,820
How do you,

1069
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,250
how do you even know that you're
in a dream unless you touch it,

1070
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,640
right?

1071
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,241
I guess.

1072
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:31,551
Yeah,

1073
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:34,990
I just touched with no stimulation at all.

1074
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,330
It's like that thing that you
do when you're lucid dreaming.

1075
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,410
Um,

1076
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,890
the way you PR like practice lucid
dreaming is by walking around your house.

1077
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:44,170
And every time you get to
a door knob or doorway,

1078
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,640
you knock in the doorway.

1079
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,893
Am I dreaming?

1080
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,450
And if you're not dreaming you,

1081
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,110
you feel it.

1082
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,010
You knock on the door.

1083
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:51,791
But if you're dreaming,

1084
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,810
your hand just goes right through.

1085
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,471
And he'd go,

1086
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:54,370
oh my goodness,

1087
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,233
I'm dreaming.

1088
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,740
And that's how you lucid dream.

1089
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,070
So it's like a meditative device.

1090
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:01,780
So whenever you see a Dick,

1091
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,400
she should thump it and go,

1092
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,170
am I dreaming?

1093
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:04,700
No,

1094
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,533
no.

1095
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,340
I got set up here.

1096
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,710
All just got set up.

1097
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,510
We all dream about day.

1098
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,920
Joe Is our day.

1099
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,450
God knows Dick.

1100
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:14,290
I don't want it.

1101
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,361
You don't have to,

1102
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:16,961
why?

1103
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,430
You don't know what to want to touch it.

1104
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,293
But you did,

1105
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,040
but you did.

1106
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,670
I touch is a doctor,

1107
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,260
but touch as a doctor when she gets it,

1108
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,180
digested it to officially
say I've done it too.

1109
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,390
What did you do your residency?

1110
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,270
She's my Miami state.

1111
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,831
Arizona.

1112
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,120
Stan joy itch.

1113
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,291
Okay,

1114
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:35,741
doctor,

1115
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:36,340
please continue.

1116
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,173
So

1117
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,240
there was no kissing.

1118
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:40,981
I don't want it put.

1119
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:43,750
This guy smelled like she smells good.

1120
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,943
She smelled.

1121
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,700
It was a girl.

1122
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:45,941
Well,

1123
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:46,420
okay.

1124
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,440
What point in time,

1125
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,333
here's the question.

1126
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,100
When you become a transgender,

1127
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,030
when do we decide to call you a girl?

1128
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,980
Is it when you make the choice?

1129
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,560
Because if you still have a penis,

1130
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,980
it's becomes very,

1131
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:04,150
I don't know if you have
to buy your penis cut off.

1132
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,150
I don't know if you have
to be on certain him,

1133
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,021
certain,

1134
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:08,710
uh,

1135
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,220
you know,

1136
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,690
medication hormones.

1137
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
I guess it's just at,

1138
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,450
for a courtesy.

1139
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,550
It's just the person's choice.

1140
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Like if you decided tomorrow that you
want it to be a Eustace is the other

1141
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,374
girl's name.

1142
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,203
What's the girl's name?

1143
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,560
Becky.

1144
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:26,870
Becky.

1145
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,810
Warren Stephens?

1146
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,773
No,

1147
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,470
you,

1148
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,303
me,

1149
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,390
you decided to be a woman.

1150
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,200
Oh,

1151
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,531
okay.

1152
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:32,861
Okay.

1153
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,131
Okay.

1154
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:33,964
Becky Stephens,

1155
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,320
I would start calling you a woman.

1156
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,400
I would start calling you her.

1157
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,150
I see.

1158
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,330
She respect out of respect and I'm
taking hormones out of respect,

1159
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:41,981
but there's,

1160
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,130
you know that there's queer.

1161
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,960
Do you know a queers?

1162
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,580
Those are like gay guys.

1163
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:48,020
Like who've taken the word over.

1164
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,483
No.

1165
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:49,941
You know,

1166
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:54,941
and that all Lbtq t what
does fucking has lesbians,

1167
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,540
bisexuals,

1168
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,740
a gay,

1169
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,780
transgender,

1170
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,960
queer.

1171
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,281
The queer ones.

1172
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,120
A strange one.

1173
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,700
And the queer one is they want
to be whatever they want to be.

1174
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,511
They want to be a man.

1175
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:06,350
They want to be a woman.

1176
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:06,990
They want to be,

1177
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,880
what do you want to be?

1178
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,030
They like want to be they
or they want to be it.

1179
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,983
They have,

1180
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,300
they have different designations.

1181
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:15,360
15% queer,

1182
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,050
but they choose 10% gay,

1183
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,280
but 15% queer.

1184
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:19,910
I liked it.

1185
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,540
Yeah.

1186
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,021
I like it.

1187
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:22,280
We're moving close to our goal.

1188
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,100
I feel like home shopping
network and I'm selling queer.

1189
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,980
We're moving closer to the goal of
86% gay by the end of the podcast.

1190
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,851
We can do it,

1191
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:32,481
ladies and gentlemen.

1192
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,130
All we need is more stories.

1193
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,260
We got more Brodie coming
up right after this.

1194
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,820
Look at the design of this.

1195
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:39,050
We get this from China,

1196
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,020
but let me assure you the
quality is remarkable.

1197
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,820
His lips are soft for any cock.

1198
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:44,810
No,

1199
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,051
no,

1200
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:45,261
no,

1201
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:45,531
no,

1202
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:46,190
no.

1203
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,570
Come on Brian.

1204
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:48,141
Asshole.

1205
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:48,441
Dude,

1206
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:49,760
you're ruining everything.

1207
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,020
We're so close to getting
him up to 25% I'd say,

1208
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,820
which is I think the real numb Joe.

1209
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,131
No,

1210
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:55,910
it isn't.

1211
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,151
No,

1212
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:57,130
it isn't saying.

1213
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,973
That's not

1214
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,240
25% here's why.

1215
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,170
This is what I said at that.

1216
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,050
I'm going to be honest
with you at that moment.

1217
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,471
Okay?

1218
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,161
At the moment,

1219
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:12,260
where's that guy is sucking on your

1220
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,193
Dick.

1221
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,430
I happened to in person all the time.

1222
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,080
I think you're at 40% gay.

1223
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,720
Are you?

1224
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,553
Are you

1225
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,373
moment?

1226
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,551
This could mess.

1227
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:26,290
Oh my hell for that moment when I'm
offering you is a fluctuating scale of

1228
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,124
gayness,

1229
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,920
but you brought me all the way to go
as high as 40 when you come in a man's

1230
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:33,310
mouth,

1231
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,920
he's giving an f being very generous,

1232
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,520
very generous by often you 40 but for
most of the population when you come into

1233
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,021
man's mouth,

1234
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:44,380
you hit a hundred and you
hit a hundred yes you do.

1235
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:44,861
Yes,

1236
00:34:44,861 --> 00:34:45,251
you did.

1237
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,720
You say if you were in prison,

1238
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:48,220
you got locked prison.

1239
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:48,641
Brody.

1240
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:51,100
I don't plan on going to
prince like just a nice guy.

1241
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,570
I don't break any fucking laws.

1242
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,200
I di,

1243
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,940
I defy you

1244
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,870
to find me like Joe if
you want with prison,

1245
00:34:58,871 --> 00:34:59,580
if you will,

1246
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,440
because that's the only place we
have no options as sexual part.

1247
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:02,890
I was,

1248
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,570
I had no options at night.

1249
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,070
Most people don't go to prison.

1250
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:06,850
Brodie.

1251
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,640
It's a dumb thing to bring up for.

1252
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,720
Most people don't go to prison and when
they walk upstairs on their own without

1253
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:14,560
a security guard,

1254
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:18,700
having them shackled risk to and
cuff you like pretending they had,

1255
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,470
they brought me to the mess
hall and they suck my deck.

1256
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,550
That's not what happened.

1257
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,420
Okay,

1258
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,230
go back to me.

1259
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,970
Go back to me being able to go back to
that or that they didn't blow the buzzer

1260
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:31,510
and give your one hour outside to play
basketball and you wind up getting your

1261
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:32,260
Dick sucked.

1262
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,071
That's not what happened.

1263
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:33,700
Brody.

1264
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,260
He made a choice to go up those stairs.

1265
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,310
There's nothing wrong with it,

1266
00:35:36,311 --> 00:35:37,900
but you're able to about 40% gap.

1267
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,840
I don't believe those numbers.

1268
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:40,201
Brian,

1269
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,000
what do you think when you
come in the guy's mouth?

1270
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:42,750
What are we up to?

1271
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,280
I think he just say I did that.

1272
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,620
I'm just assuming he's done.

1273
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:49,540
I would say definitely 25 I
don't like your numbers Brian.

1274
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,820
That's a shocker.

1275
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,070
You've never brought that number up to me.

1276
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:57,090
I cannot believe that Joe
said 40% 40% cause I love you.

1277
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,490
I should've said a hundred
man came and a man's mouth.

1278
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,980
Can I say something I did
almost immediately gaze.

1279
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:04,590
Fuck can I do other
than fucking the garden,

1280
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,190
the TD,

1281
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,210
spit it back into your mouth.

1282
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:07,044
Brody,

1283
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,210
what is more gay?

1284
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,990
What does more given us
say something to you?

1285
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,973
I'm going to say

1286
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,880
we'll move on and know what's
gay or if you think of 40% gay,

1287
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,860
gay,

1288
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,880
86 is our goal,

1289
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,200
but you're playing games.

1290
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,460
That's not what I said.

1291
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:29,550
I never said how you were
you a fluctuating skin.

1292
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:30,630
I'm going to get hammered.

1293
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,520
He wrote,

1294
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:32,460
no,

1295
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,031
you're not.

1296
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,200
You're going to be really tough to me.

1297
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,380
I love you and America loves you.

1298
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:37,950
Two,

1299
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,540
you'll be universally protected.

1300
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,000
The only people that will despise
you because of this are assholes.

1301
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,840
Fuck down.

1302
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,860
What do you perfect.

1303
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,300
You're perfect sexually.

1304
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:45,781
No.

1305
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,130
You could keep your room clean.

1306
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,111
Yes,

1307
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:48,540
I do.

1308
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,360
You give Brody Stevens a hard
time for being an 86% gay.

1309
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,590
I say percent

1310
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,980
right now we're at 40 stops.

1311
00:36:55,981 --> 00:37:00,981
The moment you decide he is release
the hounds and it's down the hatch of a

1312
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:02,131
man's throat.

1313
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:07,020
Probably cigarette brand new fucking
stubble and I don't think that's so bad.

1314
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,950
If you feel stubble on your balls
and hit balls are clean shaven,

1315
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,000
it probably is a stimulant guarantee you,

1316
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:15,820
there's at least 10 comedians that have
gone down to Brazil and had their penis

1317
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:16,160
suck

1318
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,390
by a transvestite.

1319
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,800
Every time you try to rationalize what
you've done by comparing yourself to the

1320
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:24,410
acts of others that are also ridiculous,

1321
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,320
you get another 10% gay stop.

1322
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,360
So we're now at 35% gay or goal is 86
we got at least 20 minutes left to this

1323
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:32,714
podcast.

1324
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,020
We can do this Brody while if I talk more,

1325
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,980
I would,

1326
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,490
I would probably come very close
to hitting your thing here.

1327
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,050
Nothing written.

1328
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,883
Oh,

1329
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,070
you'd come very close to
hitting 86 if you tried.

1330
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,331
So look,

1331
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:51,730
if you're on ecstasy and you are
with the perfect ladies on x,

1332
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:52,070
Z,

1333
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,030
like vanity,

1334
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,830
like vanity from the man show.

1335
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,460
Remember her?

1336
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:55,701
Yeah,

1337
00:37:55,701 --> 00:37:56,534
she was fine.

1338
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,710
I've pushed it to the limit and
I know a race car driver roadie.

1339
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,763
All right.

1340
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,090
Stop saying like you
breaking in new tires.

1341
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,780
We're trying to figure out these
compounds when we hit the skid pad.

1342
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,770
That's not what's going on.

1343
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,120
When you say and you push it to the limit,

1344
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,500
what are you saying?

1345
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,820
What's with the euphemisms?

1346
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:14,450
Brody?

1347
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,410
Let's get real with America
because America loves you
and they love you the most

1348
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:19,160
when you're telling the truth.

1349
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,970
I said,

1350
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,890
let's see how far I can go.

1351
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,210
That's 35% gay,

1352
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,093
right?

1353
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,270
We agree.

1354
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,350
I don't think so.

1355
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:27,951
Come on.

1356
00:38:27,951 --> 00:38:28,470
Let's be real.

1357
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,090
No,

1358
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:29,923
no.

1359
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,610
It might be a 35% gay thought worth.

1360
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,840
It's worth.

1361
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,770
We have only 4% where
are we at the moment?

1362
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,360
I mean is what's going on here.

1363
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,260
She's sucking your Dick,

1364
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,790
but as she tickling your balls,

1365
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,110
like is she probably,

1366
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,160
does she know her thing?

1367
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,450
Does she know what the fuck she's doing?

1368
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,601
Yeah,

1369
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:47,261
they're decent,

1370
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:50,590
but if you feel like a girl is doing it
or do you feel like a guy's doing it?

1371
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:51,071
That's beautiful.

1372
00:38:51,071 --> 00:38:52,300
I don't think about a guy.

1373
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,480
You're not thinking about a guy she looks
like a girl may cost the hounds smell,

1374
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:58,710
feel rast.

1375
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,980
Sexy phantoms.

1376
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,603
Oh,

1377
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,320
sorry about that.

1378
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
When you release the hounds,

1379
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,970
is there any feeling of regret?

1380
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,090
I didn't have any if that even
from what my recollection,

1381
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,460
recollection what,

1382
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,280
no,

1383
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,451
we,

1384
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:19,480
you stone cold sober.

1385
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,570
I was probably on a hookah and beer.

1386
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,490
I think we hit 86% no,

1387
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,530
we didn't [inaudible]
pretty good about right.

1388
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,620
That's I want to say this jail on.

1389
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,140
Talk about whatever you
want regarding this.

1390
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,160
I'll be honest,

1391
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,430
it is a subject that does
make me uncomfortable.

1392
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,290
Wow.

1393
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,620
For just a couple of reasons.

1394
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:42,700
The other reasons that it is
so public and so what I know,

1395
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:45,550
but it's getting some why
makes her unconscious is
going to be on comedy central

1396
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,630
and it freaks me out.

1397
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,291
No,

1398
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,124
listen Brody,

1399
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,240
what you,

1400
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,080
who you are.

1401
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:52,240
It's who you are and
who you are as awesome.

1402
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:52,990
We love you.

1403
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,290
I ain't,

1404
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,030
doesn't matter if you're 86% gay,

1405
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:55,411
okay.

1406
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:56,800
Oh percent like everybody else,

1407
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,450
but here it doesn't matter.

1408
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,410
Let me say this,

1409
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,000
on this podcast,

1410
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,980
you allow me to kind of explain everything
and allowed to express yourself and I

1411
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:08,260
feel like maybe on this show,

1412
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,390
and I'm not blaming anybody,

1413
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,710
it could be my own neuroses.

1414
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,040
I don't know if it comes across that way.

1415
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,020
Kind of how we explained it.

1416
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,750
I know it's a TV show and
I know this is a podcast,

1417
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,770
but that's where some of my anxiety lies.

1418
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,000
But the fact that we just talked about
this here does make me feel better.

1419
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,500
And knowing that you have my back,

1420
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,660
no matter if you're 100% gay,

1421
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,670
which not a hundred a lot of people

1422
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,610
when you come in the guy's mouth,

1423
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:37,361
you're 100% gay.

1424
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:39,100
A lot of people who've said
that I don't agree with,

1425
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,450
so I don't agree with them.

1426
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,590
I don't agree with them.

1427
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,453
Thank you.

1428
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,421
But your third year,

1429
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:44,490
86% um,

1430
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,620
at that night,

1431
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,930
I debate you on that.

1432
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,220
I said 40 before,

1433
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:49,031
but it's because I love you.

1434
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:49,781
If I didn't know you,

1435
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,720
I'd say 100% but I do and I
love you and I don't care.

1436
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,190
I think you're 100% awesome.

1437
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I don't think it matters if you're a
10% gay or 25% gay who gives a shit and

1438
00:40:59,411 --> 00:40:59,711
yeah.

1439
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:00,940
You know what lady boy,

1440
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:02,860
as opposed to a gate a man.

1441
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,500
Like if,

1442
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,180
if it was a dude who looked like don
Barris and he had a full beard and he was

1443
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:07,811
sucking your Dick,

1444
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:09,010
that be a completely different,

1445
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,340
exactly that God doesn't appreciate.

1446
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,260
It does appreciate it.

1447
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,130
Choking him.

1448
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,130
God made gay people and that's
how the Christians conundrum.

1449
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,140
Who is he exactly out there?

1450
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,550
You had to come out his nose.

1451
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,631
Yeah.

1452
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:23,464
How much time I,

1453
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,550
there was a condom.

1454
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,413
Thank you.

1455
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,440
Good move.

1456
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,850
Otherwise he'd get the super aids.

1457
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,040
They probably had to let you know.

1458
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,420
I just don't want to get reckon.

1459
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,171
I don't wreck it.

1460
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,120
I don't want to you guys.

1461
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,100
We'll

1462
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,810
take the Tarzana hat
off and you're all set.

1463
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,351
I don't,

1464
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:37,480
I don't want to be ridiculed.

1465
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,170
It could be your move
like Larry the cable guy.

1466
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,430
If he doesn't have that fucking shirt on,

1467
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,330
no one's going to know who he is.

1468
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:41,540
Yeah.

1469
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,070
That's a very clever move on his hat.

1470
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,820
Wear a baseball hat and wear a
shirt that way when he's not,

1471
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,730
when he wants to dress up and go to a
restaurant and we know why he looks like a

1472
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:52,700
regular fucking redneck slides
right in under the door.

1473
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:53,991
So go on.

1474
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:54,824
How much did you come

1475
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,580
to look?

1476
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,191
If it says,

1477
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:00,140
if it sounds wrong the way I'm asking you,

1478
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,471
you know,

1479
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:01,304
correct me.

1480
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,480
I'm new to this game.

1481
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,751
It was in a,

1482
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:05,480
it was,

1483
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,860
I did it and that was it.

1484
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,890
I pushed it and it was a good,

1485
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,500
I wouldn't say it was good.

1486
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,070
It was like,

1487
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,240
well I did it.

1488
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,783
Hmm.

1489
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,783
That's like,

1490
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,420
is that like eating and Kentucky Fried
Chicken or is that like taking a really

1491
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:24,254
good shit?

1492
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,560
I had more lean towards
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

1493
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,640
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1494
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,480
Pretty fucking good.

1495
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,343
It's good stuff.

1496
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,370
You know I went gluten free,

1497
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:32,240
but that's one thing I miss,

1498
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,840
man.

1499
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,340
I Miss Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1500
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,601
I mean you,

1501
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,070
you've had me say a lot of stuff,

1502
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:37,311
Joe.

1503
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:37,790
Our Ma,

1504
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,790
am I going to get negative tweets
based on if they listen man,

1505
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,510
if you do,

1506
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,680
those people are assholes.

1507
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,700
You didn't do anything wrong.

1508
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:44,660
You didn't hurt anybody.

1509
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,390
You,

1510
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,580
you want to have fun.

1511
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,600
You went to have fun.

1512
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:47,770
You,

1513
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,670
you did it with someone who
wanted to have fun with you.

1514
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,750
Who gives a shit?

1515
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,890
Who gives a shit?

1516
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,431
Yeah,

1517
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:52,911
that's them,

1518
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:53,380
man.

1519
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,580
It's,

1520
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,500
it's on them.

1521
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,400
It's on all of them,

1522
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:55,700
man.

1523
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,970
Who cares to check?

1524
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,750
You can't wait here.

1525
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,380
Flat Glutton for punishment.

1526
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,641
You love it.

1527
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:02,474
You're hoping they're mad.

1528
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,830
I don't enjoy it.

1529
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't want to delegate.

1530
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,490
You're a homophobe sample.

1531
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,290
I usually say anti-semite.

1532
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,340
How much do you use the,

1533
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,121
you should say that.

1534
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,260
If they say the key things,

1535
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,071
if it's a Jew,

1536
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:13,580
things calm.

1537
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,510
Homophobes oh,

1538
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:14,930
switch.

1539
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,130
Confused the fuck out of him,

1540
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:16,820
dude.

1541
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,271
I don't want to,

1542
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:18,590
I don't want to waste to hate on it.

1543
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:19,550
I just want to be happy.

1544
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:20,900
No,

1545
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,100
I don't want to leave it that.

1546
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,350
What do you,

1547
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,183
I hate camel.

1548
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:23,511
No,

1549
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:24,344
I just,

1550
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,070
I'm sure I'm going to have to deal with
some negative stuff here and there on

1551
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:30,440
Twitter or whatever or we need
to get that no matter what.

1552
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:30,711
All right,

1553
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:31,970
well maybe a couple emails,

1554
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:32,900
but so what?

1555
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,621
I'm positive.

1556
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:34,340
I feel good.

1557
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,970
You're awesome.

1558
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:35,870
HIV positive.

1559
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,440
No,

1560
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,071
Brian,

1561
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:37,904
fuck you man.

1562
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,650
Speaking of which Dallas buyers club,

1563
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,840
I don't want to just that movie.

1564
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:42,020
Yeah,

1565
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,910
bring it up because it has
a lot of your people in it,

1566
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:45,230
but it's a great fucking movie.

1567
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,413
People,

1568
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,171
Texans.

1569
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,040
Are you from Texas?

1570
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,000
I've been to Texas.

1571
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:50,550
What do you mean,

1572
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,383
Mike?

1573
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,900
I know you really do sell well in Texas.

1574
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:04,440
Okay.
