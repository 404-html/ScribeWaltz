1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,220
Keep joints in it,
but it's not quite big enough.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,323
The holes.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,550
Oh yeah.
Cause they come out like all bent and

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,180
sad.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,080
We're live.
Yeah.

6
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,570
I tried to keep joints in there,
but it didn't just stay put in there.

7
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,590
It all kind of were like,
it was like half on half smushed.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,930
We need like one of those bubblegum
brains.

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,440
You can just sticking it in there.
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,840
Uh,
I didn't want a fanboy out when I met

11
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:22,680
you,
but I'm a huge fan.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,690
I really love your music.
I think Dave Cross,

13
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,910
it was the first guy who turned me onto
you,

14
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,130
I think.
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,220
I don't remember how I met.
Just remember him telling me about exile

16
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:34,560
in Guyville.
Do you mean Mr showed?

17
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,610
Yeah.
Yeah,

18
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:36,270
he's the one.

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,770
He was a big Mr Show was in my happiest
touring iteration.

20
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,640
Like that was what we watched every
night after the show we'd hit the bus

21
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,020
and everyone would watch mister show
tilly passed out.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,920
That's a genius show.
I think it's like for Bob and Bob

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,470
Degrade on better call Saul and breaking
bad and has done a lot of other stuff.

24
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,960
That's awesome too.
But there's something about the two of

25
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,210
those guys together.
Yeah,

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,470
very unusual combination.
And they're writing,

27
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:05,720
it's just so bizarre and weird.
But they did a netflix thing for awhile.

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,140
I don't know if there are they still
doing that,

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,480
do you know?
I think he's doing those other shows

30
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,380
now.
I don't think so.

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,480
Too Bad.
Anyway,

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,510
Dave Cross introduce me to Liz phair.

33
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,670
Well I am,
that's a nice,

34
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,080
that's a nice touchstone since it was
part of my touring.

35
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:20,310
Yeah,

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,960
there you go.
I feel very good about that.

37
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,820
So you got,
what do you have now?

38
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,850
You have a box set out coming up
compilation.

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,783
Is that what it means?

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,790
It's kind of like a,
it's a reissue of my first record exile

41
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,020
in Guyville.
Um,

42
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,050
with the original girlies sound tapes
that I made on a four track in Ga late

43
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,493
eighties,
early nineties.

44
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,600
Is that when you were living at home?
Yeah,

45
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,740
that was when I was recalled back from
San Francisco having not gotten a job

46
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,490
and run out of money and grifting my way
across like the bay area.

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,350
Um,
I mean I had a place,

48
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:55,100
we,
we,

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,270
I was rooming,
everyone from my college class moved out

50
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:02,600
to San Francisco basically from Oberlin.
I went to,

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
and I made these little cassettes that I
forwarded to two friends and one of them

52
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,990
got super busy making copies of these
cassettes and sent them to every fanzine

53
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,320
in America with this like glowing
recommendation.

54
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,210
And all of a sudden I was getting,
I was living at home,

55
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,080
um,
still didn't have a job and I would get

56
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,510
these envelopes coming to me saying
like,

57
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:32,750
please make me a cassette copy.
Here's $10.

58
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,240
Can you imagine what happened to the
$10?

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,650
How awful is that?
I truly just like,

60
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,730
I was like,
great,

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,290
thanks.
I wasn't making it.

62
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

63
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,610
Like there's about a hundred people that
didn't get their cassette,

64
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,640
but I wasn't making in the cassette.
But anyway,

65
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:54,641
that's sort of Taijuan you is actually
the person who made lots of cassettes

66
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,620
and sent them around.
So I have him to thank,

67
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,490
did you have a thought

68
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,190
that you were going to eventually make
it or be a big singer or the g?

69
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,090
Was that even an idea?

70
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,100
Not a clue.
I cleaned it.

71
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,620
Being in front of people like I would
not want to.

72
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,460
I loved being in the studio.
I loved recording but I didn't,

73
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:20,461
I was super stage frightened and I
couldn't think of anything.

74
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:25,570
I'd rather do less and get up in front
of you or play music or do anything

75
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,351
really.
Yeah,

76
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,970
absolutely.
Wow.

77
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,210
But it is hard,
but you obviously have a love of music.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,190
I love playing music.
I just,

79
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,500
I get very self conscious with a group
called this sucker up to you.

80
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:39,900
Otherwise we're not going to,
I get very self conscious in front of

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,670
crowds.
Still not so much anymore.

82
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,670
I do about two weeks before I hit the
stage,

83
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,700
I will stop sleeping and then really to
work myself into this kind of cold

84
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,590
sweat.
When I think about it,

85
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,970
I'll be like,
can I leave the country?

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,140
And then like I get on the stage and it
all comes back to me and I'm like,

87
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,630
I've done this a million times.
This is the best job in the world.

88
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,090
And it just,
it,

89
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,570
I can't psych myself into that feeling
until I'm actually on stage.

90
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,940
Maybe that's just cause you care about
it so much.

91
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,690
Probably I'm too alert.
We should be smoking those joints that

92
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,670
are not in own head.
I have some over here.

93
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,710
I know.
Can't even imagine where we'd go with

94
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,480
that.
We do it all the time.

95
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,430
She want to do,
let me know.

96
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,110
We're about 10 minutes and he changed
your mind.

97
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,540
I can time.
It gets really rough,

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,020
but it gets really personal.
Maybe sometimes you have to and I'm

99
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,850
just,
I'm a very awake person.

100
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,773
Hmm.

101
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,610
Well that's a good thing.
That's,

102
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,510
that's uh,
the more sensitive you are though,

103
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:42,760
the more you have to consider all the
possibilities and that that's what could

104
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,594
keep you up.

105
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,240
Right.
To send you down the UFO wormhole.

106
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,560
Right.
We talked about that

107
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,891
cast.
Yeah.

108
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,370
There's this guy that's coming on.
His name is doctor Robert Schoch can

109
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,310
easy geologists from Boston University
and he's worked on,

110
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,410
there's,
uh,

111
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,630
some real scientists that believe it's
entirely possible that the sphinx and a

112
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,670
lot of the construction in Egypt is far
older than they think

113
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,440
I know all about,
all about know about Robert Shaw runoff

114
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:13,150
and erosion has occurred around the base
or around the pit that the,

115
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,260
and it absolutely couldn't have been
done depending on like the way the

116
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,110
Sphinx is built where it's located.
This sighting.

117
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,790
Yeah.
Where it's level is,

118
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,740
is far older.
So

119
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,130
yes,
they think it was somewhere in the

120
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:31,130
neighborhood of 9,000 plus bc because
that's the law.

121
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,800
When back then the Nile Valley was a
rain forest and somehow or another it

122
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,720
became a desert.
And um,

123
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,750
this guy's,
you know,

124
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:42,670
legit Boston University professor,
geologist,

125
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,980
and he's traveling all over the place,
but he's here for some Ufo conference

126
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,990
and the Ufo people wanted to him to
mention the UFO conference.

127
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,660
And I'm like,
fucking Christ with Ufo conferences,

128
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,600
you guys don't have anything.
If you had something that would be,

129
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:00,020
what are you gonna get in a fucking
merriot somewhere and show,

130
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,690
show some blurry picture of some
fucking,

131
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,760
a hubcap to someone chucked up into the
air.

132
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,830
Like there's nothing.
Everything that,

133
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,710
everything that they look at falls apart
under scrutiny.

134
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,640
This is oak.
A few videos.

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,030
Okay.
I'm going to push back on.

136
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:12,841
Please do.
Please do.

137
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,100
Let's just say,
what about,

138
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:16,890
do you know the discovery disclosure?
Yes.

139
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,270
Disclosure project.
Okay.

140
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:21,270
There was their first press conference
when they got all the,

141
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:22,050
I'm,
I'm,

142
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,290
I tend to be impressed by the military,
you know,

143
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,760
ranking members.
I'm sort of like,

144
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,490
if you were,
if you were guarding missile silos and

145
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:32,910
you say you saw something hover above it
and deactivate,

146
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,360
you know,
I'm probably going to check that out a

147
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:39,270
little harder.
And there were just so many people that

148
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:41,220
stood up,
you know,

149
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:44,880
in that press conference and said that
they absolutely had seen evidence,

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,510
met extra terrestrials seeing the
crafts,

151
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,530
like in hangars,
et cetera.

152
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,310
Yup.
And to me,

153
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,400
like I,
they didn't look like they had that much

154
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,560
imagination.
They're the kind of people that I didn't

155
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,450
think could really,
I mean,

156
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,760
did you find that convincing at all?
No.

157
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,743
Here's why.
No,

158
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,670
no.
Just like a whole bunch of liars,

159
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,290
a whole line of live greer,
right?

160
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,080
The disclosure project so much about
him,

161
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,170
he doesn't appeal to me as much as the
people that he brought on who were

162
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,790
mostly military.
Yes.

163
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,550
Here's the thing about military.
Anybody who's in the military is a

164
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,890
person.
If you get a hundred people together,

165
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,270
one of them is out of their fucking
mind.

166
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,620
If you get a million people,
you've got a shit ton of people that are

167
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,550
out of their fucking mind that are
running around that one extra attention.

168
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,060
One of the best ways to say you're,
you are one of the best ways to get

169
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:38,720
extra tension is to say you've had some
extraordinary experience that separates

170
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:42,260
you from the pack.
It's one of the main points of delusion

171
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,660
that people that are really out of their
fucking mind,

172
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,890
well,
it won't want to point to.

173
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:49,310
I see things in people.
I can read Auras.

174
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,660
I can tell I'm a psychic healer.
I'm an intuitive person.

175
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,110
They all have this thing that separates
them from the herd without any work

176
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:00,320
whatsoever.
I feel like a lot of these people are

177
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:04,250
that they want attention and so they
tell these extraordinary stories.

178
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,680
Now when you said they're not creative,
that's a very astute point cause they

179
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:10,640
all the same fucking story cause it's
the same story that's been going on

180
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,620
forever.
They just repeat shit they've already

181
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:15,110
heard.
Most of these people I think are full of

182
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:18,980
Shit I think is entirely possible.
That UFO is a been here entirely

183
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:23,090
possible that see people have seen you
at foes entirely possible but a lot of

184
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,850
those people,
my fucking bullshit radar just goes off.

185
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:28,850
I paint May,
may main yeah I I've talked to too many

186
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,210
of them and when I did that television
show Joe Rogan questions everything and

187
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,440
I met with Ufo people in bigfoot people.
I was telling you before the podcast,

188
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:39,440
it cured me cause I got to be around
those people for hours and just talk to

189
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:40,610
him.
No cameras on them like,

190
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
oh,
you're fucking crazy,

191
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:45,680
or you're delusional,
or your way of looking at things is not

192
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,350
objective or you're talking to me
because you want to convince me of

193
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,970
something.
You're not just communicating the ideas

194
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,000
that are actually in your head.
You're pitching me some sort of a

195
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,020
speech.
You're like,

196
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:56,090
you've got some sort of a you're doing
for me.

197
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,980
I smell it,
and as a performer I smell it.

198
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm like,
this is nonsense.

199
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,010
You telling me nonsense.
You know,

200
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,844
they would tell you,
well,

201
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,890
you want evidence,
I'll back a truck up and show you the

202
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:05,371
evidence.
I'm like,

203
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,270
where's your fucking evidence?

204
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,820
You don't have any other audit today.
I mean like,

205
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,990
yeah,
here's the thing.

206
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:14,830
Did they seem as off kilter in
everything else they talked about that

207
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,863
relationship,

208
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,840
relationships,
jobs,

209
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,390
they're all screwballs.
They're almost all screw balls.

210
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,740
The people that are most convincing are
the people that see these orbs flying

211
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,360
around the pilots.
Yeah.

212
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:28,370
Well,
the reason why they see these things is

213
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,830
there's a real phenomenon called ball
lightning.

214
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,860
It's absolutely real and it's caused by
various weather conditions and they

215
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:40,970
think that even be caused sometimes by
the right weather conditions and the

216
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:44,120
shifting of tectonic plates that somehow
or another the friction.

217
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,640
Yes,
and that these Bob Ball lightning,

218
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:48,710
if you've ever seen videos of it,
it's phenomenal.

219
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:52,070
It just flies around.
They've even had an inside airplanes

220
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,880
somehow or another ball.
Lightning has shot down the aisle of an

221
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,540
airplane while I was in Florida.

222
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,380
Have you really enlightening on a flight
that was struck by lightning?

223
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:07,600
Whoa.
He was pink and it sounded like a giant

224
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,910
bb gun.
Hid a tin can.

225
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,243
Oh yeah.

226
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,560
You were in a plane that was hit by
lightning.

227
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,490
Yes.
Holy Shit.

228
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,860
That's intense.
It was very intense.

229
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:23,640
I was coming off of tour and I wanted to
get back to my very young son.

230
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,740
I told him I'd be there in the morning
when he woke up,

231
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,100
so I ended up going on this odyssey like
planes,

232
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:30,480
trains and automobiles,
you know,

233
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:31,550
trying to get to them.
Right?

234
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,370
Like I was like,
I will be there in the morning and it

235
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,950
was terrible weather.
It's just like the worst on the east

236
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,300
coast.
And we kept taking,

237
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,930
I think twice we took off and had to
land before we could get to our

238
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:45,690
destination and get in the plane and go
off again.

239
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,660
And me being a crazy mom,
I'm like,

240
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,240
how can I get there?
Um,

241
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,650
so I get on this plane and it's very
bad.

242
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,270
We're flying right through with
thunderstorm.

243
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,100
But I've,
I've flown so many times,

244
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,920
I've,
my parents took me a million places.

245
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,710
We traveled a lot when I was young,
so I've just been flying forever and we

246
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,570
were on this blame,
the lightning's going off and thunder

247
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:12,030
and we're rattling around and it's not a
very big plane.

248
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,040
And my seat mate,
I think,

249
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,430
I didn't know who he was,
but he seemed like a decent,

250
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:21,390
nice young man.
And like the lightening just hit the

251
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:24,570
plane.
You get this big Tang of the,

252
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,820
you know,
the shock of the electricity just

253
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,590
hitting it.
We drop about,

254
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,930
I don't know what,
I don't know what makes a big stomach

255
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,240
drop,
but we drop far.

256
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,030
It's like 25 feet.
I Dunno.

257
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,400
Just like Bam.
And this pink ball of electricity just

258
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:40,970
goes like whoosh down the aisle.
Okay.

259
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,860
In the center of the aisle.
He pukes I grab

260
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,810
and I did not let go of this change or
just puked like until we were,

261
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:52,854
you know,
like I just,

262
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,700
it took about,
you know,

263
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,530
10 minutes and then it was like,
uh,

264
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,990
but that was intense and I made it,
I was there in the morning when my son

265
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,360
woke up,
so that's awesome.

266
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,740
Yeah.
But it was incredible.

267
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:09,880
The pinkness of it is still really vivid
to my mind and the ball lightning.

268
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,180
It was,
it was a sphere that just came wishing

269
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:14,980
down the aisle.
Wow.

270
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,240
That's awesome.
Lots of crazy plane.

271
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,950
Almost crashed stories.
What else?

272
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,330
Uh,
there was a time that the engine was on

273
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:29,850
fire and I could see it that you could
see it on fire.

274
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

275
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,400
Where were you please don't say over the
ocean.

276
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,070
Yeah,
but not far.

277
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:41,071
We were just off outside of Boston.
We took off nighttime again after a show

278
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,940
trying to get home to my cat.
I mean this is like this dad,

279
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:48,520
his mom's story trying to,
um,

280
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,490
and it was night and I was looking at
the lights,

281
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,560
the sort of,
I forget what they call those orange

282
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:58,561
lights and it was over the bag and see
the water and we just weren't rising

283
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,920
quickly enough.

284
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,401
You know,
it just,

285
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:03,310
I was like why,
why aren't we gaining altitude?

286
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:05,290
What's going on?
You just didn't seem right.

287
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,510
And someone on my left,
I was in the last row and someone on my

288
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,990
left said something like the engine's on
fire,

289
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,180
whatever,
right as the captain comes on and says,

290
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,640
ladies and gentlemen,
we have a problem with one of the

291
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,950
engines.
We are going to have to make an

292
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,470
emergency landing.
Please remain in your seat.

293
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,650
And I look over and you can literally
see flames shooting out of the,

294
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,040
like it,
cause the,

295
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,290
the engine was about 10 rows ahead of
me,

296
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,400
but the sparks were visible behind,
you know,

297
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,680
because you're,
do you understand like the physics,

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,580
so like it's a long trail is sparks
coming out of that thing.

299
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:50,581
And so we get to the point where we're
going to make our like landing and to

300
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:57,310
see the flight attendants scared
shitless was not a fun experience.

301
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,660
I think that frightened me the most.
Like seeing their faces and we had to

302
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,740
get into the crouch position,
you know,

303
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,310
that position,
the brace yourself position.

304
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,610
And the captain came on.
I think the last thing he said,

305
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,060
which was not reassuring was please
brace for a very rough landing.

306
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:19,090
And I'm,
I'm thinking if you're crashing it

307
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,130
doesn't,
you can't say anything more than that

308
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,490
ladies and gentlemen.
You mean like that's it.

309
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,970
Please prepare for a very rough landing.
And what happened?

310
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:32,170
I know I'm like monologuing but like
what happened to my body at that moment

311
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,780
was I went into,
it's only happened twice in my life.

312
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,440
Full tremors,
like full body.

313
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,090
Do you know,
have you ever had that?

314
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,340
It's different than like nervous shaking
or cold shaking.

315
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:47,341
It's like full
and your body's just like completely

316
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:49,540
vibrating,
like at another frequency.

317
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,710
And I realized for the first time in my
life that I didn't care if I was dead

318
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,660
like in two seconds.

319
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,810
And I felt nothing.
It really upset me that my body,

320
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:03,230
my soft squishy body,
it was going to be like pinned into

321
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,310
metal bugged me.
Like I really thought like we're never

322
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,040
doing this again like this.
It just became very,

323
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,610
very real that my,
that I cared about this arm and I cared

324
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,900
about this lag and I didn't want like it
to be completely mangled and like stuck

325
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:20,990
in metal and we hit the,
we got the ground,

326
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:25,991
it was a very rough landing and there
were firetrucks going like 110 miles an

327
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:32,180
hour on either side of us spraying us
with the d accelerant or whatever that

328
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:37,040
is,
and suddenly like foam on the windows

329
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,160
and are you ready for this?
So it was not a fun thing,

330
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:44,450
but we survived and no one was harmed.
And then we had to get back on another

331
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,970
plane because I had to go home to see my
kids.

332
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,620
So he literally sat there and waited and
got right back on another plane and flew

333
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,630
home.
Well you probably be like,

334
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,670
what are the odds?
No,

335
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,050
I just,
I wanted to see my kid.

336
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,840
Right.
But like that was an intense,

337
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,200
you mean that thing you don't ever get
to experience us unless you're like a

338
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:06,980
combat person.
Like even if you're not conscious,

339
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't want this like all screwed up.
I don't want to be like mangled.

340
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,450
No one does.
And the reality of it was like right

341
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,510
there,
right there and I don't feel it anymore.

342
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
I'm just a stupid and reckless as I ever
was.

343
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,730
But like in that moment it was very real
to me.

344
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,564
You know?

345
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,030
Fuck,
I haven't had anything like that.

346
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,840
That's intense.
I don't know what's more intense getting

347
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,970
to hit by lightening or the fire.
They're both pretty fun.

348
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,360
The Cessna that lost power over the
Bermuda Triangle,

349
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,403
is that good?

350
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,550
You know what that is?
They think they think it's nitrogen

351
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:45,000
escaping from the sea floor.
They think there's trap nitrogen and

352
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,140
massive amounts,
you know,

353
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:51,141
cause there's a lot of like dead things
and decaying things like vegetation and

354
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,050
things like that.
And they trap nitrogen pockets and those

355
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:57,060
nitrogen pockets,
when they lift up,

356
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:00,450
they can go through the surface of the
water and up into the air.

357
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,510
And if a plane is flying into that is
methane.

358
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,760
Is it methane?
I say it wrong.

359
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah.
Because nitrogen is every second year.

360
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,750
Yeah.
So 84% of the air.

361
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,500
But I think there's something about it
being a giant pocket that you fly

362
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,460
through.
I might be wrong.

363
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,120
You're talking about the gap in the tech
tonic.

364
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,310
It's methane.
Yeah.

365
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,310
And it can like make a ship go down
because yeah.

366
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:24,300
Suddenly there's no downside.
There's no buoyancy for the ships and

367
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,260
also for planes.

368
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,041
It makes,
could be,

369
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:26,611
yeah.
Okay.

370
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:29,690
This is most explosions explaining it
for me to try it.

371
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,830
Yeah.
We can google.

372
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,800
Oh my God.
This is how we roll it.

373
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,950
I'm never leaving.
Come state.

374
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,560
You can come anytime you want.
This is incredible.

375
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,330
We can come and just talk about Ufo was
over a week.

376
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Oh my God.
This is incredible.

377
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,670
Explosions of trapped methane gas are
thought to account for the mysterious

378
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:46,800
critters in Siberia,
including this one.

379
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,780
Yeah.
And so they think that has to do

380
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,550
something with the Bermuda Triangle as
well.

381
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,510
So when biological tissue creates
methane and,

382
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:57,240
um,
when they have like massive amounts of

383
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,240
die off,
whether it's fish or whether it's plants

384
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,490
or things like that,
they think that some of that stuff gets

385
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:07,491
trapped in the bottom of the sea floor
and then escapes goes up to the surface,

386
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,680
makes boats sink and even can bring down
planes.

387
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,290
How did it make a plain because plain
flat,

388
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,460
Oh,
I dunno.

389
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,900
Really lost electricity.
What'd you hear that hear a plane lost

390
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,000
electricity.
And that's what I thought.

391
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh,
you were in it started again.

392
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,610
Oh,
that could've just been a shitty plane.

393
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,163
He was that much.

394
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,060
That sounds like a dried,
I'm sure that violet absolutely told us

395
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,080
that.
You know what I mean?

396
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,000
Like he's like,
ah,

397
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,020
get the,
the,

398
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,760
the stuff gets a little fritzy up here
over the Bermuda triangle.

399
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,460
We're buying it.
It's just a shitty lane.

400
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,930
And he didn't like the service or,
you know,

401
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,890
oh my God,
Joe,

402
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:44,820
you just killed my story.
I might be naive in believing that.

403
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,580
Like this whole thing

404
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:45,961
don't,
no,

405
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,690
it's just a shitty plane.
Could be shit.

406
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,040
They'll still play in the shitty.
Yeah.

407
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,090
Yeah.
That's what they think.

408
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,330
That's the most prevalent theory,
I would think.

409
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:57,360
You'd die if that bubble hit you just
from a lot of it,

410
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:57,961
right?
Yeah.

411
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,450
Maybe.
Have you ever seen those underwater

412
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:03,180
lakes of methane?
That's creepy.

413
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,930
All right,
so water underwater,

414
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,930
right?
Yeah.

415
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,140
Yeah.
No,

416
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:11,070
it's the ocean is amazing.
It's pretty bizarre that it's just right

417
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:13,020
there,
that it's essentially an alien world.

418
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,980
Like I've always said,
like the ocean is really like space,

419
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,060
like spaces like above us all the time,
but the ocean is kind of just like

420
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,410
space.
If it's right there,

421
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,330
you can go in and that's a whole nother
world.

422
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,850
It's like a whole nother world.
It's on our earth,

423
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,650
but we're just so used to it.
It's like,

424
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,910
Oh yeah,
let's go surfing.

425
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,140
Hey,
let's get in the boat.

426
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,870
Floating around some fucking alien
world.

427
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,060
It's right there.
It's filled with life.

428
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,020
All sorts of life.
That actually breeds water like yeah,

429
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,510
came from,
yeah.

430
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,340
Well,
I was talking about it with my,

431
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,350
Oh,
is that the lakes of methane underwater?

432
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,880
That's nuts.
It's so God damn,

433
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,580
that is crazy.
They're like,

434
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,150
I'm going to go by the lake.
I just took a run around the shore.

435
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,760
That doesn't even look real.
It's like they're going around silver

436
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,070
lake.
That's that email is just like cruising

437
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:01,410
around silver lake,
but it's a methane lake.

438
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,770
What was that movie where like is
probably a methane lake too,

439
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,150
but it's been in other ways.
Yeah.

440
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,160
What was that movie where there was
aliens underwater?

441
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,420
The abyss.

442
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,530
Oh yeah,
yeah,

443
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,363
yeah.

444
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,280
Drowned to survive any us to re assess
the tater.

445
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,960
Yeah.
Right,

446
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,780
and they were like aliens was assumed.
The shape of water.

447
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,490
What's it called?
Aliens and the deep,

448
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,740
hmm.
I think it's probably the best though.

449
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,080
I think it's the best and they were sort
of pink too.

450
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,000
They were the same colors.
My ball lightning.

451
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,250
Remember that pink from the,
yeah.

452
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,120
The only guy that ever talked to when I
was talking to this Ufo people that I

453
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:42,020
believed about,
Ufos was a guy who was that skin walker

454
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,610
ranch.
That whole area out there has a shitload

455
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,060
of Ufo sightings,
scanning locker,

456
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,010
ranch.
It's some place that

457
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,820
this Guy Robert Bigelow owns and he is
an,

458
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,150
what makes it compelling is he actually
is an aerospace investor and he's got a

459
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,490
company that makes all these parts and
shit for different spaceships and

460
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,770
different pods and things too.
Why?

461
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,570
Why does he do immune?
It's his business,

462
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,710
but he also owns this gigantic ranch in
Utah and we went out to visit them,

463
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,200
visit the ranch and visit some of the
people around there that,

464
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,570
and one guy that we talked to that lived
around there was just regular dude.

465
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,150
I think he worked in a factory,
just regular guy,

466
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,010
not crazy,
but super normal.

467
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,200
Like talk to him,
not a bullshit artist at all.

468
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,460
And he's telling me about this glowing
orb that came through the walls of his

469
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:34,180
house and,
and floated around inside of his living

470
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:36,640
room and kitchen and then took off
through the wall.

471
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,900
And I said,
ah,

472
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,500
like the way he described it,
I absolutely believe that he was telling

473
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,780
me the truth and I think that was ball
lightning.

474
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,410
I think we have it a lot in that area.
And so I think whatever the atmosphere

475
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,810
conditions in that area,
it's a frequent occurrence.

476
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:52,070
And because of that,
a lot of these people see things and

477
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,760
they start talking and then people start
looking for him and then they start

478
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,580
talking crazy and then people start
talking about like they were talking

479
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,920
about a bullet proof wolf that appeared
out of mist.

480
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,680
And like for real,
that was like an got that out front.

481
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,650
Oh,
the Werewolf greeter.

482
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

483
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,160
But this,
this guy was the only guy that made

484
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,040
sense and I think he saw ball lightning
just like you did.

485
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,630
How could it be on the ground?
Like that

486
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,120
could just happen,
you know,

487
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,950
if there's a storm conditions,
but it does,

488
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,680
it occurs not just up in the sky.

489
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,800
It occurs at low altitude as well.
Yeah,

490
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,090
they say ball.
They don't know why.

491
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:27,430
But apparently I talked to a scientist
about this.

492
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,430
He was telling me that lightning
shouldn't be possible.

493
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,850
Like there's,
there's shouldn't be enough power to

494
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,020
create lightning.
There's like,

495
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,460
if you do the calculations,
he's like,

496
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,640
but clearly we know it's true.
So what do we do about that?

497
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,980
We don't really know.
We don't know enough about lightening.

498
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:43,900
So when you describe ball lightning,
he's like,

499
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:46,030
well good fucking luck.
Who knows who,

500
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,980
what are the atmosphere?
We don't know enough about it.

501
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,240
Yeah.
We don't know what the conditions are

502
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:49,960
like what?

503
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,610
What does that mean?
There's not enough energy for

504
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:52,421
lightening.
They can't,

505
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,880
you can't marshal that much electricity
in the atmosphere.

506
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,470
I'm too stupid to repeat what he said
and have it make any sense.

507
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:02,340
But when he was describing it to me,
the way he was explaining it,

508
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,290
and I think I read it as well,
he was,

509
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,540
he was explaining and what I read was
that they don't really understand how

510
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:14,541
that much energy is produced in the sky
like that and that if you calculated

511
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,740
like what it would take to produce
that,

512
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,320
that shouldn't be possible.
Again,

513
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,543
I'm a moron.

514
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,560
No,
I,

515
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,930
I wished a real expert were here.
I wish I was like,

516
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:27,800
that's fascinating.
Yeah.

517
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,360
So he,
with this guy was described,

518
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:32,080
it was talking about ball lightning.
We were saying they don't know how to

519
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,730
recreate ball lightning.
They,

520
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,620
they have no idea what causes it.
But there are,

521
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:36,700
sure it's a real thing.

522
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,630
Wait,
we can't recreate ball lightning in a

523
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,090
lab environment.
I don't believe so.

524
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,950
That's crazy.
Yeah.

525
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,380
I don't think they can it.
You know,

526
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,230
you're right because we can't generate
that amount of power.

527
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,320
We literally can't gender,
I mean maybe with a bomb,

528
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:54,860
but we can't generate that.
I have no idea.

529
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,030
I think we can't.

530
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,370
Well,
I think that's what a lot of people are

531
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:59,770
seeing.
I think these people that see things and

532
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,380
then also the human imagination is so
fantastic.

533
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:04,840
Your memory's all fucked up.
Memory's terrible.

534
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,610
You know?
So you see something and then you

535
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,710
decided something different when you see
it.

536
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,540
I talked to another lady told me she saw
big foot and she wasn't a book.

537
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,150
She didn't seem like a bullshit artist.
She seemed like she was being a hundred

538
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,950
percent honest.
She didn't seem like she needed a ton of

539
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:20,230
attention.
She didn't seem crazy and I think she

540
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:23,050
saw bear.
I just think she saw a bear way in the

541
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:26,320
distance and she saw it very briefly
because it was the Pacific northwest and

542
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,580
trees are very dense,
thick.

543
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:30,070
She saw a big,
and it might even been on two legs,

544
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:33,850
cause bears do do that all the time.
And I think she saw that and in her mind

545
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,350
she saw a gorilla.
It was,

546
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:36,700
Whoa,
why am I looking at a gorilla?

547
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:40,330
And then she had this story that just
got concocted in her head and she saw

548
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,080
Saskia

549
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,190
that happens.
I mean,

550
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:42,890
I,
I,

551
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm convinced of certain things and then
I find out I'm completely wrong.

552
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,350
But you know,
it does happen.

553
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,720
I told you that you better back off the
ghost.

554
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,680
Um,
I used to believe a great deal.

555
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:58,681
I still pretty much believe pretty much,
I think basically this is my entire

556
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:04,621
philosophy on all weirdnesses okay.
If you look back 500 years to what they

557
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:08,290
knew scientifically,
then it's superstitious.

558
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,790
It's magic,
it's ridiculous,

559
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,040
it's ignorant,
et Cetera,

560
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,240
et cetera.
I believe that that's exactly what we

561
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:17,890
are now to 500 years in the future.
So I don't consider it paranormal.

562
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,520
I consider it future science goes her
future science,

563
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,760
go surf future science,
aliens or future science.

564
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:27,100
It's all future science.
And I'm down for that.

565
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,770
I'm ready to party with the future
science.

566
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm ready for that.
Accept that.

567
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,540
Um,
my problem is the people that tell ghost

568
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,700
stories or those fucking go shows,
there's so,

569
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,640
there's so faked,
so painfully faith.

570
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,430
I really believed it for a while.
Like I really absolutely bought into it.

571
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:46,380
Hook,
line and sinker.

572
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,850
I was like,
they're watching the little there,

573
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,470
the,
there's all different kinds of ghosts.

574
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:51,940
Like the ones that look like,
um,

575
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,620
he walks or none.
He walks,

576
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,580
which are the ones that are the jet,
the first movie star wars.

577
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:00,580
And they like where they're little robes
and they were busy.

578
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,320
They were like,
oh,

579
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,270
you know the first ones that loot,
they're like,

580
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,550
we're selling route robotics.
I don't know.

581
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:10,120
They didn't really have faces.
They just had like cloaks the robot

582
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,370
sellers.
Well apparently there are ghosts that

583
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:16,840
are little cloak creatures and they
scare the crap out of me.

584
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,240
They move fast and I don't understand
what they're doing here.

585
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,010
Like,
but I mean you can explain demons.

586
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:27,250
You can explain demons.
If you think about like dog ghosts or

587
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:30,880
wolf ghosts or lion ghosts,
that's a demon.

588
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,560
Could be,
they growl.

589
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:35,440
They have like weird eyes.
They're hostile.

590
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:38,020
They scratch you animal.

591
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,650
So you,
you have a real belief in ghosts.

592
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,900
The treanda kind of like not 100% but,
but you're,

593
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:49,020
you have an open wide bump into them
sometimes a week.

594
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,770
And I don't see them but I feel them and
hear them and that like,

595
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,050
I know,
go ahead.

596
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh little smile.
That little smile.

597
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:01,200
That's why we're talking about it.
Cause we're on the weirdness podcasts,

598
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,760
but like I don't talk about it cause it
just doesn't get a good response.

599
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,970
Blinded.
So when you bought,

600
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,890
I believe you,
you don't seem like a liar by any

601
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:10,910
stretch of the imagination,

602
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,640
but,
but I have a huge imagination.

603
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,030
I'm sure you do.
I could very easily have been tricking

604
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:18,760
myself into something.
What do you feel what happens?

605
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,930
Um,
I just bump into that and they just,

606
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,030
if you walk into a room,
I mean it happens maybe once a year.

607
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,250
Yeah.
And you walk into a room,

608
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:32,880
you walk somewhere or something's going
on and you just feel it and it's a very,

609
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:35,220
very strong and you,
I just,

610
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,820
I talked to them.
I just say like it mostly hotel rooms.

611
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,720
Let's just say if I'm in a hotel room on
tour and I led their move,

612
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,870
if I don't like it or I'll just say
alone in that room,

613
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:46,830
I'll be like,
hi,

614
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,230
I'm playing a show at,
so I'm only here for two days,

615
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:54,450
but I really need to get some sleep.
Um,

616
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,530
you can come to this.
I tell them they can come to the show if

617
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:58,120
they want.
I'm like,

618
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:01,750
this is what I do for a living.
And I try to like hear and think what

619
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:02,580
they do for a living.

620
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,500
I would be psyched if I was a ghost and
I found you.

621
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm like,
this chick's cool.

622
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,160
How do you want to scare?
Let her sleep,

623
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:10,090
man.
Let her sleep.

624
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,940
Fuck down.
I got the pots and pans ready to make a

625
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,010
racket.
Nah Man,

626
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,410
let her sleep.
She's cool.

627
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,480
It's go to the show.
I put 'em on my guest list.

628
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,240
He's got a plus one.
That's nice.

629
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,700
You don't have to reserve a seat for
everywhere.

630
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,810
Obviously you have an active
imagination.

631
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,890
And do you think that maybe your mind
fucking yourself at the time?

632
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,820
Like when you're saying,
well,

633
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,920
you're talking out loud,
are you doing it because it's comforting

634
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,933
because you enjoy it?

635
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,030
Probably,
but,

636
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,530
but if you asked me on a lie detector
test whether I think I really

637
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:47,100
encountered something,
I'd say yes for sure.

638
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,680
I mean,
there's been enough experiences in my

639
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:53,160
life that it just seems like just part
of future science.

640
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,010
Hmm.
There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrick,

641
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,470
he's a scientist and he believes that
things have memory.

642
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,690
He thinks that everything has memory
things.

643
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:03,970
That's why people don't want to live in
haunted houses.

644
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,740
You know?
Don't want to live in a house where

645
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,200
someone died.
He thinks that objects have memory.

646
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,080
They can't express it,
but that they have it.

647
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,070
I agree with that.
It might be.

648
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,293
We like,
we haven't,

649
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,940
I think it's less the object retaining
it.

650
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,710
I mean,
it must be retaining something.

651
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,810
I think it's more our psychic ability to
perceive the past.

652
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,760
Yeah,
that's what I think.

653
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,790
I think it's more like you see the chair
and then you can psychically feel what

654
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:36,410
happened in that chair.
I'm not really sure how to like,

655
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,700
you're not seeing the chair imbued with
some aura.

656
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,400
You're actually looking into the past.
Yeah,

657
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,760
that's what I think.
Cause I've had dreams that were like

658
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:47,010
prefiguring

659
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,930
I think you can dream if something's
impactful enough.

660
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,450
I think you can dream.
Okay.

661
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,220
Let's say something really bad happens
to you.

662
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,830
Imagine something horrible.
Okay,

663
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,820
I dunno,
this studio explodes

664
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:06,180
a couple months.
Maybe before then you might have a

665
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,080
dream.
Well,

666
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:09,390
let's just say something goes really,
really wrong or bad.

667
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,430
Nothing traumatic.
You might be able to have a dream ahead

668
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:17,970
of time.
That would be how you would synthesize

669
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,710
that traumatic experience.
Just as if it had happened before and

670
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:27,330
you were dreaming after the fact before
you've had that happen.

671
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,040
I have,
which I would happen with,

672
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,343
um,

673
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,730
I'm saving that for my book.
Is that okay?

674
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,350
It's okay.
But it was a very powerful,

675
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,320
very,
yeah,

676
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,560
absolutely.
Absolutely.

677
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,880
Absolutely good.
But it was very convincing to me and

678
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,550
hard to explain any other way.
Have you ever had any other sort of

679
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,040
psychic premonition?
Yes.

680
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,890
Yes.
Do you remember the last big fire we had

681
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:59,260
in la when it was like encroaching
recently?

682
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,263
Yeah,
that one.

683
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,000
Um,
the night before that fire I was out

684
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,160
walking with my son again,
my son,

685
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:08,470
he's like all over this podcast.
I don't know why,

686
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:10,840
cause he barely speaks to me at the
moment and he's like,

687
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:11,321
yeah,
yeah,

688
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,580
fine,
good talk to you later.

689
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,190
Um,
and I just felt incredibly uneasy and he

690
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:21,340
suffered from asthma when he was young
and really badly.

691
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:25,180
So when it would be when there was a lot
of particulate matter in the air,

692
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:29,920
or if it was just bad air conditions,
I would tend to be very worried about

693
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:34,921
him and keep him home or informed the
teachers or whatever it was just he'd

694
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,670
get really bad asthma attacks.

695
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,540
And so I have a predisposition to be on
the alert,

696
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,630
but this is the night before no fire had
started yet.

697
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,710
And I just was very anxious,
very anxious,

698
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:51,220
and I couldn't settle down.
And I couldn't think for months.

699
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,720
I hadn't been like that.
I mean,

700
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,490
and I said to him,
I'm like,

701
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,490
I don't know what it is,
but I feel kind of unsafe.

702
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,940
If something happens tomorrow,
you have to like,

703
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,020
you have to be my witness that I sensed
something was coming.

704
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:07,240
Now you probably think I'm this horrible
mother,

705
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:11,140
I never do this.
It happens like I think I've like said

706
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:14,650
that to him twice in our entire life and

707
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,820
I forgot about it and the next day I
forgot about it.

708
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,250
I didn't think about it at all until,
you know,

709
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:27,251
we were socked in in a sort of Brown
muck as we are and like the sun became

710
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:29,780
the eye of Sauron and ever,
you know,

711
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,870
everyone's like freaking out and we're
looking at all these images and I was so

712
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:36,470
distracted by all these images that I
completely forgot my sense the night

713
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:40,460
before and what I think that was until I
remembered it.

714
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:41,930
Then I called up and I'm like,
ah.

715
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,420
And I think it's more like,
I don't know something's coming,

716
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,730
but I have maybe time,
maybe the envelope with time is a little

717
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:57,290
bit more mushy than we think.
Maybe we perceive time is very orderly

718
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:00,890
and very linear,
but maybe it's really not.

719
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,030
And it could be pushing back like the
experience and maybe I had the

720
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,910
experience before I perceive the
experience or I don't know what that is,

721
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:09,800
but that happens to me a lot.

722
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,420
I've heard people describe,

723
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,590
well,
he likes hearing about it.

724
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,870
By the way,
I never talk about this stuff in my real

725
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,560
life because nobody likes it.
What do you mean it makes people

726
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:21,600
uncomfortable and they look at you
funny,

727
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,610
so I just never talk about it except for
on

728
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,000
the podcast.
What?

729
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,930
Why would it make them uncomfortable?
It just does.

730
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,930
I'm fascinated by that because I don't
experience it and I'm not,

731
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:34,090
I've never had a premonition that came
true,

732
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:39,100
but I do have a really good ability to
know if someone's crazy.

733
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,590
I'm really good at that.
Apparently I'm not.

734
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,573
No,
you're not crazy.

735
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,031
No,
I mean,

736
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:47,950
I don't know if someone's of crazy
people blind spot.

737
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,180
That's where he could pick out fires in
the distance,

738
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,450
but you can't pick out nuts.
Yeah,

739
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,490
that's it.
I don't have any psychic ability though.

740
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,893
I've just,
I think just,

741
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,670
I don't if you can tell if someone's
crazy or not,

742
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,860
you might have some,
I mean,

743
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:09,861
you might have some perception and it's
think it's pattern recognition and data

744
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:12,220
chunking.
Oh,

745
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:13,750
see,
I've met so many people.

746
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,500
Then when I see things that are off
little things that are off and you

747
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,150
probe,
like you're talking a little,

748
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:22,600
things are off more and you're like,
you see the looking into the eyes,

749
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:24,010
you see calculations,
you're like,

750
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,300
okay,
something's going on here.

751
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,190
This is not a,
he's not a normal person.

752
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,350
This is a person putting on a normal
mask.

753
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,870
Like there's something off here.
It just smells,

754
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,670
smells fishy,
you know?

755
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,740
I just think it's that.
I just think that we have them as

756
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,461
guests.
I mean,

757
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:38,240
are they are sitting across from you?
Oh yeah.

758
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,550
Yeah.
A bat shit crazy.

759
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:41,830
What are you doing?
I've had people on what I was sure they

760
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,680
were pilled up for sure.
I'm like talking to him like this

761
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,770
motherfucker's adderall to the gills.
Like what does it look like when they're

762
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,090
adderall?
There's have we were talking,

763
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,900
there's just something about the way the
talk to not really cut.

764
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,900
Liz Phair is it?
That's not what it's about.

765
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,400
It's not about me.
It's about the future.

766
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:56,110
It's about children.
It's about society.

767
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,550
What I'm trying to do is be an
entrepreneur.

768
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,440
I want to build businesses on.
They just start,

769
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,170
they just info wars.
Alex Jones,

770
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,200
we got him high and drunk and he was
talking about on the show.

771
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:09,820
Is that what goes down here and I like,
oh look at this.

772
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,670
I am in a den of inequity.
Like yes,

773
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,620
we've got some like that's some sudden
that's,

774
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,200
what is that?
Do you want some we could fire

775
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,250
God.
I don't know what will come out of my

776
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:19,250
mouth.
Good stuff.

777
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,940
Go prescribe.
Huh?

778
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,380
But those are like snoop dogg type
things,

779
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,790
right?
Those are like,

780
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,130
what do they call the joints?
Your backwoods?

781
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,140
No,
they just have a brown paper.

782
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:32,700
You don't have to have any.
Oh my God.

783
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:34,770
We're literally getting high right here,
Jamie.

784
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,390
Yes.
We do it all the time.

785
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,800
Seriously?
Yeah.

786
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:37,980
It was

787
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,610
a podcast.
You can do anything illegal.

788
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,060
Tiny hit.
Take a tiny hit.

789
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,680
There we go.
That's what I'm talking about.

790
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,110
It's definitely not crazy.
It's marijuana.

791
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,160
It's legal.
It's good for you.

792
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,910
It's a staple of civilization.
What will happen?

793
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,930
Nothing.
I don't know.

794
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,940
You'll say cool shit.
Cigarette stuff in it.

795
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,240
No,
that's a cigar leaf though.

796
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:57,990
No,
no.

797
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,590
It's all just brown paper.
No,

798
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,030
good.
I'm going to try this.

799
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,893
Oh,
settle.

800
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,030
Settle,
settle and see what goes down.

801
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,950
Yeah,
we smoked pot.

802
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,840
It's okay.
I smoke pot.

803
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,580
I'm sure you do.
You just did.

804
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,750
I just did it.
It's proof.

805
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:16,820
Does evidence people worried?
I mean,

806
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,620
if we had a casual drink,
you know,

807
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:20,790
if we had it set up a glass of whiskey
or something,

808
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,290
no one would care but marijuana like,
oh my God,

809
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,150
God,
it is weird.

810
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,910
It's like now it's okay.
Like now it's finally,

811
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,200
finally.
It's okay.

812
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Yeah,
fine.

813
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,350
I agree.
30 years of watching people drank really

814
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:33,640
sucked.
Yeah.

815
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,070
I was never much into alcohol.
No,

816
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,710
I prefer marijuana.
Yeah.

817
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,900
Well you're a sensitive person.
It makes you more sensitive.

818
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,910
Marijuana does.
Sure.

819
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,893
Really?
I think so

820
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,760
for sure.
It makes you more aware,

821
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,280
more,
um,

822
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,640
consider it thinking about more
possibilities.

823
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:53,560
I mean that's what people call paranoia
really.

824
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,410
It's like a lot of times people live
with blinders on and marijuana just

825
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:57,244
comes along and goes,
hey,

826
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,420
let's just take those over and uh,
puts a spotlight and like,

827
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,590
look at the back of your brain.
Whoa,

828
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,740
look at this shit you're hiding.

829
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,050
That's exactly right.
It is.

830
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,300
It's like shining a flashlight into your
unconscious.

831
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:09,540
Like,
did you do what's back there?

832
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,160
I'm like,
oh cool.

833
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,900
Let's get a look at it.
Let's talk to it.

834
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,450
That is what the paranoia is.
I agree with that.

835
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:20,870
It's like people suddenly are like self
conscious.

836
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,940
They see themselves in a new way and
they're like,

837
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,470
I can't handle this.
Yeah.

838
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,490
That's like 40 years of denial.
Denial.

839
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,120
Yeah.

840
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,050
And,
and all these different mechanisms that

841
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,020
you've kind of like psychological
mechanisms that you've utilized.

842
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:40,220
Try to hide these thoughts from yourself
or try to skip past them really quickly.

843
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,870
Oh,
I've got that under control and just get

844
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:44,130
past it and move on to some new thing.
That's a,

845
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,340
that's a common thing.
People love to do it.

846
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,090
Oh,
that's crazy.

847
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,351
I do.
I feel,

848
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,850
I feel like mellow.
Yeah,

849
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,930
it's good.
I like that.

850
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,460
Good.
Still knocked my energy down.

851
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:57,410
Just a nice nice amount.
Puts you in a condo and I need like a

852
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,630
about 10% energy knockdown,
right?

853
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Maybe 15% yeah,
like a half a hit.

854
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,450
That's what you need.
Like just a little,

855
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,240
just where you're like,
okay.

856
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,800
Yeah,
fine.

857
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,260
Pause,
beat.

858
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,120
Everything's fine.
Fine.

859
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,030
I like that salt lamp.
That's the biggest one I've ever seen.

860
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,880
That's the biggest one would be fine,
but it's um,

861
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,280
it's too big.
They don't look as cool as a small ones

862
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:24,310
because the small ones,
there's not as much salt to the light

863
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:26,890
comes through more.
It's one of those things.

864
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,670
It looks cool on paper and then you'd
get it.

865
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,780
I don't think that's cool.
Got The awesome skull there of the long

866
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,250
horn that is an Asian water

867
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,880
buffalo.
Is it friend Adam Green tree shot in

868
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,440
Australia.
That's really cool.

869
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,140
Yeah.
He brought it from Australia for me when

870
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,000
he was a guest on the pocket and just
fly that.

871
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,310
He just put it in a carry on.
No.

872
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,640
Okay.

873
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,460
You imagine weight and it wasn't even
boiled down yet.

874
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,240
It was just the head
blood flies.

875
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,580
Exactly like putting an overhead mic
check it.

876
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,650
It'll fit.
It'll fit.

877
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,110
I don't know if you wrapped it up,
he must've because he wouldn't want the

878
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:07,150
bones to crack or break.
Get knocked around,

879
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,510
but he's being wrapped it up.
Yeah.

880
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:09,910
That's pretty dope.
Yeah.

881
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:12,200
He's a wild man.
Bow Hunter and he,

882
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,370
he goes up to the northern area of
Australia,

883
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,110
Australia,
all the animals.

884
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,510
Essentially.
The large mammals are all invasive

885
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:23,290
species so they have to hunt them cause
they don't have predators so he goes up

886
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,660
there and shoots water buffalo and the
bone arrow.

887
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,930
That's cool.
I respect that as opposed to other types

888
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:35,410
of hunting.
I really respect the idea of like mono e

889
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:36,340
mono,
right.

890
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,160
Going out there and be like,
what don't you respect?

891
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,770
Like just don't go kill them big.
Yeah.

892
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:47,170
Trophy hunting can fuck off entirely.
It's a weird thing.

893
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,200
It's weird that it's almost like

894
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,560
people hunted entirely for food and then
they got enough food and they go,

895
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,320
I don't want to shoot that thing too.
You know?

896
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,720
It's like they got into shooting things
and it became a thing of not just

897
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,550
shooting stuff for food but shooting
stuff.

898
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,700
Even if you can't justify it.
Like there's some animals,

899
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:06,534
like,
um,

900
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,390
there's certain haunts that they put on
where they kind of have to control

901
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:11,910
populations of these things,
like grizzly bears and stuff like that.

902
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:16,320
When they started encroaching.
Even wolves are certain populations of

903
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:18,540
wolves they have to control.
And then in the northwest,

904
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,410
but you get to like elephants and
tigers,

905
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,600
lions and like,
what are you doing?

906
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,140
What are they doing?
What are your a man?

907
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:28,670
Explain that to me.
What is,

908
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,270
what is what,
why does that make you feel important

909
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,390
since you had a gun?
I mean a gun,

910
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,420
you stand back,
you sit in the bushes for,

911
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:40,730
I dunno,
eight 12 hours and then you pull the

912
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:41,250
trigger

913
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,720
does,
it doesn't even necessarily make them

914
00:40:42,721 --> 00:40:45,240
feel important.
It's just because they can do it.

915
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,410
And this,
it's exciting.

916
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,750
Like if you were shot a rifle.
Yeah,

917
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,190
yeah.
We go to the rifle range.

918
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,740
It's exciting.
It's fun to just shoot paper,

919
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,600
put paper targets out there and shoot
them.

920
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,010
It's fun.
It feels good.

921
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,490
There's something about like aiming boom
and hitting where you want it to go.

922
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,870
It's exciting.
Yeah.

923
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,470
And so once that,
and there was a real problem is in

924
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:09,990
Africa it becomes incredibly profitable
for the people that live there.

925
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,620
And then those animals are thriving
because they protect them and have

926
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:15,690
hunters come in and pay shitloads of
money to hunt them.

927
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:19,000
So their numbers are really healthy,
which is really crazy.

928
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:23,460
It's cause like for the longest time,
most of the animals in Africa that are

929
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:27,420
hunted now in,
in plentiful numbers were on the verge

930
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,254
of extinction.

931
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,930
Let me start out of them.
Still are.

932
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:32,510
I mean maybe not extinction,
but I don't think that they have an

933
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:34,770
abundance the big five over there and
yeah,

934
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,541
depends on,
yeah,

935
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,880
well it depends on where you are,
but Africa obviously it's fucking huge.

936
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,310
Inversely what it looks like when you
took,

937
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,290
but America inside of Africa,
it's like sits over in the SAR up.

938
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,010
It's like it just sits in this tiny
little bitch ass country.

939
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,920
But in Africa there's many animals that
were 20 years ago on the verge of

940
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:57,290
extinction that are thriving and it's
because of hunting.

941
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,140
Since some of it makes sense in a tiny
little zone,

942
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,080
I mean they're not driving by.
It drove all numbers.

943
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,630
There's the other problem I have with
people calling the,

944
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,860
a lot of the people that hunt over
there,

945
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:09,120
poachers,
they call it like poachers.

946
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:11,210
The poachers poaching me.
That's just people who are poor.

947
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,910
That's all it is.
It's just like incredibly poor people

948
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,160
that are trapping these animals.
And some of them,

949
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,260
like if they're shooting rhinos and
stuff like that,

950
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,390
they're now,
they're not doing it because they're

951
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:21,890
evil.
They're doing it because they're fucking

952
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,120
desperate.
I mean they

953
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,250
are,
that is their game.

954
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,920
I mean it belongs to them.
It's their country.

955
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,260
It's their game if you believe people
and animals.

956
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,123
Yeah,
but,

957
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,780
but I think as as everything,
it's like depending on your perspective,

958
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,820
how much of,
just like we were talking about when you

959
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:42,650
get high and suddenly your territory
expanse of what your awarenesses,

960
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,050
same difference.
Like this is their country,

961
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:47,690
this is their,
these are their native population of

962
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,750
animals.
So it's there,

963
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,950
but like taking in a broader scope that
should be utterly protected and

964
00:42:55,071 --> 00:43:00,071
expanding territory rather than like a
little theme park for rich Westerners to

965
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:02,840
come in and shoot shit.

966
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,873
Yeah.
It's weird.

967
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,920
Have you ever seen a low,
do you know Louis Theroux is,

968
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:11,730
is there a documentarian from the UK?
He's got a great special that he did or

969
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:17,590
we went over to one of those wild game
parks is stay with these Weirdos and

970
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,510
these a rich American people that go
over there,

971
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:23,050
shoot shit and he was over there for
like weeks and finally just drove the

972
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:26,350
got crazy until the guy was just like
breaking it down to him.

973
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:29,080
What's really going on.
It was basically just saying in this

974
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:31,090
crazy accent,
Africa is fucked.

975
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,910
This is what you have to understand.
Africa is fucked.

976
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,810
This African guys explain it to him like
this is the only way these things are

977
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:40,060
going to survive.
If you think that you're going to remove

978
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:43,030
these fences and remove the profit,
right.

979
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,090
These people gonna come in and slaughter
these things and they're not going to

980
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,500
think at all about the future.

981
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,710
They're not going to think at all about
preserving the populations or them going

982
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,880
extinct.
I don't think about it at all.

983
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,700
They're just going to wipe them out.
Just like they are doing with Rhino

984
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,340
Horn.
They know rhinos are worth thousands and

985
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,350
thousands of dollars a horn,
so they just shoot those fucking things.

986
00:43:59,351 --> 00:44:00,670
They don't care.
They don't live there.

987
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,250
Their children are starving.
If they find out that they could sell

988
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:06,310
this Rhino Horn and get x amount $100 or
whatever,

989
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,930
they give them for it,
they're just shoot it.

990
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,780
Like that's their concern is not for
rhinos.

991
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,290
They're concern is for their family or
they're an extreme poverty.

992
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,140
Yeah.
I mean the,

993
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,260
the poverty that they have over their
spooky,

994
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,720
you know,
and in mass mass,

995
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,720
I have a buddy of mine who makes wells
for the pygmies in the Congo,

996
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,180
in the Congo,
and he goes over there all the time.

997
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,220
And uh,
he's actually a fighter.

998
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,530
He's a,
he fights for Bella.

999
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:31,500
He's one of their top heavyweights.
And he spends like three to months a

1000
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,620
year in the Congo,
got caught malaria three times and

1001
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,230
animal it's made,
it's justin wren is a beast.

1002
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,570
Such a,
such a sweet,

1003
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,020
amazing person.
But he goes over there and he says,

1004
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,570
you,
you can't believe the kind of poverty he

1005
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:48,450
sleeps in a grass hat grass house when
he's there,

1006
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:50,400
just like they do these,
you know,

1007
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,660
they sleep on the F,
they have,

1008
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,190
you know,
nope floors.

1009
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,110
This is him over there.
That's him with the people.

1010
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,010
I mean,
he's a just a leafs that they put on the

1011
00:44:59,011 --> 00:44:59,850
roof,
I don't know,

1012
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,690
just lease from some local plants that
they use to make their houses,

1013
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,910
but he,
you know,

1014
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,380
when he tells you what it's like over
there and the extreme poverty,

1015
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,490
and most of these people were dying
because of waterborne diseases.

1016
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,760
So He created this charity called fight
for the forgotten.

1017
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,870
And he goes over there and they build
wells and they've built a ton of wells.

1018
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,940
We actually contribute to it.
And we,

1019
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:25,950
um,
there's one of our sponsors,

1020
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,040
the cash app.
They,

1021
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,650
every time you sign up for it,
they give $5 to these people.

1022
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,933
Yeah.
It's amazing.

1023
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,800
I mean,
clean water is the most essential.

1024
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,210
Yeah.
What a brilliant,

1025
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,280
well,
there's a company called water for water

1026
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:41,160
for.org water.
And the number for those people are

1027
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:41,994
also,
uh,

1028
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,310
connected with him.
And they just do this everywhere.

1029
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,860
They do this all over impoverished
countries.

1030
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,490
Go there and just dig wells.
You could change the whole thing because

1031
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:52,200
all these people,
they have distended bellies because

1032
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:55,140
they're filled with parasites and they
have all these waterborne diseases and

1033
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,070
they're just,
yeah,

1034
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,740
girls don't go to school cause they
spend all day walking to the water

1035
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,560
source.

1036
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,110
Well nobody goes to school.
There was the pygmies like it's,

1037
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,550
they're incredibly uneducated.
I mean it and then unrepresented and not

1038
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,060
respected or appreciated and
discriminated against.

1039
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:13,570
And you know,
this is why this guy who's just just big

1040
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:16,330
hulk of a man says,
this is what I'm a concentrate on these,

1041
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,210
these small forgotten people.
It's really pretty amazing.

1042
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,610
That must be so rewarding just to see
the difference he's making.

1043
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,770
Yeah.
I always feel like such a loser whenever

1044
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:27,630
I hang around with it.
I'm worried about what I'm gonna eat for

1045
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,550
lunch.
He's quiet of the fucking car and go to

1046
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:33,720
catch malaria for the fourth time.
He said it three times.

1047
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:36,270
That's crazy.
It's fucking not so shit kills people.

1048
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,580
Doesn't he just get the shot?
What's the deal?

1049
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,540
Can totally stop it.
The problem is when you get it,

1050
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,990
once it stays in your system,
he's gotten it again.

1051
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:52,220
When he got a cold like herpes,
like he got it again when he got a cold.

1052
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,430
Is that true?
Malaria stays in your cells run to him.

1053
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,020
Yeah.
He got it when he wasn't even over

1054
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:58,160
there.
God,

1055
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,960
yeah.
And um,

1056
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,190
I think you're changing my idea about my
Nile trip that I want to take my pocket

1057
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,971
list,
smile trip.

1058
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:07,970
I want to get one of those big house
both things with like,

1059
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:10,520
have you ever seen him?
They're like double deckers and then

1060
00:47:10,521 --> 00:47:15,520
they have the top thing and it's just
like a bunch of sort of like games

1061
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,550
zones.
Like you just like,

1062
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,421
you know,
cool.

1063
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:20,560
Let ons chairs with like covering it.
It's all very open air.

1064
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,630
It just feels like you'd be having
cocktails up there at sunset,

1065
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,580
walking around,
talking to all your family and friends

1066
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,000
that do it.
Like one of those European,

1067
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,960
here's what else I'd do.
I'd make sure I had like a security boat

1068
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:32,640
behind me.

1069
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,850
Ah,
for the kidnappers and shit.

1070
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,650
I'd have my little security about what
that was like a really zippy fast one,

1071
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,633
you know.

1072
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,950
Good.
You would definitely need that for sure.

1073
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,200
Yeah.
A fucked up place though.

1074
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,600
Crocodiles alone.
I have a friend who went over there.

1075
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,200
Um,
he has a show called the uncharted where

1076
00:47:55,201 --> 00:47:59,460
he just travels all over the world and
it goes to these adventures and they

1077
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,180
flew him into this,
I think it was the Congo because this

1078
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:06,060
local village was having a problem with
the people.

1079
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:10,200
They're getting eaten by crocodiles and
everyone in the village is like missing

1080
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:11,560
an arm.
They'll bites,

1081
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:12,990
taken out of their legs.
Oh yeah.

1082
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,360
These poor people.
I mean they live,

1083
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,070
this is the only place where the water
is,

1084
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:18,720
they have to go.
They're leaving create these little

1085
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,700
fences where they,
um,

1086
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,360
they like try to fence in the area so
the crocodiles can't get to that spot.

1087
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,450
They still get in there somehow and fuck
these people up because they've gotten

1088
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:28,470
accustomed to eating them.

1089
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,620
Oh No.
Oh No.

1090
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,310
Just territorial.
Oh No,

1091
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:32,941
no,
no.

1092
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:35,100
Like a waterhole tension.
Well,

1093
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:37,710
animals are like,
they're opportunists.

1094
00:48:37,711 --> 00:48:40,740
And once they decide that your food,
that's when it becomes a real problem.

1095
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:43,110
So there's really like man eating
crocodiles.

1096
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,550
Oh yeah.
Well there's,

1097
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:46,380
there's definitely man,
any crocodiles.

1098
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,000
Is this Jim shockey?
Yeah,

1099
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:50,010
this is my friend Jim.
And this guy is missing.

1100
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah,
it's in Mozambique.

1101
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,210
This guy's missing and hand disguise.
Missing his whole arm.

1102
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,290
The fence will no wonder they that's in
the gym.

1103
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,270
He's a lovely Canadian fellow who
travels everywhere.

1104
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,050
So they,
they've,

1105
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,590
he's a hunter and they flew him in to
kill these crocodiles for them.

1106
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,330
Nice.
It's crazy.

1107
00:49:06,331 --> 00:49:07,350
I mean,
look at that fucking thing.

1108
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:11,580
You imagine you're living right there
and there's just God damn dinosaurs

1109
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,280
everywhere.

1110
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,900
No.
And furthermore,

1111
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,850
if you can,
if you can get rid of the,

1112
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,340
I don't know,
it must be a learned behavior because

1113
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:19,830
most crocodiles aren't doing that.

1114
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,600
It's just that they're near people.
They'll,

1115
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,820
they,
their brains are so small and there's

1116
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:26,040
so,
so reptilian that what?

1117
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,450
Well,
they're just trying to do is eat.

1118
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,880
And if it's a moving,
they're going to try to eat it.

1119
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,280
And if it's a person solid,
they're targeting people,

1120
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,010
but they found out that they can get
peach row crocodiles.

1121
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,140
I don't think they're just going to eat
any old thing.

1122
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,300
I think they eat everything they can eat
their giant.

1123
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,980
Talking about 1800 pound lizard,
that's been the same.

1124
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,620
It's exactly the same form for 60 plus
million years.

1125
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,100
You could say the same about sharks and
they don't just go eat you.

1126
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,780
They would if they could,
if they just decided to start eating

1127
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:55,400
with the parks and the people.
Yeah.

1128
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,090
People eat get eaten by sharks.
No,

1129
00:49:58,091 --> 00:49:59,650
they don't.
They don't ever,

1130
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,860
no one's ever been eaten by sharks.
Generally they're eating like very

1131
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:05,800
occasionally know Reiki or not eaten by
sharks.

1132
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:10,450
Generally checks don't have a taste for
our blood is what you're saying.

1133
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:10,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

1134
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,460
We're not on the menu.
We're not on the menu,

1135
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,640
but they will eat us.
They will bite you to get you out of

1136
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:18,730
their zone or they might mistake you and
bite you.

1137
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,680
They you cause they think you're
something else but they don't.

1138
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,320
You're saying eat,
which means like you sit down and you

1139
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:24,610
finish the meal.
Right.

1140
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,800
I think that rarely happens.
Usually they just bite you in half and

1141
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:29,480
just get a follow up.
This tastes like shit.

1142
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:33,170
Am I gonna find a seal zone?
You know?

1143
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:35,200
And like I know there's some

1144
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,720
animals that actively target people and
it becomes a giant problem.

1145
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:41,150
Like in India,
in India there's this river,

1146
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,910
this place called the cinder bands and
the bull sharks.

1147
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,661
No,
no.

1148
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:48,260
These are tigers.
It pulls bull sharks are very aggressive

1149
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,390
and they do kill people,
but these aren't tiger sharks there.

1150
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:51,860
Tigers,
just the cat.

1151
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,320
They kill a lot of people.
Yeah.

1152
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,640
The shit out of you.
Yeah.

1153
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,710
No.
Sit down and like put the Napkin in

1154
00:50:58,711 --> 00:51:01,590
their color and get like there.
Yeah.

1155
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,360
Well the actively hunt people in this
one place and they've been doing it for

1156
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,330
hundreds of years.
They've,

1157
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,910
they said over the last 200 years,
300,000 people have been killed by

1158
00:51:09,911 --> 00:51:12,480
tigers in the cinder bands.
Yup.

1159
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,730
Over the last 200 years,
300,000 people who have been killed by

1160
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:20,050
tigers.
I don't know what to do with that

1161
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:22,240
number.
It's implausible is insane.

1162
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,770
It's just so common.
First of all,

1163
00:51:23,771 --> 00:51:25,540
India has a billion people,
right?

1164
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,110
And a lot of them are really poor and
they live in by these rivers and these

1165
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:33,130
cats are everywhere and it's tall grass.
You've ever seen that video of the cat,

1166
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,130
that giant tiger leaping up and
attacking the guy when he's on an

1167
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:37,550
elephant?
No.

1168
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,290
This is shows.
Yeah,

1169
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,360
we'll shows you pull it up to me.
It shows you how crazy India is.

1170
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:50,770
This guy's on top of an elephant and
he's walking this elephant through this

1171
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:55,120
grass and this tiger runs through the
grass and leaps up in the air and fucks

1172
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,050
my boys on this elephant.
I shouldn't laugh,

1173
00:51:58,051 --> 00:51:59,430
but it's kind of funny.
It's like,

1174
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:01,320
it's kind of funny.
What a hell of a tiger

1175
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,840
there.
They're insane.

1176
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,280
I mean,
if a tiger was in a movie as a monster,

1177
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:07,260
it'd be what?
We want to scare his monsters ever this

1178
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,240
on youtube.
Oh yeah.

1179
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:10,270
We can't play it on youtube,
but just everyone knows what it is.

1180
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,430
Yeah,
don't pull it down because somebody owns

1181
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,450
this.
They have a copyright.

1182
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,670
So here's the guy.
So he's on top of this elephant.

1183
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:20,990
Now look at the grass and they spot it.
And then the thing,

1184
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:21,824
yeah.

1185
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,530
Wow,
whoa.

1186
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,940
Yep.
It is on.

1187
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,940
Oh my God jumps

1188
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,490
and it's going after him.
It knows that he's up there.

1189
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:32,001
Look at it.
It's like,

1190
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:32,834
bitch.

1191
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,550
Well,
if I were the elephant,

1192
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,190
I just messed that tiger up.
Tore the guy's arm apart.

1193
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:39,350
The elephant didn't really give a fuck.
It's just hanging out.

1194
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,610
I looked the elephants like,
whatever,

1195
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:42,290
bitch.
Tigers can't kill me.

1196
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,710
Even outside,
just stomp on it.

1197
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,620
Pretty sure tigers don't kill elephants,

1198
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,070
but lions do.
And when lions do,

1199
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,800
they're really hungry and they get a
bunch of them and they gang up

1200
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,800
upon an elephant.
Okay.

1201
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:56,120
Don't talk about,
because you're going to talk about the

1202
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:58,400
baby elephants that get ganged up on
first.

1203
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,290
Oh,
not even necessarily babies.

1204
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,990
They'll take out a real elephant.
Well,

1205
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,430
not if it's with the herd.
What is this?

1206
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,220
Trying to save a goat woman fights off
tiger with a stick.

1207
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,730
Let the goat girl cry slowly.
It's a fucking girl.

1208
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,680
The kangaroo punching ones.
Those.

1209
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,700
That's my name.
That dude,

1210
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:21,701
I want to marry that dude.
You know,

1211
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,460
it's like trying to figure it out.
Awesome.

1212
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,050
Right?
People were mad at that guy.

1213
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,450
He's so cute.
But if you're an animal lover,

1214
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,210
Kangaroos fucking up his dog.
Kangaroos,

1215
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,930
those male kangaroos fight all the time.
They're always like punching.

1216
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:39,370
That was just like a really fun,
this is the guy.

1217
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:44,040
He's going to get his dog.
So I would do the same thing cause it's

1218
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,980
got the dog because this guy is so
awesome,

1219
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,913
so weird.

1220
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,840
They don't even seem real.
They seem to human.

1221
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,913
Yeah,
look at that.

1222
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,440
Here we go.
Thinking about it.

1223
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,810
Bam.
It's like,

1224
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,290
yeah bitch.
I just love the kangaroo does not know

1225
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:02,110
what to do.
He's like,

1226
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,370
am I supposed to fight you?
He's so cute.

1227
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:06,930
I was like fuck this.
What a weird animal.

1228
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:09,390
But it bounces off like that when two
legs guy though,

1229
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:10,530
right?
Oh yeah,

1230
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,870
for sure.
And also that he didn't follow up.

1231
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,110
What do you think they were?
What was it doing like just fighting it

1232
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:19,520
or playing with a dog was barking.
The kangaroo decided to grab a hold of

1233
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,080
dog and get him in a headlock and that's
what they do.

1234
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:26,580
Which is
generally giving you time to react a

1235
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:29,400
different way.
That's giving you a moment to not

1236
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,080
escalate.
Yes,

1237
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,230
sure.
If you see the beginning of the video,

1238
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:36,570
he's running around this kangaroo,
he thinks he's hunting.

1239
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,010
He thinks he's like alerting his company
in the car to target.

1240
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,750
Right.
If you don't even seem like a real

1241
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:44,970
animal,
they seem like something from an avatar

1242
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:45,581
movie.
Right.

1243
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:50,010
You want to cuddle with them all.
When I see like all I want is to take

1244
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:54,870
them all home and just cuddle with them.
Guy Punched him right in the face too

1245
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,390
early.
You know that for on their bellies.

1246
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:01,060
Really like,
dude,

1247
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,910
that's a duty I don't see.
I don't see,

1248
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,480
he's not as big as,
I think that's a woman.

1249
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,330
It might be because she's not very big.
That also makes sense to that.

1250
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:12,300
That's what that pouches,
where the tummy,

1251
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,550
what's,
I think there's a little thing right

1252
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:16,010
there.
It says something,

1253
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,900
that little thing hanging down there
like a penis.

1254
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,830
Now the tails back here.
No,

1255
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,840
that can't be the penis.
Huge Penis.

1256
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,110
Come on.
Where's the balls bouncing around?

1257
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:33,030
There it is.
Maybe that's just like the curtain for

1258
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,070
the vast,
very developed kangaroo.

1259
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:38,130
He's not going to win many fights.
He's sort of a Beta there,

1260
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,170
right?
There's some giant Kangaroos.

1261
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,540
Those big scary one.
So get this one knocking on the door.

1262
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,110
Hey Man.
Hey Man,

1263
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:48,630
look at the clause and those funds.
That's what I'm saying.

1264
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:51,360
When you put the dog in the headlock,
he could easily have taken care of that

1265
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:52,390
dog.
But he didn't.

1266
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,870
He like,
he kept the head.

1267
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:56,460
He was like,
I'm shutting this down.

1268
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:59,340
I really think we're mis-gendering.
I think we're mis-gendering that

1269
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:00,780
kangaroo.
Like it's a girl.

1270
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,450
It looks like a dude.
See Look,

1271
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,540
the difference you see his car,
maybe kangaroo chases people cause

1272
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:12,960
that's muscles.
Is it really chasing people?

1273
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,040
Yeah,
cause it has muscles.

1274
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,310
Maybe it's a female.
That guts does a lot of crossfit.

1275
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,760
The secret life of golfers.
Like there's,

1276
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,220
there's crocodiles on the golf courses,
there's Kangaroos.

1277
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,130
What else is like going on for those
guys?

1278
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,890
Lightning.
Oh yeah.

1279
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,190
Golfers die.
Golfers.

1280
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,320
They're holding onto a piece of metal.
Yeah.

1281
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,610
How many golfers die every year from
lightening strikes?

1282
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,570
I say happened to somebody I know or my
parents knew I was there when it

1283
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:42,580
happened.
He died and there was like a,

1284
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,250
they were all in the clubhouse and he
must have stepped outside cause he

1285
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,930
thought nothing would have happened.
And Yeah,

1286
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,720
lightning struck.
Why used to hear about that all the

1287
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:50,470
time,
right?

1288
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,590
Like people would have to come home.
And how many people do you think Liz

1289
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,000
phair take?
Guess what?

1290
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,320
Every year.
Number every year.

1291
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,960
Well,
I'm going to go with strikes over

1292
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,470
deaths.
I wasn't going to go straight.

1293
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,010
I'm going to say strikes.
I'm going to say there's about

1294
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,150
struck by lightning.
At least a couple hundred,

1295
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,410
couple hundred regular golfers.
Just Golf.

1296
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,580
Just golfers.

1297
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,710
Ooh.
Ooh,

1298
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,170
Ooh.
I'm going to go with worldwide Knight's

1299
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:18,070
states.
Just United States.

1300
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,630
It seems unfair.
Okay.

1301
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:21,070
Worldwide.
Worldwide.

1302
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,020
I'm going to go with
25 I like it.

1303
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,330
I was gonna,
I was gonna say 23 worldwide.

1304
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,980
I say three strikes.
These are not jeff average.

1305
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:37,850
51 annual lightning strike fatalities
over the last 20 years on your estimate.

1306
00:57:37,851 --> 00:57:40,390
And we worry about that.
And the second visit is one a year,

1307
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,590
but how many of those guys are golfers?
That's what I typed in action that are

1308
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,780
assholes with a kite with a key hanging
off of it.

1309
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,610
I type thing.
How many golfers die each year from

1310
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:50,020
lightening,
but how many people,

1311
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,210
how many people are cooking cello?

1312
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,830
Right?
You go 5% of the annual ones happened on

1313
00:57:56,831 --> 00:58:01,831
golf courses.
So 5% of equity one is like estimated 10

1314
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,240
to two and a half.
Something like that.

1315
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:05,463
Not a lot.
Yeah.

1316
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,590
Yeah.
I said three.

1317
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:11,591
He missed how bad I am at math.
One is

1318
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,210
10 there's no way you're as bad as me.
That's pretty bad.

1319
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,410
I'm bad.
I'm very bad.

1320
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,780
I think that's inherited.
Two.

1321
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,630
My kids suck at math too.
I figure if you don't have to like if

1322
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:27,990
you can look it up easily like names,
dates,

1323
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,100
math.
Yeah.

1324
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,860
I don't think you have to remember.
Well that's what I'm saying to my kids.

1325
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:33,450
I'm like,
look,

1326
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,680
you see the phone calculator,
we'll learn how to do that.

1327
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,590
I'm delegating,
delegating that to Google.

1328
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,910
Let Google figure it out.
Trusting Google,

1329
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,590
trust in your overlords.
Lifting.

1330
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,770
I'm going to do like the big picture,
you know,

1331
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,030
trust in your overlord.
All these little Gizmos.

1332
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,470
What is that is a clock made by tgt
studios.

1333
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:57,430
It's a guy who's a,
he's an artist and he makes these things

1334
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,340
all lot of it's all handmade out of
wood,

1335
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:05,290
walnut and he gets these Russian.
What are those things called?

1336
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,270
Those things that are inside of it.
[inaudible]

1337
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Nixey tube and that's how he gets it to
read the numbers and shit.

1338
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,400
What does it mean?
Is it just one 47 it's the time.

1339
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:22,640
One 47 and 46 seconds.
He's bad ass.

1340
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,510
He does a lot of really cool shit.
He's a craftsman.

1341
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,780
He does a lot of like really fascinating
stuff.

1342
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,720
You got his instagram page,
tgt studios.

1343
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,070
Do you ever check Daily Mail for like
the hideous side of life?

1344
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:39,310
I checked the Internet for the hideous
side of life.

1345
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,960
What do you,
what are you checking?

1346
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,290
I do check Daily Mail.
It's like my horrible and I disguise

1347
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:49,340
myself every time I do.
There's a dude's website.

1348
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,150
Pretty Dope,
right?

1349
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,200
Yeah,
it is really cool.

1350
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,600
Yeah,
it makes cool stuff.

1351
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,310
So what do you like,
what are you looking for?

1352
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:59,140
I really just want the gossip.
I'm just there to find out.

1353
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:02,350
It's like going to the,
you know the well in the village though.

1354
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,780
I want to know what's going on with
that,

1355
01:00:03,781 --> 01:00:06,940
exactly what it is.
But then they always sneak in something

1356
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,970
like utterly devastatingly just shocking
and awful.

1357
01:00:12,281 --> 01:00:12,641
Like,
you know,

1358
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:14,830
they would,
they'd have Kim Kardashians next to like

1359
01:00:14,831 --> 01:00:18,970
the isis beheadings and it would be like
side by side so you couldn't miss it.

1360
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:20,920
And I know that that's part of like your
friend,

1361
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:22,540
the hunter,
the adrenaline rush.

1362
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,450
I know that's part of why I go there
because it might,

1363
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:27,450
my sister might be shocked a little bit.
Yeah.

1364
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,890
But it's,
it's a revolting impulse.

1365
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:31,900
Like that's the worst of me

1366
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,730
you get.
It's like a big tub of ice cream that's

1367
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:37,840
in your fridge every day and you know
you should need it and you do what?

1368
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:42,140
You just make your underwear
and you're like,

1369
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:45,860
what the fuck is wrong with me?
Why did I do every time I watch one of

1370
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:47,300
those videos after it's over,
I'm like,

1371
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:49,730
why the fuck did I watch that?
Yeah.

1372
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,580
Do you think that stuff like adds up in
your brain?

1373
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:55,610
Like how much of our stress and
unhappiness and all that kind of stuff

1374
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:59,870
that culturally everybody feels is
because you expose yourself to things

1375
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:01,360
that you just shouldn't know about?

1376
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,880
I think for sure,
for sure it has an effect.

1377
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,060
It's a matter of a,
does it have an effect as in as far as

1378
01:01:07,061 --> 01:01:11,290
raising awareness of consequences of
devious actions or does it have an

1379
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:14,620
effect in that you're always worried
about it and so it sort of manifests

1380
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:17,080
itself more often because it's
constantly in your head.

1381
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,760
The ladder probably makes sense.
And then we needed a cup of coffee,

1382
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,130
a drink and a joint.
Yeah.

1383
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:27,670
Just to just try to unwind and find a
group of people that you could hang out

1384
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:31,210
with the trust that are cool to protect
you from all those fuckers coming over

1385
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:32,920
the fence.
Right.

1386
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,300
I mean this one was worried.
Oh,

1387
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:37,840
circle to everybody's worried this would
worry about Russia.

1388
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:39,100
Right?
Everyone's worried about Russia.

1389
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,530
Right?
I'm not worried,

1390
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,630
I'm pissed.
Do you see the thing that there are

1391
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:47,170
parking submarines over to the power
line over the Internet lines?

1392
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,820
I was wondering about that.
What?

1393
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:52,340
I don't know.
Like probably to let us know he full

1394
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:56,020
color we could could line with no
problem if that happened.

1395
01:01:56,021 --> 01:01:58,960
How fast do you think it would take
before we got something back up again?

1396
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:04,140
Or how and how fast crazy that there's a
line that goes across the fucking ocean

1397
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:05,584
and that's how the Internet,
yeah.

1398
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,600
Yes.
There are times when I will sit and

1399
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:11,420
dream about those lines and I'll just
sit there thinking,

1400
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:16,250
I'll see this sort of greenish merck and
then I'll see you hear the silence in

1401
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:18,920
that clicking sound that you're under,
you know with all the fishes eating

1402
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,763
stuff that like

1403
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:24,450
what do I like clicking stuff and I'll
picture these lonely ass cables just

1404
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:28,860
draped down the side of a cliff,
like in the great abyss and like how

1405
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:31,190
just picture their loneliness for
awhile.

1406
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,900
Wow.
Yeah.

1407
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,650
That's intense.
Whoa,

1408
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,670
they're everywhere.
Yeah.

1409
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,210
You imagine if aliens came here and saw
that,

1410
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:41,610
they'd be like,
what in the fuck are these crazy

1411
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,610
assholes wires?
I asked my son what he thinks we're

1412
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:47,940
going to look back on in the future and
think was like the craziest thing we

1413
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:51,120
lived with and he said wires and I
thought it was kind of brilliant.

1414
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,650
That's what a kid would say,
right?

1415
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:54,360
That lives the world today.
That is brilliant

1416
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,700
wires.
I could just play live and move anywhere

1417
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,970
around on the stage.
I didn't have to stand in front of me.

1418
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,870
The fact that we stand in front of a
mic.

1419
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:06,990
I know there's a great tradition and
it's really cool and rock and roll,

1420
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,370
but I personally feel very hemmed in by
this Mike,

1421
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,260
Stan,
I have to stand up straight.

1422
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,570
Bobbi Brown.
I did and I was like,

1423
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:18,180
all my friends just took me aside and
they were like,

1424
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:22,740
no,
can't do it.

1425
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:26,550
It works for Anthony Robbins.
He does it.

1426
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:32,220
He does it right.
It doesn't need go.

1427
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:36,190
Bobby Brown,
whenever it's anybody wears those.

1428
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,770
It's Bobby Brown period.
He did it for my prerogative,

1429
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:42,960
but that's it for the rest of everyone's
life.

1430
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,260
That's a Bobby Brown,
Bobby Brown.

1431
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:49,200
I know a comic who does that really does
is act with,

1432
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:56,100
I'd fucking don't get it.
There's Anthony Robbins look at up big

1433
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:59,420
beautiful son of a bitch.
At one point I bought the box set.

1434
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:02,190
You know,
at one point I was like trying in my car

1435
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:05,730
to listen to my positivity.
He's got some very good points.

1436
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,400
He says some things that really can
work,

1437
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,733
but you know,
it's like,

1438
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,250
here's the thing,
Anthony Robbins is like any delicious

1439
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,280
meal.
You do not want to eat it all fucking

1440
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:18,330
day,
every day.

1441
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,070
And if you hear too much Anthony
Robbins,

1442
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:20,940
he's like,
okay,

1443
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,970
he fucking enough.
I get it.

1444
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,490
Be Positive.
Put out the energy.

1445
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,870
We're going to walk on coals.
It's weird too.

1446
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,170
Why is he wet?
He does do that.

1447
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:35,430
But here's what's interesting about
today,

1448
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,390
cause he's fucking jacked and he's just
running and sweating up a storm.

1449
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,060
Getting these people pumped.
Maybe it's raining out.

1450
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,040
I'd be ready.
Yeah,

1451
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,630
it could be.
Um,

1452
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,540
well they do this fire walk thing,
which is essentially,

1453
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,820
here's the thing,
Coles.

1454
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:59,550
Yeah,
go for it.

1455
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:05,750
With my Bobbi Brown Brown,
if you have one of those,

1456
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,480
you can be totally wireless,
right?

1457
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:14,340
Just hook it up into a backpack.
Wireless action with him.

1458
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:17,800
A little free.
Free Fair.

1459
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,050
Well,

1460
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:19,400
okay.
She's tired.

1461
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:19,510
Yeah.

1462
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,320
That should be a a t shirt that just
says free fair.

1463
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:25,420
And it's just the Bobbi Brown thing,

1464
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,600
like a silhouette of your head with just
the dark Bobbi Brown thing over your

1465
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:33,710
face.
Someone's going to make it by the end of

1466
01:05:33,711 --> 01:05:35,500
this podcast.
So many.

1467
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,350
We'll have that and we're going to put
it up on instagram.

1468
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,420
Bobbi Brown.
I want a parabolic parachute thing over

1469
01:05:41,421 --> 01:05:43,610
my whole stage.
Anywhere I go.

1470
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:47,030
Don't they have that for sports now they
have this like parabolic microphone

1471
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:51,430
thing where I think and like zoom in on
the coach talking or zoom in on it got

1472
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,330
this thing where like it's very
directional,

1473
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,000
right?
Like a laser of a microphone so it can

1474
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:59,690
be up in the ceiling of the arena and
then they just pointed at somebody and

1475
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:01,490
it can go right in and hear that
conversation.

1476
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,380
A shit.
Right.

1477
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:04,603
I don't even using it yet.

1478
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,840
Know that they can listen to what you
say in a room by monitoring the window

1479
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:17,310
and the vibrations of normal human
conversation has enough of an effect on

1480
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:21,260
the window that they can translate that
in December

1481
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:22,640
beach.
That's insane.

1482
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,320
Whoa.
That's insane.

1483
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:28,810
They know the noises you're making based
on the effect it has on a window in a

1484
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:30,310
room.
You don't even have to be screaming

1485
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,620
just talking.
That's crazy.

1486
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,060
That's crazy.
No,

1487
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,150
that's real.
Well don't you kind of just assume that

1488
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:41,860
we're being listened to all the time now
after Edward Snowden and all that stuff

1489
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,650
after you know,
the,

1490
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:46,450
the releases of,
I feel like I've got at least two fans

1491
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:51,080
listening in to me at all times.
And your house just,

1492
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:55,540
and like the NSA,
like to Liz Phair but I'm sure there's

1493
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,890
more.
Yeah,

1494
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,930
they probably poured like I'm going to
find a terrorist.

1495
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,200
But
yeah,

1496
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,440
it's probably a lot of actually thought
about that the other day cause I screwed

1497
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:08,710
up my knees and I've been doing this
thing where like put my elbows into my

1498
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:10,690
legs is I'm sitting watching tv or
something.

1499
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:14,650
Kind of give myself a massage.
But if you were listing through the

1500
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:17,350
audio of my phone or anything,
you just think I was constantly

1501
01:07:17,351 --> 01:07:20,500
mastered.
This is kind of like rubbing motion on

1502
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,800
that.
They're like,

1503
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,840
she's never getting off.
She keeps stopping.

1504
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,510
What's the
blockage?

1505
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,300
She's frantic.
Like what?

1506
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,740
What are those like the primates that
are constantly,

1507
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:35,950
yeah.
Bonobos.

1508
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,503
Vanilla.

1509
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,130
Yeah.
I mean we're going to get to a point

1510
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:43,380
where everybody can listen in on
everybody.

1511
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,510
That's what I think.
I think we're only a couple of decades

1512
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:49,080
away from that.
I think right now it's like content or

1513
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:49,631
a,
you know,

1514
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:53,490
a service providers have the possibility
of tapping into you.

1515
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:57,060
Maybe you know all these different
government groups knows how to tap into

1516
01:07:57,061 --> 01:08:01,350
your phones and tap into your TV and tap
it in the camera that's on your laptop.

1517
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,540
But I think it's going to come a matter
of time.

1518
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:06,930
But that's the intrusion of privacy is
going to be the bottleneck to future

1519
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:09,480
technology.
And we're going to get to some virtual

1520
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:14,570
reality environment where it is so tight
tonically and so incredibly realistic

1521
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,440
that whatever the fuck happens in the
regular world is going to lose its

1522
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:24,020
significance.
It's going to slowly lose significance

1523
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,720
to the point where we're going to accept
that.

1524
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,930
One of the ways to overcome some of
these technological hurdles as to

1525
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:34,310
completely dissolve all boundaries
between all people and information.

1526
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,460
Meaning you're going to be able to look
at anybody doing anything anytime and

1527
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:39,890
they're gonna be able to look at you and
that's going to be the new reality of

1528
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:42,920
human beings.
And this will be after we've accepted

1529
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:45,770
virtual reality,
so once we accept virtual reality,

1530
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,540
regular life is going to be so mundane
because you're going to be able to

1531
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:52,190
create artificial environments like
Avatar world,

1532
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:55,070
like you're flying through 2001 a space
odyssey.

1533
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,890
You're hanging out with the champs,
you're going to have haptic suits on,

1534
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,680
they give you feedback.
It's going to be tied into your central

1535
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:03,860
nervous system.
It's going to recreate smells and feels

1536
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:08,861
and that's all going to happen.
It's not a matter of whether it's going

1537
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:10,460
to happen,
it's a matter of when is it going to

1538
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:10,910
happen.

1539
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:14,330
I think when that does happen,
the big bottleneck is going to be

1540
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:17,330
privacy and I think people are going to,
just like they're doing now with

1541
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:19,670
constantly putting up things on social
media,

1542
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,600
constantly showing pictures of their
kids and constantly giving updates on

1543
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:26,810
everywhere you go and tagging all these
things at Geo tags.

1544
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:31,840
I think that in the future we're going
to just accept that no one has any

1545
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:36,470
privacy and kids today are more likely
to accept it than we were and our kids

1546
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:39,650
are going to be more likely to accept it
then their kids and it's going to keep

1547
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:41,990
going on and on and on and three,
four generations.

1548
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:44,600
It's going to be life.
Life is going to be no privacy.

1549
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,220
Like if we were all living in like a big
brother Type House is fucking no

1550
01:09:49,221 --> 01:09:49,971
privacy,
right?

1551
01:09:49,971 --> 01:09:52,100
There's cameras everywhere.
There's people willingly do it.

1552
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,690
How long before everybody willingly does
it?

1553
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,550
It's a matter of time.
Right now it's a,

1554
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:59,990
it sounds impossible because we grew up
valuing privacy.

1555
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,690
I need my alone time.
I don't want anybody paying attention to

1556
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,120
what I'm doing,
but once meet human beings are so

1557
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:10,040
incredibly malleable that once life
changes around us and we know for a fact

1558
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:12,140
this is an extra ball,
this is not going back and lets

1559
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,480
yellowstone blows.
We get hit by an asteroid.

1560
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:16,760
This is life now we're just gonna accept
it.

1561
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,760
It's going to go into the next thing and
you're going to deal with people looking

1562
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,440
at you naked all the time,
lol.

1563
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,690
Because you don't care because you're in
the Avatar dimension.

1564
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:27,380
Riding a fucking dragon over a volcano
and you going to be living in a world

1565
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:30,980
that's so much more fantastic in the
real world that someone looking at your

1566
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:32,240
asshole and the real world,
you're like,

1567
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:33,680
go ahead,
look,

1568
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,750
who cares.
You're basically saying that we're

1569
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,750
putting ourselves in those little pods
and the Matrix.

1570
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,520
Yes.
You're saying that we're willingly

1571
01:10:41,521 --> 01:10:45,130
climbing in eventually to these little
pods of Google and,

1572
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:48,840
and,
and powering the whole machine age.

1573
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:51,000
Yeah.
Cause we're just going to plug in.

1574
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:54,000
I think we're going to be symbiotic.
I think we're going to become part

1575
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,560
machine.
I think it's inevitable.

1576
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,030
Colony.
Yeah.

1577
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:59,270
You know where it kind of like an ant
collector.

1578
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,310
One organism with many,
many parts.

1579
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,460
Yeah.
I think it's a matter of time.

1580
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,420
That is that okay.

1581
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,300
You don't have to,
you're alive right now.

1582
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,970
You're alive.
You're alive and a beautiful time.

1583
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,040
You're alive.
And the transition between when you were

1584
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,070
young and there was no

1585
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,830
internet to now you've been an adult
where there's internet.

1586
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,590
This is the most amazing time ever.
We're lucky.

1587
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,860
We're lucky.
We're the most lucky cause we've

1588
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,020
experienced both.
We've experienced,

1589
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:27,870
I mean when I was a kid we didn't have
fucking answering machines.

1590
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,671
No,
I know.

1591
01:11:28,671 --> 01:11:31,700
Right.
You just called and hope they were home.

1592
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,840
Yeah.
And that they weren't home.

1593
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:33,940
You never found them.
You,

1594
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,590
you open that door to your house,
you were a ghost.

1595
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,360
You just guide bid that a trust.
You,

1596
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:41,480
you were where you said at work you just
went places,

1597
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,760
you do whatever you want,
you know,

1598
01:11:43,761 --> 01:11:46,070
and that's the last wild ones.
That's what we are.

1599
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,120
We are the last,
we're the last of the disconnected,

1600
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,150
you know,
we were disconnected and then we became

1601
01:11:52,151 --> 01:11:56,350
connected in the 1990s though.
That's a totally new experience for

1602
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:58,630
human beings.
And we experienced both parts.

1603
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:03,100
We were the last humans to experience no
internet internet.

1604
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:07,000
No one else will ever experience that.
The only way they'll experience that is

1605
01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:10,060
if they don't have internet.
But the world has internet.

1606
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,770
You know what?
I want to get back to what you said.

1607
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:17,270
How long is the electricity down?
If we're attacked on the infrastructure?

1608
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:20,180
That's what I want to know what we were
talking about the internet,

1609
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:21,640
but some of the Internet.
The same thing.

1610
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:22,940
Yeah.
Look,

1611
01:12:22,941 --> 01:12:24,290
that's another,
that's an issue too.

1612
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,801
Oh,
that's all.

1613
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:29,780
They're going to blow his internet,
but it would be like the saddest attack.

1614
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,320
Wow.
EMP can take us out to,

1615
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:36,920
which suggests a scary and probably
easier to accomplish.

1616
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:40,070
That's what I want to know about,
like how long is the recovery time?

1617
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:40,410
Because

1618
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,540
I do feel like Putin sitting back,
they're like,

1619
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,610
well,
I think what they're really worried

1620
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:49,611
about other than Putin is solar flares.
They think solar fairs have the real

1621
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:52,560
potential to take out the entire power
grid.

1622
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:55,400
That's,
that's entirely possible and big.

1623
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,100
We know.
Oh,

1624
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:56,850
that too.
Yeah.

1625
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:57,960
Yeah,
for sure.

1626
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:01,770
That's only one thing.
Yellowstones the big one.

1627
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,093
Oh,

1628
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,490
that was like a stoner moment.
We all just stopped.

1629
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:12,410
They know about the,
the Caldera volcano in yellowstone,

1630
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:13,244
you know?
Yeah.

1631
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,160
That's the big one.
I do.

1632
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,430
I'm not,
everybody should be free.

1633
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,530
I was worried about that,
although I know what the bulging,

1634
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:19,730
hmm.
Yeah.

1635
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,780
I think the northwest part is bulging or
say,

1636
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,000
well,
it's just constantly have an earthquake.

1637
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:27,050
They've got thousands of earthquakes
every year for like the last five or six

1638
01:13:27,051 --> 01:13:29,700
years.
Thousands and thousands in a month.

1639
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:33,320
So Times that to me is not worth
worrying about because there's nothing

1640
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:37,430
we can do that is like that.
You might as well just the,

1641
01:13:37,431 --> 01:13:39,620
what I said they want it.
They want to dig a hole.

1642
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,480
No,
they want to drill a hole and let some

1643
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:42,314
of the gas out.

1644
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,440
Well,
wow.

1645
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:48,370
I applaud their like,
you know,

1646
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,090
well,
you know,

1647
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:52,880
yeah.

1648
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,360
Didn't want to lance a zit or some of
the lava out.

1649
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,340
What's crazy?
Is it that that's happened to human

1650
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,240
civilization like many times over the
course of history at giant volcanoes

1651
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:05,500
blown up and killed everybody?
Yeah.

1652
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,510
Yeah.
A bunch of that shit happened to,

1653
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:08,523
yeah.

1654
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,930
I'll,
I'll be loving life because I'm small.

1655
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,970
I think only the small things survive,
right.

1656
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,920
I Dunno.
They said about the,

1657
01:14:16,921 --> 01:14:17,740
um,
the,

1658
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,580
what hit the Yucatan is that we used to
be like a mole.

1659
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:25,090
Like human beings.
They di if you trace the evolution of

1660
01:14:25,091 --> 01:14:27,940
the human being,
if you believe in that nonsense today,

1661
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,790
if you go all the way back,
we were like a mole.

1662
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:33,670
We're some kind of a mold that was the
only survivor.

1663
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1664
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:40,501
Literally 65 million years ago.
Human beings are our farthest mammal

1665
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:45,130
ancestor is some sort of a mole that
survived the big hit.

1666
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:47,300
Yeah.
Like shrewish Mulligan thing.

1667
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1668
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,360
And cause all the upper predators get
wiped out so then they can thrive and

1669
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:58,600
they live in a ground so that these
things can live underground and of what

1670
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:02,320
our future would be like underground.
Everyone,

1671
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:04,420
thanks for joining Mars.
But I think we're just going to go

1672
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:06,550
underground.
We are going to go to Mars too though.

1673
01:15:06,551 --> 01:15:08,740
Some idiots support Fox are going to be
no thank you.

1674
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,640
No thank you cass.
Why do people want to do that?

1675
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:17,110
Because we can because it's one of those
go sit and like badlands.

1676
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,550
That's what I'm saying.
You're done.

1677
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,800
And you can come back and have pie.

1678
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,440
Yeah.
It's dumb.

1679
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,360
Yeah.
And then you have to bring water or have

1680
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:26,390
to go get it and melt it down with,

1681
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,610
but you're there.
Okay.

1682
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:30,190
You're on Mars.
Let's just say we're on Mars.

1683
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,550
What do we do?
We're just terrify me.

1684
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,900
Cry.
Stop working.

1685
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,093
Rock.
Yeah.

1686
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,610
Do I mean I just don't see the life
there.

1687
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:42,990
Well,
I think people want to be pioneers and I

1688
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:46,320
think it's entirely possible that you're
going to wind up going with some really

1689
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:47,300
crazy people too.
Yeah,

1690
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,160
right.
Yeah.

1691
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,400
He wants to be a pioneer.
That isolated.

1692
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,020
Yeah.
Crazy pants.

1693
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:55,920
Right?
See if I know a lady who lives in the

1694
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,270
Arctic Circle.
She lives like two more hundred miles

1695
01:15:57,271 --> 01:15:59,910
above the arctic circle.
She's on that shield life below zero.

1696
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,790
You ever see that show?
But she can come out when she wants.

1697
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,380
She can come back.
She flies back.

1698
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,490
She ain't,
she was in the studio,

1699
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:06,330
not this one,
the old one,

1700
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:08,820
but she was sitting right where you're
sitting like,

1701
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,700
you know she's a normal person.
I can't even take a cruise.

1702
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,290
No,
no,

1703
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,820
but you're going to cruise in the Congo.

1704
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,590
That's a river,
but I can't take a cruise boat because I

1705
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:23,890
can't be isolated in the middle of the
ocean with people I don't think are

1706
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:25,750
really on the ball.
Like I can't do it.

1707
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,460
I think that's where like the next
plague starts I think does happen

1708
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,330
sometimes.
Yeah,

1709
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:34,420
they get the norovirus or whatever on a
cruise ship.

1710
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,140
I want,
if someone was just really in a chuck

1711
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:39,220
and people over the side,
like that's your move.

1712
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,980
You just take a crew of people that
survive that.

1713
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:47,050
I like the stories of the people that
fall off the cruise ship and they get

1714
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:49,240
bound.
Who the fuck finds him there in a

1715
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:50,800
shipping lane?
They get found.

1716
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,570
Really?
I've loved those stories.

1717
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:55,270
I've never heard those doors.
I always thought your fuck you imagine,

1718
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,910
could you,
there's almost nothing that can fuck you

1719
01:16:57,911 --> 01:17:00,880
worse than to fall off a cruise ship.
But these people,

1720
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:02,050
they,
they survive it.

1721
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,210
You have to think of how long can you
swim,

1722
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,540
right?
I mean it's like 13 hours or I dunno,

1723
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:08,920
how long can you tread water?
Well,

1724
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:11,420
you can tread water longer than that.
Oh no,

1725
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:12,343
sure.
You can.

1726
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,720
I sink like a rock.
You'll be hallucinating.

1727
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,640
Right.
But you still be treading water.

1728
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,980
You just be your tissue

1729
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,920
tearing apart.
What I heard one guy talk about was how

1730
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:25,610
he saw,
like he had the illusion of seeing boats

1731
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:30,611
come by and talk to him and he like
talked to people that were saying just

1732
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:32,240
hang on,
hang on longer.

1733
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,580
It was all imaginary.
Like none of it was real.

1734
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:39,170
But he was having like a full sort of
trippy virtual reality experience with

1735
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:41,480
his hallucinations that kept him alive
longer.

1736
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:45,980
They were like his subconscious,
but they would come in his mind in

1737
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:49,550
vessels and like stop and talk to him,
throw him something.

1738
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,170
Wow.
Motivate him.

1739
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,300
That's crazy.
I guess you could get that if you go

1740
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,270
into one of those,
um,

1741
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,220
sensory deprivation tanks or something
that,

1742
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,280
oh,
you do?

1743
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,720
I want to run over here.
Shut up.

1744
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,760
Fuck you.
Oh Wow.

1745
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,770
Yeah.
Well,

1746
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,110
do you do that regularly?
Yeah.

1747
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,160
Do you have a loose nations?
Yeah,

1748
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,330
definitely.
Tell me.

1749
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:09,693
Um,
the,

1750
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:14,660
the most extreme one.
I was in a jungle and um,

1751
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:18,670
there was some people that were native
to this place.

1752
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,330
They were dressed in western clothes
though,

1753
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,100
like t shirts and shorts,
but they were barefoot,

1754
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:27,940
which is often the case though
unfortunately a lot of people that live

1755
01:18:27,941 --> 01:18:32,020
in these indigenous villages,
they were like under armour shirts and

1756
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:34,810
shit that they,
someone gets them somehow it gets down

1757
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:37,030
to them.
Missionaries maybe sometimes bring them.

1758
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,580
Um,
but they were speaking in a language

1759
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:42,910
that I understood,
but it was an English and I don't speak

1760
01:18:42,911 --> 01:18:44,950
anything other than English.
And when they were talking,

1761
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,890
I was listening to them,
I was amongst them and I was listening

1762
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:51,040
to them and they were speaking of is
very different language.

1763
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,280
And then I realized like,
Holy Shit,

1764
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,580
I can understand their language,
but I realized that in English.

1765
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,060
And then Poof,
I popped out of the,

1766
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,620
the spell like my freaking out about it
brought me,

1767
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:03,470
it was all like,
don't know.

1768
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:04,300
No,
don't go away.

1769
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,920
Don't go away.
Ah,

1770
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,540
fuck.
It's like,

1771
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,530
it was so extreme.
It was so I could smell the,

1772
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,870
the rain,
I could feel the moisture in the air.

1773
01:19:13,871 --> 01:19:18,040
I could see the leaves all around me.
I could hear the sounds of the forest

1774
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,640
and these people in the rain forest just
hanging out talking to this.

1775
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,250
It was totally uneventful.
Nothing was happening.

1776
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,580
But they were talking in this language
that I absolutely knew what they were

1777
01:19:27,581 --> 01:19:29,290
saying.
They were going back and forth and

1778
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:32,800
communicating and I was following the
conversation in their language,

1779
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,410
thinking in their language and then I
realized it and I woke up.

1780
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:38,463
How do you interpret,

1781
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:42,840
I think first of all,
I was tripping balls,

1782
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:43,920
right?
There's that,

1783
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,220
there's been in that tank on what?
Uh,

1784
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,800
I think it was edible pot.

1785
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,770
I've done a bunch of different things in
the tank,

1786
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:57,771
but mostly it's edible pot.
Pot Edibles has a distinctly

1787
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:03,290
hallucinatory effect at high doses,
especially when you close your eyes and

1788
01:20:03,301 --> 01:20:04,560
you're laying back.
And just like,

1789
01:20:04,561 --> 01:20:07,680
just,
just letting visuals place.

1790
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,950
Um,
also I think it's entirely possible that

1791
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:15,951
we have genetic memory and I think it's
entirely possible that like there's

1792
01:20:16,821 --> 01:20:20,190
certain things that people pass down to
their children.

1793
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,730
Like there are certain traits that my
kids have that are watching them.

1794
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:24,863
And I go,
okay,

1795
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,910
how do you,
why are you so into this?

1796
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,120
Are you so into this because you just
happen to be into this?

1797
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:33,270
Are you into this because you cause I'm
into this and somehow or another gotten

1798
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:37,740
in my jeans and passed on to your little
tiny body and now you're developing with

1799
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:40,470
this like hunger for certain certain
types of activities.

1800
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,540
Because I see it literally
will little note,

1801
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:49,250
we don't know what's transferred.
We don't know how much of like what

1802
01:20:49,251 --> 01:20:50,910
links people have certain instincts,
right?

1803
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,650
People are afraid of,
spiders are afraid of snakes.

1804
01:20:52,651 --> 01:20:53,850
Why?
Why is that?

1805
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:58,260
It's probably some memory.
Probably somewhere along the line some

1806
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:02,280
memory got transferred into your DNA.
Well the question is like how much gets

1807
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:05,220
in there until I hope my nine year old
daughter,

1808
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:08,460
I thought probably very little.
I was probably,

1809
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:10,260
it's just like physical traits and
that's it.

1810
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:14,000
But her mind is so much like my mind,
like,

1811
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:15,840
and especially her obsession with
things.

1812
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:19,500
I've never seen a little kid so obsessed
with things like this is me in a nine

1813
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,810
year old girl's body.
Like this is fucking crazy.

1814
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:27,410
And talking to people that have musical
talent or people that have artistic

1815
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:32,160
talent and their children seem to have
an aptitude for this,

1816
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:36,600
like an an unusual attitude almost as if
they're trying to remember it rather

1817
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:37,434
than learn it.

1818
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,690
Ooh,
I like what you just said.

1819
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:43,140
I like that area.
I think there's something that gets

1820
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:43,890
trend.
I don't,

1821
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,380
I don't know how much of it is readable
data,

1822
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,920
but I think there's so much information
that gets through yourselves and then I

1823
01:21:49,921 --> 01:21:52,920
think the child is faced with their own
data,

1824
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:54,390
right?
Their own life experiences,

1825
01:21:54,391 --> 01:21:57,840
their own genetics,
they're on hormones and all these

1826
01:21:57,841 --> 01:21:59,310
different things that are happening
around them.

1827
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:03,780
But I think underneath all of that,
it's entirely possible.

1828
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:06,600
There remains some very,
very distant memories,

1829
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,070
which is why people survived as long as
they did because you could transfer some

1830
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:14,700
knowledge until the kids,
I think it's probably less today than

1831
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:17,880
before because the world's so safe.
Everything's nerved.

1832
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,530
You don't have to worry about getting
eaten by leopards.

1833
01:22:19,531 --> 01:22:21,180
Like it's a,
it's a totally different environment.

1834
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:22,890
We live in it so less of it gets in
there.

1835
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:26,790
But I think there's probably still
somewhere in the operating system.

1836
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,890
If you went into dos and started
sneaking around,

1837
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,400
you'd find some weird code from like
different languages that you spoke

1838
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:36,770
10,000 years ago or you know,
who knows whatever life experience.

1839
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:40,140
Like why are kids scared of monsters?
Those are another thing that they were

1840
01:22:40,141 --> 01:22:41,430
talking about once in one of these
things.

1841
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,360
Like they're scared of monsters because
monsters used to be a real thing that

1842
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:48,210
you had to worry about it cause they ate
people like cats,

1843
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,420
like leopards and jaguars and shit.
Like that was a real problem.

1844
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:54,690
So little kids,
they're not scared of bullets or you

1845
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:57,120
know,
they're scared of fucking monsters.

1846
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,890
That's what every little kid scared of
the dark.

1847
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,560
And monsters because that's in our
genetic memory.

1848
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:06,220
Probably some leftover shit for when we
got eaten a lot in trees.

1849
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,653
Trees.
Right.

1850
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,770
So falling and pronation.
Yeah,

1851
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:14,680
both.
So is that what you think happened?

1852
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:18,430
Like that you kind of access to memory
because I was going more with like the

1853
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:19,660
um,
what do you call it?

1854
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:23,080
Collective unconscious.
Like you were seeing a present day thing

1855
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,990
in another part of the war all I doubt
it.

1856
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,770
No,
you're going back in your,

1857
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:29,630
I think it was his imagination more than
anything,

1858
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:32,390
honestly find to be really honest.
I think it was imagination.

1859
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:35,960
I think I just have a very vivid
imagination and it's particularly when I

1860
01:23:35,961 --> 01:23:38,550
was lit on some,
okay,

1861
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:41,600
I've read a study where,
um,

1862
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:44,990
if something really traumatic happens to
the parents,

1863
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,730
and I don't know if this is animals or
whatever,

1864
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:51,860
even if the baby animal is born after
this thing is over,

1865
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:56,861
this traumatic event,
they'll have a fear of that thing is

1866
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,890
that was very poorly articulated,
I think the pots like gone through me.

1867
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,461
No,
no,

1868
01:24:01,461 --> 01:24:02,930
no.
I'm just like sort of,

1869
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:04,260
I think I know what you're talking
about.

1870
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,800
There was a study that they did with
mice and what they do with mice as they

1871
01:24:07,801 --> 01:24:11,580
sprayed a citrus and aroma inside the
cage.

1872
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:13,470
And then the electrocuted the feed of
the mice,

1873
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:18,300
their children when they smelled this is
children that had not had been

1874
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:20,310
electrocuted when they smelled that
citrus aroma,

1875
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,230
they had a heightened panic state.
Yeah,

1876
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:23,490
yeah.
That's what it is.

1877
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:23,910
Yeah.

1878
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,650
But that's,
is that how they figured that out?

1879
01:24:25,651 --> 01:24:29,430
Because that seems like I can explain
that with normal science.

1880
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,380
That's easy.
Right.

1881
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,470
Um,
cause they'll have the sense,

1882
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,050
well no,
never.

1883
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:40,570
They never experienced the electrocution
thank before on the smell.

1884
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,160
Right.
But the smell never gave them a

1885
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:46,090
heightened sense of awareness in mice
that weren't fetus would be shocked.

1886
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,470
Oh,
you're saying they weren't pregnant?

1887
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,131
No,
no,

1888
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:48,881
they weren't pregnant.
Oh,

1889
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:50,950
this is before their pregnancy,
if not even there.

1890
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:52,000
Right.
Exactly.

1891
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,760
Okay.
So what explains that genetic memory?

1892
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:57,670
It's a,
it's a piece of evidence appointed

1893
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,440
genetic memory,
but it's one of those things.

1894
01:24:59,441 --> 01:25:04,120
It's like if you don't understand,
go back to dos are c plus or something

1895
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:05,020
like that.
Some computer code.

1896
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:06,310
I don't understand it.
If I read it,

1897
01:25:06,311 --> 01:25:09,460
it's just jibberish to me or like those
quantum physics guys and write all that

1898
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:12,810
stuff does just gibberish.
So we might be just getting that gerrish

1899
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,530
going and what is,
what's going on here?

1900
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,550
No one knows,
right?

1901
01:25:15,551 --> 01:25:17,800
We don't know.
One day maybe we'll be able to read that

1902
01:25:17,801 --> 01:25:21,340
jibberish but right now we know there's
something getting passed down from these

1903
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:24,670
mice,
so if the parent gets shocked because

1904
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:27,610
they smell that thing and then the kids
who have nothing to do with it,

1905
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,270
they get shocked or they a smell it and
they think they're going to get shocked.

1906
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,710
Something's being transferred to that.

1907
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,710
That's crazy.
That means that we have components of

1908
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:39,490
our parents.
Like right now we're reacting to stuff

1909
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,140
in our everyday life.
Our fears,

1910
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:42,460
our worries,
our neuroses.

1911
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:45,220
Yeah.
Possibly things that our parents

1912
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:46,054
experienced.
Okay.

1913
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:50,010
It's entirely possible that you didn't,
neuroses of your parents is somehow or

1914
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,220
another transferred into your body,
whether or not you accept them as your

1915
01:25:53,221 --> 01:25:54,054
own.

1916
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,390
Because I'm adopted.
That means I have two sets of neuroses

1917
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,530
going at once and wonder and one
doubling down on,

1918
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:04,370
I wonder how much your adoptive parents
gave you sticks.

1919
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,330
What does this,
who does?

1920
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,840
Another study's authors,
Wa,

1921
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,760
uh,
was an early researcher of trauma,

1922
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,210
trauma and heritability.
Her research on Holocaust survivors

1923
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:17,360
found that epigenetic changes,
not the genes themselves,

1924
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,050
but how they are turned on and off by
other molecules could be passed down to

1925
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,030
survivors,
children and change their stress

1926
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:24,290
hormones.
Wow.

1927
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,130
There's a bit,
what does that,

1928
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:29,490
how does that express itself though?
Not genes themselves,

1929
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,360
but how they are turned on and off,
but by other molecules could be passed

1930
01:26:33,361 --> 01:26:35,130
down.
So they're going to be heightened,

1931
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,160
they're going to have a heightened
sensitivity to threat.

1932
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:41,850
Probably.
Probably they're going to have like a

1933
01:26:41,851 --> 01:26:43,800
quicker response neurologically.

1934
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,140
Will they say that about,
um,

1935
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:49,230
children that are in the womb when their
mother is under extreme stress or

1936
01:26:49,231 --> 01:26:51,330
violence?
They can sense that.

1937
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:52,130
Yeah,
for sure.

1938
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:52,963
Yeah.

1939
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:57,040
But what freaks me out is that the,
it's not even like a fetal baby that's

1940
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:57,890
reacting this.
Yeah.

1941
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:00,970
Like complete genetic material
transference.

1942
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,720
Yeah.
Who knows?

1943
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,420
I don't think we know enough future
science.

1944
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:07,950
Yeah.
That's what you're into.

1945
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:10,950
I'm weighing the future science.
I wish we lived in the future.

1946
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,470
So that's where ghosts fit in.
I just go,

1947
01:27:13,471 --> 01:27:14,460
I mean,
future science,

1948
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:17,300
I think I just think time.
I think time is a,

1949
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,970
an illusion.
I think that I'm more,

1950
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,370
did you ever see interstellar?
Yes.

1951
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,500
I'm more in that zone.
Hmm.

1952
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:29,730
That's that smacked of good science to
me.

1953
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,470
I was like,
yes.

1954
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:36,500
So when you say time's an illusion,
you mean like the watch is real?

1955
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,750
Like if it says four 30 that's when the
movie starts,

1956
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,010
right?
That's all real.

1957
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,150
No,
that's just coordination.

1958
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,300
That's it's,
it's within our species.

1959
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:48,360
We're coordinating together.
We're working as an ant colony.

1960
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:51,210
We're sending signals,
which happened to be time signals.

1961
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:53,370
We're using math to coordinate,

1962
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,080
but if you go underwater and hold your
breath for five minutes,

1963
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,330
that's real five minutes.
No,

1964
01:27:58,331 --> 01:28:01,600
that's just when you run out of oxygen.
So that five minutes,

1965
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:05,770
that is the counting of that time
doesn't mean anything.

1966
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:07,240
Doesn't mean anything.
No,

1967
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:09,460
it doesn't mean anything.
But if someone's five minutes late,

1968
01:28:09,461 --> 01:28:09,911
you're like,
bitch,

1969
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:10,840
you're five minutes late.
Right.

1970
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:15,420
Well I'm never mad about that because
I'm always late,

1971
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:16,254
so,

1972
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,013
oh,
okay.

1973
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:19,550
Hmm.
That's interesting.

1974
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:23,180
Um,
well the only time supposedly is now and

1975
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:26,720
everything else is just are pathetic
attempts at measuring it and trying to,

1976
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,350
that's just coordination on like,
you know,

1977
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:32,900
people like that's all we're doing.
Like how old are you?

1978
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:33,611
Um,
you know,

1979
01:28:33,611 --> 01:28:37,480
and then that just means how crispy you
are from going around the sun.

1980
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,470
That's not like really anything
accessory.

1981
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,793
Yeah.
You're like,

1982
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,270
sorry.
Right,

1983
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,291
right.
Skin.

1984
01:28:44,291 --> 01:28:48,040
Cracklin you know,
like it's just kind of that and to me

1985
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:48,910
like time,
it's just,

1986
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:51,460
it's just space.
It's like how far are you away from this

1987
01:28:51,461 --> 01:28:54,220
gravitational pull?
I think gravity is way more interesting.

1988
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,820
I think time is just us coordinating
with math.

1989
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,040
Well,
we definitely are,

1990
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,950
but it's also like when Sun's coming up,

1991
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,010
like check your watch,
six 15 sun's coming up.

1992
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:05,873
That's a real thing.

1993
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:08,280
We're just clocking a spin of an earth.
Yeah.

1994
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,040
It's the same thing with the lungs under
water.

1995
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:12,390
The earth spins.
I agree with you.

1996
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:12,500
Yeah.

1997
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,960
Disagree with you at the same time.
Yeah,

1998
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:16,300
that's fine.
I think you're right.

1999
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:19,450
But I also think the fucking movie
starts at four 30.

2000
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,980
That's another human putting on a movie.
It's true.

2001
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:27,240
You're just coordinating with,
give me an example of time that is a

2002
01:29:27,241 --> 01:29:31,200
manifest thing outside of human
coordination.

2003
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,600
Um,
well,

2004
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:34,230
you could the oldest,

2005
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,460
I don't mean like things happening,
right?

2006
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,570
I mean time,
just time itself.

2007
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,750
Is that helpful in any way?
Other than for us?

2008
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:45,060
I don't think it exists in the universe
really.

2009
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,180
Well,
if the universe had a big bang and that

2010
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:49,220
was a point,
I don't

2011
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,690
living room.
Sorry.

2012
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:56,440
What do you think?
I think we're looking at,

2013
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,480
okay.
Black holes.

2014
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,300
Say there's a train,
right?

2015
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:03,310
We're at a where to depot.
Okay.

2016
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,660
I love that word.
Train depot.

2017
01:30:04,661 --> 01:30:07,660
Depot.
Like home depot or a train depot.

2018
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:11,500
Okay.
And there's like a giant but of a train.

2019
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:12,850
Right?
Huge.

2020
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,530
I Dunno.
20 feet tall,

2021
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,610
18 feet wide,
filled with that legs.

2022
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:21,370
That shame,
that feeling of like,

2023
01:30:21,371 --> 01:30:24,220
oh my God,
there's great mechanical power and then

2024
01:30:24,221 --> 01:30:26,200
it leaves the depo,
but you're still there.

2025
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,660
You didn't get on it.
Right.

2026
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,160
And it,
it just travels in the distance into a

2027
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:31,750
Tinier and Tinier,
Tinier,

2028
01:30:31,751 --> 01:30:34,900
tinier speck until it's just a little
point until you can't see it anymore.

2029
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:38,290
Did the train shrink?
No.

2030
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,130
Okay.
So when you see all this matter going

2031
01:30:42,131 --> 01:30:46,720
into a black hole,
is it really hitting a singularity or we

2032
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:51,550
really condensing matter to that extent?
Or is it just condensing to a certain

2033
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:55,690
extent and traveling in the distance?
Is it going somewhere?

2034
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,840
And that's why we perceive it as gone.
It's basically to run this by an

2035
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:03,760
astrophysicist and then they break out
the worm hall.

2036
01:31:03,761 --> 01:31:05,920
But that's not the same thing.
That's not what I'm saying.

2037
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:09,070
Like,
and I think the big bangs or the other

2038
01:31:09,071 --> 01:31:10,780
end of that process,

2039
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,960
the under end of the process of coming
out,

2040
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,700
that's a,
that's a real,

2041
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,600
uh,
thought.

2042
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,100
They think that,
well,

2043
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:23,410
every galaxy has a super massive black
hole black hole that's in the center of

2044
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:25,600
it.
One half of 1% of the mass,

2045
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:27,880
the entire galaxy.
So the larger the galaxy,

2046
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:32,620
the largest supermassive black hole,
the prevailing theory is that,

2047
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:37,000
or one of the prevailing theories I
should say inside every black hole may

2048
01:31:37,001 --> 01:31:40,840
be another universe.
It's entirely possible that there's

2049
01:31:40,841 --> 01:31:44,830
another universe of hundreds of billions
of galaxies each with supermassive black

2050
01:31:44,831 --> 01:31:47,440
holes in the center of them,
and he'd go through that one you go

2051
01:31:47,441 --> 01:31:49,420
into,
it's fractal and it just goes on forever

2052
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:50,680
and ever and ever.
That's entirely,

2053
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,280
that's my philosophy.
And I think the whole Universe is

2054
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:55,410
spinning.
I think the whole thing's a spiral deal.

2055
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,830
Mm.
I think they think that don't tell them

2056
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,430
within the spiral,
get the eddies right,

2057
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:03,700
which of the galaxies and the
irregularities and stuff,

2058
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:05,740
but the whole Shebang is also spinning

2059
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:09,060
the multiverse ideas like legit
scientists.

2060
01:32:09,061 --> 01:32:10,250
Talk about that now.
That that,

2061
01:32:10,251 --> 01:32:12,960
that there might be different for that.
Number two universes.

2062
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,570
Yes,
I agree with that and there's so much

2063
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:18,060
more sense.
What makes some kind of like the people

2064
01:32:18,061 --> 01:32:19,680
that go out of that's crazy,
but the universe,

2065
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:21,210
it's crazy.
It's crazy.

2066
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,790
It's crazy that you look out and you see
forever.

2067
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:26,550
That's crazy.
That's really fucking crazy.

2068
01:32:26,551 --> 01:32:27,384
And when you look up

2069
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:29,910
hanging out,
you're sitting on the side of a planet,

2070
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,510
you're in the middle of the whole thing,
right?

2071
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:32,940
Yeah.
You're in the middle of this soup of,

2072
01:32:32,941 --> 01:32:35,620
of reality.
But to think that that's crazy,

2073
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:37,570
but that's as crazy as it gets.
Like says who,

2074
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,790
why would,
why would you think this fucking the

2075
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:43,000
infinite numbers of these things out
there that were just a part of something

2076
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:46,390
that's so big you like,
if you looked at all of the Zeros on

2077
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:48,220
that number,
you wouldn't even be able to wrap your

2078
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:49,120
head around it.
You'd be like,

2079
01:32:49,121 --> 01:32:50,680
what?
What's a billion?

2080
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,410
How many zeroes is that?
How many billions is this?

2081
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,410
How many trillions isn't a billion?
And,

2082
01:32:55,411 --> 01:32:58,350
but there's no way that they,
it's too much.

2083
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:02,320
There's this enigma thing.
I love it so much and it's talking about

2084
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,270
it.
It has to do with why we haven't seen

2085
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:05,200
aliens yet.

2086
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:07,610
The fermi paradox.
Yes.

2087
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:08,610
Yeah.
I think that's it.

2088
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,890
Yeah.
The fermi paradox is like questioning

2089
01:33:10,891 --> 01:33:13,500
why?
Because there's so many different life.

2090
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:14,790
I mean,
some different plants it could

2091
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:19,791
potentially support life is like if
there's 100 billion galaxies or hundreds

2092
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:22,950
of billion,
each one has a hundreds of billions of

2093
01:33:22,951 --> 01:33:25,440
stars.
How many of those have habitable planets

2094
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:26,910
and if,
if so,

2095
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,710
why haven't they contact?
Yes.

2096
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:29,623
Yeah,

2097
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,760
and like the math is overwhelming that
either we're the first or they kill all

2098
01:33:35,371 --> 01:33:36,420
the comers.

2099
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,430
Hmm.
Or or there we're like,

2100
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,780
or we turn inward
and go into the,

2101
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:49,690
yeah.
What's the turn inward turning toward is

2102
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:52,330
the,
the idea that we all go virtual and then

2103
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:56,350
we become some sort of a symbiotic thing
connected to this,

2104
01:33:56,830 --> 01:34:00,610
this hive mind,
this real electronic reality.

2105
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:04,020
I can't handle self driving cars.
I can't do that.

2106
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:05,220
No,
I can't.

2107
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,113
No,
I'm not.

2108
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:06,871
Am I?
Yes,

2109
01:34:06,871 --> 01:34:07,704
I am.

2110
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,180
How could you dot.
Self driving?

2111
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:13,760
Cars are real.
They're here and they suck right now.

2112
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,470
They're killed a couple of people.

2113
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,450
That's insane.
There's like five of them on the road

2114
01:34:18,451 --> 01:34:21,150
and they've already killed someone.
There's a lot of them on the road.

2115
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:22,590
Yeah.
No,

2116
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:26,430
I feel extremely unsafe about that.
I reject that with every fiber of my

2117
01:34:26,431 --> 01:34:28,950
being.
I drive my own car.

2118
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,310
Good for you kind of car.
You drive a Mercedes,

2119
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:35,590
do you rich check on their partying.
Hardy.

2120
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:39,870
We're getting deep.
We're going deep.

2121
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:43,170
Um,
I think they'll get it down.

2122
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,500
They'll get the autonomous car down.
The real problem is going to be the

2123
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:49,770
thrill and the excitement of freedom.
Just getting in your car,

2124
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:51,900
turn the key and just going,
I'm good dude.

2125
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,610
You can't do that anymore.
That's gonna.

2126
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,740
That's gonna be a real thing that's
going to be one day.

2127
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,160
No,
I mean not feels

2128
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,160
extremely threatening as an American.
I feel like America to me is about big,

2129
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:06,360
long roads and freedom.
Yeah.

2130
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,320
Go where I want when I want kind of
thing.

2131
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:11,240
Yeah.
If you've got the goods,

2132
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:13,340
you can start a business there or
whatever it is.

2133
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,110
That to me is America is the,
the,

2134
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:17,120
I don't want to be locked into little
channels,

2135
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:19,220
going all 20 miles an hour,
you know,

2136
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,410
like I need,
do you want to be able to accelerate?

2137
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:25,490
I consider driving kind of an art form.
It's kind of an art thing.

2138
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:29,810
It's like a sport.
You be an activity and I don't want to

2139
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:33,300
relinquish that to be like a thing on a
factory line.

2140
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:36,130
Well you might get lucky and die before
it becomes mandatory.

2141
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:38,040
No,
not at all.

2142
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:39,070
No,
no,

2143
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:39,271
no,
no,

2144
01:35:39,271 --> 01:35:41,010
no.
That doesn't dovetail nicely with my

2145
01:35:41,011 --> 01:35:43,740
idea that they're going to discover
something that lets me live 500 years

2146
01:35:43,741 --> 01:35:46,310
cause I've decided that's exact perfect
life span for me.

2147
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:48,540
For me personally,
not for everyone.

2148
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:52,690
Would you think that you'll still be
getting after it when you like 450 years

2149
01:35:52,691 --> 01:35:53,350
old?

2150
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,450
They'll have,
they'll have hormones for that.

2151
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,240
They'll have everything.
Just we'll have everything for that.

2152
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,790
Have you juiced up large physical
envelope will be okay.

2153
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:03,100
It's the psychology.
Can you not go mad?

2154
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:06,580
You might go mad.
Well it depends on if everyone else is

2155
01:36:06,581 --> 01:36:07,980
living 500 years.
Even then

2156
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:13,810
before we were talking about if you
found out that you were going to live

2157
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:18,110
this life over again every time,
like infinitely.

2158
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,880
What'd you be able to handle it?
No,

2159
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,120
but why you handle it now?
You live in right now?

2160
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:26,310
No.
Would you be conscious that this was

2161
01:36:26,311 --> 01:36:29,130
your fifth two and half the time we take
someone's word for it back to the

2162
01:36:29,131 --> 01:36:31,290
Matrix,
neo is come back like five times.

2163
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:32,790
He still can't get it right,
right.

2164
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,600
But if someone came up to you right now
and said,

2165
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:38,420
Liz,
I'm going to give you the reality of

2166
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:40,580
existence,
the reality of existences.

2167
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:44,660
You will do this life an infinite number
of times until you get it right and

2168
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:46,820
you're never going to get it right.
So you just going to keep living this

2169
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:50,720
life over and over again,
hopefully fucking up less and less each

2170
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:52,430
time,
but most likely you're going to still

2171
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:54,560
fuck up and you just going to keep doing
the same thing.

2172
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,790
He'd be like,
no fucking way.

2173
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:57,860
But if someone says,
do you want to end your life right now?

2174
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:58,551
You'd be like,
no,

2175
01:36:58,551 --> 01:37:00,350
I love my life.
When you were on that plane and your

2176
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:01,460
whole body was shaking,
you're like,

2177
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:04,070
I want to stay alive.
I don't want to die.

2178
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,710
So why don't you want to stay alive and
just keep doing it over and over and

2179
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:07,350
over and over?

2180
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:08,970
Well,
is there transcendence,

2181
01:37:08,971 --> 01:37:11,610
is there a goal?
If there's a goal I can get with it.

2182
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,050
So transcendent meaning we evolve hogs
day.

2183
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:16,610
You know that wonderful movie?
Yes.

2184
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:17,850
Not that movie.
Great movie.

2185
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:21,060
I looked that like like top 10 for me.
Okay.

2186
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,940
You got to watch some other movies then.
But I love dumb nineties eighties

2187
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:29,520
movies.
I like a lot of them to genre that I

2188
01:37:29,521 --> 01:37:33,360
really like.
I mean like blues brothers might be top

2189
01:37:33,361 --> 01:37:36,560
five easily for me.
Christmas vacations,

2190
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:38,670
good movie.
I haven't seen that one.

2191
01:37:38,671 --> 01:37:40,230
But yes,
you're feeling me.

2192
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:41,251
Okay.
So if there's,

2193
01:37:41,251 --> 01:37:43,230
if there's something that you evolve
into,

2194
01:37:43,231 --> 01:37:46,620
I can live my life over many times and
strive to be better at it,

2195
01:37:46,621 --> 01:37:49,770
but if there's no point to it all and I
just have to keep living over and over

2196
01:37:49,771 --> 01:37:51,360
and going to high school again and again
and again.

2197
01:37:51,361 --> 01:37:52,110
No.

2198
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:55,830
Well don't you think that human beings
overall are evolving?

2199
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:58,030
Yes,
I think so.

2200
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,490
I didn't even,
besides,

2201
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,780
I think even our trials and tribulations
and the things that go sideways,

2202
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:08,100
they revealed sideways is an option to
us and gets us back on track.

2203
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,680
I have an expression that my mother
loves onward and sideways.

2204
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:16,600
That's good.
Kind of gets you up in the morning when

2205
01:38:16,601 --> 01:38:18,280
you were like,
I can't do it anymore.

2206
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,150
Yeah,
I like that and I like the idea of,

2207
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:25,870
I'm very into,
as we sort of evolve.

2208
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:30,460
Speaking of Ufo conferences,
I was driven in the back of Rick Ruben's

2209
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:33,850
Bentley.
When I first moved to La.

2210
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:38,140
My friend Nora was friends with him and
he drove us to Ufo conference and I just

2211
01:38:38,141 --> 01:38:41,950
remember sitting in the back of this
huge Bentley and he wouldn't talk to me

2212
01:38:41,951 --> 01:38:46,210
at all like I was like not of interest
enough to,

2213
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:49,600
I kept sort of poking my head up to the
front seat to like try to contribute to

2214
01:38:49,601 --> 01:38:51,550
the conversation.
Like yeah,

2215
01:38:51,730 --> 01:38:54,070
no,
he just like ignored everything I said

2216
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:58,600
and they were talking about the
evolution of human consciousness at this

2217
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:01,270
crazy UFO conference.
It was pretty funny.

2218
01:39:01,271 --> 01:39:04,630
It was very organized.
It was just like any like NAM or

2219
01:39:04,631 --> 01:39:05,850
something.
It was like anything.

2220
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,750
Yeah,
they have some good ones,

2221
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:08,561
you know,
there,

2222
01:39:08,561 --> 01:39:11,980
there's a business in it though.
That's the real issue with all the UFO

2223
01:39:11,981 --> 01:39:16,630
stuff is that there's a business is that
you get to a point where people realize

2224
01:39:16,631 --> 01:39:18,940
you could,
you could make a lot of profit if you

2225
01:39:18,941 --> 01:39:23,941
just start talking about Ufos are
talking about extra terrestrial invaders

2226
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:29,491
that are inevitably coming and when and,
and then everything gets murky.

2227
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:32,990
Know it gets real murky.
It's kind like who's who's being one

2228
01:39:32,991 --> 01:39:35,890
science and well you need to approach
it.

2229
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:39,960
It's just,
it's not always pure.

2230
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:42,330
You know,
like there's some people that look at it

2231
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:46,320
and that are like real researchers.
Like this is a bunch of them that try to

2232
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:48,600
figure out what the fuck is going on.
And they make a lot of sense,

2233
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:49,361
you know,
and they're,

2234
01:39:49,361 --> 01:39:50,490
they're trying to figure it out but they
don't,

2235
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:53,040
they don't point to anything in
particular and say this,

2236
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:55,560
this little fetus,
this is an alien baby and we're going to

2237
01:39:55,561 --> 01:39:56,910
use genes to prove it.
Like,

2238
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:59,010
you know,
they found that little baby with a big

2239
01:39:59,011 --> 01:39:59,940
head,
just a baby,

2240
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,200
just a deformed baby.

2241
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:03,930
But what they're really looking for is
aerial phenomenon,

2242
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:04,840
right?
That's

2243
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,060
Ariel phenomenon is one.
But phenomena.

2244
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:10,810
The problem isn't a phenomenon.
Phenomena.

2245
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:13,090
Yeah.
Phenomena.

2246
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:17,050
The problem is we don't know who stuffed
that is.

2247
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,520
Right.
If it's ours,

2248
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:20,320
it's flying around.
They don't tell you about it.

2249
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:23,940
If it's some drones at the government's
working on cut,

2250
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:26,670
that kind of maneuverability,
why aren't they using it?

2251
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:29,970
What kind of maneuverability?
You convinced they have a,

2252
01:40:29,971 --> 01:40:34,971
they can move great speeds at odd angles
is what I understand.

2253
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,610
Yeah.
I don't see us.

2254
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:38,790
I mean,
they couldn't get here.

2255
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:39,541
Well,
here's the thing,

2256
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:44,541
they couldn't get here unless they were
able to actually like tesseract what

2257
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:48,210
does that word tesseract from wrinkle in
time.

2258
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,190
Like a girl book that was out now.
Right?

2259
01:40:51,191 --> 01:40:52,470
It's a movie.
I haven't seen the movie,

2260
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:55,420
but it's nice flag.
Get my box set.

2261
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,270
So they fold.
They full time horizon.

2262
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,720
Ah,
no,

2263
01:41:05,721 --> 01:41:06,980
but I'm sure I'm familiar with it.

2264
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:09,030
That's fucking movies.
Scary space.

2265
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,530
Who's in that movie?
Laurence Fishburne and a bunch of other

2266
01:41:16,531 --> 01:41:17,610
people.
Sam,

2267
01:41:17,611 --> 01:41:20,670
the guy from Jurassic Park.
English gentlemen.

2268
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:24,000
Uh dammit.
I want to say Harris with the son's

2269
01:41:24,001 --> 01:41:25,770
name.
Like the older guy.

2270
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:28,020
The grandfather?
No,

2271
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:31,470
the one who was Sam Neill.
Sam Neil.

2272
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,320
He was one of the scientists,
one of the top scientists.

2273
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:36,390
They went there with Laura dern.
He was like Laura durrance boyfriend.

2274
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,250
He's English.
Yes.

2275
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,150
Pretty sure theory is there's a
gentleman that's the event horizon.

2276
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,750
English accent.
Yeah.

2277
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,470
It doesn't mean maybe he's just so
proper.

2278
01:41:46,471 --> 01:41:48,690
I think he's English.
I think he's English.

2279
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:50,790
That'll blow my mind.
The movie's bad ass though.

2280
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:54,270
It's one of the best horror slash
science fiction movies ever.

2281
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:58,080
They combined like a demonic movie with
space.

2282
01:41:58,081 --> 01:41:58,980
It was demons in space.

2283
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,750
Okay.
I like this.

2284
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:04,240
Yeah.
The aliens are actually demons

2285
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:07,230
sort of.
They punched through a wormhole in order

2286
01:42:07,231 --> 01:42:10,470
to travel this far and when they did,
they opened up a passage to hell

2287
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,060
straight the dimension.
Tom.

2288
01:42:12,061 --> 01:42:16,220
Tom Don't paint well.
Hell being what we would do to extra

2289
01:42:16,221 --> 01:42:17,180
terrestrials.
I mean,

2290
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:20,120
think about who we are to an alien
civilization.

2291
01:42:20,121 --> 01:42:21,830
Let's just say they're peaceful and
they're not.

2292
01:42:21,831 --> 01:42:24,590
I mean like imagine us,
although we'd probably be like so

2293
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:26,080
evolutionarily backward,

2294
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:28,430
right?
It would probably be like if we had a

2295
01:42:28,431 --> 01:42:33,431
giant hamster wheel and visited a crazy
arm chimps and you're like Whoa,

2296
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:36,320
slow the fuck.
You know.

2297
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:39,880
They probably would be really aware that
we're super violent,

2298
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:44,600
would shoot at them and shit.
They probably would do something to slow

2299
01:42:44,601 --> 01:42:45,434
that down.

2300
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,740
No,
officially high.

2301
01:42:46,741 --> 01:42:48,980
Like I can feel it.
It just happen to me.

2302
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:49,990
No,
there's no doubt.

2303
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:50,873
Right.

2304
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:55,060
So.
Okay.

2305
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,970
Have you ever been to one of my
concerts?

2306
01:42:58,110 --> 01:43:01,680
No.
Does that bum you out?

2307
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,613
No,
not at all.

2308
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,500
I was going to ask you,
cause I was assuming it was pretty early

2309
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:06,610
on.
I'm going out,

2310
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:09,760
I'm going to plugging myself now,
but I'm going out and I'm playing all

2311
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:14,410
these songs that I haven't played ever
really live that I wrote.

2312
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:15,880
Grab that microphone.
Sorry.

2313
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,300
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

2314
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:21,790
I'm going to whisper.
When are you performing out here?

2315
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:22,350
Soon

2316
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:25,260
I will be like eight shows.
It'll come and go.

2317
01:43:25,261 --> 01:43:28,170
Kind of like a shooting star through the
sky.

2318
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:34,090
What are you going to be here happening
now joe?

2319
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:39,480
Get down here.
I'm sure June I'm in,

2320
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:42,190
but it's kind of

2321
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:47,170
an interesting thing if you play stuff
that is from from a really long time ago

2322
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:52,171
and it was pretty rudimentary on stage,
can you trick it out with a base?

2323
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:56,270
Can you trick it out with drums?
Can you go back and like reinvent your

2324
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:59,210
early work?
Do you think that that would be like,

2325
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:01,940
would that upset an old fan?

2326
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:05,670
You mean if an old fan wanted to hear it
the way it was?

2327
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:07,560
Like if you had an acoustic version,

2328
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:11,970
did they want me to just exactly hit
exactly how I played at?

2329
01:44:11,971 --> 01:44:12,804
Probably right.

2330
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:17,010
Are Don't think that you can leave that
up to vote

2331
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:20,980
cause I was thinking it would help my
voice to be a stoner since I was a

2332
01:44:20,981 --> 01:44:21,814
stoner back.

2333
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,330
So you're thinking about getting into
being a stone now.

2334
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:28,520
I might,
you make it good stoner sitting around

2335
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:31,180
and talking about black holes and shit.
Perfect dose.

2336
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,280
You believe in ghosts.
Like all that shit sober though.

2337
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:34,660
Yeah.
That's the scary part.

2338
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,510
Well I think most people do.
I don't think most people that are

2339
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,040
watching those go shows are high.

2340
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:40,493
No.
Yeah,

2341
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,590
the Internet is like the paranormal.

2342
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,180
Oh,
well it's library things that people are

2343
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:48,910
curious about and they're fun.
Like if ghosts were real,

2344
01:44:48,911 --> 01:44:50,620
it'd be fun.
It'd be awesome.

2345
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:53,360
You know?
It wouldn't be fun if they weren't real

2346
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:53,891
and be like,
oh,

2347
01:44:53,891 --> 01:44:57,250
you mean all those shows where you've
never been scared by ghost.

2348
01:44:57,251 --> 01:45:00,730
You've never actually like even thought
I've definitely been scared.

2349
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:03,040
I never thought animals.
No.

2350
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:05,590
I've been through the comedy store,
which was been,

2351
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:07,960
apparently a bunch of people get
murdered there.

2352
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:13,020
When Bugsy Siegel owned it,
he used to be Ciro's nightclub and a lot

2353
01:45:13,091 --> 01:45:15,070
of people that worked there,
apparently I've seen ghosts.

2354
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,180
Like even my friends told me they seen
goes.

2355
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:19,300
I don't know.
I Dunno.

2356
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,760
What did they say?
Did they said they saw ghosts?

2357
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:23,880
I mean,
maybe they were talking to human look.

2358
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:28,270
I've never seen an actual human effort.
Some have told me they were grabbed.

2359
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:31,120
Carla boasts that he was grabbed and
dragged.

2360
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:34,450
He was in a dark room and something
grabbed him and dragged him on the

2361
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:38,200
ground and then ran through the place
and slam the door outside.

2362
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,640
You're kidding.
That's what he said.

2363
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:42,640
Could it have been a person?
Could have been for sure.

2364
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,260
The people are real,
you know,

2365
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:46,510
it's more likely a person.
He's in a pitch black room.

2366
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:49,060
It might have been one of his asshole
friends side to grab him cause he's

2367
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:51,450
probably drunk off his ass laying down
there.

2368
01:45:51,451 --> 01:45:54,520
Like I think you had a fight with his
wife or something like that.

2369
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:56,570
Went to the comic store.
I was like fuck this.

2370
01:45:56,571 --> 01:45:57,161
I'm,
I lie here,

2371
01:45:57,161 --> 01:45:59,190
I'm gonna make it.
I'm going to be a big man.

2372
01:45:59,191 --> 01:46:01,360
And then something like came into the
room,

2373
01:46:01,361 --> 01:46:03,610
he tells the whole story on stage.
It's really kind of interesting the way

2374
01:46:03,611 --> 01:46:04,060
he tells it.

2375
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,370
Cause he,
he's very dramatic and goes through the

2376
01:46:06,371 --> 01:46:10,630
whole detail of it.
But I've talked to several waitstaff,

2377
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:14,200
waitresses,
managers that have seen ghost there.

2378
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,000
Comics who've seen ghosts there.
And,

2379
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,810
but again,
people were full of Shit.

2380
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:19,360
Right?
You get a hundred people,

2381
01:46:19,361 --> 01:46:22,870
one of them's a fucking moron.
And that one out of a hundred might tell

2382
01:46:22,871 --> 01:46:25,930
you some goofy ass fucking store cause
they want to be special.

2383
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:28,060
But what happened to you that made you
scared?

2384
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:29,770
Oh,
normal stuff.

2385
01:46:29,771 --> 01:46:31,810
Just being in the dark.
I'm just freaked out to be.

2386
01:46:31,811 --> 01:46:35,260
Yeah.
I'm more scared of animals than anything

2387
01:46:35,261 --> 01:46:37,240
else.
The real things,

2388
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:39,340
you know?
I'm scared of real shit.

2389
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:43,090
Oh yeah.
Huge giant.

2390
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:45,250
I've shot a moose.
I stumbled.

2391
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,320
You shot a moose kill in the first time.
Yeah,

2392
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:51,420
I ate it could for you.
Yeah,

2393
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,500
that's true.
Hunting.

2394
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:53,363
Yeah.
Well,

2395
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:54,713
it's the way to do it.

2396
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,020
Fucking huge.
They're like,

2397
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:59,400
um,
they don't even look like a real animal.

2398
01:46:59,401 --> 01:47:01,920
The first time I saw him,
one in British Columbia,

2399
01:47:01,921 --> 01:47:03,990
it looked like it was like a scene from
Jurassic Park.

2400
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:06,150
We pulled,
we pulled the car over and we rolled the

2401
01:47:06,151 --> 01:47:06,931
windows down.
We're like,

2402
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:10,890
what the fuck?
Look at that thing is so big.

2403
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:15,180
I think I could walk under it and clear.
You might be able to really think like

2404
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:16,650
their legs are,
you know,

2405
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:19,140
you a little duck.
Maybe it's the worst.

2406
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:20,940
They're so big.
Doesn't even make sense.

2407
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:23,520
Like you feel like you could drive a car
under them.

2408
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:24,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

2409
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:26,730
They're enormous.
They're the redwoods of deer.

2410
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:31,020
Yeah.
Crazy animal grows giant doors on its

2411
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:34,830
head every year and then they fall off
after the done breeding,

2412
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:37,050
the horns fall off and they regrow
again.

2413
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,720
Did you,
did you have to wait for a long time to

2414
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,650
get it?

2415
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:41,490
Yeah,
we were.

2416
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:44,760
We were there for like five days and we
got it on the fifth day.

2417
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:46,440
The fourth or the fifth day?
Yeah,

2418
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:48,140
same animal.
You saw it.

2419
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:48,721
No,
no,

2420
01:47:48,721 --> 01:47:50,010
we didn't seem one.
We're looking at,

2421
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:52,700
there's a lot of wolves up there.
Are you allowed to shoot the wolf?

2422
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:54,390
Yeah.
They tried to get you to kill as many as

2423
01:47:54,391 --> 01:47:55,350
you can.
I didn't.

2424
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,400
I didn't.
I don't want to,

2425
01:47:56,580 --> 01:48:00,000
but if you're up there,
they give you an unlimited tag for

2426
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:01,860
wolves.
You could shoot 30 walls,

2427
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:03,690
but you won't,
you'll never get 30 of them.

2428
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:06,620
They're smart as shit.
But we did come across a baby moose.

2429
01:48:06,621 --> 01:48:08,130
I got eaten by a wolf.
Ooh,

2430
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,530
it's crazy.
A pack of wolves was hair everywhere.

2431
01:48:10,531 --> 01:48:13,080
That was the most surprising thing.
It's just fucking hair.

2432
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,820
I didn't think there would be hair
everywhere,

2433
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:16,650
but I'm like,
of course they're going to kill this

2434
01:48:16,651 --> 01:48:18,330
thing.
They have to chew off the hair.

2435
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:19,600
Oh yeah.
Spit it out.

2436
01:48:19,601 --> 01:48:21,370
Right.
Every meal,

2437
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,670
every meal.
And animal eats has like all this

2438
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:26,070
correct.
Like the snow one preparing it there.

2439
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,200
No knives and forks.
They can't lay in their shit

2440
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:30,890
to see ropes of hair and their shit.
Dude,

2441
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:31,670
girl.
Yeah.

2442
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:36,410
They don't just eat the meat like nice
and clean like a bowl and chopped up

2443
01:48:36,411 --> 01:48:37,101
meat.
No,

2444
01:48:37,101 --> 01:48:38,480
they're eating the hair.
Everything.

2445
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:39,970
Yeah.

2446
01:48:39,970 --> 01:48:43,330
I used to look at those like wild horse
videos and they would show that pack of

2447
01:48:43,331 --> 01:48:45,250
wild horses and I would try to think
like,

2448
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:49,300
is it better?
Maybe it's better to be like stabled and

2449
01:48:49,301 --> 01:48:51,310
in a clean with Nice,
you know,

2450
01:48:51,311 --> 01:48:56,230
sawdust or whatever in your pen.
Like maybe it's not so bad to be a kept

2451
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,790
animal.
I'm not sure.

2452
01:48:57,791 --> 01:48:59,440
I'd like to be a wild horse.
I mean,

2453
01:48:59,441 --> 01:49:02,330
it seems really romantic,
but would it really be fun?

2454
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:06,360
It's a great rolling stone song.
I think what it is is,

2455
01:49:06,361 --> 01:49:07,194
uh,
they're,

2456
01:49:07,290 --> 01:49:10,800
they're not the same thing that they
used to be.

2457
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:12,320
They're not the same thing.
You're right.

2458
01:49:12,321 --> 01:49:14,200
Yeah.
They've been domesticated for so long.

2459
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:15,740
Yeah.
It's not even the same animal,

2460
01:49:15,741 --> 01:49:17,030
really.
Do you know what to see what that

2461
01:49:17,031 --> 01:49:18,800
genetic memory thing you're talking?
Yeah.

2462
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:21,320
Do you know scrub bullous?
Ever heard of that expression?

2463
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:23,270
Scramble.
Scrub bowls are wild.

2464
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,920
Um,
domestic cattle,

2465
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:29,330
domestic cattle that's broken down
barriers and gone wild and has lived in

2466
01:49:29,331 --> 01:49:32,420
the wild for several generations to
change their form.

2467
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,340
They look different.
They look,

2468
01:49:34,341 --> 01:49:37,700
they're much more muscular.
They're freaky looking multicolored.

2469
01:49:37,701 --> 01:49:41,210
Sometimes they have grow giant antlers
are giant horns rather.

2470
01:49:41,211 --> 01:49:43,490
And it,
Australia has a real issue with them and

2471
01:49:43,491 --> 01:49:45,380
they're super,
super aggressive.

2472
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:48,010
When you think about bull riding,
people ride bowls and the

2473
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,900
go fucking crazy.
That's what a bull does.

2474
01:49:49,901 --> 01:49:53,170
Bowls are ruthless motherfuckers.
They're just out there trying to have

2475
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:55,960
sex with cow and anything that gets
anywhere near them,

2476
01:49:55,961 --> 01:50:00,961
they'll fuck up because they're giant.
So these things just roam wild and there

2477
01:50:01,151 --> 01:50:03,190
are different animal now and people hunt
them.

2478
01:50:03,191 --> 01:50:05,770
It's very strange.
That is a,

2479
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:10,030
that's a wild animal.
These horses are still the same form as

2480
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:12,430
when people domesticated them.
They just got loose.

2481
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,533
And so they're just running around

2482
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,050
trying to find something to eat.
They're not real wild.

2483
01:50:16,051 --> 01:50:17,280
Wild.
They're wild.

2484
01:50:17,281 --> 01:50:20,280
Horses are not native to North America.
Oh Wow.

2485
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:23,070
Yeah.
They were brought in to North America.

2486
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,960
The native Americans did not have
horses.

2487
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:28,500
We brought them in from Europe.
I did not know that.

2488
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:32,100
Yeah.
Well what's crazy is horse is originated

2489
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:35,820
in North America many,
many eons ago,

2490
01:50:35,970 --> 01:50:40,650
but then died off in North America but
prospered overseas in different places

2491
01:50:40,651 --> 01:50:44,040
like possibly when across the bering
land mash and all these different places

2492
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:49,041
where horses evolved and became zebras
and all these other different animals

2493
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:52,560
like and then they,
the Europeans brought the horse back to

2494
01:50:52,561 --> 01:50:54,870
North America.
But the horse originated in North

2495
01:50:54,871 --> 01:50:58,530
America but then died off.
So these wild horses,

2496
01:50:58,531 --> 01:51:00,210
they're just domestic horses.
They got free.

2497
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,830
So it is kind of shit.
Yeah,

2498
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,300
it's kind of shitty.
They don't really,

2499
01:51:04,301 --> 01:51:08,170
they probably like if you see a really
well taken care of horace,

2500
01:51:08,171 --> 01:51:11,740
they don't seem to mind it.
Like if there's a place up here that has

2501
01:51:11,741 --> 01:51:15,010
a stable and people ride their horses,
people come by and pet the horses.

2502
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:18,430
The horses seems so chill.
They don't seem to mind it at all.

2503
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:20,770
Like,
if it's a loved horse in there taking

2504
01:51:20,771 --> 01:51:24,820
care of and you know they're just
treated well and fed well,

2505
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,560
they don't,
it doesn't seem to mind.

2506
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:31,630
How do they not mind that hugely heavy
saddle and that hugely heavy human

2507
01:51:31,631 --> 01:51:36,631
beings only hugely heavy to you.
The amount of so happy that a horse has.

2508
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,340
Do you deal with that?
How about what does a big horse way?

2509
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,860
Thousand Pounds.
2000 pounds.

2510
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:45,220
It's like you remember when your son was
really little,

2511
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:46,950
he put them on your shoulders,
didn't really bother you.

2512
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:52,970
What it's like.
And then think of the mass that a horse

2513
01:51:52,971 --> 01:51:56,120
carries around just a bone structure and
the muscle,

2514
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:59,900
this fucking thing that can jump over
huge stacks.

2515
01:51:59,901 --> 01:52:02,990
A logs with a person on its back.
It is pretty incredible.

2516
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:04,160
Yeah,
they're insane.

2517
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:06,620
So what we are,
you know,

2518
01:52:06,621 --> 01:52:08,870
if we had to carry a purse around yeah,
that was fucking suck.

2519
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:12,320
Yeah.
Because we got squishy discs in our back

2520
01:52:12,321 --> 01:52:15,680
and our muscles give out and we cramp up
and you know,

2521
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:16,730
we're,
we're in stupid fuck

2522
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:21,110
shoes and like a horse can carry a
person for a long time.

2523
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,620
I feel a little bad for them.
Yeah.

2524
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,760
They probably shouldn't do it when
they're tired.

2525
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,680
Battled a horse.
I don't ride horses.

2526
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,490
No.
You have to pull this strap like really

2527
01:52:31,491 --> 01:52:33,770
tightly around their barrel chest.
Right?

2528
01:52:33,771 --> 01:52:35,510
Yeah.
Cause they do this thing where they,

2529
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,030
when they can tell that you're saddling
them,

2530
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:41,570
they like stick their bellies out.
Oh.

2531
01:52:41,571 --> 01:52:45,800
To try to get to sell some space so that
when you let go they go like this and

2532
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:46,100
they're more

2533
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,710
comfortable.
So you literally have to like Yank this

2534
01:52:48,711 --> 01:52:50,020
thing and you're like,
ah,

2535
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:52,880
on that.
Otherwise you'll start to slip when

2536
01:52:52,881 --> 01:52:55,490
you're riding,
you'll just start to fall like slowly.

2537
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:01,460
I mean it sucks.
That's why they're always fighting when

2538
01:53:01,461 --> 01:53:03,220
you were on the trail because were like
I said,

2539
01:53:03,221 --> 01:53:05,060
to just fart all the time anyway.
I think they probably do.

2540
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:06,840
I just made that up.
I don't want him to sound like I didn't

2541
01:53:06,841 --> 01:53:08,180
want to talk about,
but you're squeezing them.

2542
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:09,110
Done.
It's turnips.

2543
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:12,200
But they spoke like if they saw a wolf
they'd go nuts.

2544
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,580
Oh yeah.
I spoke at a garbage can.

2545
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:16,650
Do you know?
That's why cowboy boots are made that

2546
01:53:16,651 --> 01:53:18,150
way.
Where your feet going,

2547
01:53:18,151 --> 01:53:20,910
I'm loose and then they have the,
the heel,

2548
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:25,020
all that is so that the heel slides on
that thing that your foot sticks in.

2549
01:53:25,021 --> 01:53:26,940
What's that thing called?
Startup stirrup.

2550
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,780
Your foot slides in and locks on that
stirrup with the heel and then if you

2551
01:53:30,781 --> 01:53:33,510
get knocked off,
the foot should just comes off.

2552
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:36,240
You don't get dragged.
Oh,

2553
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:40,110
I'll give your foot.
If you have like hiking boots on with

2554
01:53:40,111 --> 01:53:45,111
like 17 eye holes and you get that bitch
tie down laced in and you shove them

2555
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:49,080
into those stirrups.
If that fucking horse starts bucking and

2556
01:53:49,081 --> 01:53:51,990
you get knocked loose,
you're going to get dragged and kicked

2557
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:54,390
to death.
You're going to be hanging on by your

2558
01:53:54,391 --> 01:53:56,250
foot.
It's going to install it on your head.

2559
01:53:56,251 --> 01:53:58,440
As you're running around,
you're gonna bounce you off rocks and

2560
01:53:58,441 --> 01:54:00,150
shit.
But if you're in one of them cowboy

2561
01:54:00,151 --> 01:54:02,010
boots,
you feet just come right out.

2562
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:04,920
I am now only going to wear cowboy boots
if you're riding.

2563
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:07,890
The horse should only wear cowboy boots.
I haven't been,

2564
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:13,920
but that's why they're so slippery.
That's why they come right off to their

2565
01:54:13,921 --> 01:54:16,860
goofy smart.
It is for horse riding.

2566
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:20,370
Yeah,
but like people that don't get that and

2567
01:54:20,371 --> 01:54:24,570
try to wear like big ass fucking
mountaineering boots and ride a horse

2568
01:54:24,571 --> 01:54:25,360
like,
yeah.

2569
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,610
I don't think anyone can fit a big ass
mountain every mood in his church.

2570
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,850
This was a real issue with people that
go mountain hunting.

2571
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:34,040
I always thought cowboy boots are for
snakes.

2572
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:36,670
That's why they were like so thick.
I bet that that's it too.

2573
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,460
I bet that they had to go up high enough
to say that a strike wouldn't get.

2574
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:41,570
Yeah.
Yeah,

2575
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:43,670
that makes sense.
That's probably a factor too,

2576
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:47,680
but there's definitely a factor.
Like the way the heels constructed is

2577
01:54:47,681 --> 01:54:50,440
that your stirrup sits right in the heel
and the way your foot just comes right

2578
01:54:50,441 --> 01:54:50,740
off

2579
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,840
and the way the toe goes up,
it would just stay in.

2580
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:55,410
You'd go flying or,
exactly.

2581
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,440
It's really smart,
right?

2582
01:54:58,441 --> 01:55:00,480
What's the point of tears?
Really smart tips.

2583
01:55:00,481 --> 01:55:03,240
He gets stuck up there.
He foot goes flying out and you're done.

2584
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,970
I know that was a very vivid,
now that I'm high,

2585
01:55:05,971 --> 01:55:09,300
like to imagine my head bouncing along
the trail behind the horse.

2586
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:14,910
Back your head cracking off rocks.
She got try to stay conscious.

2587
01:55:14,911 --> 01:55:16,500
Grabbing your head,
your head,

2588
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,930
your hand gets smashed in the ram.
Anything.

2589
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:23,130
You're just a rag doll.
Ah Yeah,

2590
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:25,020
exactly.
Declan.

2591
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:28,440
Oh you're awfully silent over there.
Does he ever,

2592
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:31,590
he talks all the time.
He's a good talker.

2593
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:34,010
Really.
Jamie?

2594
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:37,620
Smart Guy.
But we could wrap this up if you like.

2595
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:40,280
She had to be out of here.
I thought 45.

2596
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:42,270
Oh Shit.
She probably get out of here.

2597
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:46,620
That did just by did you drive?
No,

2598
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:47,860
no.
Someone getting?

2599
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,960
Yeah.
Okay.

2600
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:53,550
Um,
when can people find out where you're

2601
01:55:53,551 --> 01:55:56,640
playing and when you're playing live,
what's the best way?

2602
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:59,940
Is it your website?
Yes.

2603
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,610
Liz phair.com.
Okay.

2604
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:06,990
I think
people find it.

2605
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:07,830
Go look for it.

2606
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:12,830
And your collection sold out already.
Damn.

2607
01:56:13,051 --> 01:56:16,950
Look at you.
That went exceedingly fast and I was

2608
01:56:16,951 --> 01:56:19,620
terrified by it.
I had like a complete breakdown and

2609
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:23,670
couldn't be on twitter for three days
cause I was so shocked at how fast they

2610
01:56:23,671 --> 01:56:25,410
went.
I just nervous.

2611
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:26,880
I don't know.
It just,

2612
01:56:27,190 --> 01:56:29,010
it became very real,
very fast

2613
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:34,380
when the box that's coming out I think
is May 4th,

2614
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:39,120
which may the fourth be with you and
also with you.

2615
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,580
I'm very excited about that.
Awesome.

2616
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,010
I'm going to buy it.
It's like a compendium.

2617
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:46,890
It's going,
there's my origin story.

2618
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:50,400
Basically you wrap this up.
If I kick the bucket,

2619
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,200
we're good.
And we know where I came from.

2620
01:56:52,201 --> 01:56:54,600
It's all like collected and beautiful
packaging.

2621
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,640
Um,
super cool.

2622
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:58,350
That's fair.
This was a lot of fun.

2623
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:01,170
It wasn't really a lot of fun.
This is the best.

2624
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:05,210
Let's make all interviews like this.
All right.

2625
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:08,490
Thank you very much gentlemen,
by everybody.

2626
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:10,580
I love.
