1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,790
The general good experience,
so

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,580
for you,
you had this traumatic experience of

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,580
violence when you were young,
you were depressed,

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,060
you were trying to figure out what the
source of this was,

5
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:17,400
whether it was some sort of a chemical
imbalance in your brain.

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,210
Now when they say chemical imbalances in
the brain have,

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,140
are they capable of measuring the level
of Serotonin in your brain?

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,980
Yes,
so there's a huge debate about this.

9
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:27,840
She couldn't,
for example,

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,930
do autopsies and there's a big debate
about,

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,480
but that's when someone's dead.
Yeah,

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,820
but there's a big debate about.
So there seems to be most scientists

13
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,710
agree,
not all of them,

14
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,180
and there are some people who dissent
from this,

15
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,810
but most scientists agree low serotonin
correlates with depression,

16
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:43,860
right?
But it's not the same thing in the same

17
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,870
way stretch marks correlate with
obesity,

18
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:47,960
but they're not the cause of obesity is
that the product to them?

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,130
So there are real brain changes that
happen,

20
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,380
which I write about in Los Connections
and important to say that,

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,380
that I don't think they should be
described as chemical imbalances,

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,970
but one of these,
it was really shocking to me,

23
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,770
was one of the British experts and they
stopped to.

24
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:02,280
David Healey said to me,
and you can't even say the sorry,

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,950
the idea that depression causes serotide
in.

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,960
You can't even say that that theory is
discredited because it was never

27
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,330
credited.
There was never a time when half of the

28
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,100
scientists in the field believe that.
Right?

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,060
The reason that story got sold to me and
most people listening to this in the

30
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,370
nineties,
it's because it worked really well for

31
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,510
the drug companies,
right?

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,790
Because what it makes it sound like if
you've just got a chemical imbalance,

33
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,590
the solution is just to give you
chemicals.

34
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,410
And that's important to say chemical
antidepressants do play a role.

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,680
We can measure that.
And there's a slightly nuanced point to

36
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:32,850
make about this,
which is.

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,280
So depression is measured by something
called the Hamilton.

38
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,900
Right.
I've always felt sorry for whoever

39
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,690
Hamilton was that the only way we
remember him is by how fucking miserable

40
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:40,500
we all.
But anyway,

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,230
so how is the scale goes from one where
you are,

42
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,320
you know,
dancing around in ecstasy,

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,330
ecstasy.

44
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,200
It's a 51 when you would be acutely
suicidal.

45
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,600
Right?
And to give you a sense of what movement

46
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:55,080
on the Hamilton scale looks like.
If you move six points on the Hamilton

47
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:55,980
scale,
sorry.

48
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,430
If your sleep patterns get better,
you'll gain six points on the Hamilton

49
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,370
scale and if your sleep patterns
deteriorate.

50
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,210
So you have a baby who's crying all the
time,

51
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,850
you're generally lose six points on the
Hamilton scale,

52
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,130
right?
So professor Irving Kirsch at Harvard

53
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,020
medical school to the best research on
this,

54
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,790
and what he found is on average chemical
antidepressants move people one point

55
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,830
eight points on the Hamilton scale,
right,

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,010
about a third of what improving your
sleep patterns does.

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,100
It's important to say that's an average.
So some people do get more than that.

58
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,180
Some people get less and you can say one
point eight points is not nothing,

59
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,440
right?
If you're acutely suicidal,

60
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,030
one point eight points can take the edge
off.

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
There's real value in giving people that
relief,

62
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,740
but it's not solving the problem for
most people.

63
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,480
I thought I was weird for being on
antidepressants for so long and

64
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,830
remaining depressed.
Turns out I was totally typical concert.

65
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,900
Dr Steve [inaudible] is professor of
psychology,

66
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,410
has done a lot of work on this.
Between 65 and 80 percent of people

67
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,120
taking chemical entity precedence become
depressed.

68
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:51,954
Again,

69
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,160
this is a guy who is a real Bernie
sanders supporter,

70
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,380
open Bernie Sanders supporter who worked
for the DNC.

71
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:01,870
The DNC absolutely rigged the primary
against Bernie Sanders.

72
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,120
He was aware of this.
He was there while this was all going

73
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,620
down.
So is Donna Brazil.

74
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,890
Everyone was aware of it.
The guy got fucking murdered after he

75
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,500
leaked information to wikileaks.
If you don't think that's a little

76
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,360
weird,
what are you looking at?

77
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,230
What?
What?

78
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,290
What delusional rose colored glasses.
Are you looking at your party from a.

79
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,040
You think you're in some Julia Roberts
movie from Nineteen Ninety.

80
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,740
This is real shit.
Some guy got killed.

81
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,300
He was 24 years old.
He was a young guy who was very

82
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:33,301
optimistic and have this view of the
world where he means the guy fucking

83
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,360
war,
American flag pants and shirt.

84
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,920
There's a famous picture of him with a
beer on Misa patriot that a lot of ways

85
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,050
he wanted to be involved in the
political process.

86
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,300
He was very idealistic,
is he was probably shattered by finding

87
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:53,320
out to the party that he was working for
was corrupting the democratic process.

88
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,590
And because I've said this before,
you know,

89
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:00,850
I've been accused of helping Donald
Trump win by really wacky people online.

90
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:02,830
They're like pointing out all the flaws
of Hillary Clinton.

91
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:03,341
Like,
look,

92
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,710
man,
you can't ignore that shit because you

93
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,490
want one side to.
When I've talked about all of his flaws

94
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,200
to it,
there's a lot of flawed human beings are

95
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,900
run for president.
Pretty much all of them.

96
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,250
I mean,
it's very rare.

97
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,840
We have someone's not flawed,
right?

98
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,670
Extremely flawed.
We're all flawed,

99
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,490
but extremely flawed.
Who wants to be the fucking King of the

100
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,540
world?
It's very rare.

101
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,790
Well,
uh,

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,390
you know,
not to change subjects,

103
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,760
but Barack Obama,
everyone thinks is the greatest guy in

104
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:29,594
the world.
Do you know,

105
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,750
in contrast to Donald Trump?
Because he was polite,

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,030
he was a statesman,
he was a good speaker website.

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
But at the end when he was polite at the
same time,

108
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:40,880
he let cops correct the heads of
peaceful protesters at occupy Wall

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,670
Street all across the country,
said he put on a soft shoe to stand up

110
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:46,100
for unions.
He fucked over unions in Wisconsin when

111
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:48,080
they took the teacher's union a way,
uh,

112
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,210
he opened the Arctic to drilling twice
whenever shell oil wanted.

113
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,063
He said,
okay.

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,470
And he only closed it when they didn't
want to do it anymore.

115
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,280
He took us from two wars to seven.
He cooked out five point 1 million

116
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,830
families out of their homes instead of
helping them.

117
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,010
And he made Wall Street whole while
fucking over everybody else.

118
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,870
So this guy,
he ended,

119
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,820
he made the Bush tax cuts permanent.
So there was a,

120
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,950
what they say is,
uh,

121
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,010
it looked like it was changed on the
outside continuity on the inside,

122
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,080
just completely through the windshield.
That's a negative way.

123
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,620
Is this the flat Earth Guy?
Oh,

124
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:22,180
that guy is crazy.
He's only raised $110 because we need to

125
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,690
know math.
Hold on.

126
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,740
It's only $110 at a $10,000 goal.
Listening flat earthers.

127
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,150
You need to put your money where your
mouth is.

128
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm starting to believe that you don't
really believe in this cause.

129
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,560
Yeah,
send my boy Michael Hughes.

130
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,560
$10,000 and you get your liver spotted.
Hands off.

131
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:41,561
My mother had a couple of shots at him.
He bailed on the fails,

132
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,210
right?
I don't think he's actually does.

133
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,570
He launched himself into space yet.
I think they got the late a few times.

134
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:50,020
The first time he's going to do it.
Then the government got involved and I

135
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:50,481
was like,
yeah,

136
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,920
you can't do that.
Know that is such a crazy move.

137
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Rock doesn't fucking.
He has $10,000.

138
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,250
If Eddie,
you think there is fucking give this guy

139
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,420
some money,
but what about that?

140
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,420
Bob Character isn't even super wealthy.
There's funding a single forever because

141
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,220
he's been too busy with flat earth
theory.

142
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,130
Listen man,
once he understands the fucking real

143
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,880
true image of the earth,
and then you have a wall that surrounds

144
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,580
the outer realm of the earth and
everybody thinks is worth is round.

145
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,470
You got shit to tell the people.
It's more important than your rap song.

146
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,790
You made things run.
You got to get people.

147
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,500
Whoa.
Look at the guy from Brinkley to when

148
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,270
it's moved on,
he moved on.

149
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,850
Y'All got to take this flat earth shit
to the next level.

150
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,510
Fuck the flat versus round argument.
Let's talk more about the simulation and

151
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,930
who's programming it is.
That's how both sides get benefit.

152
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,290
If it's round or flat.
Oh my gosh is crazy.

153
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,180
He's going through some shit.
It's flatter stuff.

154
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:44,931
What else can we tell?
Well,

155
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,240
here's the thing,
and this is something really important

156
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,530
for anybody who's listening to this.

157
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,910
You've got to not hang yourself on your
ideas.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,950
I've done it.
I did in the past.

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,520
When you do that,
you're not really paying attention.

160
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,740
You're only looking for things that
support your idea.

161
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,840
It's called confirmation bias.
Everybody,

162
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,160
if everybody is susceptible to it,
me included,

163
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,060
have.
I've done it 100 times to myself when

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,220
the task,
but once you realize what it is,

165
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,870
if you keep doing the same goddamn
thing,

166
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,130
then you're being stupid.
So once you know what it is and you know

167
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:16,940
it's possible,
we'll do.

168
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,240
Let's just look at this.
Look at all the overwhelming amount of

169
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:25,160
evidence from super geniuses that say
it's around just you gotta walk away,

170
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,630
it's it hurts you.
It hurts your view of the world to

171
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,960
believe that because you can't believe
it if you're really paying attention.

172
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,000
So if you believe that what you're
saying is you have a very limited box in

173
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,470
which you're willing to operate in.

174
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,950
You're not willing to accept anything
outside of what you've already got as a

175
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:47,951
preconceived idea and you're ignoring
massive amounts of data that points to

176
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,180
the fact that you're wrong.
So by doing that,

177
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,100
you limit your own view of yourself,
you,

178
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,340
you,
you become you.

179
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,080
You don't trust in the way you view
things anymore.

180
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,290
Your box.
Then it's very dangerous to be committed

181
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,530
to something you know is not true.
It also shows a level of diligence to

182
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,460
because when you got these geniuses who
spent their entire lives doing doing

183
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:11,150
this stuff and astrophysics,
you're telling me that third part of

184
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:15,170
this scheme to and they believe that
it's 100 percent of the problem.

185
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:19,040
One hundred percent.
It's adopting an idea too soon.

186
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,290
That's 100 percent of the idea because
once you.

187
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,020
Once you adopt that idea and then you
hang onto it,

188
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,910
now you're fucked.
Like bigfoot.

189
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,860
Bigfoot was a big one for me.
I was.

190
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,060
I was convinced it was real with you.
How long ago was this?

191
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,170
A couple weeks when it
drops.

192
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,910
Oh yeah,
that's totally legit.

193
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,601
No,
dude,

194
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,700
if you can get a guy into that position,
that shit will hurt.

195
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,950
Yup.
If you get a guy like Gordon Ryan puts

196
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,480
you in something like that.
Just for fun.

197
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,710
Yeah,
I'll fuck your legs up,

198
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,770
but here's a go back to it again.
I don't think it's a good position for a

199
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:51,620
couple reasons,
so like right there.

200
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,650
It's good if you can get to that,
if you can get to that,

201
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,710
but I'm sure.
Here's the catch dop in him.

202
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,970
I'm not sure what stopping him from
scooting his butt towards that guy's

203
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,720
right leg.
Here's the catch is that if you can roll

204
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,640
over while you're in the figure four leg
lock,

205
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,580
it completely reverses the polars of
the,

206
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,930
uh,
of the,

207
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:15,480
uh,
earth pain of the pain.

208
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,960
So then Rick flair with.
Well,

209
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,980
let me see it again.
By the way,

210
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,800
that's also true in real life.
I've tested that.

211
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,520
Well,
what I'm saying is like the position

212
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,280
you would,
there's a natural way to defend it that

213
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,690
it doesn't seem like the guys defending
it.

214
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,620
That's why like,
look.

215
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,470
Oh,
he's trying to keep them from putting it

216
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:34,891
in there.
Oh,

217
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,080
he stepped on his dick because he's
stepping on his deck a little bit.

218
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,820
That's the undertaker.
You're allowed to.

219
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,610
Okay.
This is a short legs down.

220
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,300
Oh yeah,
that's a heel hook.

221
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,060
Yeah.
Okay.

222
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,670
The guy.
Here's the why.

223
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,580
This is so fucking stupid.
The guy who's getting his leg kranked is

224
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,710
actually the guy who's in the best
position.

225
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,890
He's in a heel hook position.
Yeah.

226
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,300
If you could just grab his leg.
Right.

227
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,580
So who's supposed to be getting hurt
here?

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
This is actually the guy in black.

229
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,700
The guy in black is.
No,

230
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,560
no.
The guy in the better position.

231
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,890
All he has to do is reach back with his
right arm and hook,

232
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,870
timeout,
elbow onto the ankle.

233
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,590
No,
you time out,

234
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,840
motherfucker.
This is not a figure four leg lock.

235
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,550
This is embarrassing.
That's a heel hook.

236
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:14,130
He's given them a heel hook and the
other guys pretending he's in pain.

237
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,560
This is crazy.
This isn't even a figure.

238
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:19,480
Four leg lock to know what this is.
It's an unmodified.

239
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,330
Oh,
come on.

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
Lucky's in agony.
No,

241
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,380
he's got a fucking heel hook.
Take the heel.

242
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:25,470
Look.
It's right there.

243
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:27,510
You go like this.
You clap your hands together.

244
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:30,210
The match is over.
I mean it's 100 percent over in real

245
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:30,990
life.
Yeah.

246
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,320
Well,
what the fuck are they doing that?

247
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,490
What did they do at winners or losers?
Everybody gets a trophy.

248
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,090
Is that what you're doing?
You show in a terrible position.

249
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,930
The guy in white isn't trouble.
What happened?

250
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,460
Oh,
I broke up.

251
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
Yeah,
the other guys doing it wrong for the

252
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,280
whole fucking time.
