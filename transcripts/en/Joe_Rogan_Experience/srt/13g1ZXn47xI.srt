1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,790
But another time I fought,

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:06,624
I used to,

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,890
I used to take the number one bus from
Jersey City Rothberg into high school and

4
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:15,891
we were on the bus one morning kids and
there was a guy reading a paper and he

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:21,261
had a connector of drool from his Lyft
to the daily news and there was a puddle,

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,890
he was on heroin.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,620
They would go to Jersey City in
those days and get methadone.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,590
So they would take the bus up northwest.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,433
So I'm sitting there,

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,610
he's passed the fuck out and there's
got to be just six inches of poplar.

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,770
This guy's been passed out for 20 minutes.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,120
I point my ass at him and I lift
up my hips and a little bit,

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,440
I kept my asshole just pointing out
that even if it wasn't pointed at him,

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,070
he wouldn't ricochet off the chair
and go straight through his mouth.

15
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:52,270
Like he's sitting there
and I let her fuck go out.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,190
I could live to be 80 he lifted
his eyes like this person,

17
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,024
right?

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:58,750
Hey,

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,600
one cause mouth.

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,643
Who the fuck?

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,243
He goes,

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,010
these as and died.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,810
And my little buddies were like,

24
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:16,750
what the fuck and Giggling,

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,310
and he's like,

26
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,100
I should beat the fuck
out of whatever farther.

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,983
I'm just mother.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,490
Fantastic.

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:26,790
Oh,

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,623
Jesus.

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,470
Oh Man.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,500
This is when,

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,700
this is why I hate people.

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,010
This is why I hate when I read posts.

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,820
Gimme a second.
