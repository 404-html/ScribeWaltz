1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,420
Got Publicists with your,
Huh?

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,030
Yeah.
She wanted.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,040
She didn't want me to do this without at
least.

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,130
Definitely don't do that on,
on the air with live.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,770
People are going to get mad at you
tonight on the air and you're hearing it

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:11,910
right now.
It's like,

7
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,010
God dammit.
John John's almost finished.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,490
You had all this time almost finished.
You got to finish that fucking thing.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,190
That's an athlete.
That's someone that works out a lot.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,530
Just like those imperatives,
right?

11
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,450
You got to get that food in there,
which is key.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,800
It is key,
but that's shit.

13
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,170
What are you eating?
What does that kind bar thing?

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,520
It's all bullshit.
Oh,

15
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,410
it is.
But is that a good one?

16
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,140
Is that one ones with the five grams of
sugar or one of them?

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,860
Carmel.
Fake candy bar type five grams of sugar.

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,300
Definitely a little closer to that Jon
Jones.

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,710
How you doing brother on the road?
You know,

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,500
I understand.
I gotta get you some stuff to bring with

21
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:46,950
you,
man.

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,020
Bring some good ones.
He ever,

23
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,890
uh,
ever fuck with that guy.

24
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,290
A primal kitchen.
His,

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,420
his stuff.
He's got some great stuff.

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,660
I'll give you some before you leave.
I'll just try it.

27
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,100
Yeah,
you're doing the number one thing that

28
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,160
people get mad at on this podcast when
we just fight companion podcast is

29
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,070
chewing.
People get furious.

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,380
There's something about being in
someone's ear.

31
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,170
Like my daughter was in my ear last
night and she was chilling.

32
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,140
She's trying to sit on my lap and she
was chewing in my ear and I'm like,

33
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,170
this should not be bothering me.
Like why is this bothered me?

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,570
I was having an internal dialog.
I'm like,

35
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:20,700
honey,
you're eating in my ear and to her.

36
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,840
She's like,
what do you give a fuck?

37
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,020
So I'm eating in your hair.
I'm your baby asshole.

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,260
You give a shit.
How old is your kid that this one?

39
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,430
That was on my lap.
Six August.

40
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,100
I have three.
Oh Great.

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,930
I got a 20.
I got an eight and I got to six.

42
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,493
Wow.

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,970
Good for you.
How many have you got?

44
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,420
A four,
eight,

45
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,130
nine,
eight,

46
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,070
six and three girls.
It's crazy,

47
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,040
right?
I'm going to say so bad.

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,150
Jeremy Stevens says it's the fighters
curse.

49
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,740
I've heard that a bad ass is good old
girl.

50
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,630
My Coleman all girls.
I think don fries got all girls.

51
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,581
Yeah,
I want to sun.

52
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,570
So there's a surgery that you can do.
Oh,

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm where?
I guess they take my semen and they take

54
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,520
out all the girl,
the girl hormones.

55
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,870
Whatever chromosomes injected into the
white gives you like a 97 percent chance

56
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,090
of getting a little boy.
Really?

57
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,560
Uh Huh.
Is that legit if you googled it?

58
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,690
I've heard a lot about it.
I haven't limited,

59
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:21,600
but if it's a possibility that they were
going in that direction for the next

60
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,460
one.
Yeah.

61
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,700
See,
that's one of those things that I would

62
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,890
google.
I would make sure that it's not some

63
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,160
horseshit created by some dude just to
collect your sperm.

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,510
I feel like.
I think I heard Kanye did that to get a

65
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,040
boy the second time.
Oh yeah,

66
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,910
come in.
Income.

67
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,470
Yeah.
I don't know.

68
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,600
I obviously got to look into it
extensively before even trying to go in

69
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,980
that direction,
but that's the plan.

70
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,250
Hopefully it's real when you think in
some way.

71
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,600
Now I'm not really too much of a
spiritual one.

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,110
I wouldn't say I'm spiritual,
but I don't believe in.

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,990
I don't.
How do I phrase this?

74
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,930
Would you worry that you would anger the
gods?

75
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,960
But trying to fuck with DNA.
That's

76
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,870
so funny.
That's a great question.

77
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,400
So I,
I actually thought that,

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,560
you know,
because obviously I'm a religious guy.

79
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,550
I thought that my theory has always been
God is gonna give me a son when I am

80
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,860
mature enough to raise a man,
teacher man,

81
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,680
how to be a man.
So that was always my thing and I felt

82
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,514
like,
um,

83
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,610
I felt like God was waiting for me to
get married before a given me and my

84
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,530
fiance,
this boy that's deep and yeah,

85
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,580
that,
that was my whole theory.

86
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,970
I was just like,
when I'm mature enough and you were

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
married,
you know,

88
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,600
God feels like we're in this good place.
He's going to give us a boy and then I'm

89
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,070
thinking,
you know,

90
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,960
but if we have another girl that trial
and error,

91
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,420
so expensive,
that's 18 more years of raising some

92
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,890
another girl,
you know.

93
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,570
So because me and my wife already had
three,

94
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,060
um,
I call her my wife and my fiance.

95
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,740
She's pretty much,
my wife have been together forever.

96
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,930
Um,
so I'm like,

97
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,110
I didn't want to risk.
I don't want to read.

98
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,700
You think about it in terms of a
financial risk.

99
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,910
Oh yeah,
I can afford to have a thousand kids.

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,950
Like what are you doing?
But that's something that gets ingrained

101
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,110
in your hat.
And people always say,

102
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,620
oh,
the cost of raising kids,

103
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,440
you start thinking about man,
the cost,

104
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,720
the reason it's more at the time.
Yes.

105
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,620
That time that you know,
you to put it in,

106
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,880
like,
you know,

107
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,980
you're raising another little girl and
it's all trial and error.

108
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:19,360
So I'm thinking let's just put a little
science in there.

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,590
And I'm like,
I feel like God gives people the

110
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:26,591
intelligence to come up with
these ideas and these different,

111
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,750
you know,
surgeries or whatever to be able to.

112
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,480
You got to be saying like,
God gives someone the,

113
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,280
the idea to be able to do this.
So maybe he's okay with you.

114
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,510
Choose a boy or girl.

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,540
Well,
they didn't have the foresight when they

116
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:45,541
were writing the Bible to take out
genetic diversity testing or whatever

117
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,570
the fuck they're doing.
What,

118
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,740
what?
What would they be doing?

119
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:52,120
Like some sort of DNA,
chromosomal jazz.

120
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't know what they're doing.
I don't know what the process is.

121
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,910
Yeah,
well people,

122
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,120
I mean wouldn't you say personally that
like people who are religious,

123
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,930
almost all of them sort of pick and
choose what they decide to agree with

124
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,150
and not agree with you.
You're a religious person,

125
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:12,151
but you have a tattoo of you have a
religious hatoon which is double ironic

126
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,550
as it says in the Bible not to get
tattoos.

127
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,700
Right.
Not to mess with the temple.

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,920
Right.
But then you gotta pick and choose what

129
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,630
you were listening to.
That's not the way it's supposed to go

130
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:25,420
either,
but you know where I'm perfect and he

131
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,254
knows that.

132
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Do you think when you were talking about
like I'm wanting to wait until or that

133
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,680
God would give you this opportunity when
you are more mature,

134
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,480
when you were mature enough to raise a
man?

135
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,610
Do you think about that?
Like man,

136
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,380
why do I have to wait?
Like,

137
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:44,360
why am I not mature enough right now?
Like,

138
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,440
if I can internalize that and if I can
understand that,

139
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:51,970
like what is the difference between me
in the future when I am mature enough to

140
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,500
have a man and me right now?
Like,

141
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,650
why,
why have I not learned enough lessons?

142
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,190
Why not having

143
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,660
a balance myself out enough?

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,790
I feel like I,
I've,

145
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,050
I've learned lessons every year,
you know,

146
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,390
every month,
every day.

147
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,520
I feel like I'm growing as a person,
as a man,

148
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:09,370
but I only,
I know about some demons that I still

149
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:13,570
struggle with and,
and I feel as if when I'm over those,

150
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,380
um,
I'll feel outfit ready to be able to

151
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,090
raise them and teach me how to be a
proper bed.

152
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,210
But you don't feel like you're over
overdose yet.

153
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,680
No.
Middle of it,

154
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:27,400
you're in the struggle.
I'm definitely of still in the struggle

155
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:27,861
of,
of,

156
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,050
of some things,
you know.

157
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,190
But,
um,

158
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,430
but I've definitely got over a lot of
things that I,

159
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,650
that I used to struggle with it,
which I'm excited about.

160
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,753
But,
you know,

161
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,470
life is,
is a,

162
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,760
it's a work in progress.

163
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,560
Well,
you were telling me before the show that

164
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:41,900
you,
uh,

165
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,110
you don't do instagram anymore,
you're not doing anything,

166
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,380
you just sort of laying low.
You're not doing any interviews.

167
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:47,880
So like before you were about to do
this,

168
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:48,611
you're like,
oh shit,

169
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,380
I haven't done anything like this in a
while.

170
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,261
Yeah,
yeah.

171
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,340
The main reason why I decided to come on
your show was um,

172
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm getting ready to do this grappling
match against Dan Henderson on the 11th

173
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,740
and um,
there's gonna be a lot of media

174
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,480
surrounding it and there was a lot of,
you know,

175
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:06,590
I got to do like a one hour phone or
with a bunch of different media guys.

176
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,320
And then there's a,
a few reporters that's got to be there

177
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,510
physically to,
to do some interviews with me.

178
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,960
And I felt like this is kind of just
like a lot of things kind of untalked

179
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,420
about and you know,
people are just wondering how I'm

180
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,070
feeling and what I'm,
what I've been up to and stuff like

181
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,720
that.
And I didn't want to have to answer the

182
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,330
same exact questions over and over 4,000
people,

183
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,320
so I was just like,
you know what,

184
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,950
Joe Rogan has a lot of respect amongst
the mma community and you know,

185
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,770
his fellow goes obviously beyond the mma
community.

186
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,210
He's a smart guy and I was just like,
you know,

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,610
I'd rather let me just talk with you
about kind of everything and get it out

188
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:39,020
of the way.
Um,

189
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,980
but yeah,
outside of this,

190
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,200
this interview with you,
I have not really done anything publicly

191
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,640
since July when the UFC 200 scans.

192
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,440
So you've been on a crazy ride just not
just through July,

193
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:55,430
but for the last couple of years you've
been been involved in a lot of crazy

194
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,264
shit,
you know,

195
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,640
what are you,
have you been,

196
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,400
are you disappointed in yourself with a
lot of this stuff that I am.

197
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,510
I totally am.
I totally am.

198
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah.
What does it feel like?

199
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:04,830
Like,
like,

200
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,440
like,
like Gimme the thought.

201
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:10,130
Like we can go through all of them,
but give me the thought like probably

202
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:12,740
the most.
I was disappointed in you and I love you

203
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,930
as a person.
I think you're a great guy to jail

204
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:15,950
things.
I really do.

205
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,840
I've always had a good time hanging out
with you,

206
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,900
but I was very disappointed with you
with that car accident.

207
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,330
When you ran away from that car
accident.

208
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,550
That to me was like God Damn Johnson.
Yeah,

209
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,401
place.
Yeah,

210
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:26,850
it was.
It was.

211
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,440
I was at a bad place.
It was a.

212
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,870
It was a messed up situation,
man.

213
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:33,060
I literally was an important mental
life.

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,820
Then when I was winning all these
fights,

215
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,390
I was the boy in the UFC.
I'm sponsored by Nike and Gatorade and

216
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,380
you know,
the greatest of all time finishing

217
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,390
legends after legend after legend.
I'm just really in this position where I

218
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,610
felt so untouchable and I just felt like
I felt like everything was meant to go

219
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:01,290
my way and in that time of my life
started to.

220
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,030
I was obviously,
I was smoking pot,

221
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,250
you know,
majority of my career of drake

222
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,590
drink and you know,
every weekend pretty much,

223
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,030
you know,
to the point of blacking out.

224
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,380
Just lacking out.
Yeah.

225
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,970
Just just being a hammer,
you know,

226
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,580
and just being a total party boy,
but still,

227
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,270
I'm still training my butt off,
you know,

228
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,370
I'm working really hard believer in
really hired,

229
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,510
have big goals,
big dreams,

230
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,280
but just being a party boy and I think I
just took everything that I have for

231
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:33,090
granted because everything for the
majority of my career has gone my way.

232
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,350
And um,
that,

233
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,050
that morning I got in a car accident,
man,

234
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,180
I just,
it was,

235
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,890
it was just,
it was,

236
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,160
it was a huge reality check and it was,
you know,

237
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:46,320
I think in some people's mind they
envisioned me,

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,440
you know,
hitting this car and running up and

239
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,290
seeing that it was a pregnant lady and
then it off Vernon.

240
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,130
And then people said that I came back
and grabbed a load of money,

241
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,470
which is the stupidest thing ever.
Why?

242
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,360
With a millionaire and need to grab
cash,

243
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,550
right?
Unless you run back to the car.

244
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,650
So I literally,
I went through a light,

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,790
um,
it was like a green light that said that

246
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,300
I could turn left,
but you're supposed to yield for the

247
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,460
right of way,
right to turn left.

248
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,020
And um,
um,

249
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,700
person came through and I,
I just assumed it was my green light to

250
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,770
go,
obviously being I'm not completely clear

251
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:28,604
headed.

252
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,430
And I ended up running into a car.
Um,

253
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,590
I was definitely disoriented.
I'm disoriented from the accident,

254
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,870
from the accident for sure.
Just kinda like what the hell just

255
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,220
happened.
It was a really big hit,

256
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,700
but that was fine.
I had no injuries and I just felt like,

257
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,420
well maybe it wasn't that bad of a hit.
So I literally,

258
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,450
um,
step out of the car and I realized like

259
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,570
seconds later I realized my bulls in the
car.

260
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,570
So you bowl my ball,
my.

261
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:00,940
Yeah,
my,

262
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,471
my,
my,

263
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:03,000
yeah,
my pop pop pot.

264
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,300
Yeah.
And I wasn't smoking weed in the car or

265
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,320
anything,
but it was in the car,

266
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,810
but my bowl that had residue was in the
car.

267
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,240
So I literally,
I open my car door,

268
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,320
I'd like to take two steps away from the
car and then I go back to the car and I

269
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,460
searched the car because I had it in my
cup holder and when I hit the ball fell

270
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:23,640
somewhere.

271
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,860
Who knows where it flute you.
But I knew,

272
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,780
I knew shit.
Like I can't find that bull that's gonna

273
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,610
get me in trouble and just having a bowl
of my car.

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,630
So I looked for like two seconds and
find the ball and I just took off

275
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:37,550
running.
Um,

276
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,450
did you look at the other person in the
other car?

277
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,160
No,
I had no clue that it was a woman.

278
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,080
I had no clue that it was a pregnant
woman.

279
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,610
How much time are we talking about?
Like from the time literally from the

280
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,030
time that I hit,
I had,

281
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,780
I had,
I had,

282
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,130
I was over a fence probably eight
seconds later.

283
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,350
It was,
it was literally a super reactionary,

284
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,650
like just,
I just felt I hadn't been home yet.

285
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:03,580
I say that a friend's house.
I wasn't drinking and driving.

286
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,110
I,
you know,

287
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,570
my decision was to sleep at my friend's
house because I knew I couldn't drive

288
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:07,900
home.

289
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,450
He woke up early the next morning to go
to work and he's like,

290
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:13,600
John,
feel free to stay here and uh,

291
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,280
you know,
you can make yourself breakfast or

292
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,390
whatever,
whatever.

293
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,900
And the guy has a family,
he has a wife and he has a newborn baby

294
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,180
and I didn't want to stay at his house
while he's at work.

295
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,680
So I was just like,
no,

296
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,620
I think I'm okay.
But really I had maybe like two hours of

297
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,740
sleep and um,
I didn't realize that I was still wasn't

298
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,330
ready to drive.
So,

299
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,940
um,
you know,

300
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,300
I wake up and get in my car and uh,
you know,

301
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,940
I just wasn't ready to drive or whatnot.
But um,

302
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,500
why didn't you look at the other car
because it all happened so fast.

303
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,730
Yeah,
sorry.

304
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,690
Yeah.
So it all happens so fast and um,

305
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,800
I just knew I was a,
I knew I smelled like alcohol and um,

306
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,630
I just felt like if the police came out
it would be a bad situation for me.

307
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,680
And um,
I just thought the person that I hit had

308
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,690
to have been okay because I was totally
okay.

309
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,880
I was like,
maybe this collision wasn't that hard.

310
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,150
Um,
so I just feel like in a lot of people's

311
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:14,710
minds they see me as like a,
I knew it was this woman,

312
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,940
I saw this woman hanging out the window
crying and bleeding and sort of

313
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,680
something like that.
And like I just chose the lever and I

314
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,300
didn't know what I had it.
No,

315
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,250
if I had a truck,
I didn't know if I hit a uh,

316
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,600
a punch bug,
I didn't know what it was that I had.

317
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:30,360
I just knew it was another vehicle you
didn't even look.

318
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,493
No,
I didn't look.

319
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,030
Wow.
And I didn't go back for cash,

320
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,540
but it doesn't make a,
it doesn't make a what I did.

321
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:40,960
Okay.
The fact that,

322
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,700
you know,
I didn't go back for cash and I really

323
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,660
went back for my boy,
that's,

324
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,350
that's no better.

325
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,420
Right.
Um,

326
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,340
full situation was just a shitty
situation I was in.

327
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,430
I was in a really bad point in my life.
Taking everything for granted.

328
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,760
If you wanted to have a situation come
up with just like worst case scenario,

329
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,440
that is the worst case scenario.
Pregnant woman.

330
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,480
Oh yeah.
It makes me like a monster.

331
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,600
It makes me look a monster.
When you found out I was pregnant woman,

332
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,010
what was,
what was going through your mind?

333
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,120
I thought,
man,

334
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,680
I am.
I'm done.

335
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,980
I'm done.
First I was afraid that there will be

336
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,910
some type of,
uh,

337
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,340
problems with their baby because,
you know,

338
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,590
obviously if she had a difficult
pregnancy then that's,

339
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,270
that's a whole different level of being
in trouble and God forbid if she was

340
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,140
having a miscarriage,
um,

341
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,960
you know,
I would imagine that that would be

342
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,580
$1,000 to put on me.
So I thought about the fact that I went

343
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,581
from just partying and join this career
and this amazing fairytale life I went

344
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:40,540
from.

345
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,780
I thought I was going from that to like
literally being in jail,

346
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,670
being labeled as a murderer.
So that was my,

347
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,340
that was my number one
thing,

348
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:51,830
was just hoping that the baby was okay.
What about,

349
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,440
what were you thinking about yourself?
Like when you did that,

350
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:55,274
when you read,
I mean,

351
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,830
there's no way you can be happy with
yourself that you did that.

352
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,560
What were you thinking?
Well,

353
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,610
I,
uh,

354
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,590
me and my mom have a great relationship.
I'm a mama's boy.

355
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,540
Um,
um,

356
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,630
and then I'm the father of four
daughters.

357
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,860
So,
um,

358
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,960
you know,
if anything,

359
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:12,710
my,
my,

360
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,710
my respect for,
for women is I have tremendous respect

361
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:20,380
for a woman and I tried to like,
uh,

362
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,870
obviously being a father,
I like,

363
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:24,704
I try to,

364
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,930
I just felt like a monster.
I feel like a monster,

365
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,790
you know what I mean?
Um,

366
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,360
I just felt terrible.
I felt I felt really bad.

367
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:39,580
I was just,
I was mainly concerned with this woman's

368
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,940
health and safety and I'm really glad
that she ended up being okay.

369
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,080
I felt really bad.
I was just like,

370
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,980
do even in the public's eyes,
like you just heard a pregnant woman

371
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,210
like doesn't really get worse than that
but,

372
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,420
but yeah,
I had no clue.

373
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,590
I had no clue that was even a woman that
I hit and I felt terrible.

374
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,040
And what was the,
what was not just the,

375
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,210
what was the reaction from your family
and friends?

376
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,803
Um,
you know,

377
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,110
surprisingly it was,
it was okay.

378
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:10,950
You know,
um,

379
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,000
they,
they,

380
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:17,250
they support me so much and they love me
so much and they know that,

381
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,750
you know,
that I haven't really,

382
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,520
uh,
I believe I have a good heart.

383
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,920
They know that I have a good heart.
Um,

384
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,670
and they were just were just thinking

385
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,240
man,
like did anybody step in and say,

386
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:29,740
hey man,
you gotta get your shit together.

387
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,370
Oh,
I've had,

388
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,420
I've had a lot of people telling me I
need to get my shit together.

389
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,240
And what was it about?
Like what besides that,

390
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,150
what do you mean?
Like besides this one instance,

391
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,930
what other things would people come to
you and say,

392
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,360
Hey John,
you gotta get your shit together.

393
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,510
Well,
kind of all of it,

394
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,700
all,
everything that's happened over the last

395
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,570
two years.
What makes people feel like they can

396
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,250
tell me that I need to get my shit
together?

397
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:56,251
And I recently,
I recently went outside to my growers.

398
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:59,560
My garbage man was coming up and I was
late getting one of the garbage out to

399
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,850
the side of the road,
so he waited for me and I've even told

400
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:06,490
me he was like,
he was dumping garbage and he's like,

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,980
hey man,
like I'm waiting to see you fight again.

402
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,480
It's like you really need to get it
together.

403
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Man.
Just parked outside of my little kitchen

404
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,480
pretty much just telling me to get my
shit together.

405
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,850
I've taken like,
everybody feels like they have the right

406
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:25,240
to tell me to get my shit together.
I'm at the end of the day,

407
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:27,430
you know,
I sit there and I humbly take it because

408
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,230
the right.
Uh,

409
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:29,920
yeah,
they're right.

410
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,450
But at the same time,
you know,

411
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,270
how many motherfuckers in the world,
you know what I mean,

412
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:39,271
like so many people
are into all types of crazy shit and

413
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,700
don't compare yourself to the losers and
the losers.

414
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:43,980
I know what you're talking to me,
you know what I mean?

415
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,240
Can say hey,
well compared to dudes like to go out

416
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,980
and who knows,
who knows?

417
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,120
I'm fine.
Exactly.

418
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,290
Knows what we're shit this guy's.
And he's telling me to get my shit

419
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,650
together.
It's like just because mostly it's

420
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,580
publicly don't mean you're any better
than I am.

421
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,440
That's true.
But you know that that conflict is never

422
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:01,620
ending and you can't get involved in it.
That that conflict that you're starting

423
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,760
up in your own brain right now.
It's a rationalization conflict.

424
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,270
You start rationalizing your behavior
versus well,

425
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,860
a lot of other people do worse where a
lot of that is a dead end,

426
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,430
a bad road that a lot of people go down
to make themselves feel better.

427
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,110
The only thing that can make you feel
better is to be pure or your shit

428
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,090
together.
Like if someone comes up to me and says,

429
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,190
Hey man,
you've been ripping off old ladies and

430
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:24,750
stealing money from the church,
I'd be like,

431
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,310
fuck you.
Talking to him about it doesn't make any

432
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:27,420
sense.
That's not true at all.

433
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,270
So if someone says something to you,
that's rude,

434
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,180
that's not true.
It doesn't have any impact on you.

435
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,180
But when someone says something to you,
that's rude but true,

436
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,940
then you have to rationalize and then
you have to go,

437
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,110
well,
what about you man?

438
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,930
What's going on in your life?
Maybe you're into some dark shit.

439
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,400
You know,
that's a,

440
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,050
that's a bad road.
And it's a,

441
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,780
it's a defensive road.
And as a fighter it's a natural

442
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:49,601
instinct.
Somebody hits you,

443
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,110
you hit him back so many attacks you,
you won't.

444
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,590
Yeah.
But what about your weaknesses?

445
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,390
And you want to try to search them out.
And I'm sure a lot of people go through

446
00:18:57,391 --> 00:19:00,720
that when they read social media and
they see these anonymous eggs on twitter

447
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,940
saying mean shit to you.
You Start Thinking,

448
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,620
oh,
I want to know who this fucking guy is

449
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,870
and what's going on in his fucking.
I'm like,

450
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,250
that is a trap.
That's a trap.

451
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,460
Well,
you know,

452
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,040
like I said,
I do respectfully take it like I've

453
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,460
never had someone say,
hey,

454
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:14,320
you know,
get it together,

455
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,520
John.
And then I sit there and be like,

456
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:15,881
oh,
well,

457
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,000
you know,
I always,

458
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,990
I always,
you know,

459
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,610
thank you so much for caring.
Thank you so much for your route for me

460
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:24,890
still and I and I really appreciate it
and I'm working at it and,

461
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,690
and I,
I seriously have been working on my

462
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:32,740
personal life tremendously and as of
right now I feel,

463
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,390
I feel amazing.
I feel better now today than I did when

464
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:41,770
I was a beating everybody's ass and you
know,

465
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,610
sponsored by the world and like I
literally feel better today because I,

466
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,310
I feel like I've conquered a lot of
demons in my personal life.

467
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,620
May feel better,
meaning you feel more at peace

468
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,740
more at peace,
you know,

469
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,000
like not worried about social media all
the time like that,

470
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,770
that has brought a lot of peace to me.
Not worried about what people are

471
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,750
saying,
not even worrying about what's going on

472
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,510
in the UFC.
Like who has the builder or,

473
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,640
or,
you know,

474
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,430
just just,
just being Jonathan Jones and having my,

475
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,160
my group of friends,
um,

476
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,280
across the country who gender like a
genuinely loved me focusing on my kids

477
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,630
every day.
You know,

478
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,240
taking my girls to cheerleading,
practice,

479
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:26,130
picking them up from school,
dropping off at school.

480
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,950
Basic stuff like me and me and my
fiance,

481
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,720
um,
you know,

482
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,030
living light,
feel on top of stuff.

483
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,300
Yeah.
Being the top of stuff,

484
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,970
you know,
I'll go men no debts,

485
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,400
you know,
everything's caught up.

486
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,350
Everything's,
everything's spot on,

487
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,120
you know,
things I wanted to get fixed around the

488
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:42,790
house,
you know,

489
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,920
that paint chip is paint it now.
Everything's just,

490
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,660
everything's going to.
Everything is so put together right now.

491
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,800
My life,
um,

492
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,720
outside of sports is.
And uh,

493
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,600
obviously haven't had the clear mind.
Something that I haven't had in a long

494
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,740
time,
you know,

495
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,870
I just feel I just feel really good
right now.

496
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,820
So um,
as far as.

497
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,420
And then,
and then also being in a position where

498
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:09,700
I don't even really need to fight
against it either.

499
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah.
Financially

500
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,110
like don't you though?
Don't you though in your mind?

501
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,440
Oh yeah.
I have to fight because I have to fight

502
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,910
because of the story.
Can't end like this.

503
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,700
Yeah.
Well it's like the financial thing is

504
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,700
beautiful and everything like that.
It's wonderful that you're set for life

505
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,160
and you can just kick back and your
children will be taken care of.

506
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,380
And your wife would be taken care of.
That's all beautiful.

507
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,160
But you have a responsibility of
greatness.

508
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,500
There's very few people that ever get to
the position that you,

509
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,110
not just,
we're in when you won the title,

510
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,510
when you were the youngest ever ufc
heavyweight or light heavyweight

511
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,400
champion.
Not just that,

512
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,970
the youngest ever UFC champion.
Now,

513
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,700
not just that.
There's also a responsibility that comes

514
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,950
with potential.
It's not,

515
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,280
it's not just with what you've done and
you know,

516
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,280
it's what you could have done.
Right?

517
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,260
You,
you fought Alexander Gustafson,

518
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,710
be honest about that.
How much did you train for that

519
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,280
fight?
I trained,

520
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,050
I trained for the fight,
but,

521
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,040
but I,
um,

522
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,490
I definitely,
I had this thing where I just felt

523
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:16,180
invincible and uh,
did a lot of wild stuff leading up to

524
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,010
the fight.
I definitely didn't give it my all

525
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,540
as far as partying and sleeping right.
Bailey party and stay up all night.

526
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

527
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,310
I mean,
when you win a fight like that where you

528
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:33,260
weren't 100 percent,
does that sort of almost reinforced this

529
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,850
idea that you could do anything you
want?

530
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:35,331
And then,
man,

531
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:37,790
imagine if I trained next time,
if it's someone big,

532
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,410
I'll train.

533
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,160
Yeah.
So I have this,

534
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm going to share something with,
I'm not sure if I've ever shared this

535
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,240
with anyone else before,
but I had this crazy thing that I would

536
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,550
do,
um,

537
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,080
where I would party one week before
every fight and I did it throughout my

538
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:54,050
whole career and uh,
and it was stupid,

539
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,390
but it was this mental crutch that I
had.

540
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,810
I literally would one week before every
flight I would go out and I will get

541
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:06,770
blacked out wasted.
And my logic was if this guy were to

542
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:11,771
beat me somehow I'm at,
I can look myself in the mirror and say

543
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,123
that,
well,

544
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,860
I lost because I got hammered the week
before the fight.

545
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,710
So it was a built in safety net.
It was a safety net.

546
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,670
Yeah,
exactly.

547
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,790
So I did it my whole career.
I,

548
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,260
I would go out and get hammered when we,
before every fight.

549
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,880
Have you ever worked with a sports
psychologist?

550
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,260
No,
but now,

551
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,780
but now I don't have my,
my,

552
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,690
um,
my old st proof.

553
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:38,900
I was the first fight that I did not do
that.

554
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,190
Worse performance.
So what was your worst performance?

555
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:46,040
I think you were very unjustly
criticized that fight because I think

556
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,050
over in St.
[inaudible] is a very tough guy.

557
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,120
He's a very difficult five,
is very strong.

558
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,850
He's got a brutal left kick.
He's athletic.

559
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,490
He moves well.
I believe it was a good performance,

560
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,590
but it was still worst before.
Let's see.

561
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:00,770
I think over st proves a really tough
guy and he was a tough fight.

562
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:04,160
And you hadn't fought in a long time.
You were off for how long?

563
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:05,700
How many months?
Sixteen months or something?

564
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:06,940
Yeah,
it was,

565
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,220
it was over a year.
Yeah,

566
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,320
it was a long time.
Over a year ago.

567
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,770
Yeah.

568
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,410
And then you're fighting a guy who had
been pretty active and fought some good

569
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,540
guys,
had a great victory,

570
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,990
was shogun and looked real good.
And a lot of his fights and was an up

571
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,520
and comer.

572
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,880
Main thing about events that really
bothered me was,

573
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,600
um,
he was,

574
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,660
he was the most,
um,

575
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,650
while he was seizing.
Hey actually has been fighting longer

576
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:29,090
than I have.
A lot of people don't realize that,

577
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,480
but he was just so
green and raw still like skill wise,

578
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,440
skill wise.
Like I,

579
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,540
I don't.
Um,

580
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,240
I studied everybody extensively and then
I come up with their patterns.

581
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,880
Um,
I figured out the way they flinch.

582
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,010
I figured out their first favorite
punch,

583
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,420
their second favorite punch,
that third,

584
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,140
their favorite combinations that set up.
So they take downs when they clinched

585
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:54,050
what side of the head is going to be a
literally everything I know everything

586
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:56,090
about every opponent,
what side they're going to shoot,

587
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,740
whether it's going to be a head inside
his head outside.

588
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,200
What am I going to do about that?
You know,

589
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,740
I figured out everything.

590
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,700
Why they shoot,
where,

591
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,460
what area of the cage they like to shoot
everything.

592
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,690
Um,
and uh,

593
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,160
with in St [inaudible] he,
he,

594
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:09,770
he,
he doesn't know what he's gonna do.

595
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,830
He's so that are unorthodox,
you know,

596
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,770
and he gets these random knockouts from
weird angles and he's just wing stuff

597
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,600
and he almost closes his eyes and next
thing you know,

598
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:21,990
he's knocked somebody out.
You know,

599
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,750
so the scary thing about him was a,
he's so unpredictable and so,

600
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,180
and I had a lot on the line.
Um,

601
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:30,380
so I just said,
you know what,

602
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,260
this guy is a,
he's in a shell pretty much the whole

603
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,130
fight.
He was defensive,

604
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:37,040
the whole fight and uh,
and I just thought I had coached through

605
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,030
the fight,
um,

606
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,930
and not really risk anything which I
felt like I let myself down because I'm

607
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,690
normally,
I would just,

608
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,330
I mean normally when you get someone
like that you just,

609
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,590
you know,
take them out,

610
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,940
you know,
you should,

611
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,200
I should have just been able to take
them out.

612
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:54,890
But I was content with winning and I
think that was,

613
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,820
I think that was one of the first fights
where I actually just wanted to get the

614
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,140
win,
get my money,

615
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,290
go back to what I,
my actual goal,

616
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,880
which was Thisi,
um,

617
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:07,250
instead of wanting to finish this guy
like normal.

618
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:12,220
So I had to really question my,
I really questioned myself and why I'm

619
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,230
like,
I was like that while I was content with

620
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,020
coasting.

621
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,160
Well,
that was a fight where you,

622
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,540
that had the most pressure on you and
then in a fight you've had before as far

623
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:26,220
as like people wanting to see how you
respond to the adversity outside of the

624
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:26,800
octagon.

625
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,060
Right,
right.

626
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,260
I agree.
I agree.

627
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:33,190
I had a lot of pressure and I feel like
I responded great to my adversity.

628
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,040
You know,
I did all the things I had to do to get

629
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:36,874
back,
to

630
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,740
get back to the stage,
you know,

631
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:44,580
I handled all my probation obligations
and,

632
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,130
and um,
and I,

633
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,920
I stayed healthy,
started powerlifting and hired a

634
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:51,950
nutritionist.
I looked better than ever.

635
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:54,380
I felt better than ever physically.
Um,

636
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,480
I did everything I had to do Amanda up
and was responsible for my actions.

637
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,060
Yeah.
Was it Greg Jackson that thought that

638
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:04,970
the power lifting might have a bit of an
effect on your performance?

639
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,850
You thought that you were doing too much
of that?

640
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,471
Yeah,
well,

641
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,090
I was doing too much of it.
So,

642
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,910
um,
I literally,

643
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,300
I started power lifting and I took off
seven months of martial arts training.

644
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,260
I didn't show up to Jackson's for seven
months and I,

645
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,120
I showed up to this place called Zia
strength systems,

646
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,850
um,
powerlifting gym.

647
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,020
I'm four days a week just getting
jacked,

648
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,340
getting jacked,
African American.

649
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,180
I became obsessed with lifting heavy
weight and I literally didn't know

650
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:41,181
martial arts training.
And then about four months out from the

651
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:45,120
fight I started to come into the room a
little bit more.

652
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,860
And then only three months before the
fight,

653
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,510
did I actually start a training camp?

654
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,311
No.
Why?

655
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:51,840
Why did you do that?
As far as like cardio and things like

656
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,040
that,
wouldn't you think that your cardio

657
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,530
would dramatically suffer from just
lifting weights?

658
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,450
I did a lot.
I had a lot of weight to it

659
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,590
because I had gotten big and I,
uh,

660
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,310
I actually did a lot of,
um,

661
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,830
a lot of cardio training,
but I was also,

662
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,830
I had these new coaches,
new strength and conditioning coaches

663
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:11,160
who specialize in powerlifting.
So I had to almost,

664
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,810
we had to come up with a plan together
of how we're going to start not weight

665
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:18,180
lifting and doing all cardio.
And even at the beginning stages it was

666
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:18,481
like,
okay,

667
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,100
well let's just look lighter,
weights more.

668
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,821
And I'm saying,
no,

669
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:21,151
no,
no,

670
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,460
I need like cardio,
cardio.

671
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,950
And so it was just like a big learning
thing that we had to do that.

672
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,020
Yeah.
So these guys,

673
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,940
were they,
were they involved in martial arts at

674
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,150
all these,
uh,

675
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,280
my power lifting coach,
I know they were so,

676
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,650
but,
and they were giving you advice about

677
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:36,260
martial arts training,
sort of learning on the job?

678
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,460
Yeah,
kind of literally the job,

679
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:39,350
but they weren't giving me advice about
martial arts training,

680
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,250
they,
they,

681
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,990
um,
it was just a learning curve.

682
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:45,560
I don't think they had ever worked with
an endurance athlete the way that I am.

683
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,540
And so I'm mostly,
they work with football players or power

684
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,760
lift.
They work with a Philadelphia Eagle and

685
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,040
a lot of power lifters.
Yeah.

686
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,630
Um,
but these guys,

687
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,590
to their credit,
they were really humble and they,

688
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,630
they listened and they were able to
quickly adjusted what we were doing

689
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:03,670
every day to make it more about,
um,

690
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,580
endurance and not about maintaining
muscle and strength and things like

691
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,530
that.
And I felt like I got in really good

692
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:10,460
shape with these guys,
so,

693
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,940
and now we're at a place because I'm
still working with these same guys and

694
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,570
now we're at a place where,
um,

695
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,700
we realized the importance of endurance,
that we're going to start way farther

696
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:20,820
out and,
and,

697
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,090
and like I said,
these guys are humble enough to do what

698
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:25,940
I need them to do is put me through some
strenuous workouts that I think are a

699
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:28,130
great ideal racial differences in the
right place.

700
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,750
So other than the fact that you did so
much strength and conditioning or so

701
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:33,670
much power lifting,
what else?

702
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,540
Like what did you feel when you got into
the octagon when you fought over in St

703
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,160
Jude,
did you feel stronger?

704
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:42,790
Did you feel like your endurance had
been diminished slightly because of all

705
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:43,630
this power lifting?

706
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,640
Well,
I'm like,

707
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,660
so,
so like I was saying,

708
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:46,950
I,
uh,

709
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,190
I took off seven months of martial arts
and then I did a three month campaign.

710
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,510
And so if you like anything,
if you take off seven months,

711
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:58,150
if anything,
your game is going to change a little

712
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:00,310
bit.
So literally throughout my training camp

713
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,530
I found myself trying to get learning
how to fight again,

714
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,960
pretty much I felt like timing,
timing was off I creativity was off the

715
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:13,390
things that,
that go to moves that I used to do

716
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:14,790
weren't quite there.
Um,

717
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,580
I would watch some of my old training
practices or my old fights and I'm like,

718
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:20,170
man,
I'm not doing this stuff that I was

719
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:21,600
doing before.
Um,

720
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,080
so I was really nervous going into.
I knew that I was ready to beat dc

721
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,920
because I was so well rehearsed and like
the drills and everything were so Robert

722
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,230
hearst to be DC.

723
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,450
But as far as going into the fight will
open St Pruett.

724
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,910
I just felt that my creativity was Kinda
gone in my ability to improvise or

725
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,130
wasn't quite there.
And that was just from taking off so

726
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,390
much time,
uh,

727
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,410
from martial arts.
So in the fight with ogen St Prue,

728
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,250
um,
I felt really strong.

729
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,930
I felt really,
really strong,

730
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,640
like picking him up against the cage
and,

731
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,670
and,
and taking them down felt effortless.

732
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,460
Um,
as opposed to the way you used to feel,

733
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,920
you felt stronger.
I felt I felt really strong.

734
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:00,760
Yeah,
stronger.

735
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,410
Um,
what else?

736
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,330
Um,
endurance felt good.

737
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,590
It felt good.
It wasn't as sharp as normal,

738
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:11,320
like a few times when when I took him
down,

739
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:17,070
I remember I wound up in a punch and I
do a big punch and then I wound up and

740
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:19,760
then I hit,
hit him again in DC.

741
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,550
Said it was in the back of the head
which wasn't.

742
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,070
It was on the neck,
but

743
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,430
I was throwing big shots.
I know Vince instead of throwing a whole

744
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:34,000
bunch of shots and that was because I
was feeling lactic acid in my arms.

745
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,300
So I'm.
So that kind of made me nervous that I

746
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:40,030
didn't have the normal level of
endurance that are normally have.

747
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,590
Do you think that's because you had more
muscle bulk?

748
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,431
I think it was,
yeah,

749
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,730
I think it is because they have more,
most of bulk but on the bright side and

750
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:47,920
not that this is a good thing to,
to injure someone,

751
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:51,400
but I didn't break or fracture his arm
with a kick and that's something that

752
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,800
I've never done before.
So that showed me.

753
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:57,780
That definitely came.
That has to be connected to just develop

754
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,520
and so much power in my hips,
into my legs.

755
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,630
It's a point of like a balancing tipping
point,

756
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,460
right?
Where it's like strength versus

757
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:08,230
endurance and trying to find that
perfect.

758
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,820
Right.
And right now,

759
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,750
as,
as,

760
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,830
as I sit here today,
um,

761
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,023
I'm,
uh,

762
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,810
I'm using my past experience and you
know,

763
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,580
to measure what I'm doing as we speak.
So right now I'm strong as hell.

764
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,800
Um,
but my insurance is actually in a really

765
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,880
good place right now and I'm not
fighting until July.

766
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,040
So now we're figuring it out right now
as we speak.

767
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,280
When you got really big,
were you doing that?

768
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,450
Were you thinking,
Hey,

769
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,400
you know,
one day I'm going to fight heavyweight.

770
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,270
Let's see what I would be like as a
heavy.

771
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:35,720
Wait.
No,

772
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,151
no,
I didn't.

773
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,250
No,
I didn't know what I was going to do at

774
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,510
that point.
Um,

775
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,160
I just,
I just needed something to be passionate

776
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,540
about.
Um,

777
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,030
something that's to be competitive about
while you were suspended.

778
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,110
Suspended.
Yeah.

779
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,741
And uh,
you know,

780
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,550
I,
I,

781
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,550
I went through a real self destructive
state right after the car accident and

782
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:58,190
then how,
so I just started to party more.

783
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,110
I was,
I was really,

784
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,260
I was really depressed.
Yeah.

785
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:05,261
The belt had been stripped from me and
I'm not until Anthony Johnson and Dcf,

786
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,580
uh,
um,

787
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,780
that first time that I did,
I joined the gym and get my,

788
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,770
get my self together.

789
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,120
Why was that?
Just watching that fight competing for

790
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:16,540
your belt?

791
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,980
Yeah,
just seeing them compete for the bill.

792
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,180
That's myself,
man.

793
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:24,181
I am wasting and wasting talent.
I'm wasting everything.

794
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:25,024
Like,
you know,

795
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,580
I believe I can be both of these guys
and they're up there and uh,

796
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,060
on tv where I should be and I'm sitting
here at home,

797
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,030
I'm kind of,
you know,

798
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,270
living in this depression.
And so I'm literally,

799
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:39,260
the next day I called,
uh,

800
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,740
the,
I walked down there stoned,

801
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,710
right?
And,

802
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,380
and,
uh,

803
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,213
just like,
Hey,

804
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,870
I need to get my life together.
I need something.

805
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:52,030
I need something to
be excited about,

806
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:56,160
something to,
to inspire and motivate me,

807
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,520
get me up,
get me out of the house.

808
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,810
And,
uh,

809
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,380
and I just completely turned everything
around from that day for it and just

810
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:07,780
started to,
to,

811
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,380
uh,
find a new passion and,

812
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:15,410
and that was weight lifting and I,
I got so strong so fast,

813
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,260
um,
and it became,

814
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,130
it became everything to me just for my
numbers to go up every week,

815
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,380
um,
and which they did.

816
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:25,930
And I found myself really happy again,
like,

817
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,130
you know,
squatting 500 pounds would be in 64 and

818
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:30,964
the only way in,
you know,

819
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,680
to 25,
you know,

820
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:35,320
with these really skinny legs,
500 pounds is a lot of weight,

821
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,950
like dead lifts and 600 pounds.
You know,

822
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,500
there were guys who had been training at
that gym for years who still can't do

823
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,990
those types of numbers.
Um,

824
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,220
and I was able to do it.
So I was just like,

825
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:45,731
man,
you know,

826
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:47,140
I can do anything I put my mind to.

827
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,610
And uh,
I just thought I was going to become one

828
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:51,580
of the strongest motherfuckers in
Albuquerque.

829
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,530
That was my,
that was my plan.

830
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,660
Well,
power lifting gyms are very competitive

831
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,740
and guys get super hung up on the idea
of like lifting heavier and heavier

832
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:02,150
weights.
Hooked.

833
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,270
I had a Mark Bell on the podcast before
and we also did a podcast in Columbus

834
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,920
with a Louie Simmons who's a world
famous power lifting a guru and he's a

835
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:15,530
fucking maniac and it's all with all
those guys.

836
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,660
It's all just about putting up big
numbers.

837
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,160
Keep it going,
keep it going,

838
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,040
keep it going.
Heavier numbers,

839
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,370
you know?
Yeah,

840
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,350
it was,
yeah.

841
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,510
I fell in love with it.
It's crazy sort of discipline.

842
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,630
It is.
Yeah.

843
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,140
So it's so simple to use,
just lifted up,

844
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,120
but it's very satisfying for people
looking at it like,

845
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:33,950
who gives a fuck if you squat 500
pounds,

846
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,630
but when you're doing like screaming.
Exactly.

847
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,080
Everybody,
high fives,

848
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,000
chalks flying in the air.
It's the best.

849
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,000
I'll tell you.
I love it.

850
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,730
I,
I,

851
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,230
I really love power lifting and all
about getting injured though because

852
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:51,830
that's a big part of power lifting until
I have a pretty good traders and,

853
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,520
and um,
and they teach me the right way to do

854
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,770
things,
but they also allow me to,

855
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,170
um,
be out of position a lot of times too

856
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,004
because,
um,

857
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,430
a lot of times people focus on the
perfect form at everything,

858
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:06,560
but when you looked at real big wait,
you're not always going to be in the

859
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:07,580
perfect form.
So they,

860
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,250
they almost allow me to be out of
position.

861
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,250
Sometimes you are not in the form is
still power through positions.

862
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:16,010
That way you're,
you're strong grappling sense.

863
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,270
Yeah.
You're strong in Everett,

864
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,120
you're showing every,
every,

865
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,420
every part of the movement,
whether you're a former bad form,

866
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,810
you're still able to lift big weight.
Well,

867
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:25,610
that's the big theory behind functional
strength,

868
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:27,350
right?
That's why people like doing things like

869
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:27,470
that

870
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,580
power cleans and presses because it's
such an awkward thing to do with the

871
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:34,610
weight and you're,
you're in weird movements and you're

872
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,360
doing things with your whole body right
now.

873
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,380
What are you doing

874
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,070
days?
So these days I am a,

875
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,890
I have just been doing,
um,

876
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,450
uh,
are you back on Jackson's a bunch of

877
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:48,570
power lifts and a bunch of wrestling and
Jujitsu?

878
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,640
That's been my thing lately.
No striking.

879
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,780
Uh,
no.

880
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,050
I haven't done any striking.
My whole goal is to not get punched in

881
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:58,180
the head at all.
That's your goal.

882
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,920
Well,
that's what my plan is.

883
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm going to eventually answer my
workout routine to where I'm doing a lot

884
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:09,961
of myths and working on my versatility.
I'm working on my versatility and,

885
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,380
and just my abilities on my show.
You,

886
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,100
you're not throwing any punches these
days.

887
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:17,140
Not throwing out kick now,
but it's crazy to me,

888
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:20,380
but my plan is to get into that.
That's not going to last for too long,

889
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:23,620
but I won't be doing too much sparring.
Especially heavy spine.

890
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,200
Right.
But even without doing any sparring,

891
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,050
you don't hit the bag you don't know.

892
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,570
Lately I've been doing a whole bunch of
wrestling and Jujitsu.

893
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,210
Wow.
And I'm really starting to love it to

894
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,770
just Jujitsu will.
Yeah.

895
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:38,770
I'm,
I'm really starting to love Jujitsu and

896
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,000
Jujitsu has been the art that I've
neglected the most over my entire career

897
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:45,310
and surprisingly I have the most
submissions in light heavyweight

898
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:46,890
history.
Um,

899
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,950
I think can Sha Kim shamrock is right
behind me with maybe five and I have

900
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:54,100
six.
Ken shamrock are frank,

901
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:55,750
one of them,
one of the shamrock brothers are behind

902
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,720
me for most submissions in.
Well,

903
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:00,410
Ken was never a light heavyweight,
right?

904
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,990
I mean Ken went to light heavyweight
when he fought Tito,

905
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,510
but in the early days,
like when he was,

906
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,670
he was a heavyweight.
I'm sure someone could figure,

907
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,890
figured out is a light heavyweight and
the Tito days.

908
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,060
But that was ken,
you know,

909
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:15,960
later on in his career.
How many submissions did frank have?

910
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,710
Maybe it's frank,
I dunno.

911
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,330
Keto Frank.
I think one of the shamrock brothers are

912
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,540
right behind me and some interesting
legends.

913
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,840
Legends of the sport.
Yeah,

914
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,910
pioneers,
man.

915
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,410
But now I love Jujitsu,
man.

916
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,660
And will you bill for it?
That's for sure.

917
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,080
These long arms,
man.

918
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,990
I'm,
I'm,

919
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,830
I'm,
I'm becoming a joke man.

920
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,040
I'm shocked.
I would assume that

921
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,580
someone who is a professional mixed
martial arts fighter has to at least

922
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,430
maintain a maintenance level of
striking.

923
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,600
Alright.
Constantly.

924
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,380
And my plan is to get back and I still
July still very far away

925
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:51,100
now when it's July.
How does that work when you're

926
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:51,960
suspended?
Because,

927
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:53,170
uh,
this is a question that I've always

928
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:55,600
wanted to know,
like if you're suspended for ped or

929
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,870
something along those lines,
are you not supposed to train with other

930
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,640
fighters that are in the UFC or is that
bullshit?

931
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,953
I,
I,

932
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,640
I haven't heard anything about,
about.

933
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,910
Because that sounds crazy,
right?

934
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:06,750
That's the train.

935
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,830
Especially if you're trying to help
friends.

936
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,800
Right.
It would be very therapeutic for someone

937
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:11,520
who's on the outside

938
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,680
and that's.
I spent a lot of time helping other

939
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,480
fighters.
Does that help you a lot when you're

940
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:19,410
trying to get back into things and to
sort of just someone in my house

941
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,790
studying their opponents?

942
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,631
Yeah,
that's a,

943
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:25,640
that was one of the best parts about MMA
and martial arts in general I think is

944
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,593
helping friends

945
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,890
given back something.
That's to me too,

946
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,950
because martial arts can be a very
selfish sport,

947
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,170
you know,
it's a,

948
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,040
it's a team sport,
but um,

949
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,400
if you're not putting yourself first,
then you're not going to make it to

950
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:40,970
certain levels.
I've been really selfish my entire

951
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:43,880
career and um,
that's one thing my coaches have always

952
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,140
gotten on me about,
Hey John,

953
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,360
I know you live in New York.
I know you got a family,

954
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
but you need to get back down here to
help these guys.

955
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,920
They have a fight coming up.
But now that I live in Albuquerque,

956
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm constantly giving back and helping
other fighters,

957
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:58,340
especially since I have all these
suspensions happen.

958
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:03,080
Do you surround yourself with too many
people that liked to party?

959
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,060
I used to.
You used to.

960
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,590
I used to for sure.
Yeah.

961
00:40:06,591 --> 00:40:11,420
I used to have a lot of wild friends.
And when did you stop hanging out with

962
00:40:11,421 --> 00:40:11,780
these people?

963
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,370
With the car accident?
Um,

964
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,130
or like,
no,

965
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,860
after the car accident when I,
when I decided that it was going to be

966
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:20,510
completely sober,
I uh,

967
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,480
I let loose a lot of friends and it was
crazy because,

968
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:25,370
um,
I used to,

969
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:29,690
my phone used to blow up on Friday
nights because everybody knew that John

970
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:33,610
was going to be buying everything that
people need to know.

971
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Like I literally,
I'm that guy who went to the bar and um,

972
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,250
I would just buy like 40 shots patrol,
right?

973
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,090
And I'm just like.
And literally if you're standing around

974
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:48,290
me,
you're getting a shout out patrolling,

975
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,900
just passing them out.
Right?

976
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,800
And next thing you know,
people who don't even know each other,

977
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:55,350
they're all hugging and I'm really good
at merging people together and have

978
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,160
strangers and having a great time.
And that was my thing,

979
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:02,480
like walk into a bar where I know five
people and now I have 20 new homies and

980
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:04,310
like everybody's just hanging out.

981
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,370
Um,
and so when you're like that,

982
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,230
you know,
Friday nights come around,

983
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:10,280
8:00,
everybody's like,

984
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:11,510
yeah,
where are you going to be tonight?

985
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,220
You know,
that's,

986
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,750
you know,
if I'm out there's going to be more

987
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:17,030
people around,
you're going to have a way better time.

988
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,610
Your chances of getting laid is going up
because you're hanging out with me.

989
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,720
It's just the truth.
I just had a bunch of people around me

990
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,750
and um,
and um,

991
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,620
since I became sober,
a lot of those phone calls,

992
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,050
they slowly,
they slowly,

993
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,610
they slowly stopped,
you know,

994
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:39,611
and so now I'm a,
I've been sober for almost 16 months and

995
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:43,130
um,
and now I'm,

996
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,700
I have had the best times of the best
times.

997
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,740
I,
I remember everything that happens.

998
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,880
Um,
my friends don't try to ever encourage

999
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,360
me to drink or anything and,
and uh,

1000
00:41:55,361 --> 00:41:56,550
so they know I'm not going to.

1001
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,940
And um,
I just had the best times,

1002
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,130
had the best times.
I'm.

1003
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,440
And how were you able to make that
transition?

1004
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:09,610
Did you follow many program stop being
no idea and I just stopped and I stopped

1005
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:11,830
answering my phone call for a lot of
people.

1006
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,930
Um,
and I,

1007
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,170
um,
I just kinda went into hiding for a

1008
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,530
while.
I just,

1009
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,900
um,
I just stayed away from the scene until

1010
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:25,000
I felt like I was strong enough to just
not do it.

1011
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,410
And um,
and,

1012
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,410
and it,
it helped,

1013
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,200
it helped a lot.
And now do you ever go to bars now and

1014
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:34,770
order a water or anything like that?
Yeah,

1015
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,261
do that.
Yeah,

1016
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,350
I go out,
I go,

1017
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,650
I'm and uh,
I'll drink red bull,

1018
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,241
red bull,
whatever.

1019
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:41,950
I'm in a situation where a lot of people
are drinking.

1020
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,430
Sometimes I feel like I'm just kind of
chilling and like a little bit too

1021
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,600
chilled out.
So like in order to like keep up with a

1022
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:50,550
bunch of drunk people that are talking
to drink red bull,

1023
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,453
drink a red bull.

1024
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,160
Too many of those though,
man,

1025
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,980
it's terrible for you,
but I mean it's way better than just

1026
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,770
getting turned up.
So it's funny because I,

1027
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,180
I've developed this,
uh,

1028
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,380
this way of just having so much fun,
completely sober where a lot of times

1029
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:09,000
when I'm leaving like a place,
someone be like,

1030
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:09,840
hey,
how are you getting home?

1031
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,900
I'm like driving.
So it's great.

1032
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,000
I really do appreciate my sobriety.
I love it.

1033
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,910
I know you were having,
you were saying you were having a

1034
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,700
problem with pot.
Yeah,

1035
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,110
I did.
I,

1036
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,030
I've,
I've been,

1037
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,550
uh,
I've been a stoner since high school.

1038
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,190
Yeah.
Um,

1039
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,210
is that like stopping that,
was that as easy as stopping drinking or

1040
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,950
is it a,
was more difficult?

1041
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,390
It was,
um,

1042
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,743
s

1043
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,320
it was,
I think stopping pot was really tough

1044
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:48,560
because I literally didn't associate
with too many people who didn't smoke

1045
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,550
that that's the way I kind of like a lot
of people in my own team.

1046
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:53,990
I didn't hang out with them because I
was,

1047
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,090
I was kind of one of the hardest working
guys on the team,

1048
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:00,650
but a little bit of a bad boy and none
of my teammates were really a bad board.

1049
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:02,780
Meaning you smoke pot.
I'm just being an.

1050
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,050
I was just always down for a good time,
you know what I mean?

1051
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,540
So I just kind of,
a lot of my friends were people who

1052
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:11,450
weren't martial arts,
had anything to do with martial arts and

1053
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:13,520
I would always kind of associate with,
um,

1054
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,950
just just party people,
people who would like to have fun.

1055
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,430
Um,
so I realized once I quit smoking that I

1056
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:21,470
really didn't know too many people who
didn't smoke,

1057
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,720
so I had to kind of start
hanging out with people who didn't

1058
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:27,930
smoke,
which I kind of found,

1059
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,800
I thought it was
boring.

1060
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:32,803
You

1061
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,340
don't like to stare up at space,
they don't want to go to the mountains

1062
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,040
and meditate well fucking cross legged
position

1063
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,840
people who are just straight,
you know,

1064
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,230
we're always just straight and um,
and I had just,

1065
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,350
I had to find different activities to,
you know,

1066
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,050
because when you're hanging out with
people who don't party,

1067
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,810
you know,
they have certain ways that they have

1068
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:59,620
fun and it's usually based around a lot
more activities I feel like.

1069
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,330
So I got into mountain bike,
mountain biking and um,

1070
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,520
you know,
jogging more fitness,

1071
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:07,420
just laying on fitness and things like
that.

1072
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:08,410
So now,
you know,

1073
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:13,411
fitness is like my drug.
I really love being strong and being

1074
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:17,200
healthy and like I do mountain biking
and Jujitsu.

1075
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,130
I do a lot of Jujitsu these days and,
and so that's Kinda like,

1076
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,980
that's what I live for outside of
family.

1077
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:24,814
And of course,

1078
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,430
well,
it sounds to me that you've done an

1079
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,650
audit of your life and you've looked at
all the issues that you're,

1080
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:32,980
you're,
you're dealing with,

1081
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,710
and you decided to not engage in them
anymore.

1082
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,100
Have you write things down?
Do you write goals down or,

1083
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,830
or things that you demand of yourself?
Do you ever do that?

1084
00:45:41,831 --> 00:45:42,850
I do.
I have a,

1085
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,540
I have a

1086
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,820
list on my phone of different ways of
thinking that,

1087
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,710
that I want to stand for

1088
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,830
different things.
You think you're thankful for,

1089
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,140
you know,
different ways of thinking,

1090
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,400
different ways of thinking.

1091
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,161
Yeah.
That,

1092
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:55,250
uh,
that I want to stay for you.

1093
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:57,020
I do like,
like how so?

1094
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Um,
just little things that helped me be

1095
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:07,520
patient and,
and to be loving into

1096
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,800
appreciate.
Um,

1097
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,660
there's just,
I've had to look through my phone,

1098
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,260
that kind of,
I just,

1099
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:20,660
I just write down a lot of reminders of
what I stand for,

1100
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,680
you know,
and,

1101
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,460
and how I,
how I view things and yeah.

1102
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,700
But I do write things down.
Yeah.

1103
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,910
Now when you look at the future and you
see yourself from here on out,

1104
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,910
do you feel like from now on,
for,

1105
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,070
from my time on this earth,
no more drinking,

1106
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,430
no more pot,
no more partying.

1107
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,800
Um,
I do believe that I'll drink really

1108
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,370
advise as um,
just because I

1109
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,660
coming out of high school I started
drinking in high school and I always

1110
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:54,180
felt like I needed alcohol to be cool or
to um,

1111
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,050
put myself in certain situations to,
to conquer anxiety or whatever.

1112
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,830
Um,
to be a part of the crowd and to have

1113
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:04,600
fun and relax.
Yeah.

1114
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,480
I always thought I needed alcohol and
um,

1115
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,650
so I got to a point where I couldn't
just go out and have a drink.

1116
00:47:11,651 --> 00:47:14,950
I would always get to the point where
everyone's getting crazy and things are

1117
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:15,940
getting wild,
you know?

1118
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,530
And,
and um,

1119
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,030
I never really had the opportunity to
develop a healthy relationship with it.

1120
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:25,330
It just,
it just went from high school to college

1121
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:30,331
when you get even more to being famous
and being able afford to buy everybody

1122
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,080
drinks every night.

1123
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,460
Right.
So I,

1124
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,770
I just,
my relationship with alcohol it,

1125
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,310
it became unhealthy and I never went
through a period of time where I,

1126
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,560
where I had a healthy,
mature,

1127
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:44,530
responsible relationship with it.
Now being sober for so long,

1128
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:49,531
I know that I can have one drink and
feel a little bit of a buzz and catch an

1129
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:57,040
uber home or whatnot or I know that I
can go out and not have a drink at all

1130
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:00,940
and be the life of the party.
I know that I can go out and not have a

1131
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:04,750
drink at all and approach someone and
talk to someone with zero anxiety or

1132
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:05,650
feeling like,
oh,

1133
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,371
I,
you know,

1134
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:10,630
I could sit amongst the group of drunk
people and know that I'm cool in my own

1135
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:13,930
skin just the way that I am.
And that's something I never really had

1136
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:17,470
the opportunity to experience until now.
And so,

1137
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:19,480
um,
now I feel like I'm in a mature enough

1138
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:20,520
place where,
um,

1139
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,730
if I wanted to have a drink in the
future to celebrate a victory or

1140
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:27,490
something like that or a glass of wine
at home with my fiance,

1141
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,860
I know that I could do that now.
Um,

1142
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,160
so I just,
my relationship with it and it's

1143
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,090
completely changed and I,
I believe that I could drink in the

1144
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:39,250
future and not run into some of the
wild,

1145
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,030
you know,
crashing a Bentley into a pole.

1146
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,390
Stuff like that that I was doing before.

1147
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,370
When you say you believe you could,
you know,

1148
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,010
it's interesting.
I'm kind of talking out of my ass here

1149
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:49,660
because I've never had a problem with
alcohol.

1150
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,840
But I know people that have.
And the people that have had a problem

1151
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:54,070
with alcohol,
they,

1152
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,570
the way they describe it,
they're like,

1153
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,780
I can't do it.
Like if I go back,

1154
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:03,781
I will go all the way that there's a,
there's a thing that alcohol does to you

1155
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:06,040
where it says,
or drugs,

1156
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,600
you know,
like just a little bit,

1157
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,250
man,
just a little bit.

1158
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,170
Come on.
We're just going to get a little bit,

1159
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:13,090
just a little bit,
just a little shot.

1160
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,890
Just a little.
Just a little beer.

1161
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,300
What's a beer?
Everybody has a beer.

1162
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,820
Come on man.
And then that's the siren song.

1163
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,800
That leads you back to the rocks.
I feel like,

1164
00:49:20,801 --> 00:49:24,190
um,
I had a problem with alcohol but I never

1165
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:25,000
wanted to admit it.

1166
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,610
Like when you say you had a problem,
did you have a physical problem?

1167
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,030
Like when you got it off the alcohol,
did you have withdrawals?

1168
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,610
Did you feel weird?
You know,

1169
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,490
I feel weird.
I wasn't waking up and drinking every

1170
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:36,880
day.
So it's a psychological thing.

1171
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:37,540
It's good.
Yeah,

1172
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,940
I was,
I was getting hammered on the weekends.

1173
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,960
Right,
right.

1174
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,290
Um,
it wasn't waking up in and like I didn't

1175
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,750
need alcohol,
but I always said to myself,

1176
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,120
I don't have a problem with alcohol.
But then when you run into a pregnant

1177
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,950
woman,
you have a panel of alcohol.

1178
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:57,730
The day that something affects you,
the first Gwi you know,

1179
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,160
it's a problem.
You weren't thinking straight.

1180
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,060
Something was caused you to not think
straight and it was your actions and

1181
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:06,340
what you chose to take into your body,
and then you said,

1182
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:07,360
all right,
I'm done with that,

1183
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,250
but you feel like you could get back to
that.

1184
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,410
I feel.
I feel like I'm.

1185
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,400
I feel like alcohol.
I

1186
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,650
was never really like.
I was never really addicted to alcohol,

1187
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,930
was addicted to 'em.
I just really enjoyed partying a lot and

1188
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:21,850
I made a lot of bad decisions with
alcohol,

1189
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:24,430
so now I,
I really have had the time to see

1190
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,970
clearly
where I went run with alcohol.

1191
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,920
Obviously again,
being a public figure,

1192
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:33,860
I live in a small town.
I never needed to be getting blacked out

1193
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,120
in public again anyways.
It's just something that I look back and

1194
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,230
I hear stories.
My boys were like,

1195
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,870
Yo,
you remember the time you do this?

1196
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,390
I'm like,
oh no.

1197
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,920
I used to get blacked out in public.
It looks a little bit in this small town

1198
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:49,970
that I live in.
It's just like.

1199
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,040
So I,
I just,

1200
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,760
I've had a lot of times they evaluate
marijuana actually is something that I

1201
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,790
don't think I want to go back to really
to,

1202
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,650
I don't think I want to go back to and I
don't feel like you have an unhealthy

1203
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:03,240
relationship or had an unhealthy
relationship with marijuana.

1204
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,071
I,
I re,

1205
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:06,350
I have,
I was smoking way too much pot.

1206
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,410
I was poking way too much pie.
Literally breakfast,

1207
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:13,940
lunch and dinner in between workouts to
study film to do everything.

1208
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:16,250
I was just,
I was just in it for me.

1209
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:20,210
There's some functional smokers who can
wake up and they have eight things

1210
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,370
they're going to do that day and they do
all eight things like me.

1211
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,660
I would wake up and I had eight things I
needed to do that day and I'd be like,

1212
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:27,170
ah,
I got three of them done today.

1213
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,500
Like I'm good with that.
Like I just,

1214
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:30,291
I,
it just,

1215
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:33,170
it slowed me down,
slow me down and now that I haven't been

1216
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:34,850
spoken to,
I just feel a lot better.

1217
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,400
I feel a lot better.
I feel um,

1218
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,710
I feel more on my game.
I feel sharper sparking up a joint right

1219
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:44,640
now.
Go ahead and saying.

1220
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,880
I know it's probably hard for you to
hear it.

1221
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,980
I know this fairly well.
No,

1222
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,890
I mean honestly everybody differently.
Absolutely does.

1223
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,210
It absolutely does.
That's important.

1224
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,320
Sodas,
red bull and so does alcohol and so does

1225
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:55,800
everything else.

1226
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,633
Yeah.
You know,

1227
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,770
it was,
it was all day every day for me.

1228
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,450
But do you think that you,
um,

1229
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,720
was it all day every day because you
were looking for an escape or was it all

1230
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:06,280
day every day because it had formed a
habit and you just,

1231
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,650
that's what you were used to doing.

1232
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,470
It became a,
it just became a way of life.

1233
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:10,850
It became a way of life for me.

1234
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,880
When you're dealing with the amount of
stress and just the amount of pressure

1235
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:19,390
is probably a better word of being,
you know,

1236
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,430
one of the great fighters of all time.
I mean,

1237
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:26,300
you're without a doubt one of the best
fighters that's ever fought in mma and

1238
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,530
there's so many eyes on you and there's
so much pressure and there's so much

1239
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:33,170
money involved and accolades and all
these different things.

1240
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:34,004
These,
these,

1241
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,300
you know,
hey John,

1242
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:37,190
we've got a business meeting for you.
Hey John,

1243
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:40,010
this company wants to talk to you about
doing this and hey John,

1244
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,310
and there's just so much coming your
way.

1245
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
Do you feel like it's almost like you
had set yourself up in a position where

1246
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:55,190
you needed like some escape.
You needed an escape valve and that's

1247
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:58,250
what you had found through the drinking
that's you had found through the pot.

1248
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,300
You'd found these ways where you could
not be Jon Jones for awhile.

1249
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,090
We could be the blacked out dude at a
bar.

1250
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,090
All of a sudden you feel normal.
You know,

1251
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,930
normal as normal as you can feel by
being a 20 whatever year old millionaire

1252
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,280
fucking throwing shots around and
albuquerque the,

1253
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:20,330
you would found a valve to release you
from some of the intense pressure of

1254
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,480
being one of the baddest motherfuckers
on the planet.

1255
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,850
Yeah,
yeah.

1256
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,770
I,
I agree with you.

1257
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,461
Yeah,
absolutely.

1258
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:28,700
It definitely made you feel,
uh,

1259
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,860
for those moments,
your hands away from you.

1260
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,980
She just blocking the microphone and
I,

1261
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,261
um,
yeah,

1262
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,860
I,
I do agree that it is for those moments

1263
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,980
made me kind of feel

1264
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,273
um,

1265
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,310
normal like normal.
Yeah,

1266
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:53,840
for sure.
Especially the bar thing,

1267
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:57,410
especially the bar thing,
like going out and just having a good

1268
00:53:57,411 --> 00:53:59,070
time.
Like sometimes I,

1269
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:03,620
I forgot that I was a celebrity and that
there was a lot of eyes on me and,

1270
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:05,360
but for those moments I felt like I was
like,

1271
00:54:05,361 --> 00:54:06,550
I think I was one of my biggest
problems.

1272
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,730
I felt as if I was amongst.
I didn't really hold myself to a higher

1273
00:54:10,731 --> 00:54:12,920
standard because of who I was and what I
did.

1274
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:13,750
I,
I've,

1275
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,110
I've,
and even to this day,

1276
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:17,600
I just feel like I'm one of the guys
like where you are.

1277
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,860
Yeah.
In one of the guys like,

1278
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:19,830
I,
I don't try,

1279
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,890
I don't really seek hanging out with
other celebrities.

1280
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:26,390
All my friends are like,
I'm just normal average joe guys.

1281
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:27,410
And,
and,

1282
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:30,130
uh,
back when I used to party,

1283
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:34,870
I used to feel like that was me just not
being John Bones Jones and just being

1284
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,590
one of the guys,
like just doing the wild shit that

1285
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,200
everybody does it.
And then when something bad happens,

1286
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,940
it's like you're quickly reminded that
millions of people around the world know

1287
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,710
exactly who you are.
So it's just,

1288
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,043
it's like,

1289
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,440
but isn't it,
it's a two edge sword too because the

1290
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:55,430
people that get completely lost in the
idea that they are this unique and

1291
00:54:55,431 --> 00:54:58,130
special person,
you eliminate yourself from all those

1292
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,750
other folks and you,
you separate yourself and that's

1293
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:05,210
extremely hard to relate and there's a
lot of celebrities that go into a shell

1294
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,910
and everywhere they go they have
security that takes him places and

1295
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:09,480
they'd get delusional.
They have a,

1296
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,460
they have a completely distorted
perception of how people interact with

1297
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:15,320
them because they don't just go hang
with people.

1298
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:15,981
Right?
Yeah,

1299
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:17,180
that's,
that's definitely not me.

1300
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:17,841
I,
I,

1301
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:20,270
um,
I meet a lot of people and people say,

1302
00:55:20,271 --> 00:55:22,310
man,
you just don't act like you don't have

1303
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,600
famous.
I'm just like,

1304
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,210
I don't know.
Like I like,

1305
00:55:26,211 --> 00:55:28,160
I really have a lot of pride and just
doing what,

1306
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,310
like just normal shit,
like going to places that most people,

1307
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,420
even fighters in Albuquerque,
you don't don't go just being amongst

1308
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:36,770
the people and,
and I,

1309
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:41,771
I think a big part of me long to just
kind of just be not famous sometimes.

1310
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,880
Now my question,
the reason why I asked you that as,

1311
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,320
how do you plan on handling that now?
Because if you're not going to be

1312
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:50,540
drinking and you're not going to be
smoking pot and you're,

1313
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:53,800
you're,
you're going to mean right now you're

1314
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,580
living life has just Jon Jones,
the person and happy with your family

1315
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:01,640
and happy with your life and just
working out and having a good time doing

1316
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:04,580
Jujitsu and all that stuff,
but eventually everything's going to

1317
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:07,130
ramp back up again.
Media obligations going to ramp back up

1318
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:09,890
again.
All these things are gonna happen and

1319
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,690
the pressure is going to be back on you
again.

1320
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,990
What are you going to use as an escape
valve then?

1321
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,173
Hm.

1322
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,560
Have you considered that?
No,

1323
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:19,650
I haven't really.
No.

1324
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,380
That's very important.
I feel like,

1325
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,550
uh,
I feel like I've matured in a way where,

1326
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,760
um,
I don't think it will affect me the way

1327
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:30,190
it used to.
I've really had the opportunity to step

1328
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:33,820
away from it all.
I realized what I had and who I am,

1329
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,610
what I was.
And um,

1330
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:43,060
and um,
I just feel above what used to be.

1331
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,250
Yeah,
I feel above the way.

1332
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:49,560
I used to like
let so much consuming.

1333
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:50,800
Like even right now,
like,

1334
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,590
I don't know,
it says just so hard to explain it.

1335
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,390
I just,
I don't feel like I'm in the same.

1336
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,130
I don't feel like I look at things the
same.

1337
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,030
Well,
I'm sure you don't.

1338
00:56:58,031 --> 00:57:01,510
I mean that's the thing about growth and
that's one of the things that when

1339
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,990
people are haters,
what they try to do is lock you down to

1340
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:06,120
the old you,
right?

1341
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,020
They try to lock you down to you at your
very words.

1342
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:08,391
Yeah,
man.

1343
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,890
I remember that Shit in 2010.
You said that fucked up thing when you

1344
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:13,030
were blacked out.
That's you,

1345
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:16,300
Bro.
Remember that I was blacked out.

1346
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,400
What did I say?
You tell me,

1347
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:22,330
you know when someone can,
someone can believe that they are their

1348
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:24,330
past,
but we're not know you're.

1349
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,000
You have not had fuck ups.
Then you don't understand the

1350
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:28,840
consequences.
Yeah.

1351
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,350
I mean you've had considerable amount of
fuck ups and a lot more than the average

1352
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:35,110
person in a public sense.
There's a lot of people that have done a

1353
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:37,840
lot of fucked up things,
but no one knows about it and the

1354
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,630
repercussions they feel it's not the
same as yours.

1355
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,000
You feel the repercussions of millions
of,

1356
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,190
first of all,
millions of people that loved you,

1357
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:48,520
that were disappointed.
Millions of people that were jealous of

1358
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:51,490
you that like I fucking told you was
going to throw it all away.

1359
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,510
There's a lot of that to get people
psyched that you fucked up far,

1360
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,020
far from

1361
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,360
though in our way.
Sometimes I'll get people to write me

1362
00:57:58,361 --> 00:58:00,160
and say,
do say things like,

1363
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,840
oh,
you ruined a great career.

1364
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:05,920
Or like you a.
like people have this mindset that it's

1365
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:06,680
all over.

1366
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,330
Yeah.
I saw a lot of people saying that.

1367
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:09,164
People that I,
I,

1368
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,750
I like said that and it's like,
I was like,

1369
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:12,770
you're crazy.
You're an idiot.

1370
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,050
You're crazy.
He hasn't thrown it.

1371
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,350
I haven't thrown it away right now.
There's a pause going on,

1372
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,430
but as far as it being all over or
whatever it is just so far.

1373
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:22,643
True.
Do you,

1374
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,530
do you fall boxing a little bit?
A little bit?

1375
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,030
You know,
Bernard Hopkins Story?

1376
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,920
No.
Bernard Hopkins,

1377
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,720
one of the greatest boxer of all time
for sure.

1378
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:33,150
And he'll,
he'll fight December 17th for his last

1379
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:36,690
fight at 51 years old because he's a
goddamn defensive wizard.

1380
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,780
He's still does commentary for Hbo,
still sharp as a tack,

1381
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:45,350
but Bernard Hopkins went to jail and uh,
he decided when he went to jail,

1382
00:58:45,451 --> 00:58:49,290
when he was young man,
he decided that from that point on he

1383
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,320
was going to be disciplined and there
there's no more bullshit and his life,

1384
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:57,390
no more robbery or assault or any of the
shit that got him into the position.

1385
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,150
Whereas in and then he was going to
dedicate his life to being a world

1386
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:03,270
champion boxer.
And from that point on,

1387
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,240
he became one of the most disciplined
boxers ever.

1388
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,400
Never ate bad food,
never drank,

1389
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:10,680
never did anything stupid,
always was in shape.

1390
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,350
And we'll go down in history as one of
the all time greats,

1391
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:18,351
guaranteed shoeing hall of Famer.
And I feel like Bernard Hopkins was

1392
00:59:18,481 --> 00:59:22,580
created by the darkest moment of him
being and him doing time in jail.

1393
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,110
And when he came out of that jail,
one of the first things that I'm.

1394
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,300
One of the corrections officers said to
him was,

1395
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:31,520
you'll be back.
And he,

1396
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,240
he used that as fuel.
And he knew that like,

1397
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,820
there's no fucking way I'm going to look
at that dude again.

1398
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,160
There's no way.
There's no way he's right.

1399
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,270
There's no way.
And ultimately Bernard Hopkins escaped

1400
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:46,970
his demons by facing them,
by being in hell.

1401
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:48,950
But being in hell,
I think he was in jail for,

1402
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,040
I forget how many years,
but just enough,

1403
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:57,100
just enough to cement and his eyes to
hardened him to the fact that what he

1404
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,750
needed was discipline and control over
his own destiny.

1405
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,910
And I think that for a guy like you,
you can take all those dark moments that

1406
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:08,000
you've experienced over the fuck man.
You think about it,

1407
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,380
man,
you got away pretty light.

1408
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,510
That girl could have died.
You know,

1409
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,630
a horrible things could have happened
while you were drunk driving when you

1410
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:16,610
slammed into that,
that Bentley into the truth.

1411
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:19,970
Although all these terrible things could
have gone wrong that you kind of got

1412
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:21,610
away with.
He kind of mean you.

1413
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:22,640
Boy,
I mean,

1414
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:24,470
if you wanted to think that someone's
looking out for you,

1415
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:27,710
you've got all the evidence in the world
that points to someone actually looking

1416
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,390
out for you.
That's great for sure.

1417
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:33,290
Something out there,
whether it's luck or whether it's

1418
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:36,140
intention or whether it's God or
whatever the fuck it is,

1419
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:39,140
man.
What the bottom line is right now at

1420
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:42,260
this moment,
you are still in your athletic prime.

1421
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,950
You're still only six months away from a
sport.

1422
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,940
When is your suspension?
About eight months,

1423
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,280
eight months away from our suspension
being released.

1424
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,180
And I mean that's.
This is all a great thing.

1425
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,260
How old are you now?
You're 30,

1426
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,520
29,
29 be when?

1427
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,850
When's your birthday?
July notice.

1428
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,660
So you'd be 30 when you come back,
you know,

1429
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,510
20 nights though would prime.
That's you.

1430
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,280
That's you at your best.
You really,

1431
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:05,660
your prime is like 32.

1432
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,260
That's why I like,
um,

1433
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,060
I put the,
I put the Jordan,

1434
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,720
the Jordan crying face as my twitter
picture.

1435
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:16,554
Have you seen that?

1436
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,300
I put that up with you with the belt on
the Jordan phase.

1437
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,370
The reason why

1438
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:29,340
that up is because a,
is because,

1439
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,200
um,
I know that right now I'm in a position

1440
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:36,810
to do some magnificent and extraordinary
things.

1441
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,250
I,
uh,

1442
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,560
I know that because I've made so many
mistakes,

1443
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:45,690
I make the perfect role model.
I make the perfect person to,

1444
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,650
to,
um,

1445
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,000
to still be able to inspire millions of
people.

1446
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:56,010
There's very few people who are,
who are perfect and flawless and just

1447
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:57,900
that clean cut,
never did anything wrong.

1448
01:01:57,901 --> 01:02:02,370
Athlete a,
there's way more people who are like me

1449
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,560
who has struggled with drugs or just
being an idiot or just doing wild shit

1450
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,530
way more people who have lived their
parents don't let their families down.

1451
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,480
Let their friends don't let themselves
down.

1452
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,880
Um,
and because,

1453
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,600
because I've made so many mistakes on
it,

1454
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,620
on such a public,
you know,

1455
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,850
such a big scale and so public,
um,

1456
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,110
I feel like all the great things that
I'll do from here on out,

1457
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,630
we're going to be that much greater
because of where it came from to,

1458
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,420
to do it.
I feel like I'm,

1459
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,260
I feel like my best is yet to come and
there's just,

1460
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:39,420
I feel like I'm in a position to,
to really touch a lot of people and

1461
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,640
inspire a lot of people because of where
I came from.

1462
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:43,770
So I'm really excited.
Um,

1463
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,540
is that something you concentrate on
more than you constantly mean?

1464
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:50,610
Do you concentrate on that as much as
you concentrate on just doing it for

1465
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:51,340
yourself?

1466
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,720
Um,
do you want it for doing it for other

1467
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:54,980
people?
Um,

1468
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,610
motivates me probably more than doing it
for myself.

1469
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,640
Why?
Why is that?

1470
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:03,450
Is that from all of the accolades that
you've received from all the fans

1471
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,510
realize that you have all this love out
there from all these people?

1472
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:06,870
Yeah.

1473
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,930
I just feel like I don't need it.
I don't need it anymore.

1474
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,180
I feel like I,
um,

1475
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,060
I feel like I've done everything
already.

1476
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:17,850
I've been in all the wildest situations
already.

1477
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,060
I've had all the craziest experiences,
stayed at the nicest hotels.

1478
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:23,240
I've seen the world of eight at the
nicest rest.

1479
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:26,040
Like there's nothing else that I really
need out of this,

1480
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,270
uh,
out of this thing.

1481
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,700
I've literally been there and done that
already.

1482
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,173
Um,

1483
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,440
um,
I feel like I'm,

1484
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,040
I just feel like ultimately I've already
gotten so much out of this sport and

1485
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:44,010
what I need to do is to truly get
something.

1486
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,500
What I really need is to know that I'm
changing lives.

1487
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:51,060
Like that motivates me more than,
than anything else right now.

1488
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,790
I'm the story,
the legacy.

1489
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:58,020
And um,
so the reason why I put that laugh in

1490
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,290
meme up is because I'm laughing at my
pain and my struggle is right now I'm

1491
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:05,100
laughing at what I'm going through right
now because I know my future is just so

1492
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,830
incredibly bright and I know the impact
that I have.

1493
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,160
I know I know what I can do and what I'm
going to do it.

1494
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:17,550
Like right now I'm just,
I'm in a waiting period where I have to

1495
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:20,840
wait before I can show the world what
I'm actually capable of,

1496
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:23,550
what I can be and what I'm going to do
for someone else one day.

1497
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:28,800
Um,
and it's also laughing at like people

1498
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:31,380
who actually think that I'm out down and
out,

1499
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:34,820
like people who actually think that my
story is over or you know,

1500
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:38,580
it was just like,
I'm just laughing at it all because what

1501
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,780
I have done is like,
I've seen some athletes come back from

1502
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:46,710
way worse stuff,
rape charges and murder and attempted

1503
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:47,640
murder and,
you know,

1504
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:50,550
all this type of crazy shit.
You don't have anything.

1505
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:53,730
I've done.
I have a party too much and I've done a

1506
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:56,050
lot of stupid stuff like from being a
party boy.

1507
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,750
And I know I'm not a bad person.
I'm not like this evil athlete,

1508
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,540
you know.
Does it bother you when people think you

1509
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,270
are because people.
No,

1510
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,320
no,
I didn't.

1511
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,690
I don't because you want to ask people,
you know,

1512
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:11,130
there's like,
no,

1513
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:13,710
I don't.
There's people who wants to believe that

1514
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:15,840
I'm this terrible.
Uh,

1515
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,180
you know,
one of the worst things that has ever

1516
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,250
happened in sports,
you know,

1517
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:24,370
people want to believe that because they
just don't want me to be all that I can

1518
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:25,280
be and

1519
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,820
people look at the worst case scenario
and they look at the worst possibility,

1520
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,340
you know,
they look at you as this guy has had so

1521
01:05:32,341 --> 01:05:34,500
much success,
so many things handed to them that maybe

1522
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,770
he thinks he's better than everybody
else now has been handling.

1523
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,670
Of course,
of course.

1524
01:05:38,671 --> 01:05:39,810
Yeah.
But they don't,

1525
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,940
they don't think about it that way.
I know,

1526
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,100
I know that,
but they don't think about it that way

1527
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,290
when they see the worst case scenario.
I mean,

1528
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,120
the way it was played out a pregnant
woman in a car.

1529
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,120
And you in your practice when you took
off.

1530
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,140
Yeah,
I mean it is like for the haters,

1531
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:56,610
it's like a dream come true.
Yeah,

1532
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,503
it is.

1533
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:57,900
Okay.

1534
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,580
But I can,
man,

1535
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,180
I.
One thing I've learned about myself is

1536
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:02,640
that I can't be held down.
I don't,

1537
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,800
I'm not held down very easily unless
you,

1538
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,540
I just can't be held down.
Man.

1539
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,580
I deal with adversity very well,
man.

1540
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:13,490
I always find a way to get my shit
together and,

1541
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,800
and dig myself out of a situations and
like,

1542
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,260
and ultimately rise above.
That's beautiful.

1543
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:21,790
As long as you don't count on it,
right?

1544
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,840
Oh well now where I'm sick of getting in
my own way and like,

1545
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,420
like UFC 200.
Let's talk about that.

1546
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:33,280
I literally what happened.
I did everything that I could to be back

1547
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:37,180
in a position to win that belt bed.
I was getting ready to just show this

1548
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:41,110
triumphant amazing story of someone who
just made it through a hit and run

1549
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:44,200
situation.
It had almost had everything taken from

1550
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,420
them and got it all back.
And then,

1551
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:48,710
um,
and then,

1552
01:06:48,711 --> 01:06:52,630
um,
I'm sorry,

1553
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,360
I'm thinking about so many things at
once.

1554
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:55,194
We're happy with.

1555
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,130
So let's just talk about what happened.
You,

1556
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:04,131
you tested positive for some
estrogen inhibitors or blockers

1557
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,860
yesterday.
Didn't blockers that a lot of people

1558
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:11,500
associate with people who take steroids.
People take steroids,

1559
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:14,950
they want to restart their system,
or if you want a testosterone boost,

1560
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:18,990
you take clomid or clomiphene and these
are,

1561
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,260
these are standard drugs in the steroid
users world.

1562
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,800
Yeah.
This is all new for me.

1563
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,130
Yeah.
Um,

1564
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,730
basically what did you take?
So I took a,

1565
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,240
I took an offbrand Cialis bill off
brand.

1566
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,070
It was,
it wasn't actually alice,

1567
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,490
but it was described to me as being a
cialis and so I thought it was a Cialis

1568
01:07:37,491 --> 01:07:38,810
and I,
I just took it.

1569
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:42,880
So why is it guy like you need.
Seattle's have a huge got jail.

1570
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,870
It's too big.
It's too big.

1571
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:53,720
It's a good answer.
We don't have the resources to get it

1572
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:56,210
normally a new yet,
you know,

1573
01:07:56,211 --> 01:07:58,330
I,
I'm your partner.

1574
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,720
No,
it wasn't even necessarily party and

1575
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:03,690
know I've taken like melon has,
but before,

1576
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,700
and for people who haven't taken it,
you literally,

1577
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,690
you know,
you go from being like that to just.

1578
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:12,000
It puts the twist at the end of the
punch list at the end.

1579
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,160
You know what I mean?
Is it like it?

1580
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,150
It's,
it's a good time,

1581
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,313
you know,

1582
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,180
it's a good time to be a quote.
It's a good time.

1583
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:27,080
Now.
What was this like?

1584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,810
One of them's gas station.
Rhino pills,

1585
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:29,870
one of those things.
No,

1586
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,210
I haven't.

1587
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,450
Edit teammate basically tells me,
hey,

1588
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:34,370
uh,
he was talking about how his girlfriends

1589
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:35,940
are pharmacists and,
and he,

1590
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,080
he's capable of getting all this stuff
and,

1591
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,900
and all that type of stuff.
And I was like,

1592
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:43,950
well I do,
I don't do drugs or anything like that.

1593
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,180
And he's like,
you ever take a Cialis?

1594
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:46,621
And I was like,
yeah.

1595
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:47,800
He's like,
I got to Cialis.

1596
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,330
And I was like,

1597
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:49,530
well,
you said you don't do drugs or anything

1598
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:51,330
like that,
but you would done drugs.

1599
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,231
Well,
yeah.

1600
01:08:52,231 --> 01:08:52,861
Yeah.
But no,

1601
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:55,500
he was talking about all these
painkillers and all this different shit

1602
01:08:55,590 --> 01:09:00,390
than other things on top that he has
because his girlfriend's a pharmacist

1603
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,130
and he wasn't,
she getting this off brand stuff from

1604
01:09:03,131 --> 01:09:03,964
him.
It's like,

1605
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,090
I don't know,
people get a lot of stuff from China.

1606
01:09:06,091 --> 01:09:07,470
I mean that's what happened with
Anderson.

1607
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,800
Anderson got liquid cialis from China
and it was tainted.

1608
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:13,170
Look,
this happens.

1609
01:09:13,171 --> 01:09:15,720
I know for a fact that everyone knows
for a fact that happens.

1610
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,980
The supplement industry has a giant
issue with the people that mix the

1611
01:09:19,981 --> 01:09:22,920
stuff,
like if you have a VAT and you're mixing

1612
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:25,620
up whatever,
creatine or something like that and

1613
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:26,401
right before,
I mean,

1614
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:30,030
if this is done in some country or some
place that doesn't have excellent

1615
01:09:30,031 --> 01:09:31,770
standards,
it's not scrupulous.

1616
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,790
You could have been scooping up steroids
in the batch before that and you just

1617
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:39,120
throw the creatine in it and some of it
gets contaminated and they don't clean

1618
01:09:39,121 --> 01:09:39,630
it.
Yeah.

1619
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,120
That's pretty much a lock.
I'll get to that.

1620
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:44,750
But okay.
So you take this off brand seattle guys

1621
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:45,230
like

1622
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,510
you ever do by Agros and all that stuff.
And I'm like,

1623
01:09:47,511 --> 01:09:48,290
yeah,
I've,

1624
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,300
you know,
I've had melanie pain pills before and

1625
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:50,750
he's like,
oh,

1626
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,800
I got cialis.
And I'm like,

1627
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:54,430
oh this is great.
So I ended up taking one of the cialis

1628
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,160
bills and um,
um,

1629
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,360
and I thought everything was fine and
dandy.

1630
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:04,890
I had no clue.
Um,

1631
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,370
what Ha,
you know,

1632
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:10,280
that I was now having something else.
To me that was illegal.

1633
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:13,880
I took a sales spiel on June the 14th of
June,

1634
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,670
16th.
Um,

1635
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,380
you cited,
came over to my house 6:00 in the

1636
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,490
morning.
Hey,

1637
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:22,190
what's up guys?
That coffee going offer when everybody

1638
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:23,780
water bottles.
Super Nice,

1639
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:24,640
hospitable.
Come in.

1640
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,360
I'm laughing and joking with them.
I had no clue that that test was going

1641
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:32,090
to be the test that derail my life.
And um,

1642
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,000
you know,
right before UFC 200,

1643
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,920
uh,
my manager mark,

1644
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,440
he calls me over to his hotel room and
he said,

1645
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:39,410
okay,
I want to talk to you man,

1646
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:40,730
like,
what's going on?

1647
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:41,151
He's like,
Hey,

1648
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:44,060
you're not going to be fighting.
What are you talking about?

1649
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,051
He's like,
you know,

1650
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:48,850
you didn't feel you didn't pass your
drug test and a,

1651
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,090
the level of hurt and just and
confusion.

1652
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:56,690
And I literally had an anxiety attack
and I had never had one of those before.

1653
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:00,260
What does that feel like?
I felt like the whole room just came in

1654
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:03,080
on me,
like the whole room came down on me and

1655
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:05,420
I was just,
I couldn't breathe.

1656
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,270
I remember opening up his hotel window
looking for a balcony.

1657
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:12,290
So I could just breathe and realize that
I'm like not trapped.

1658
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:16,660
Um,
there's was literally the window opened

1659
01:11:16,661 --> 01:11:17,291
that much.
I was like,

1660
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:20,860
what the fuck,
so you don't drop out my hotel in Vegas

1661
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:23,620
where it was in Vegas,
fucking brick and I'm breathing.

1662
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,200
They don't want gamblers leaping through
the banking.

1663
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:29,220
I'm breathing through the thing,
calm myself down.

1664
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,970
And um,
and I instantly started thinking about

1665
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,400
the weight of the.
I had the weight of the world literally

1666
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:38,150
on my back.
I knew that I knew that I wasn't going

1667
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:40,470
to be fighting a few hours before
everyone else knew,

1668
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,800
the public knew and I was just,
I could already start hearing

1669
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,600
everything.
Even my own coaches,

1670
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:49,410
we looking at me like just their hearts
were on the floor.

1671
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Like I had done so much to get back to
fighting at UFC 200.

1672
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,640
Like getting my life in order,
getting the people around me in order to

1673
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,780
get in my head,
my health,

1674
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:02,340
my mind,
you know,

1675
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:05,220
just being in order to beat DC.
And,

1676
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:09,690
and like literally right now I've done
so much.

1677
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:13,980
So much of the right things to be back
in a good position and right now you

1678
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,660
know,
people look at me as if I still don't

1679
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:19,320
have my shit together,
but the only thing that I did was I took

1680
01:12:19,321 --> 01:12:23,830
a pill that I thought was gonna get me a
boner and it literally,

1681
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:28,910
it's caused me a lot of heartache and a
lot of disappointment and a lot of them

1682
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,700
threw me back here in any way,
shape or form.

1683
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,010
When someone gives you this pill and you
don't know where it came from,

1684
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:35,750
you don't know.
What did you think,

1685
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,040
man?
I don't know what's in this.

1686
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,361
No,
I didn't.

1687
01:12:38,361 --> 01:12:40,250
No,
I didn't think of it because I'm,

1688
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,080
I had been dealing with the athletic
commission.

1689
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:47,700
I've been in the UFC for a long time and
I've taken a little gas station Dick

1690
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,533
Pills before,
like,

1691
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:49,403
you know,
like,

1692
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,520
and I've never failed a drug test ever.
Did you?

1693
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,280
Did you ever think that you might have
got lucky?

1694
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,630
No,
I didn't think I got lucky.

1695
01:12:56,631 --> 01:12:59,120
I thought that you fail drug tests when
you're doing sketchy shit.

1696
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,410
Right?
But didn't you think there might be some

1697
01:13:00,411 --> 01:13:02,420
sketchy shit and some Chinese?
No.

1698
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:04,040
Station Rhino,
Dick Pill?

1699
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,000
I,
I,

1700
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,710
um,
what you know about the rhinos.

1701
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,510
My friend Ryan,
my friend Brian called it,

1702
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,120
he was on the podcast.
He said,

1703
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,440
you know,
John Likes to party.

1704
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,070
I bet he took one of them Dick Pills.
No.

1705
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:17,480
Um,
that's funny you called it.

1706
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,080
Yeah.
Well he was,

1707
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,200
he was on.
Oh,

1708
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,460
I haven't.
I've taken them several times before.

1709
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:28,820
And with the Nevada State Athletic
Commission,

1710
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:33,980
I always pass my drug test and,
and I know that I would never do

1711
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:38,460
anything to cheat this sport.
I've a lot of pride in my work ethic and

1712
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,210
knowing that do dot,
I've been skinny my whole career.

1713
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,100
Whooping people's ass.
I'm not a knockout artist.

1714
01:13:43,101 --> 01:13:45,530
I wouldn't because I'm smart and you
know,

1715
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,930
I work hard.
Um,

1716
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,680
but with you with the Nevada Athletic
Commission,

1717
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:54,530
I never had an issue.
And then I was suspended when you

1718
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:59,531
started came,
so I was never really educated on how

1719
01:13:59,661 --> 01:14:03,560
serious you shot a really was like,
I um,

1720
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,140
I came back into the game and there's
like,

1721
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:06,501
oh,
hey,

1722
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:09,470
we got this new company name and Usada
instead of Nevada.

1723
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,610
What were you suspended for when you to
cane?

1724
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,090
Oh,
you

1725
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:14,560
mean when they come into the sport?
I understand what you,

1726
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,530
not when they come into your house.
So when you started came into the sport.

1727
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:20,040
I was suspended because of my head.
Right.

1728
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,900
And so I never had even met anyone who
worked for you side.

1729
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,830
I'd never been sat down.
I know you sat a seminar what to do and

1730
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:28,480
what not to do and how serious it is and
what could happen if you do this.

1731
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:30,430
And all.
The thing I knew is I had to report

1732
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:31,264
where I was at.

1733
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:35,050
Like if I go to La for the weekend,
I got a little sad to know that I'm in

1734
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:38,170
La because they test me at anytime.
That's the only thing I really knew

1735
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:40,420
about Usada.
I didn't know that.

1736
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:42,440
Doing something that I had done several
times before,

1737
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:46,000
it could ultimately lose me a fight,
so I'm.

1738
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,590
The only difference was I had taken like
little gas station pills and I've taken

1739
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,330
by Agora before this was,
this teammate gave me something that was

1740
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:59,200
Seattle is I thought the only thing that
it would do is make me bigger and

1741
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:02,200
stronger for longer.
That's all I thought was going to be

1742
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:05,230
happening and then when I find out that

1743
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:09,590
that I just felt that drug test.
Do you know that via Viagra is actually

1744
01:15:09,591 --> 01:15:12,110
illegal in the Olympics?
I didn't know that.

1745
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:16,670
You can't take that stuff.
The Viagra is a performance enhancer

1746
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,533
though.
It's a vassal.

1747
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,330
Dilate or I believe.
I believe that's how they describe it

1748
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:24,830
and it actually has athletic performance
enhancing product properties to it.

1749
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,060
How does it,
how does it help you?

1750
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,680
I don't know.
You'd have to look into that,

1751
01:15:27,681 --> 01:15:31,570
but I think it's similar to in a lot of
ways to nitric oxide supplement,

1752
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,830
like a,
like a pre workout and get your.

1753
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,840
Yeah,
yeah.

1754
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:38,440
It does something to open up your blood
cells and get you pumped.

1755
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:40,220
I mean,
it does something not just to your Dick

1756
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:42,710
but to all of your muscle.
Yeah.

1757
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,080
I don't know if I would want it to be
pumped up during a fight.

1758
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:46,830
I don't think it works that way.
I mean,

1759
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:50,600
I don't think it actually can possibly
potentially help endurance.

1760
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:52,611
Well,
yeah,

1761
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:54,680
I know,
but I know that athletes take it for

1762
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:56,360
that reason.
That's why it's banned from the

1763
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:56,860
Olympics.

1764
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,000
Yeah.
But,

1765
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,370
um,
but yeah,

1766
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,213
you know,

1767
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,700
I understand that it wasn't your
intention.

1768
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,320
It was not my intention.
I had no,

1769
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,370
I had no clue that I needed to report
this to the side of because I thought,

1770
01:16:08,371 --> 01:16:10,110
you know,
literally I was report and everything

1771
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,430
else.
What supplements,

1772
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,080
what preworkout,
what,

1773
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,510
you know,
my amino acids,

1774
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,460
protein powder,
like you saw it,

1775
01:16:17,461 --> 01:16:20,250
had all my stuff.
And what happens once you find out?

1776
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,200
Did you,
how'd you narrow it down to this pill?

1777
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:26,660
I literally,
I went through my supplements and I,

1778
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:28,700
um,
handed it to.

1779
01:16:28,701 --> 01:16:33,640
I hired a private lab in a lawyer and we
started handing it,

1780
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,440
given them everything that I took,
which isn't really a lot of stuff at

1781
01:16:36,441 --> 01:16:36,981
all,
you know,

1782
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:39,140
stuff that everyone should take fish
oil,

1783
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,630
basic basic supplements,
protein,

1784
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:43,330
protein powder,
fish oil,

1785
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,580
you know,
liver cleanse that like,

1786
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,750
or whatever.
Um,

1787
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,770
just grapeseed extract that kind of
stuff,

1788
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,280
very multivitamins for men.
Basic,

1789
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,270
very basic stuff.

1790
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,753
And,
um,

1791
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,910
and then,
and then get nutrition is like,

1792
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,830
you know,
we sweep,

1793
01:17:01,831 --> 01:17:03,620
scanned all of our stuff.
We know it's not from

1794
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,920
that.
Got Nutrition website,

1795
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:08,160
those fucking hilarious to the Gat
nutrition website at the moment.

1796
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:10,030
We found out about that said John
sponsored

1797
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,080
by Gat Nutrition.
So we've,

1798
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,230
oh,
let's check that out.

1799
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,630
Get nutrition to some fucking dude is
just,

1800
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,710
they have a lot of great,
great products.

1801
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:21,710
If you want to get bigger and stronger
than you can definitely go to them,

1802
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:23,660
you know.
But as soon as we saw that,

1803
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:25,800
we were like,
what in the holy fuck is he taking?

1804
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,340
Oh No,
I mean,

1805
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,520
but people saw you.
You got gigantic.

1806
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,870
Huge.
That radically,

1807
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:32,590
completely,
uh,

1808
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,180
completely natural.
And that's what I have great pride in

1809
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:36,880
being the natural athlete.
But,

1810
01:17:36,881 --> 01:17:38,800
um,
but,

1811
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:40,780
uh,
so they got,

1812
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,450
they got all the cat stuff,
test it and clear,

1813
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,650
right.
Everything was clear.

1814
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:48,030
Um,
this gets to have other things that you

1815
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,320
don't regulate.
Absolutely.

1816
01:17:50,321 --> 01:17:53,840
But the things that they gave me,
they were super smart about and uh,

1817
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,740
out in all the products I was clear and
um,

1818
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,790
and uh,
so my managers,

1819
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,240
I think outside of the box did you take
anything that could have possibly been?

1820
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:05,800
And I was like,
I don't think so.

1821
01:18:05,801 --> 01:18:06,970
Then I was like,
well,

1822
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:09,730
one of my teammates did give me this,
this dick pill.

1823
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,950
And he's like,
I need those.

1824
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,370
So we got those pills tested and sure
enough,

1825
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,233
they,
uh,

1826
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:21,340
in their ingredients,
they listed about five products in their

1827
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:26,341
ingredients and they actually a,
there's actually seven products too that

1828
01:18:28,571 --> 01:18:32,200
weren't listed in the ingredients.
The two estrogen blockers were never in

1829
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:33,390
their ingredients.
Um,

1830
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,240
so,
um,

1831
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,630
it was a tainted pill.
It was.

1832
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,780
Say what I'm saying?
Yes.

1833
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,360
So,
um,

1834
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:45,400
so the you cited was able to tell,
okay,

1835
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:47,160
this was totally inattention and there's
no way.

1836
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:52,740
No way in Hell I'm John would take these
estrogen blockers on purpose.

1837
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:55,780
First of all,
it was very small traces,

1838
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:59,900
so it wasn't like I was loaded up with
estrogen blockers and um,

1839
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,070
why the fuck would they put estrogen
blockers and a pill?

1840
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:06,910
We believe that the factory that created
these,

1841
01:19:06,911 --> 01:19:09,760
uh,
these dick pills were maybe

1842
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:12,430
manufacturing these pills in a dirty
laboratory,

1843
01:19:12,431 --> 01:19:14,920
whatever.
And they were just tainted.

1844
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,600
Yes,
because each pill that we,

1845
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:21,340
that we had tested,
some of them had more estrogen blockers,

1846
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:24,430
some had almost no estrogen blockers,
some head small traces.

1847
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:25,960
Actually none of the pills were
consistent.

1848
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,900
So it was obvious that it.
And we,

1849
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,180
we tested several different packages.
So it was obviously that,

1850
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:35,140
that these pills were probably getting
made in the same machine and there was

1851
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:39,190
just traces a little,
which is enough to show up in your

1852
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:42,760
system when you get at some of these
dick pills that had none.

1853
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,530
No estrogen blockers and be like,
damn,

1854
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,910
why didn't I get that one?
Yeah,

1855
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,300
exactly.
So I,

1856
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,680
I took one that was just contaminated
enough and literally I got tested two

1857
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:54,400
days later and it was in my system,
so it was,

1858
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,120
it was obvious that it was complete
accident and even,

1859
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,300
and even if I would have reported the
Deq pill to Usada,

1860
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,930
they would have read the label and the
label would have never said that it was

1861
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,440
estrogen blocker in there and I still
would have had a dirty.

1862
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,633
Right.

1863
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,530
That attainment contaminated.
Where does that leave you?

1864
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:15,180
How much time did they suspend you for?
I got suspended for a year back from

1865
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:18,540
starting from back in July.
So now I fight in July of two subs.

1866
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,760
I love you.
I love what they're doing.

1867
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,370
I don't agree with things like that.
I don't agree with things like that.

1868
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:26,910
Because what you took does not enhance
your performance?

1869
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:27,803
No,
it doesn't.

1870
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,490
Especially in such a trace amount.
I feel like in certain circumstances,

1871
01:20:32,491 --> 01:20:35,010
like there's been several fighters like
Chad Mendez,

1872
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,940
he has a,
I believe he has eczema and he was

1873
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:42,550
taking an Eczema cream that had some
sort of a.

1874
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:45,990
was it a hormone precursor or a hormone?
Peptide,

1875
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:49,110
I believe,
some sort of a hormone,

1876
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:54,111
peptide.
I think that enhances the use of this

1877
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,000
cream.
I don't.

1878
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:58,800
I don't know the full.
I'm obviously not a doctor or a

1879
01:20:58,801 --> 01:21:03,090
scientist,
but there's something about suspending

1880
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,440
someone for something like that.

1881
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:06,350
That seems ridiculous.
Well,

1882
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,240
in my situation they,
they

1883
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,380
the,
the evening you said his lawyer,

1884
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:15,780
he.
So he showed a little bit of remorse.

1885
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:17,640
I could.
I could feel that he felt bad about what

1886
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:19,580
was happening to me because I think he
could really,

1887
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,280
even the arbitrators,
they could tell what had actually

1888
01:21:23,281 --> 01:21:27,190
happened,
but their problem was they said John was

1889
01:21:27,191 --> 01:21:28,650
just negligent.
Like you didn't.

1890
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:32,110
You should have reported this pill,
but that doesn't.

1891
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:35,510
It seems to me that's silly.
I mean that's even if I would have

1892
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,440
reported the pill,
they would've read the ingredients and

1893
01:21:37,441 --> 01:21:39,480
they would've never saw that there was a
trace of,

1894
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:42,210
of something that wasn't advertised.
So why?

1895
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:43,920
Why suspend someone for something like
that?

1896
01:21:43,921 --> 01:21:46,290
Because they.
Because they have a zero tolerance

1897
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:49,050
policy.
It was just like I was the first fighter

1898
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:54,051
to ever take them to operation and and
they were more upset that I didn't let

1899
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:55,610
them know that I took the pill.

1900
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:59,040
Then what actually happened?
The rule,

1901
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:02,280
as you tell us what you take and we can
point you in a different direction,

1902
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,550
but I never told him what I took.
My whole argument.

1903
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:09,510
Was it if I told you what I took,
it still was never on the label.

1904
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,640
Yeah,
so unless you guys were going to spend

1905
01:22:11,641 --> 01:22:15,570
all the money to take it to a private
law or take it to a laboratory to test

1906
01:22:15,571 --> 01:22:17,520
this individually,
you get what I'm saying?

1907
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,780
I still ran into the same situation.
I think it's great to protect people

1908
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:24,810
from people that are cheating.
I don't think it's great to punish

1909
01:22:24,811 --> 01:22:28,260
someone for taking something that has a
trace amount of something that does the

1910
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:31,740
absolutely no benefit whatsoever and
clearly it wasn't supposed to be in that

1911
01:22:31,741 --> 01:22:35,820
pill and wasn't supposed to be in that
pill and clearly wasn't being taken to

1912
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:37,200
enhance athletic performance.

1913
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,550
Right.
That seems silly.

1914
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:41,370
It seems like a mess.
It seems like a mask that,

1915
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:42,120
I mean,
I,

1916
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,400
I understand their zero tolerance
policy.

1917
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:46,770
I don't agree with it.
And this is more of the Chad Mendez

1918
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:47,820
situation,
you know,

1919
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,980
there's,
there's weird ones like Yoel Romero.

1920
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,830
He tested positive for something.
They found out that it was a,

1921
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,750
in one of the protein powders or
something.

1922
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:56,280
He was taken.
It wasn't supposed to be in there,

1923
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:59,670
wasn't listed that way and they gave him
an abbreviated sentence.

1924
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,490
He should have.
No,

1925
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:01,800
no,
no punishment whatsoever.

1926
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,300
But I mean,
my whole thing,

1927
01:23:04,301 --> 01:23:05,830
Joe,
is I'm so grateful.

1928
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,140
I'm still optimistic,
man.

1929
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:10,540
I'm,
and I'm always looking for light in

1930
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,270
every situation.
Um,

1931
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,340
and I think that's the way I deal with
things.

1932
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:16,560
I just,
I'm always trying.

1933
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:18,340
I always believe there's going to be
good at the end of the day,

1934
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,730
that's just how I am.
I'm just so grateful where most people

1935
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:24,640
would be so upset with themselves and
all this type of stuff.

1936
01:23:24,641 --> 01:23:26,980
I'm really not.
I'm upset about the fans that are let

1937
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:29,200
down who flew out to UFC 200 and things
like that.

1938
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:32,860
But as far as the whole situation,
I'm just glad that that my,

1939
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,950
my name will no longer be associated
with steroids,

1940
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:38,530
but I'd rather be vulnerable or whatever
you want to call me,

1941
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,650
you know,
whatever you want to call me.

1942
01:23:41,651 --> 01:23:43,420
But steroids that,
that was,

1943
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,820
that would have really.
That was really bothering me.

1944
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:48,160
So I'm just glad that it's out.
What actually happened?

1945
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,200
Why did they choose to suspend you for
so long?

1946
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:53,770
Just because of the negligence behind
it.

1947
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:57,550
They didn't like the fact that I,
that I was handed a sex pill and I never

1948
01:23:57,551 --> 01:24:00,730
returned.
I never turned it into a them to check

1949
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:01,110
it out.

1950
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:02,820
And if they did,
they still would've kicked you off at

1951
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,663
UFC too.

1952
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,073
Yeah,
exactly.

1953
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:05,730
So

1954
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:06,990
I don't know.
That would have given you a more,

1955
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,360
maybe a more abbreviated suspension,
but still it's,

1956
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,730
it just seems ridiculous.
I wonder when we hand pills into Usada

1957
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:17,670
or hand anything into these Saturday,
did they read the label and say,

1958
01:24:17,671 --> 01:24:19,500
Oh yeah,
you can take this or do they actually

1959
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:21,720
take it somewhere and test it?
I'm sure they read the label.

1960
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,530
I mean if they still would have been in

1961
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,201
position,
yeah,

1962
01:24:24,201 --> 01:24:25,770
they are,
they're not going to test things.

1963
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,120
I mean that's,
that's expensive.

1964
01:24:27,121 --> 01:24:29,010
And if it doesn't say it's on there,
there's no reason.

1965
01:24:29,011 --> 01:24:31,410
I mean if somebody gives you whey
protein powder,

1966
01:24:31,411 --> 01:24:33,990
well hey,
let's test this and make sure that it

1967
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,390
doesn't have clomid in it or say

1968
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:38,420
it would take weeks to get it back and
it cost thousands of dollars and if

1969
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:40,910
you're doing that for every UFC fighter.
So yeah,

1970
01:24:40,911 --> 01:24:41,840
that's my whole thing.
I'm like,

1971
01:24:41,841 --> 01:24:43,460
even about,
I told you guys I took it,

1972
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:45,860
you guys would have read the label and
it gave me the okay,

1973
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,700
right.
Because we were allowed to have what's

1974
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,180
an vagrancy?
Alice and us,

1975
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:55,220
we're actually allowed to but because
mine's was tainted and I didn't ask,

1976
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:57,260
they were just like,
well you never asked so we're going to

1977
01:24:57,261 --> 01:24:59,630
suspend you.
So I don't really know why they decided

1978
01:24:59,631 --> 01:25:01,910
to go ahead with the full maximum
punishment.

1979
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,920
But I tend not to question things that
I'm.

1980
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,980
So I'm really young and,
and you know,

1981
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,400
I believe that my best years of my prime
is even still ahead of me,

1982
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:15,200
so I'm not even tripping about it.
I'm like,

1983
01:25:15,201 --> 01:25:15,940
you know,
whatever,

1984
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:16,430
like,
you know,

1985
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:18,710
I believe in God,
so I try to always point things back

1986
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:19,230
towards God.

1987
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:20,063
I'm just saying,
well,

1988
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:21,890
you know,
maybe this is God's plan for me.

1989
01:25:21,891 --> 01:25:26,270
Maybe I need this time away from the
sport just to continue working on my own

1990
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:28,100
personal development and growth as a man
and,

1991
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:30,680
and I,
I do believe I'm in a good place right

1992
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:32,540
now.
So I'm excited to see where I will be

1993
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,260
back in July when it's time for me to
actually compete with Glen.

1994
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:37,950
In July you released?
Uh,

1995
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:43,030
I think around July
when was used 200 July,

1996
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:47,900
eighth July fifth GFC,
200 was December 10th or 11th?

1997
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,240
December 11th.
I'm sorry,

1998
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:55,260
that was a ufc 205 UFC 200 was July
ninth.

1999
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,410
Okay.
So July seventh I'll be eligible to

2000
01:25:57,411 --> 01:26:00,880
fight two days before UFC 200 July.
Seventh,

2001
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:03,470
2017.
I'll be able to compete and I'd like to

2002
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:04,820
fight right in July.

2003
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,710
Yeah,
there's a big UFC July fourth car that

2004
01:26:07,711 --> 01:26:09,480
we put on every year,
but you're going to miss that.

2005
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:11,070
MMM.
MMM.

2006
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:14,300
What do you think now when you look at
the UFC title?

2007
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:18,470
Picture cormier just had to pull out.
He injured himself and a rumble.

2008
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:21,740
Johnson decided not to fight Luke saucy.
He decided to step back and wait for

2009
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,720
cormier.
You know,

2010
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,730
I don't believe.
I think that's a smart idea.

2011
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,770
Um,
Musashi is capable.

2012
01:26:28,771 --> 01:26:31,830
He's a very smart fighter of being
rumble.

2013
01:26:31,831 --> 01:26:33,000
Johnson and I'm.

2014
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,100
It's a high risk,
low,

2015
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,700
low return,
low return.

2016
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:40,370
Why?
Why do you need to be Sassy?

2017
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,650
Yeah,
yeah,

2018
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,290
yeah.
The title fight picture is sort of

2019
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:46,060
waiting.
A lot of it is waiting on you.

2020
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:48,550
That's a big part of it.
Waiting on you to return.

2021
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,830
Yeah.
I'm excited to go back and get my baby.

2022
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,760
I have they had conversations with you
about when you do return,

2023
01:26:54,761 --> 01:26:58,060
what kind of fight you would have.
Would you go right to a title fight?

2024
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,230
Fight a contender?

2025
01:26:59,280 --> 01:26:59,870
No,
it is.

2026
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:04,130
No one's spoken to me about whether I
get an immediate shot or a,

2027
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:08,610
whether they make me a fight at least
once or twice before or no,

2028
01:27:08,611 --> 01:27:10,290
I have no clue what they're actually
planning on doing.

2029
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,000
But

2030
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,920
how often do you communicate with UFC?

2031
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,190
I,
I literally haven't spoken to Dana

2032
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:15,820
White,
uh,

2033
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:19,580
since uh,
like a week before ufc 200

2034
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,570
now that the UFC has been sold.

2035
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:25,960
Well actually not a week before a fight
week of UFC 200 years anyways.

2036
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:29,290
Now the UC has been sold and there's
these new owners.

2037
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,520
What's your thoughts on all this?

2038
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:32,740
I'm excited to,
uh,

2039
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,230
to get to know the new owners of the
UCL.

2040
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,840
I don't,
I've had a few interactions with ra

2041
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,200
before.
Um,

2042
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,540
but um,
obviously I've never dealt with them on

2043
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,600
a business level,
but I'm excited.

2044
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:46,810
I do Miss Lorenzo Fertitta.
I think I had a great relationship with

2045
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:48,790
him.
He was always the calm,

2046
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:49,630
cool,
collected one,

2047
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:51,640
the one that I could actually,
you know,

2048
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:56,641
like leave emotion behind it and like
really have a good conversation with.

2049
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:57,730
So,
you know,

2050
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,360
we had a great relationship in that way.
Um,

2051
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,710
but I'm,
I'm,

2052
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,090
I'm excited about the new leadership.

2053
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,591
Yeah,
it's interesting,

2054
01:28:05,591 --> 01:28:08,680
right?
It's a new chapter in it is a lot of who

2055
01:28:08,681 --> 01:28:11,030
knows that that's what gets exciting and
they're,

2056
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:16,210
they're obviously very entertainment
business savvy and see where it,

2057
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:21,570
where it leads to.
When you look at the state of mixed

2058
01:28:21,841 --> 01:28:25,350
martial arts today,
what problems do you see in mma?

2059
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,713
Hmm.

2060
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,320
Do you see anything that stands out
glaringly?

2061
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:32,400
Like,
here's,

2062
01:28:32,401 --> 01:28:35,820
here's some things that I think about
weight cutting weight,

2063
01:28:35,821 --> 01:28:39,810
cuttings of giant issue.
When you see all this work that's being

2064
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:44,370
put in by Usada to make sure that people
aren't taking things to the point where

2065
01:28:44,371 --> 01:28:47,880
someone like you who's taking something
that's not a performance enhancer,

2066
01:28:47,881 --> 01:28:50,760
get suspended for a year.
And the idea is that you're supposed to

2067
01:28:50,761 --> 01:28:54,210
be protecting fighters from someone
who's doing something that's dangerous,

2068
01:28:54,211 --> 01:28:56,280
right?
That's the tape behind it.

2069
01:28:56,281 --> 01:29:00,360
The cheating and somehow could cause
potential danger or damage to people.

2070
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:01,950
But what about cutting man,
isn't it?

2071
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:03,690
I mean,
it isn't extreme weight cutting.

2072
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:05,370
One of the most dangerous things.

2073
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,660
Um,
so we're going to put this on pause.

2074
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:08,330
I have to pee.

2075
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:08,941
Oh,
okay,

2076
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:09,774
go ahead.
Go ahead.

2077
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,830
I was drinking this water and coffee.
Good.

2078
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,150
Talk about weight cutting.
John's going to be right back.

2079
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:18,390
Go right to that door.
Take the eggs on light and don't let

2080
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:20,130
your publicist talk you to coming back
in here.

2081
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:21,780
She's probably listening.

2082
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,090
Interesting.
Very forthcoming with the boner pill

2083
01:29:26,091 --> 01:29:27,890
talk.
I think that's important.

2084
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,550
I mean if anyone's going to believe him,
that's the only way to really get it out

2085
01:29:31,551 --> 01:29:33,740
there.
I fucking hate weight cutting.

2086
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:38,820
I do.
I had a conversation with Ari Emanuel

2087
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:43,400
about it and I'm going to have a
conversation soon with Novitsky about it

2088
01:29:43,401 --> 01:29:48,401
and I just think is the most.
It's the most unnecessary and dangerous

2089
01:29:48,531 --> 01:29:53,330
aspect and fighting the most important
aspect in fighting his fighters,

2090
01:29:53,331 --> 01:29:58,280
being healthy and in shape and competing
to the best of our abilities and if

2091
01:29:58,281 --> 01:30:01,520
there's anything that inhibits that
other than not training,

2092
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:04,400
it's the dehydration effect of Wake
County.

2093
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:08,420
I think weight cutting is.
It's terrible and now that they can't

2094
01:30:08,421 --> 01:30:10,280
use ivs,
I'm obviously again,

2095
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,910
hate to say this again.
I'm not a doctor so I don't know what.

2096
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,050
What is the most effective method of
rehydrating?

2097
01:30:18,051 --> 01:30:22,070
But I've talked to doctors and I guess
they vary in their opinions because some

2098
01:30:22,071 --> 01:30:26,180
people say it's orally is the best way
through drinking water slowly,

2099
01:30:26,181 --> 01:30:28,640
but some people say it's not.
Some doctors say no.

2100
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:32,240
Ivy is a far superior method,
especially when it comes to rehydrating

2101
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:35,240
the brain,
which could take as much as 72 hours.

2102
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:38,060
Um,
I think it's interesting that in boxing

2103
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:43,090
most of the deaths have come from the
lighter weight divisions and they

2104
01:30:43,491 --> 01:30:45,640
attribute that also to weight cutting
and did

2105
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,720
duration.
Okay.

2106
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:49,520
So you have a bag that I'm talking way
too much.

2107
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,560
Ah,
I knew it.

2108
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,760
I knew it.
She's like you said too much about the

2109
01:30:53,761 --> 01:30:57,660
Dick Pills,
mom on the dick pills longer,

2110
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:58,680
faster,
harder Jones.

2111
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:02,500
Really?
How much we

2112
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:03,830
do you cut?
Um,

2113
01:31:03,831 --> 01:31:05,510
I don't really cut a lot of weight at
all.

2114
01:31:05,511 --> 01:31:06,344
I,
um,

2115
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:11,370
I,
I get myself down to about

2116
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:17,850
2:20 on fight week.
And then what do you weigh right now?

2117
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:23,290
Write down to 30 2:30 to 2:30.
But I get myself down to about 2:20

2118
01:31:24,501 --> 01:31:29,030
during fight week.
And then I make sure that the day of

2119
01:31:29,031 --> 01:31:32,240
winds I cut about five pounds of water.
That's nothing.

2120
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,233
No,
it was nothing.

2121
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,910
But that's a testament to just,
you know,

2122
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,070
I've been doing it for so long now I
know my job is to be,

2123
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,660
you know,
to have my weight together.

2124
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:44,720
When you see conor mcgregor weigh in at
1:45 and it looks like,

2125
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,480
like death,
right?

2126
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:49,910
You know that when I see those,
that that's what scares the shit out of

2127
01:31:49,911 --> 01:31:53,900
me when I see people that are just
clearly cutting way too much weight or

2128
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,280
when I ever saw was travis Luder when he
fought Anderson Silva,

2129
01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:00,910
Travis Luder,
he like his lips were dried up and

2130
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:03,650
cracked and he was shuffling to the
scale.

2131
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:06,610
Like he couldn't walk.
He didn't have the strength to pick his

2132
01:32:06,611 --> 01:32:08,660
feet up and walk.
He was like,

2133
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,990
just shuffling towards the end.
He still didn't make the way.

2134
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,780
It's shitty but scares me the most
because a,

2135
01:32:14,781 --> 01:32:16,830
there's not a lot of options when it
comes to weight classes.

2136
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:18,730
If someone's one 85 and they go,
you know,

2137
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:20,740
man,
I'm having a hard time fighting one 85.

2138
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,690
Then they look at you and they're like,
fuck that.

2139
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,710
This is two.
Oh five.

2140
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:27,040
That's a 20 pound jump.
Twenty pounds is a big jump.

2141
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:28,690
It's huge.
Yeah.

2142
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:31,070
Yeah.
As far as will it come for me,

2143
01:32:31,071 --> 01:32:32,480
I just,
you know,

2144
01:32:32,481 --> 01:32:34,970
it's never really been an issue for me.
I've always made way.

2145
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:36,980
I've never come close to missing way.
Um,

2146
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,410
I just think,
aren't you

2147
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:40,860
lucky though that you are in the
neighborhood of two?

2148
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,420
Oh five.
Like what have you.

2149
01:32:42,421 --> 01:32:46,330
We're just a little bigger and you know,
you're in the heavyweight.

2150
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,390
If I was a little bigger than I will
let,

2151
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:50,380
I would go to heavyweight.
Um,

2152
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:51,440
but you know,
a part of,

2153
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,880
of our,
of our job is to keep our weight under

2154
01:32:54,881 --> 01:32:56,280
control.
You know,

2155
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,910
if you know,
you're gonna be fine at two.

2156
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:59,550
Oh five.
You have no business walking around it,

2157
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,750
you know,
a to 50.

2158
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:03,310
You know what I mean?
So,

2159
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:04,203
you know,
he's just,

2160
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,150
you know,
there's enough weight classes.

2161
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,081
No,
I,

2162
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:10,780
I would like there to be at least
another weight class when it comes to

2163
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:11,620
us.
Big Boys,

2164
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:14,280
you know what I mean?
I would love it if they went to 25 to

2165
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,250
25.
Yeah,

2166
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,530
I believe that there was a to 25 pound
weight class,

2167
01:33:17,531 --> 01:33:19,570
I'd be,
I'd be a two belt holder myself.

2168
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,120
You feel like that would be a better
weight class for you?

2169
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,160
Uh,
I,

2170
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,440
I love to a five.
I make 25 just fine,

2171
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:30,100
but to 25 I compete against 2:25 pounder
any day,

2172
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,800
you know,
face the guy who's shown up fight night

2173
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:37,060
at 2:40 or whatever and you know,
as bargains heavyweights pretty much

2174
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:37,894
every,
you know,

2175
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,210
I've been doing it my whole career
anyway.

2176
01:33:39,211 --> 01:33:40,240
So,
um,

2177
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,070
it'd be great to see,
uh,

2178
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:45,340
some,
something that bridges that gap a little

2179
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:47,050
bit from 12.
Five to two 65.

2180
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:48,200
Yeah,
I would like to see it.

2181
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:51,950
I would like to see between 55 and 70
slash 70 and 85.

2182
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:56,600
Just 15 pounds a giant leap.
Twenty pounds from 85 to 205.

2183
01:33:57,230 --> 01:33:58,200
And then of course two.
Oh,

2184
01:33:58,201 --> 01:33:59,660
five to heavyweight,
that's a huge leap.

2185
01:33:59,661 --> 01:34:00,420
That's 65 years

2186
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,490
pound check antic yeah.
A lot of people are like,

2187
01:34:02,491 --> 01:34:05,070
why don't you go up to heavyweight and
try to win the belt there.

2188
01:34:05,071 --> 01:34:07,620
I'm just like,
you realize what you're asking me to do.

2189
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,590
These,
these guys are very skilled.

2190
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:12,810
He's got a very skilled and,
and they,

2191
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,150
they can waive it for 60 pounds more
than me.

2192
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,310
That's very dangerous.
But,

2193
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:19,110
but have you thought about doing heavy
weight?

2194
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,390
I do want to challenge,
uh,

2195
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:23,040
for the heavyweight title.
Um,

2196
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,960
but I'm waiting for the perfect
opponent.

2197
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:28,000
And when you do do that,
when you challenge for the heavyweight

2198
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:30,160
title,
are you going to gain weight?

2199
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:31,690
Are you going to fight it the way you
were at?

2200
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,240
I'll fight right around two,
2:30.

2201
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,590
So you will not lose any weight at all.
I would try to eat a lot and make sure

2202
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:42,170
my endurance and speed and agility is
where it needs to be.

2203
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:45,430
And uh,
I've beaten up a lot of heavyweights.

2204
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,340
Man,
you know,

2205
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:48,860
the only people who are at Jackson's
have seen that.

2206
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:52,730
I've submitted a lot of heavyweights.
I've slammed a lot of heavyweights of

2207
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,890
manhandled a lot of heavyweights,
but um,

2208
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,133
but,
um,

2209
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:59,360
and I've done it right at the weight I
am now,

2210
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:01,570
so I know that,
that I,

2211
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:04,010
that I'm capable,
I just wanted to make sure that I

2212
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:07,550
compete against the,
the right stylistic matchup for me when

2213
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:09,440
I do go to heavyweight and challenge for
that title.

2214
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,600
One of the things you said earlier that
I thought was really intense.

2215
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,020
Nice.
You said you're not going to spar hard

2216
01:35:14,021 --> 01:35:14,580
again.

2217
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,413
Yeah.
No,

2218
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:19,290
not until it was time.
I feel like I've been majorly preserving

2219
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:22,730
myself,
so I'm leading up to the oven st proof.

2220
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:23,460
I,
I,

2221
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,130
I took almost as if no concussions
whatsoever.

2222
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:30,970
And then I've been a suspended now for
another year and I've taken no

2223
01:35:30,971 --> 01:35:31,920
concussions.
So,

2224
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,900
um,
while I feel like a lot of these guys

2225
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:36,600
are in this race to,
to get better,

2226
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:39,770
I'm getting a lot better.
I'm getting a lot stronger.

2227
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:42,000
My wrestling and Jujitsu was getting a
lot sharper.

2228
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:43,470
Um,
but I've,

2229
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:47,670
I've completely,
my brain is feeling great right now.

2230
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:51,330
I haven't been polluting it with shit
and I haven't damaged it.

2231
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,430
And so I just feel like,
uh,

2232
01:35:53,431 --> 01:35:57,300
you got the best fighter in light
heavyweight history,

2233
01:35:57,870 --> 01:36:02,280
who's still the youngest guy in the
division who hasn't taken any damage

2234
01:36:02,281 --> 01:36:05,610
whatsoever and it's completely
regenerating himself and I'm going to

2235
01:36:05,611 --> 01:36:08,790
come back and have this explosive,
explosive second half of my career.

2236
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,470
No,
there's a lot of guys that are doing

2237
01:36:11,471 --> 01:36:13,120
that now where they're not sparring
hard.

2238
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,940
Um,
cowboy barely spars at all.

2239
01:36:15,941 --> 01:36:18,760
I don't think even spars.
He does some tactical sparring where,

2240
01:36:18,761 --> 01:36:20,050
you know,
just tap touch,

2241
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,630
just move around.
But he's mostly just doing drills.

2242
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,690
That's what I'm going to get into.
He said he changed that after the Dos

2243
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,720
Anjos fight.
He said when he lost a hot failed Dos

2244
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,290
Anjos,
he just felt like maybe he had

2245
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:31,420
diminished himself too much with hard
sparring.

2246
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:32,610
Do a lot of these guys.
They,

2247
01:36:32,611 --> 01:36:35,080
they leave their career in the gym,
you know,

2248
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,390
like you get no points.
I got,

2249
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,010
there's a few guys that come to mind
right now.

2250
01:36:38,011 --> 01:36:40,750
I Jackson's who,
who get punched in the head.

2251
01:36:40,751 --> 01:36:43,420
I'm sitting there watching them and I
watch a lot of fighting and I'm still a

2252
01:36:43,421 --> 01:36:45,010
huge student of the game,
um,

2253
01:36:45,011 --> 01:36:48,100
but I'm not doing it myself.
These guys laugh and like,

2254
01:36:48,101 --> 01:36:48,831
you know,
they'll get punched in,

2255
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:52,120
they start giggling or are they just.
And that's the dumbest shit to me.

2256
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:56,260
Every like getting punched in the head
pisses me off if I leave practice with a

2257
01:36:56,261 --> 01:36:57,310
headache,
I'm pissed,

2258
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:58,421
you know,
I feel like,

2259
01:36:58,421 --> 01:37:01,230
uh,
I just took away from myself or just

2260
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:03,810
there was one more punch I could have
saved for an actual event.

2261
01:37:03,811 --> 01:37:05,770
And so right now,
um,

2262
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:07,910
you know,
I have a great chin.

2263
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,480
I've never been wrapped or wobble.
Um,

2264
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,520
and uh,
I want to keep it that way.

2265
01:37:12,521 --> 01:37:14,840
I'm going to preserve my myself,
um,

2266
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:16,500
because the skills will come.
Um,

2267
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,120
but you know,
that brain wants,

2268
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:20,440
wants,
is a yellow,

2269
01:37:20,441 --> 01:37:21,430
is yellow forever

2270
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:24,320
Jello forever.
And that's a security thing when you see

2271
01:37:24,321 --> 01:37:26,890
guys go,
when you see a guy like maybe chuck

2272
01:37:26,891 --> 01:37:30,770
Liddell was one of the best examples
ever because he had an iron jaw at one

2273
01:37:30,771 --> 01:37:32,630
point in time.
He was just indestructable.

2274
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:35,900
And then he saw,
he just get wobbled by shots that

2275
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:38,330
normally he would just eat like,
like a tic TAC.

2276
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2277
01:37:39,231 --> 01:37:41,600
And when it goes,
it just goes and it does not come back.

2278
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:42,980
I'm saving my shit.
Joe,

2279
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,960
I hear you saying I want you to now
Jackson's is such a crazy place because

2280
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:52,430
it's a hotbed of mma talent and it's a,
it's a magnet for talented people to

2281
01:37:52,431 --> 01:37:54,530
come there to get better because they
know they're gonna be training with a

2282
01:37:54,531 --> 01:37:58,350
bunch of animals there.
But I'm hearing now with the opening of

2283
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:01,830
the new place that you just,
you guys just got so many tough dudes

2284
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:03,240
come in.
They're trying to make a name.

2285
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:05,400
Right?
Do you have an issue with that when it

2286
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:08,550
comes to sparring where guys want to try
to make a names barring,

2287
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:08,920
you know,

2288
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,540
I personally don't have an issue with
it.

2289
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:11,680
So me,
uh,

2290
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:14,140
since we've had our new gym,
um,

2291
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:17,750
it's this gigantic facility and we need
people to pay the bills.

2292
01:38:17,751 --> 01:38:21,700
So we literally,
we allow a lot of people to come into

2293
01:38:21,701 --> 01:38:24,580
the gym who I don't think are always
qualified to be in the gym,

2294
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,130
um,
but we allow everybody to come.

2295
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:29,830
And so anybody off the street,
like any normal person?

2296
01:38:29,831 --> 01:38:30,664
No you can't.
No.

2297
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:32,950
So our gym manager,
he does have an extensive,

2298
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:36,850
like a tryout thing that he does where
he puts you through his jujitsu

2299
01:38:36,851 --> 01:38:40,300
wrestling and kicking and striking and
make sure you are knowledgeable about

2300
01:38:40,301 --> 01:38:41,950
the game.
So you have to have experience,

2301
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,550
like how much experience do they have to
have?

2302
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:45,350
They have to be like an amateur MMA

2303
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,610
fighter.
There's a lot of damage belt in Jujitsu.

2304
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,900
Like you just,
you can't,

2305
01:38:48,901 --> 01:38:50,650
you can't be a guy off the street who
don't know.

2306
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,680
She has no shit.
But outside of that,

2307
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,860
you know,
if you have a general idea of martial

2308
01:38:54,861 --> 01:38:57,540
arts and you know,
that we were opening the door to a lot

2309
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:58,500
of people right now.
So

2310
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,950
pro fight jam or do they offer classes
for beginners

2311
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,500
amateur classes?
Um,

2312
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:05,000
so have,
you know,

2313
01:39:05,001 --> 01:39:07,340
almost nothing.
You're in the amateur classes.

2314
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:10,820
And then there's the pro pro pro
practices where you literally get,

2315
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:13,550
you know,
guys who aren't very knowledgeable

2316
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,940
training next to me and Holly Holm,
cowboy cerrone,

2317
01:39:15,941 --> 01:39:17,290
and you know,
so it's,

2318
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,550
it's,
it's a fan experience for sure.

2319
01:39:19,551 --> 01:39:22,910
And it's an experience of a lifetime for
a lot of people.

2320
01:39:22,911 --> 01:39:26,250
And I'm happy for a lot of these guys
who come in here inspiring my shield.

2321
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:29,150
I was against the train with me and the
rest of us,

2322
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,060
uh,
because I can only imagine wanting to,

2323
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:34,700
you know,
you get to play ball with Lebron James

2324
01:39:34,701 --> 01:39:37,850
and you just got out of college or you
never went to college.

2325
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:41,720
Like I am happy for them as long as they
don't get in my way.

2326
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:43,220
Did.
That is the big difference though,

2327
01:39:43,221 --> 01:39:46,210
is someone who wants to come and play
with Lebron James,

2328
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:48,280
you know,
you want to make a name for yourself.

2329
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:50,920
So with me,
you could dunk on Lebron James and were

2330
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:51,790
like,
oh,

2331
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:52,870
I can't believe you did that.
But.

2332
01:39:52,871 --> 01:39:54,580
So the difference between that and
fighting

2333
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,840
I have,
I have a way of,

2334
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:59,280
of not letting this affect my game
personally.

2335
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:01,120
Um,
I'm a,

2336
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,960
I'm a decent judge,
like I can read people's character a

2337
01:40:03,961 --> 01:40:05,710
little bit and uh,
have,

2338
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:09,800
have I see you for the first time.
You are obviously about to 62.

2339
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:11,910
Oh,
five whatever to 20 and you,

2340
01:40:11,911 --> 01:40:15,930
it's all about the way you look at me.
So if you come into the gym and you even

2341
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:20,340
look like you have an ounce of a chip on
your shoulder or like an ounce of Holy

2342
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:21,020
Shit,
that's John Jones.

2343
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:24,130
I'm getting ready to,
to spar him today.

2344
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,370
Like alright,
like anything weird that's going on with

2345
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:29,370
your eye contact with me then I'm just
not gonna mess with you.

2346
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:34,050
Say Hi to you and welcome to Jackson's
and say,

2347
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,240
hey man,
do you want a spar?

2348
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,153
I'm like,
Hey,

2349
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:37,023
I don't know.

2350
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:41,220
I just,
I don't have any room for,

2351
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,930
for people trying to prove anything with
me.

2352
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:44,620
There's a lot of that there.
Isn't there?

2353
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:45,793
Yeah,
it happens.

2354
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:47,820
So me,
the best way you can work with me when

2355
01:40:47,821 --> 01:40:49,770
you come to Jackson and just come up and
introduce yourself,

2356
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:51,090
be kind,
be polite,

2357
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:55,540
be respectful and um,
show me that you are here to get better

2358
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,300
and uh,
and that you are not here to,

2359
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:00,820
you know,
even some guys that come in and ask for

2360
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:02,800
a picture of their first day here and
I'm just like,

2361
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,700
it's like do earn,
like why don't you come here,

2362
01:41:06,701 --> 01:41:09,340
work your ass off for a few days,
few weeks or whatever,

2363
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:12,730
and then get to this place where you
feel like you're comfortable to expert

2364
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:14,530
picture instead of just being here and
being a fan.

2365
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,590
People want those fucking pictures is
instantaneously.

2366
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:18,490
Yes.
Like Bro,

2367
01:41:18,491 --> 01:41:20,350
you're here,
you're in the church right now.

2368
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:22,960
You're in the met.
Like you don't take a picture here.

2369
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:23,930
Like,
you know.

2370
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:24,831
Yeah.
I don't know.

2371
01:41:24,831 --> 01:41:26,160
I just know what you mean.
No,

2372
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:28,360
like,
yeah,

2373
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:30,160
you should.
That's not where your mind should be at

2374
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,840
facebook page.
Right?

2375
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:32,380
Yo,
look,

2376
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,660
look,
wide trailer today is just like I told

2377
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:36,510
you I was bad motherfucker.
Yeah.

2378
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,230
Or Yeah,
you'll see that they'll tag you in a

2379
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:41,830
pitcher and his thing had just trained
with the boat and really we didn't even

2380
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:43,690
train together.
We like you were just in the room.

2381
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:49,480
But um,
but I do see the benefits of habits.

2382
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:52,610
So many new people coming in.
I mean everyone has something to teach

2383
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:55,870
and you can learn from,
from anybody from any country if you

2384
01:41:55,871 --> 01:41:57,220
will,
if you have an open mind enough.

2385
01:41:57,221 --> 01:42:01,330
And a lot of the guys come in with a
great attitude and they're just really

2386
01:42:01,331 --> 01:42:03,040
grateful to be there and there.
And they,

2387
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,440
um,
they go with a lot of the top dogs and

2388
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:08,410
you know,
we can kind of beat him up a little bit,

2389
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:10,810
you know,
because they're the new guy or whatever.

2390
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,390
Um,
but every once in a while you get that

2391
01:42:13,391 --> 01:42:15,530
one guy was something improving it.
And I've really found,

2392
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,580
came up with a great way to protect
myself from those types of people.

2393
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:21,370
But you've run into those.
Um,

2394
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,500
most people,
most people,

2395
01:42:23,501 --> 01:42:27,040
like I'm always very defensive when I'm
going with the guy who I felt like he

2396
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:29,500
could be trying to prove something,
like even when we're drilling,

2397
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:31,300
my defense is always on.

2398
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:33,580
I don't,
I don't give someone the opportunity to

2399
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:37,720
take a swing or ticket punch.
I've had one guy hit me with a monster

2400
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:39,580
is overhand,
right while we're drilling.

2401
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:42,460
And that was intentionally to,
to knock me out.

2402
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,770
And uh,
instead of retaliating,

2403
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,300
I just,
I said,

2404
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:47,770
uh,
I said,

2405
01:42:47,771 --> 01:42:48,604
man,
you okay?

2406
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:49,563
And he's like,
uh,

2407
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:50,351
yeah,
I'm around.

2408
01:42:50,351 --> 01:42:51,101
I'm sorry,
I just,

2409
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:52,770
I don't know what happened.
And I was just like,

2410
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,370
okay,
well that was,

2411
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,120
that was fun,
man,

2412
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,780
that's working with you,
will never ever work with you again.

2413
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:02,170
At one guy punched me in the balls
intentionally to not too long ago.

2414
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,620
And uh,
and that was his last time ever trained

2415
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:07,720
with me as well.
So it's

2416
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:15,540
smart to stay away from you,
but you do find those disturbed people

2417
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:20,140
that get involved in fighting and um,
they do want to take a chance at a guy

2418
01:43:20,141 --> 01:43:22,090
like Jon Jones take a swing at you.

2419
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,830
Man,
we'll connect and knocked him out,

2420
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:28,890
knocked out Jon Jones.
I go like a few times that it has

2421
01:43:29,141 --> 01:43:29,974
happened to,
uh,

2422
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:31,390
I'll,
I'll let my teammates,

2423
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:33,610
now I'm going to match what you're
trying to do to me.

2424
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,080
So,
you know,

2425
01:43:35,081 --> 01:43:38,830
don't be surprised if I fuck you up with
something that's a little bit more than

2426
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:40,920
what you would do to a trading partner
if,

2427
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:43,780
if I realize you're trying to hurt me.
Do you meditate,

2428
01:43:43,781 --> 01:43:45,730
John?
I used to meditate a lot.

2429
01:43:45,731 --> 01:43:49,210
Now I'm more big into visualization.
When did you use to meditate?

2430
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:53,780
I'm right around 2000,
around 2010,

2431
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,660
2011.
Um,

2432
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:58,970
I went through this huge spiritual thing
where I,

2433
01:43:58,971 --> 01:44:00,740
um,
I became obsessed with,

2434
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:04,000
um,
the power of the mind and um,

2435
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:08,400
I got into a deep,
like really deep just um,

2436
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:12,980
meditation and visualization and just
realizing how powerful our minds

2437
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:15,830
actually are.
Like how we really do paint our world

2438
01:44:15,831 --> 01:44:18,170
with our thoughts and our level of self
belief.

2439
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,720
And so,
um,

2440
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,190
right around 2010,
um,

2441
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:27,440
I just took myself to this different
mental level where I took myself on

2442
01:44:27,441 --> 01:44:31,280
being an average joe kind of.
You'd probably hate every show.

2443
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,890
Uh Huh.
That's aggressive.

2444
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:39,460
It wasn't used to that name.
Such a goofy name.

2445
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,630
It's good.
It's like a blank.

2446
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:42,970
It's like cardboard.
There's nothing to it.

2447
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:46,630
Yeah.
So I took myself on being very average

2448
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:51,580
minded to actually believing that I was
the shit and believing that I could be

2449
01:44:51,581 --> 01:44:54,850
the shit and that I could be the goat
and be the greatest and never lose into

2450
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:57,190
like I take myself to a different place
mentally.

2451
01:44:57,191 --> 01:44:58,420
And it,
a lot of it came from,

2452
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:01,930
um,
mental practice and meditation and

2453
01:45:01,931 --> 01:45:06,310
visualization and just seeking knowledge
from people who are strong believers

2454
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:11,320
because like I'm Les Brown and Tony
Robbins and guys like that.

2455
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:16,240
I just became really obsessed with just
learn about the power of the mind.

2456
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,880
So I used to meditate.
Now I just kind of,

2457
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,670
I have a lot of things that have stuck
with me,

2458
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:24,580
a lot of ways of believing that stuck
with me that just subconsciously I know

2459
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:30,970
who I am and what I'm capable of and how
I believe apart from my mind actually is

2460
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:35,060
I'm a firm believer in meditation
because I believe that human beings can

2461
01:45:35,061 --> 01:45:37,820
get caught up,
especially someone involved in a very

2462
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:41,330
difficult endeavor like you are.
You can get caught up in the momentum of

2463
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:44,810
your life and sometimes it's very hard
to reset.

2464
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:49,900
It's a very hard to separate yourself
from it and get a balanced and as much

2465
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:54,560
as you can objective perspective,
and I think one of the best ways to do

2466
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:59,000
that is to take time.
We sit and you close your eyes and you

2467
01:45:59,001 --> 01:46:04,001
do nothing and just concentrate on your
breathing and just just set it all aside

2468
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:10,850
and extract yourself.
Extract your consciousness from the

2469
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:14,420
momentum of your life and I think a lot
of people don't do that and they get

2470
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:18,800
caught up in this hurricane of existence
where everything is just constantly

2471
01:46:18,801 --> 01:46:20,630
going on.
Your phone won't stop ringing.

2472
01:46:20,631 --> 01:46:22,970
There's fucking people knocking at your
door.

2473
01:46:22,971 --> 01:46:25,960
You got this going on that going on and
you got to go catch this flight.

2474
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,130
No Shit,
you got fight coming up and Oh shit,

2475
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:31,850
you got this and that.
And sometimes you lose yourself.

2476
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:34,090
You lose yourself in that wave of life.

2477
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:36,940
I definitely lost myself at one point in
my life.

2478
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:39,820
Um,
and I feel like right now I'm at this

2479
01:46:39,821 --> 01:46:44,821
position where I am,
I am myself and I can see John Bones

2480
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:52,140
Jones and I'm like,
I can like look at my career from a fan

2481
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:55,020
perspective.
You get what I'm saying?

2482
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:58,470
And um,
and actually make fun of myself like,

2483
01:46:58,471 --> 01:47:02,640
Damn you fucking idiot.
Like what have you done?

2484
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:03,570
Like,
you know what I mean?

2485
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:04,970
Like,
um,

2486
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:06,810
I,
I have,

2487
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,440
I have a good way of detaching something
inside of me and,

2488
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:13,470
and,
and seeing what's happening and okay,

2489
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,370
oh no,
it's not over.

2490
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,020
You've got to do is just do this,
do that,

2491
01:47:16,021 --> 01:47:17,850
do that.
And you get what I'm saying.

2492
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,730
I'm so,
I'm not,

2493
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:23,400
I don't,
I'm not necessarily meditating these

2494
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,180
days,
but I do have the capability of taking

2495
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:32,160
away who I actually am at this point and
realizing that this is just a part of me

2496
01:47:32,161 --> 01:47:33,960
or this is just a situation in my life.

2497
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,150
This is my actual life.
This isn't my,

2498
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:40,650
this isn't my final destination,
this is just a small moment in time that

2499
01:47:40,651 --> 01:47:42,810
I'm going through right now.
You get what I'm saying?

2500
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:44,070
I get what you're saying.
So,

2501
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:46,300
um,
so that,

2502
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:51,210
that's my form of meditation.
I step away from terrible situations and

2503
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:54,840
look and look at myself as if it's the
future and I'm looking back on what's

2504
01:47:54,841 --> 01:47:56,610
happened to me or what's happening and I
say,

2505
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:58,800
okay,
how can I get myself out of this?

2506
01:47:58,801 --> 01:48:00,960
How can I make this better?
What do I need to do to turn this

2507
01:48:00,961 --> 01:48:01,794
around?
What do I,

2508
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:05,760
you get what I'm saying.
Being completely emerged in the moment

2509
01:48:05,761 --> 01:48:06,571
and thinking that,
oh,

2510
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:07,600
I can't get out.
Like,

2511
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:09,150
you know,
so

2512
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,630
not said earlier.
The UFC two.

2513
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:11,720
Oh,
five was in December.

2514
01:48:11,721 --> 01:48:15,380
No,
November locked up due to a five.

2515
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:16,810
Oh,
two.

2516
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:17,350
Oh,
five,

2517
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:18,183
500,
sorry.

2518
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:22,220
What I'm thinking of in December,
when is your grappling match with Dan

2519
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,000
Henderson?
December 11th.

2520
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,200
The stats.
December 11th.

2521
01:48:24,201 --> 01:48:25,520
Okay.
That's what I'm fucked up on.

2522
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:29,000
Um,
what is this is this is this Ebi rules?

2523
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:30,870
So this is submissions,
chills,

2524
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:33,380
Sonnen's.
I think that the president of it or

2525
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:34,214
something like that.
Yeah.

2526
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:36,560
Then we have the,
you have the information for all that.

2527
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:38,570
Let's put it up to tell people how they
could see that.

2528
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:39,980
What,
what made you decide to do this?

2529
01:48:39,981 --> 01:48:41,690
Just to mix it up while you're off.

2530
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,100
Yeah,
I uh,

2531
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:44,690
uh,
they reached out to me.

2532
01:48:44,691 --> 01:48:47,390
I did like a small,
a grappling event.

2533
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:49,850
Like I was at an autograph signing.
I saw that.

2534
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,200
Yeah,
some guy was like,

2535
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,580
hey,
you ever roll?

2536
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:54,080
And like competitively.
And I was like,

2537
01:48:54,081 --> 01:48:57,110
no,
actually I haven't since 2009 or

2538
01:48:57,111 --> 01:48:59,060
something.
Like I did one Jujitsu match my whole

2539
01:48:59,061 --> 01:49:01,880
career and I want it but for some issues
against these,

2540
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:03,740
these guys or whatever.
He's like,

2541
01:49:03,741 --> 01:49:05,090
man,
you should come over and roll with me.

2542
01:49:05,091 --> 01:49:06,170
And I'm like,
what build are you?

2543
01:49:06,171 --> 01:49:07,640
And he's like,
I think he,

2544
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,830
the guy who challenged me was like a
purple belt or something.

2545
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,110
And I'm like,
uh,

2546
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:13,970
you know,
I really don't do that type of stuff.

2547
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:14,980
I,
you know,

2548
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,060
I would have to go home,
I don't have any clothes or anything.

2549
01:49:17,061 --> 01:49:17,541
And he's like,
oh,

2550
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,780
we were selling gs over here in rash
guards.

2551
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:21,440
And I'm like,
I was like,

2552
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:23,020
I don't think I'm going to real man.
Like I,

2553
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,250
you know.
And so he's like a,

2554
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,760
well at least come over and say hi.
There's a lot of kids over there.

2555
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:30,260
A lot of people who would just love to
see you come.

2556
01:49:30,261 --> 01:49:32,270
So some support to the Jujitsu
community.

2557
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:33,523
I'm like,
all right,

2558
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:35,690
I could do that.
And so when I went over there after my

2559
01:49:35,691 --> 01:49:39,020
autograph signing,
there was a bunch of people standing

2560
01:49:39,021 --> 01:49:43,070
around and I was greeting everybody and
the guy was like,

2561
01:49:43,071 --> 01:49:44,210
hey,
like are you going to roll with me or

2562
01:49:44,211 --> 01:49:45,560
what?
And I was just like,

2563
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:47,530
in a lot of people heard them and I was
just like,

2564
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:53,140
I feel like when someone's trying to a,
I feel like someone wins when they call

2565
01:49:53,141 --> 01:49:55,230
you out and you don't oblige them.
Right.

2566
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:56,860
You know what I mean?

2567
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:59,770
So I was just like.
And this guy's head is,

2568
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,550
it's a small victory knowing that I
backed down and it's,

2569
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:05,170
we're not punching,
it's,

2570
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:06,310
it's Jujitsu,
right?

2571
01:50:06,311 --> 01:50:08,410
So no one's going to get hurt.
It's just like,

2572
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:11,170
you know what,
let me live a little and just do this,

2573
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:12,570
you know,
I'm sure the kids are gonna,

2574
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,360
love it and people are going to.
So I,

2575
01:50:14,361 --> 01:50:15,280
uh,
I was like,

2576
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:16,540
all right,
give me a rash guard.

2577
01:50:16,541 --> 01:50:18,070
So they gave me a rash guard and I
literally,

2578
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,950
I didn't even warm up.
I just got to do one of these.

2579
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:25,030
And then I ended up tapping these two
guys out fairly quick.

2580
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:28,120
And um,
I think some of these people are from

2581
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:30,580
submission underground.
They saw those videos and they're,

2582
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:34,810
they're starting this new promotion,
um,

2583
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,650
where they're actually paying fighters
pretty with that.

2584
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:38,170
Like they're taking care of the
athletes.

2585
01:50:38,171 --> 01:50:39,004
You know,
really?

2586
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,980
Yeah.

2587
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:42,260
Do People Watch it on paper view?
Is that what it is?

2588
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:45,650
So I think you can watch it online.
You could stream it online for a price.

2589
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:46,880
Okay.
And um,

2590
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,750
so here it is a,
okay,

2591
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:52,070
it's flow grappling.com.
F L O grappling.com,

2592
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:54,710
Sunday,
December 11th at 2:30.

2593
01:50:55,790 --> 01:50:59,690
And I think this is Ebi rules.
If this is the shale sunnen thing,

2594
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:02,300
so to see if that,
if you could see that in there,

2595
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:04,280
Jamie,
scroll up and see what the rules are.

2596
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,550
I,
I still don't even know what the rules

2597
01:51:06,551 --> 01:51:08,320
are.
I think it's the mission only.

2598
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:09,650
Yeah,
submission only,

2599
01:51:09,651 --> 01:51:14,180
but I think Ebi rules is a Ebi rules is
a very interesting to get me.

2600
01:51:14,181 --> 01:51:16,730
But Ebi is Eddie Bravo,
invitational rules.

2601
01:51:16,731 --> 01:51:21,590
What he did is he figured out a way to
avoid draws and what he does is he has

2602
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:25,330
guys,
they fight for a or they grapple for a

2603
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,160
determined time period.
Then at the end of the time period

2604
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:29,001
minutes I heard,
yeah,

2605
01:51:29,001 --> 01:51:33,050
they exchange a bad positions.
Like one guy will start off.

2606
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:36,270
Well you start off what's called spider.
So spiderweb aside,

2607
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:38,720
control with,
not the arm bar locked up,

2608
01:51:38,721 --> 01:51:42,040
but the arm hooked,
you know the arm hooked so your you have

2609
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:45,440
your legs across the arms,
trapped and ready go.

2610
01:51:45,441 --> 01:51:47,090
So the guy on the bottom is trying to
escape.

2611
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:51,800
You're trying to hold him down or you
can start off with the over under from

2612
01:51:51,801 --> 01:51:54,260
back control so you don't have a choke
locked in,

2613
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:55,460
but you have over under.

2614
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:58,370
You have both hooks in and you're on the
back and they say ready,

2615
01:51:58,371 --> 01:52:00,590
go.
So it's how fast the person could escape

2616
01:52:00,591 --> 01:52:04,950
versus how fast you could submit them.
At the end of the exchange back of what?

2617
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:08,860
Say if you submit your guy and then he
has an opportunity to try to submit you.

2618
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:11,100
If you submit him faster than he
submitted you,

2619
01:52:11,101 --> 01:52:13,940
you went.
If you submit him and he doesn't submit

2620
01:52:13,941 --> 01:52:15,400
you,
you went with your escape.

2621
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:18,980
Both escape and he'd do it again.
And then if you both escape again,

2622
01:52:18,981 --> 01:52:22,550
you do it one more time and then they
calculate all the time it took for each

2623
01:52:22,551 --> 01:52:24,440
one to escape.
And the person who has the least amount

2624
01:52:24,441 --> 01:52:27,050
of time and escape the quickest winds up
winning.

2625
01:52:27,051 --> 01:52:29,530
I'm winning this shit.

2626
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:35,480
Dan Henderson quite a bit smaller than
you two.

2627
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:36,950
Yeah,
I would imagine.

2628
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,610
Yeah.
I wonder how much you weigh right now.

2629
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,330
[inaudible] 85.
And I don't think he's cutting a whole

2630
01:52:41,331 --> 01:52:42,680
lot of weight.
It's not a big guy,

2631
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,140
you know.
And um,

2632
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,090
it's interesting like him fighting
Michael Bisping,

2633
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:49,100
I think that's probably going to be his
last fight.

2634
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:50,930
A lot of people thought he should have
won that fight.

2635
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:54,140
Super close fight.
He retired and he argued in.

2636
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:55,011
Yeah,
I think he did.

2637
01:52:55,011 --> 01:52:56,180
I think he decided that's it.

2638
01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:58,040
Yeah.
So I'm sure this means a lot to them to

2639
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:00,280
be able to be able to beat me even in a
grappling match.

2640
01:53:00,281 --> 01:53:02,110
That's quite the way to end your career.
Yeah.

2641
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:04,930
So I don't know how hard he's training,
but I've,

2642
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:06,880
I'm putting a little effort into it for
sure.

2643
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,200
Yeah.
Will you tell me before you just getting

2644
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:10,370
really in love with Gigi?

2645
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:12,060
I do.
I do love Jujitsu.

2646
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:12,740
Yeah.
My,

2647
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,760
my,
my professor has a,

2648
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,770
he's a great coach,
man.

2649
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:22,810
They call them to say,
I think it's Portuguese for like buck

2650
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:24,960
tooth or something like that,
but his real name,

2651
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:27,790
Roberto all car.
He's several times world champion

2652
01:53:27,791 --> 01:53:29,910
Jujitsu.
I think it'd be funny magazines quite a

2653
01:53:29,911 --> 01:53:32,910
few times and he's won all these.
That's huge.

2654
01:53:32,911 --> 01:53:35,940
All these world champion,
I think he's a five time world champion.

2655
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:36,993
Wow.
Um,

2656
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,840
and he,
he literally is right there with me

2657
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:43,410
every practice and you know,
he knows that have,

2658
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,480
I've never done training,
but he,

2659
01:53:45,481 --> 01:53:47,700
um,
he uh,

2660
01:53:47,730 --> 01:53:49,710
he doesn't settle like I'm technically a
white belt,

2661
01:53:49,711 --> 01:53:50,550
but he's,
he,

2662
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:51,720
every position,
he's like,

2663
01:53:51,721 --> 01:53:52,620
you know,
you got to do this right?

2664
01:53:52,621 --> 01:53:53,880
