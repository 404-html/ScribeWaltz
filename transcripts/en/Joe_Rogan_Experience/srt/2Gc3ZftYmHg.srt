1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,310
The yes

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,330
and we're like,
what's up man?

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,500
How are you?
Fantastic.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,700
Thanks for doing this.
Appreciate it.

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,660
Appreciate you.
Let me come up.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,590
So,
uh,

7
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:15,540
why don't you tell people what you do?
Uh,

8
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:20,541
I am a muscle physiologist,
so I'm a phd in human bioenergetics and 

9
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm the director for the Center for 
sport performance,

10
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:24,690
which all that basically means I studied
muscle physiology,

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,560
why it grows,
shrinks,

12
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,090
repairs,
dyes and all that crap.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,540
Now when you're dealing with athletes 
and you're dealing with like state of 

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,251
the art performance,
how much does that stuff change like 

15
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:37,251
year to year,
like protocols,

16
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,360
like what people used to think was the 
way to go,

17
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,190
what's the new way to go?
Well,

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,700
if you take a look or if you examine 
just the idea of science in general,

19
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,880
it's the understanding that we're wrong.
That totally what science is.

20
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,560
If,
if we knew what the answer was,

21
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,730
we wouldn't look into it.

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,040
Like what's the point of doing a study 
if we know the answer,

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,220
right?
So by definition we're always evolving 

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,651
in that sense,
but it's quite funny how the central 

25
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:01,260
tenants are really not that different.
You take nutrition,

26
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:06,261
you take training,
the vast majority of those things are 

27
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:06,261
similar to what they were 20,
30,

28
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,290
8,100
years ago,

29
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,970
so the bulk of it,
what matters for the bulk of athletes is

30
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,971
fairly standard.
What where it differs is the last few 

31
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:20,151
percentage points.
It's getting us that last 10 percent 

32
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:23,151
gains or being very specific so you on a
personal level need this little bit of 

33
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,570
difference when you need this tiny bit 
of difference,

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,120
but the bulk of it really is not that 
different,

35
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,840
but when you watch an mma fighters in 
particular,

36
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:35,841
you see so many different methods,
mean so many different ways to approach 

37
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,650
things and I never know who's right,
you know,

38
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,860
is it really depends upon who's 
successful and they'd go,

39
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,930
well that guy obviously has it down.

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Yeah,
that's a major fallacy called the 

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:47,960
fallacy of authority,
so or appeal to authority,

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,011
which is somebody really good.
Did it or somebody who coaches somebody 

43
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,130
really good,
they did it or a lot of people did it.

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,340
All.
Three of those are examples of major 

45
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,340
logical fallacies,
right?

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,150
To break down on Aristotle's reasoning 
and it's not what we do now,

47
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,770
they can help us with some ideas of 
where to go,

48
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:05,700
but that's a really bad approach.
So we have to understand like what works

49
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:10,701
for somebody at a very high levels,
not necessarily going to work for the 

50
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,960
bulk of people and particular if like 
the great example is is Schwartzenegger.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,260
So when he came out and with his book of
the Encyclopedia of bodybuilding,

52
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,820
everyone was like,
fantastic,

53
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:22,821
I'll go do those workouts.
You're not arnold and you should be 

54
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,720
doing what arnold did when he was at 
your stage.

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,100
Not at his stage will also is doing a 
bucket of steroids.

56
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,110
Well that too,
right?

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,120
That's a big factor.
Like if especially back in those days,

58
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,450
they didn't come clean about that stuff.
No.

59
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,480
So guys are like,
Hey,

60
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,550
I call my biceps are ripping off the 
bone.

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,810
Right?
Or how come it's not working for them.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Yeah.
So all that is really important to 

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,300
understand what the context of recovery 
than nutrition has.

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,760
All the other stresses that are 
eliminated from his life.

65
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,220
All of that changes what's going to work
or not work for you.

66
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,300
Now there's a bunch of different ways of
approaching things like I've always been

67
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,310
fascinated by the marv method

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,310
and now nick curse on takes that method 
as well and their idea is that strength 

69
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,141
and conditioning is,
especially when a fighters in camp is 

70
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:13,351
more important than anything more 
important even than skill work because 

71
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,980
you already know how to fight.
Just so strength and conditioning should

72
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:19,981
take precedent.
Get all that done to get your body to 

73
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:20,500
the point where you have the most 
horsepower,

74
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,870
the biggest gas tank,
the best tires,

75
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,871
you know,
the best handling and then you already 

76
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:28,480
know how to fight.
So just approach it that way.

77
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,220
Yeah.
So the guy that actually trained Marv.

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,140
Michael.
Yes.

79
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,690
This is the Fullerton guy.
It cal state fullerton.

80
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,110
So he was the cyclist.
Yes.

81
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,210
This,
that's his name,

82
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,950
y e s,
s Russian name.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,090
Uh,
he's awesome.

84
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:45,091
He's like 85 now or something and if you
want to get massively entertained by 

85
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,261
somebody,
like he's a good one because he's just 

86
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:49,261
very opinionated.

87
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:49,320
But nonetheless,
uh,

88
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,420
yeah,
that,

89
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,160
that is,
I think,

90
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,910
an important one.
If you look at Joel Jameson,

91
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,060
a friend of mine who trains Demetrius 
Johnson,

92
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,450
like all those guys,
they have very different approaches and 

93
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:00,450
I don't,
I think the massive fallacies,

94
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,150
it's actually goes back to your original
question,

95
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,190
is thinking that there is one single 
answer.

96
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,520
That's the problem,
right?

97
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,480
Whether we're talking training,
nutrition,

98
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,830
recovery,
ice,

99
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,240
will,
any of these modalities,

100
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,730
the major reason we have so much 
internet fighting between experts and 

101
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,290
why it makes it so difficult for so many
people to figure out like,

102
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,300
well,
what's the right answer is because 

103
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,300
searching for the right answers,
the problem to begin with,

104
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,720
we're having the wrong conversation with
all of this crap.

105
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,410
It's not the right place to go.
So those are two very different 

106
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,410
approaches.
For Demetrius,

107
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,080
they reduce a lot of the strength 
conditioning they do during camp because

108
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,940
they want to get very good with the 
train,

109
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,510
with the fighting.

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,720
So all that stuff is gone.
So Joel believes in training as much as 

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,620
we can prior to camp.
And then in camp,

112
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:46,621
it's time to get better at fighting.
Someone like nick is apparently has the 

113
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,510
opposite approach.
Yeah.

114
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,820
I don't think that either one of them is
more or less effective than the other.

115
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,170
It really comes down to the combination 
of coaches as well as the athlete.

116
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,330
Some athletes,
and,

117
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,980
and you could attest to this,
and I've seen this a bunch of times,

118
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,800
if they're two days out,
three days out a week out,

119
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,280
some of them get really anxious if they 
don't get to practice a skill.

120
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,920
Like I want to be really sharp with my 
combinations.

121
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,360
I want to be really good with my 
transitions,

122
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,190
et cetera.
And if you take that away from them,

123
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:13,990
they get very anxious and they don't 
like it.

124
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,890
And so you almost have to do is program 
at based on this combination of 

125
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,440
physiology and psychology.
And that's a bit outside of my realm,

126
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:26,860
but this is what makes coaching so 
complicated is saying,

127
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:27,970
okay,
well you know what?

128
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:32,971
For you athlete one,
you're going to do the opposite 

129
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:32,971
approach.
Athlete too,

130
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:36,980
you're going to be doing the other 
approach because you just don't feel as 

131
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:36,980
good.
You're not as confident,

132
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,130
you're not filling the smooth and and 
more than anything when they walked down

133
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,950
to that cage or particularly two or 
three days before,

134
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,510
they have to feel amazing.
Yeah.

135
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,610
You have to have that combination.
Yeah.

136
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,450
It is weird that like there is no 
answer.

137
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,490
No,
there was one like a Mark Hunt is going 

138
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,350
to have a completely different set of 
requirements than you know,

139
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,730
a Derek Lewis or a mighty mouse.
Johnson or anybody.

140
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,040
It's like everybody's got different 
needs and,

141
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,340
and everybody's coming to the table with
a different set of skills and a 

142
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,340
different set of problems.

143
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,780
Especially when you look at experience 
too.

144
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,870
So what worked for you in your second 
fight when you were 20 is maybe not the 

145
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:13,870
same approach you have to take when 
you're 30.

146
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,130
I just,
I just got back from New York.

147
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,800
I was in there the last three days and I
was with one of my guys,

148
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:23,801
Dennis Bermudez and we had this 
conversation and when I first started 

149
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:26,360
working with him,
we had to take a very different approach

150
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,040
the week of,
and especially even,

151
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,240
you know,
the hour before the fight because the 

152
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,991
way that he got ramped up for a fight is
very different than some other people 

153
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:36,410
that I've worked with.
What we had to realize.

154
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,420
And I remember he called me right after,
um,

155
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,470
one of his recent fights,
uh,

156
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,810
maybe four or five fights go and he's 
like,

157
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,811
I'm freaking out because I didn't freak 
out in the cages time when really I was 

158
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:46,811
like,
what?

159
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:46,811
And he's like,
you know,

160
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:51,401
I'm usually really freaked out in the 
cage and this is what drives my 

161
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,221
performance.
But this time I was really calm and 

162
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:54,221
collected.
I saw everything and I'm,

163
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,900
I'm nervous that I'm not nervous enough.
So I had to get him in with,

164
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:01,901
with my good friend Lenny.
Where's the Moses sports psychologist 

165
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:01,901
who works a lot of combat sport athletes
and say,

166
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:02,900
okay,
we need to get you in a place of optimal

167
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,210
arousal because if you're under aroused,
it's a problem,

168
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,980
but if you're over aroused,
that's a problem as well.

169
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,370
So we had to change the tactics a little
bit between everything from his walk 

170
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,491
down to the week of before the queuing,
the things that we say to him to make 

171
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:18,080
sure he's in an optimal state.
Every other athletic worked.

172
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,000
Like all those approaches are completely
different.

173
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,080
We can't have the same thing.

174
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,480
How do you train a guide to do is walk 
down all this.

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,800
There's a lot we can do really?
Oh yeah.

176
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,790
And I'm not sports psychologist so I 
don't go too much.

177
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
You know what they do?
Absolutely everything from breathing 

178
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,740
drills right to the queuing,
the words you use.

179
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,840
So for example,
in the back,

180
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,260
if you're a Dennis Bermudez five years 
ago,

181
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,200
you know Ryan Parsons would have to say 
like real vile,

182
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,210
horrible shit.
Like rip his fucking head off.

183
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,250
I want you to bring it back into place.
Like murder him,

184
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,130
rip him to shreds.
That works for some guys,

185
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,470
for dentists at that point,
at that point.

186
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,530
Not Anymore.
Right now it's a little bit different 

187
00:07:59,530 --> 00:07:59,530
approach and Ryan and can tell you the 
details of what he does now,

188
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,151
but some guys that can you tell some 
other people that backstage they're 

189
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:04,151
gonna be like,
what?

190
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,760
Like don't don't say that.
Just like telling me what to focus on.

191
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:11,761
Remind me my keys in my timing.
And so the guys that are two ramped up 

192
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:11,990
there,
very specific breathing drills,

193
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,991
for example,
we can have them do as they're walking 

194
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,300
down the cage as they're in the cage a,
especially if they're the first one down

195
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:20,610
or the second one down.
So if their first down,

196
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:25,611
sometimes that's a 10 minute delay 
between when they're standing in the 

197
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:25,611
cage and when they actually start 
throwing.

198
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:30,320
Right?
If you're not taking advantage of that 

199
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,320
time or if that time is getting taken 
advantage of you,

200
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,530
that can have a real problem with your 
energy and especially if you get a guy 

201
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,071
who is really savvy,
like a connor or John Jones who takes 

202
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,360
their time coming down and they mess 
with you,

203
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,070
they do different things on the way 
down.

204
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,650
That really influences what's going on 
with the guy in the cage,

205
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,490
especially if they're less experienced 
or maybe attend to the underdog or other

206
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,880
things like that.
So that can all be we be messed with.

207
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,380
Now a guy like Dennis Bermudez is a good
example,

208
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,740
right?
You,

209
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,080
you're

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,710
working with him.
He's obviously a world class fighter,

211
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,060
but he always seems to fall just short 
on these big fights.

212
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,770
Yeah,
there is.

213
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You know,
this is where it's outside of my 

214
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:09,800
expertise.
I'm a muscle physiologist,

215
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:09,800
not a psychologist.
Right.

216
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,100
But with his last performance against 
Aaron Elca,

217
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,300
who is a really tough guy.
Very awkward.

218
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:20,301
Really just blood and guts type fighter,
but that was a good matchup for very 

219
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:20,700
good fight.
Good matchup.

220
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,620
Skill-Wise,
it should on paper.

221
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,290
Just so many good matchup,
favorite dentist and a lot of ways where

222
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:30,291
there's no way to beat around that.
I feel like two things are happening in 

223
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:30,291
that fight.
One,

224
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,310
I feel like Darren Elkins is getting 
better for sure.

225
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:37,311
And he was super motivated and energized
by his performance over Merseyside 

226
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,900
backtick,
which is an amazing comeback.

227
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,640
That's incredible.
Crazy.

228
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,900
Yeah.
So,

229
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,200
but a lot of people felt like he was the
favorite.

230
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
That Dennis was the favorite going into 
that fight.

231
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,080
Yeah.
On paper.

232
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,600
Clearly he was,
um,

233
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,000
from a lot of vantage points,
but it's really difficult.

234
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,270
Um,
you know,

235
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,260
without telling too much,
uh,

236
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,290
Dennis story for him it was quite funny 
what happens with the game plan 

237
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,310
sometimes and what happens when they get
in there,

238
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,311
even with the seasoned guy like Denis 
and I don't know if a part of that was 

239
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,250
because it was in New York and Dennis 
his hometown,

240
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,310
or if that was because of pat who was 
good friend,

241
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,790
fought right before and want to really 
crazy fight and the fight before,

242
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,250
if you saw that you just don't know what
goes in.

243
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,120
And then,
you know,

244
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,210
sometimes like in the middle of a fight,
you're like the fights over and like,

245
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't even know why we did that.
Just we got into this weird rhythm thing

246
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:29,001
and we started doing this and that was,
I don't know what happened and that the 

247
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:29,280
rhythm can kind of take over the fight.

248
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,210
And Darren fought an amazing fight.
He did exactly what he needed to do.

249
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,590
Um,
but it was just the,

250
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,540
from my perspective as a scientist,
I one,

251
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,400
I try to stay away from those things.
It's not my job,

252
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,140
but it's,
it's fun.

253
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,460
And this is what makes it exciting for 
me.

254
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:49,461
It's why I work with these folks is 
because you can have the perfect camp 

255
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:52,740
physically and sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

256
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,300
And so then you go back to the drawing 
board and you go,

257
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,590
well,
do we throw everything out?

258
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,920
Do we try something different?
Was it though?

259
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,610
Is it psychological?
Is it physical?

260
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,900
That's the thing to think about 
physically.

261
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:03,630
Fantastic.
What was the physical game plan like you

262
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:08,631
planned on?
You must have planned on knowing how 

263
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:11,001
Darren fights a super high paced in your
face type of fight that that part's not 

264
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:11,490
a problem for dentists.

265
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,040
He doesn't really get tired and the vast
majority is fights,

266
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,450
but it looked a little bit like he was 
getting tired and this fight again,

267
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:23,451
he can say that,
but from the feedback and from what we 

268
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:23,451
saw,
like he was like,

269
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,170
no,
he just maybe had a hard time focusing.

270
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:27,180
Honestly,
I didn't ask them very specifically,

271
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,530
uh,
what was going on there.

272
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:33,531
I kind of give them a few weeks to kind 
of get through that stuff before we 

273
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:33,531
start going back.
Right.

274
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:33,810
What's watched the tape?
Let's go through it.

275
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,070
Went through.
So I want to be careful not offending 

276
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,070
him or,
or his direct current,

277
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,730
just like that.
Um,

278
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,780
but yeah,
I mean from my vantage it was like this 

279
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,930
was not,
this is not what we were looking for.

280
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,930
He should have just been more active,
particularly in the second round,

281
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,390
which is what really got them in the 
east on the third round.

282
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,070
Once you kind of got into it dot Dennis 
in our eyes,

283
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,070
lease was pretty dominated that round,
or at least clearly ahead were one and 

284
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,890
two were not so good for him.
Um,

285
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,730
but yeah,
I just potentially a focus potentially a

286
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,690
lot of things.
Uh,

287
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,200
he wasn't nothing.
He physically that happened to him in 

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,200
the fight that he was.
He like,

289
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,600
oh,
I didn't prepare for this.

290
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:12,670
We didn't think was gonna happen.
This is throwing me off.

291
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,320
He was just like,
I just,

292
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,380
I just didn't go in the second round.
So it's a weird job you have because 

293
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,910
you're kind of relying on someone else 
to pull the trigger.

294
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,960
You're relying on someone else to make 
the moves and you could train them all 

295
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,640
you want.
You can get them in incredible shape,

296
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,110
but then,
you know,

297
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,910
ready go.
They're on autopilot.

298
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,130
They're doing their own thing.
Especially me,

299
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:36,220
because I'm not the guy who's in 
practice all day everyday with them.

300
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,610
Like I'm not the Nickerson,
I'm not seeing them 12 hours a week.

301
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm out there.
I'm just like,

302
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,660
like Dennis,
I won't even see all camps sometimes 

303
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,931
because he's in New York and I'm in and 
a in La and so it's like,

304
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,890
so what do you,
do you give them a protocol,

305
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:53,050
do you give them a schedule?
So my role,

306
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,420
depending on which fighter I'm with,
is completely different.

307
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,300
So sometimes it's one phone call,
the beginning of camp.

308
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,920
Sometimes it's just like,
hey,

309
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,390
this came up when you think we should 
do.

310
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,420
How do we go about this?
Sometimes it's a text three times a day 

311
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,760
everyday for the whole camp.
Sometimes it's phone calls.

312
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,410
I get,
I try to do like,

313
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:13,411
this is not my full time job.
My full time job is to research muscle 

314
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:16,771
physiology.
I work with MMA fighters and combat 

315
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,300
sport athletes is because I love it 
rarely.

316
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,860
So it's almost like a side job.
A side hobby,

317
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,640
yeah.
Yeah.

318
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,400
If you want to think of it that way 
because you know,

319
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,710
I have my full time living.
I've got multiple labs to run.

320
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,810
Like this is what I do is publish 
research,

321
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,920
right?
I take biopsies of people like hundreds,

322
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,920
tens of thousands of muscle fibers at 
this point in my life and when I can 

323
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:37,920
help,
if I think I can,

324
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,430
I will,
but I try not to.

325
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:42,700
I don't work with general public.
I our lab is different.

326
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:47,701
I'll put it this way.
Most labs that do the type of muscle 

327
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,910
research we do are focused on disease 
prevention or treatment.

328
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,350
Right?
So how do we fight cancer?

329
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:53,170
How do we get people back?
I'm one of the few that actually do this

330
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,670
on the other end of the spectrum,
which is,

331
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,730
well,
let's study optimization like how do we 

332
00:13:59,730 --> 00:13:59,730
thrive?

333
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,640
How do we not just get to 80 years old,
but how do we kick ass at 80 years old 

334
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,320
and becoming from a performance 
background that I have a,

335
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,330
my athletic background.
It just makes so much sense.

336
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,220
I didn't come from martial arts 
background at all,

337
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:12,850
like I didn't do anything until much 
later in life,

338
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,730
but I.
Once I started paying attention to mma,

339
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,250
I was like,
there's something energetically,

340
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,240
physiologically far different about the 
demands of this sport and it's really 

341
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,090
exciting and it's a really complex 
problem to solve.

342
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,500
So I just started helping out,
chipping in and then once you get help a

343
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,270
couple of people and they're like,
this is fantastic,

344
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,590
et cetera.
Kind of the ball gets rolling.

345
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,070
So right now basically what I do is 
think of it like concierge service if 

346
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,200
you will.
Like I don't,

347
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,900
I'm not like,
you can't email me for training program.

348
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,470
Like I don't have an online website.
You can buy stuff from right here.

349
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,490
Like if somebody's like,
hey,

350
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,170
I know a friend who could really need 
this or something.

351
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,930
Maybe.
So do you coach people for Diet as well?

352
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,720
Do you do go through everything with 
them?

353
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,410
Depending on what they need.
And how do you.

354
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:59,411
Like,
how do you decide like what a person 

355
00:14:59,411 --> 00:14:59,411
needs?
Like I say,

356
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:02,680
if you know,
Darren Elkins came to you that he might 

357
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:02,680
be very different than Jon Jones.
Like how do you,

358
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,690
how do you decide what a person needs?
So it's depends on if they're local or 

359
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,210
not.
A blood work is the easy one,

360
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,060
but the vast majority of what I do is a 
lot of conversation.

361
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,690
So I spend a lot of time on phone calls 
and skype with them saying basically 

362
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,360
walk me through what have you done,
where are you at,

363
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:18,410
how do you think I can help?

364
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,510
The number one thing I do then is say,
okay,

365
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,640
do you have who else on your team does 
this?

366
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:24,920
Who's helping you?
Let's get on a call with them.

367
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:28,230
Not so that I can tell them what to do,
but just let me know what your world was

368
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:30,980
like and then I'll see if I can add some
advice and maybe we'll try this.

369
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I can help you track things.
I can tell you with my experience about 

370
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,730
I've seen this happen before or I know 
someone that's happened before.

371
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:43,731
Um,
this is what happened with the best 

372
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:45,581
example was,
do you remember last summer at the Rio 

373
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:47,300
Olympics when that Helen Miraculous won 
the gold medal,

374
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,210
the first American ever female to win 
gold and wrestling?

375
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,040
No,
I wasn't paying attention.

376
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Oh Joe,
go read the article in sports 

377
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,350
illustrated that she wrote afterwards.
She beat,

378
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,420
um,
you know,

379
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,660
I think you Shita was her name,
but she was a three time defending gold 

380
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,790
medalist and a 15 times straight world 
title.

381
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,220
It was just like rulon gardner when he 
beat a Carolyn,

382
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,730
but the female version.
So Helen went down there.

383
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,600
It was crazy.
He was down two to one with like 30 

384
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,000
seconds to go in the semi finals,
came back and won.

385
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,800
She was down a point to you.
Is She in the finals?

386
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,801
Ends up,
ends up upsetting her first American to 

387
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:23,801
ever win gold.
Well,

388
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:28,061
I worked with Helen for about a year on 
straight nutrition because she had to 

389
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:31,931
cut a whole bunch of extra weight for 
the first time and the whole wrestling 

390
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:32,810
community was like,
you'll never get down to 53 kilos,

391
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,460
like don't do it.
You have to go up.

392
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Because what happened was resting.
This is really weird thing where world 

393
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,970
championships is a different weight 
classes.

394
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:45,971
Then the Olympics,
so she was a world champion at 55 kilos 

395
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,740
and either had to go up to 58 kilos for 
the Olympics,

396
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,830
which had a three time defending gold 
medalist and a 15 times straight world 

397
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,860
champion or go down to f 2:53
kilos to,

398
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,950
to wrestle somebody who also had that 15
times cert world title.

399
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,660
So pounds wise,
that's like a five or six pounds.

400
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:03,350
Six pounds.
Yeah,

401
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,730
roughly.
It's not a big deal,

402
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,740
but when you're already like scraping to
get there.

403
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,770
And so she had to make the decision to 
go up or go down.

404
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,500
And what happened was she had an 
nutritionist,

405
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,350
Eric rebel,
who you may know Eric,

406
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,520
he works at Barnett.
He's been around Josh,

407
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,521
big huge dude wrestler,
but eric was her nutritionist and Eric 

408
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:25,690
reached out to me because he's right 
down where we're at and where Helen was 

409
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,330
down here and he was basically like,
I know what I'm doing obviously,

410
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,930
but like let's get as big a team as 
possible that make the right decisions 

411
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,380
as possible.
So that's how I like to work.

412
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,210
Uh,
so when a new person reaches out to me,

413
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:35,720
I go like,
well,

414
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,310
who else do you have on board?
Don't fire them.

415
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,850
I don't want anybody to get fired.
Let's all put our heads together because

416
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,600
with MMA specifically,
they're not making any income.

417
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,400
Uh,
Olympic wrestlers of the same thing.

418
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,920
She makes like 15 grand a year or 
something like he's.

419
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,100
So,
it's what

420
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,680
you have to understand when you're 
coaching them.

421
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Like it's not team Dr Andy,
like it's team Helen and all of us have 

422
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,691
to be focused on her and it doesn't 
matter if anyone knows what I do with 

423
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:03,570
her or not or anybody.
I don't care if you get the credit,

424
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:08,571
another nutritionist gets the credit.
If you want to actually help these 

425
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:11,601
professional athletes,
you have to let your ego go completely 

426
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:11,790
out the door and say,
why throw people out?

427
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:16,791
Let's take every information I have 
about everything you've ever done and 

428
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,481
come together with solutions.
And if somebody else has an idea that 

429
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:23,391
you don't like,
that's up to you to figure it out and 

430
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:23,391
give it to the athlete.
Okay.

431
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:23,391
So what'd you find out with her?
Like what was the,

432
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:25,710
what was the issue and how'd you get her
to lose the extra?

433
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,690
So actually it was like a year of 
issues.

434
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,040
It was,
yeah,

435
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,600
I mean,
yeah,

436
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:30,990
like every day,
every week,

437
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:33,300
every month something else came up.
So it was like,

438
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,200
we tackle this problem and then we had 
another problem.

439
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,270
Iron was a huge one for her iron 
deficiency and we had,

440
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,910
she was basically almost flat lined on 
her iron,

441
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,550
looked anemic and we had to come in and 
go,

442
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,050
okay,
well we're going to add this.

443
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,810
But she was also traveling to Mongolia.
She was going internationally.

444
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,700
So she kept getting sick.
Mongolia,

445
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,780
yeah,
for tournaments,

446
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,300
because you had to qualify the spot.
Dan and she's cutting.

447
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,450
She's had imagined wrestling.
A Mongolian shake is terrifying.

448
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,850
They all moving here at world champions.
Not that terrifying.

449
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,490
They're hardcore though.
This kid shit out of me.

450
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,880
So she had to put her on.
Um,

451
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,030
we had to basically play a game of 
saying if we give you the things that 

452
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,881
keep you from not being sick,
that's also the stuff that actually 

453
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,060
harms iron absorption cheap.

454
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,060
You.
The things like vitamin C for examined 

455
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,060
seed to keep you from getting sick,
right?

456
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,580
So that can help you as you're talking 
about while she's dehydrating,

457
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,620
so you're saying anytime,
so if you're going to go travel 

458
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,571
internationally for a long time,
you can take a big bolus of vitamin C 

459
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:30,270
and it may help you from getting sick 
from getting cold.

460
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Does that really affected better than 
probiotics?

461
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,420
To heal probiotics that.
We're on that too,

462
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,980
but the point was if you're going to go 
on like a two week thing to eastern 

463
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,401
Europe,
I'm going to give you every advantage 

464
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:43,401
possible that not probably get a cold 
right,

465
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:44,280
but when wouldn't you do that on a 
regular basis?

466
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:49,281
Like why would you accentuate the Diet,
a traveling trip and give it some stuff 

467
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:54,141
that.
I mean wouldn't you want that boost 

468
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:55,971
everywhere?
So the probiotics are basically a no 

469
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:58,881
brainer all the time,
but I mean you don't see and everything 

470
00:19:58,881 --> 00:19:58,881
else.

471
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,490
Yeah,
but you have to be careful because 

472
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:01,490
anytime you go with a vitamin 
specifically,

473
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,690
you're going to have potential toxicity 
and vitamin C,

474
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,860
absolutely.
Really?

475
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,670
What,
what?

476
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,980
What's the toxicity rate of vitamin C 
like?

477
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,920
It's not gonna actually.
Well,

478
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,960
put it this way at generally,
anytime you're getting a vitamin from a 

479
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,741
food source,
you're probably nowhere near toxicity 

480
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:18,741
level,
so natural consumption of food.

481
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,640
You're not going to be in a problem,
but you start taking three,

482
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,100
five,
six grams of vitamin C at a time,

483
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,670
you're potentially going to have 
problems and it's a whole host and what 

484
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,191
makes it really complicated is there's 
interaction with other vitamins and 

485
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:31,260
minerals,
so the iron,

486
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,940
for example,
if you give them with vitamin C,

487
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,870
it's gonna help absorption,
but zinc is going to do the opposite and

488
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:41,871
so if you do these other combinations,
you're going to potentially have 

489
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:42,810
problems or you're potentially safe,
and so we say the campus,

490
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,930
what does that mean?
Do you mean zinc doesn't help vitamin C 

491
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,030
absorption or it doesn't help iron 
absorption?

492
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Iron.
Zinc actually messes up your iron 

493
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:53,580
absorption.
Anytime you have an a,

494
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,280
b,
vitamin or mineral,

495
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,030
you have potential either co absorption 
or you have a confliction,

496
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,270
so you've got to cut things off.
How does zinc conflict with iron?

497
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,970
I don't know the chemistry behind it.
That's weird.

498
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,390
Yeah,
the have a lot of that and you look up 

499
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,390
basically vitamin A,
vitamin D,

500
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,030
vitamin K and magnesium,
vitamin K with bone absorption,

501
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,450
so you have to make sure that it.
Like say if you're eating one at 

502
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:15,450
breakfast,
you don't.

503
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,210
Another one at launches at Howard.
If you get it from food,

504
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,280
you're basically safe.
Like we don't really.

505
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,310
This is stuff we don't worry about it.
Even if you supplement like during your 

506
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:23,310
lunch or during your breakfast.
Yeah,

507
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:27,751
this is what the general answer is.
Don't supplement with vitamins and 

508
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:27,751
minerals unless you have a very specific
reason.

509
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,920
And we did that for the vast majority of
camp,

510
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:34,000
but she was continually getting sick 
because of a variety of reasons.

511
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,750
Some that I probably shouldn't say,
but so we're like,

512
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:38,320
okay,
fine.

513
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,510
We addressed that and then it was like,
okay,

514
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,910
now you're super anemic,
so let's get away from that.

515
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,810
But what we did basically is get iron 
back to a decent level as soon as 

516
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,740
possible and then go off of everything 
and go right back to food.

517
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,480
How are you failing?
And that one,

518
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,120
she was so low on iron as soon as we got
her to decent level,

519
00:21:56,121 --> 00:22:00,250
like within days it was just like tears 
of joy if like I feel so much better.

520
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm not,
I'm not sleeping all the time,

521
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,590
but it was continued with the hard part 
with her was getting her down and then 

522
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,930
you would be shocked.
But the food was like in Rio,

523
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,010
like what?

524
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,270
They told me.
Oh yeah,

525
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,800
at the Olympics.
Oh my God.

526
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,430
Like they told them you'd have a c,
D and then we get down there and she 

527
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,700
called me the first day and she's like,
they have nothing.

528
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,160
We've got McDonald's,
we've got popcorn and cookies.

529
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:23,410
Like there's nothing down here.
Wow.

530
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,930
She's like five Olympic,
horrible.

531
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,410
I mean the basketball players probably 
had something but like he's a wrestler.

532
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:34,411
She didn't have anything.
So they had better food for the more 

533
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:38,551
prominent sports probably probably 
because they probably brought their own 

534
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:38,551
chefs.
Yeah.

535
00:22:38,551 --> 00:22:38,650
Oh,
okay.

536
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Right.
So He's dealing with the team and then 

537
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,511
she had to be shipped out of Rio to some
other city two hours away or an hour 

538
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:45,670
away or something.
And she's like,

539
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:50,671
there's no grocery store here.
I can't even walk to the store to get 

540
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:50,671
any,
anything decent.

541
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,820
So we had real problems.

542
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,200
She was,
I'm about to do a opening ceremonies and

543
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:59,350
we had a plan for food.
Like basically we're going hour by hour,

544
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,420
how do you feel like where are we at 
these types of things.

545
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,180
And she wanted to do opening ceremonies 
and she called me.

546
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:05,440
She's like,
I want to do opening ceremonies.

547
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,860
Like,
fine,

548
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:06,610
cool,
no problem.

549
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,250
This is what I want you to eat.
And whatever it was.

550
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,870
And with the next.
And she's like,

551
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:12,460
I'm right next to Michael Phelps.
I'm in the front,

552
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:17,461
like I don't want to get out of line.
I don't want to go back out and neat 

553
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:17,461
because I don't to lose my spot next to 
Philips in the front.

554
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:17,461
I'm like,
okay,

555
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:22,141
fine.
Well she was supposed to eat whatever 

556
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:22,420
vegetable and food and fat source we 
had.

557
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,890
I don't remember.
But she's like,

558
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,690
all they have is cookies and popcorn.

559
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,870
He's like,
I guess I'll just start.

560
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,640
And we actually,
that was one time we didn't do.

561
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:35,670
We didn't want to do that because she 
was at a problem where she was so 

562
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,590
calorically underserved for so long.
She or her body would crash quite often,

563
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,660
so we had to keep her nutrients really,
really,

564
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:44,440
really high or vitamins and minerals to 
keep her at a low calorie count,

565
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:47,450
but her body not freaking out,
so she was like,

566
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,820
what do I do not eat?
And we had to actually go to the popcorn

567
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,660
because of the good fat and the butter 
that it had to keep her from not feeling

568
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:58,661
terrible to get it surprised go to for 
popcorn for nutrition at the Olympia and

569
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,310
she was there for like six hours.
They're supposed to be there for like an

570
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,930
hour and go into.
It was a shit show.

571
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,710
That's the most now.

572
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,760
What about other athletes?
Like,

573
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,820
I mean forget about this specific 
requirements or someone who has to lose 

574
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:09,820
a ton of way.
Yeah.

575
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,120
Now when you,
when you deal with most athletes,

576
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,260
like what,
what,

577
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,300
what kind of like a strength and 
conditioning protocols do you have the 

578
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,350
mom?
What kind of recovery protocols like are

579
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,650
using Cryo therapy or sauna?
Like what kind of stuff we're using.

580
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,630
So all of that is,
again,

581
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,000
I think at the problem is thinking that 
there's one answer there.

582
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't have any athletes that I'm like,
this is what we do.

583
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,210
Hey,
this is our method.

584
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,450
This is that.
I think a generally a terrible approach 

585
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,300
is combination of where that who they 
with what have they done,

586
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,100
what's their past history,
what do they like,

587
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,930
were they not like what do we really 
need to get?

588
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:43,931
So I try to identify what's compromising
their performance and let's pick the 

589
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:44,780
best solution for that issue.

590
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,050
So you show up and you're like,
your problem is agility.

591
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:53,051
Your footwork,
you're just too slow in your feet or 

592
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:53,051
we're gonna have a different approach.
Your training.

593
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:53,330
Then when someone says you're getting 
out stretch,

594
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,360
you're getting out strength here.
Like someone's pushing you around too 

595
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,360
much.
I don't need to rebuild your feet.

596
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,280
I don't need to improve your maximum 
speed because you're already the fastest

597
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,680
and the division.
Maybe your strength is your issue.

598
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:07,480
So do you do a bunch of tests on them 
when they come to you and then you tried

599
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:08,630
it?
What kind of tests do you do?

600
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,150
So we have an entire center for sport 
performance.

601
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:15,140
We've got six or eight laboratories in 
it with a whole host of equipment.

602
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,230
The thing we put the mask on them,
make them run field to Max.

603
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:18,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

604
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:23,861
If we need to do so,
we can actually measure the amount of 

605
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:23,861
oxygen and carbon dioxide coming in and 
out of the body,

606
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,540
which allows us to get a number called 
the vo two Max,

607
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,810
which is the maximum amount of oxygen 
that you bring in and exhale.

608
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,310
So it tells us basically year your 
maximum cardiovascular capacity and it's

609
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:38,690
pseudo important for mma.
So the average person's like at 40,

610
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:40,850
45,
just to give you some context,

611
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:43,610
that number,
anyone past about 60,

612
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,670
if you continue to go up,
it's not going really make you fight any

613
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:51,671
better.
So that's one of the things that we did 

614
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:54,010
or we found doing all the research on 
the MMA folks is if a point of 

615
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,941
diminishing return come around 60.
So if you show up and you're a jake 

616
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,350
ellenberger and you're at 52 and I can 
get you to 58,

617
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,870
then that's going to help your 
performance a lot,

618
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,990
but when you show up in your pack 
comments and you're 66 and I get you to 

619
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,481
69,
that's not gonna make you fight any 

620
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:10,481
better.
That's not your problem.

621
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,721
What makes you lose in a fight is other 
things that you need to spend that 

622
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:13,721
precious training time on.

623
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:18,460
So when you get a guy or a girl and you 
have them in your studio and you start 

624
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:23,711
work,
like what's like the first thing you do 

625
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:23,711
with them?
So it would honestly,

626
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:24,170
the first thing would be,
well what did the manager or why do they

627
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:29,171
reach out to me the.
Because usually when they come to me 

628
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:29,171
it's problem fixing.
They don't come to me with like,

629
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:29,390
hey,
at one seven fights in Roseville.

630
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:30,590
Fantastic.
Right?

631
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,480
Usually it's,
it's,

632
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,380
this is going on.
I'm losing because of this reason.

633
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,420
That's gotta be frustrating though 
because you'll,

634
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,990
when someone's losing the problem is 
like a slippery slope.

635
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,640
It's hard to catch yourself.
Oh yeah,

636
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,790
yeah,
well it's,

637
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:46,791
it's the game to have,
like sometimes they just want another 

638
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,320
answer which is just not good enough.
That's a rough answer.

639
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm not gonna tell them that I'm not 
coat,

640
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,100
but I'm like,
okay,

641
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,200
so we'll all watch the fights of course 
talk to their team.

642
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
So I'll give you a specific,
ample examples.

643
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:59,370
So they come to me and go,
hey,

644
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,110
like,
um,

645
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,880
I don't think we're fast enough on the 
feet.

646
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:03,690
This is a problem.
Okay,

647
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,550
well we've got force plates that are 
really,

648
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:10,551
really sensitive measurement equipment 
built into the ground and we can have 

649
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:10,551
them do a variety of,
of,

650
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,370
of jumping test,
moving test,

651
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,240
lifting test force plates.
How does it work?

652
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,450
So it's a really expensive scale 
basically built into the ground and it 

653
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:20,700
measures it.
Uh,

654
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:24,060
there is big as your laptop or as big as
the table.

655
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,710
Oh,
so it's fairly small.

656
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,900
Oh,
as big as the whole table?

657
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:28,470
Yeah.
They can,

658
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,890
not ours,
but we have one that's maybe the size of

659
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,830
a small coffee table.
Yeah.

660
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,120
And then there's two of them back to 
back.

661
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,830
Okay.
So we can do your right foot on one,

662
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:38,700
your left foot,
another one,

663
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,260
so we can test everything from not only 
your forest,

664
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,970
which is like if I,
if I measured your maximum dead lifts,

665
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,700
I would know how strong your back and 
your hamstrings and your glutes.

666
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,190
But how do you produce that force is the
big key.

667
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,480
So a good example is years ago we had 
some fighters come in and one of them 

668
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,220
was clearly not fast enough,
but he wouldn't believe it.

669
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,730
So he was strong,
but it took him a long time to produce 

670
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,820
that force.
So to give you a number,

671
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,580
let's say you could do,
you could produce 100 newtons of force,

672
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,140
right?
Just making the number up.

673
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,770
And I produced 100 newtons of force.
But if it took you one second to get 

674
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,281
there and it took me a hundred seconds 
or half a second to get there in an MMA 

675
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:19,290
fight,
I don't have one second.

676
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,120
So you don't have 100 newtons of usable 
force in your sport?

677
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,870
Know that.
It's interesting.

678
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:28,590
You just said he didn't believe it.
So he didn't think he was slow.

679
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,610
No,
he thought the problems were other 

680
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:33,610
things.

681
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:33,610
What do they think the problems were?
Who knows?

682
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,770
Coaching like I'm not getting the right 
things start.

683
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:36,900
Uh,
you know,

684
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,280
they had my walkout song wrong.
So you told them your slow dude,

685
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,580
that was my thing where I'm like,
I don't think so.

686
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:46,770
His coaching staff was like,
we think this is a problem.

687
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,430
Well let's put them on a force plate and
let's see not only how much force you 

688
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,311
produced,
because it's strength numbers were high 

689
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:56,310
squatted to lie dead to the law,
but the time it took him to produce that

690
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,350
force,
what's called the rate of force 

691
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,350
development,
uh,

692
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,370
his peak velocity,
the time it took him to get to that 

693
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:04,370
velocity.
All that,

694
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,211
when I compare it to him,
to the other athletes and nfl players 

695
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:08,211
and stuff was just like off the charts 
bad.

696
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,950
So it,
what exercise do you do to measure that?

697
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,920
So now that's a great example.
So when we have to individual athletes,

698
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:18,921
they come in.
So say one is the opposite to one of 

699
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:18,921
them is really,
really,

700
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:21,150
really good at producing fast quickly.
And the other one takes a long time.

701
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,840
So the one that doesn't produce fast or 
forced very quick,

702
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,360
we would put them on a drill where we 
say,

703
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:30,420
okay,
the goal of your training is to maximize

704
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:33,000
how quickly you produce for us.
I don't care how heavy you get,

705
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,000
but this is a reactive strength thing.
This is a speed thing.

706
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:40,200
So you're going to do a maybe little bit
lighter squats,

707
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,230
but you're going to explode.
You're going to transition out of the 

708
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,230
bottom,
you're going to bounce,

709
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,230
you're gonna.
Use Momentum.

710
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,351
You gonna Swing,
you're going to generate fast as 

711
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:51,841
possible.
You're not going to go to maximal 

712
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:51,841
strength.
The other guy,

713
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:51,841
we get the opposite.

714
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:55,560
We would take the speed advantage away 
from him or her and say you need to be 

715
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,460
able to produce more strength without 
taking advantage of the speed.

716
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:02,461
And it's basically comes down to using 
the muscle for force or the connective 

717
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:06,901
tissue for force.
And that's really what we can tease out 

718
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:10,150
now,
how much of speed and athletic 

719
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,050
performance is genetic and how much of 
it is what you've been doing and how 

720
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,930
much can you improve?
Yeah,

721
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:18,931
so that's,
if we actually just completed a really 

722
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,590
cool study on monozygotic twins,
monozygotic twins means you're the exact

723
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,930
same DNA,
so it's a sperm went in implant,

724
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,430
the two implanted one egg,
the egg split and you became identical.

725
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:32,431
Right.
And so we found two twins that were the 

726
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,711
exact same DNA,
but one of them had been doing a like 

727
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:38,940
marathons and stuff for 35 years.
The other hadn't done anything in 35 

728
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:39,790
years.

729
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,780
So we had this exact question that's 
crazy.

730
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,930
Identical DNA,
one variable different,

731
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,650
which is.
Well that's a huge variable though.

732
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,300
One is a super endurance athlete and the
Ns one,

733
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,690
the other one's a lazy bitch,
something like that or maybe studies a 

734
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,110
lot.
Yeah.

735
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,100
Uh,
something,

736
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,930
uh,
I think it was a truck driver.

737
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,700
Wow,
that's so weird.

738
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,380
That's unusual.
Isn't it?

739
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:09,370
Like extremely unusual.
Usually kind of share similar interests.

740
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,750
If not,
if there are differences,

741
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,070
there are differences.
Mild,

742
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,420
uh,
I kind of do this and you do a little 

743
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,420
bit more,
but.

744
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,420
So what were the differences in their 
body types?

745
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,230
So we tested them for everything.
A cardiovascular stuff,

746
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,440
vo two Max strength,
all these same tests that we do with the

747
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:23,860
MMA fighters,
muscle biopsies,

748
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:25,090
fiber type,
how much fast,

749
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,220
how much slow twitch.
Uh,

750
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,260
all the ones in between.
What we found was of course the 

751
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,000
endurance athlete had higher vo two Max,
like no brainer you,

752
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:39,001
you,
you run a hundred miles a week for 30 

753
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:39,001
years and your brother doesn't do 
anything.

754
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,060
You're going to have better 
cardiovascular system,

755
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,020
blood pressure,
cholesterol,

756
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,490
all that crap better than the trained 
athletes.

757
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,810
But the strength did not favor the 
athlete.

758
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,340
The muscle quality didn't favor the 
athlete.

759
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,020
The total amount of muscle didn't favor 
the athlete.

760
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,650
The speed didn't favor with the athlete,
really know and want to hear.

761
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:04,651
The craziest part is the fiber type.
The trained athlete and his quad was 90 

762
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:08,050
percent slow twitch,
10 percent fast twitch,

763
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,070
the untrained was 40 percent slow 
twitch,

764
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,450
about 30 percent fast twitch,
and then about 30 percent of some of the

765
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,250
hybrids in between.
Does that make sense to you?

766
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:21,220
Because the guy was just constantly 
running work.

767
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,310
Now what?
That's really weird,

768
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,060
that the muscle quality.
Yep.

769
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,390
Didn't favor the athlete.
I think what it mean,

770
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,320
what do you mean by muscle quality when 
you're saying that?

771
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,620
So yeah,
that's a good question.

772
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,620
You can take an ultrasound and you take 
an image of the muscle and it looks at 

773
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,320
it like a combination of how much 
administering muscular fat there is with

774
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,340
the how much total muscle master is in 
the size and a bunch of different 

775
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,360
things.
So you get this rough idea of quality.

776
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,380
How's it not favor guys exercising 
constantly?

777
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Well,
you have to be careful to only one 

778
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,100
subject or two,
so we don't know,

779
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,710
but the one implication could be that 
yes,

780
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,140
endurance running and cycling is great 
for you.

781
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,060
There's a clear health advantage of 
that,

782
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,540
but if that's all you do for 30 years,
that's probably not enough to save the 

783
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,251
muscle capacity.
We know things that are that are 

784
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:18,371
actually going to predict mortality.
Vo Two max leg strength is one of the 

785
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,270
most significant predictors of how long 
you live leg strength.

786
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,280
Absolutely weird.

787
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,010
Well,
sort of Tom Platz should live forever.

788
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,610
Yeah,
right.

789
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,150
Some of these guys that squat 900 now 
obviously there's diminishing returns.

790
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,400
$400.
I take you to 4:15,

791
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,960
you're not living at day longer,
right,

792
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:39,130
but think about it this way.
What's the one of the big reasons why 

793
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,071
you go from living by yourself to an 
assisted living home can't walk.

794
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,910
I can't walk,
can't stand up,

795
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,360
and the biggest one that they're 
actually starting to look at now is foot

796
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,790
speed,
foot speed.

797
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,170
Why?
Why?

798
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,860
If you trip and you're about to fall and
you can't put your foot out and catch 

799
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,060
yourself,
you have to have the foot speed to get 

800
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,220
yourself out there,
but these strength to stop yourself from

801
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:02,360
falling.
That makes sense.

802
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,700
So balance and yet,
well,

803
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:09,701
it's east centric strength.
The ability to block all those forces 

804
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,540
into the ground to catch your whole body
mass from falling or the,

805
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,080
wouldn't it be also your ability to 
manipulate your body like yoga?

806
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,230
Absolutely.
To be able to control yourself in 

807
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,810
awkward positions at.
The other thing they see is huge 

808
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:22,810
increases in general.
Just physical activity.

809
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,230
When you're stronger,
so when you're really,

810
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:29,231
really strong and you're 70,
you're much more likely to go to an 

811
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:32,021
extra yoga class.
I'll go and take the dog for an extra 

812
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:32,021
walk.
I'll go grab the thing,

813
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:35,630
but if I'm super weak and getting off 
the toilet is a maximum effort squat,

814
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,630
I'm more likely to just keep in my 
chair.

815
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,070
Just stand on the toilet.
Yeah.

816
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,870
Right.
Wow.

817
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,830
That's incredible that there wasn't any 
increase in muscle quality,

818
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,000
so that.
Well,

819
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,910
that's also one very specific type of 
exercise.

820
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,240
Endurance work.
We're,

821
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,690
this guy was a bodybuilder.
Who knows,

822
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,280
so that's exactly the point.
When you.

823
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,340
The first,
I think the first question you asked 

824
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,340
when we started talking was,
you know,

825
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,620
what,
what's the best type of workout?

826
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,450
What we will or what's the,
um,

827
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,560
the new age stuff,
right?

828
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,820
Hmm.
Well,

829
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,430
it goes back to I think every one of us 
would agree.

830
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:08,840
If you want to be as healthy as 
possible,

831
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,400
you need to do a variety of training.
Yeah.

832
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,840
It can't just be one modality.
So if you've only done yoga your whole 

833
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,871
life,
you're probably going to have strength 

834
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:19,871
problems,
speech problems.

835
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:20,570
If you've only run,
if you've only lifted weights,

836
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,330
if you've only exposed yourself to a few
of these stimuli,

837
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,750
you're probably in a real problem.
What we've,

838
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,360
what we've done recently actually has 
expanded that thinking.

839
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,130
Um,
so my friend Brian Mackenzie and I have 

840
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,721
a book that we just came out a couple of
weeks ago on this whole idea called 

841
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:38,010
unplugged where we need to

842
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,010
expand past just lifting and running and
think about what other physiological 

843
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:46,950
exposures do we need that are important 
for longevity.

844
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,240
How well do we do when we're hungry?
How about cold?

845
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,390
How about thirsty hot?
How well do we do?

846
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,450
Yeah,
meaning performance wise meaning 

847
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,521
everything.
So like are you manipulating diet to 

848
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:01,950
make people perform better when they're 
cold?

849
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,140
Like what are you doing?
Every combination.

850
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,470
So if you want to be able to sustain and
perform as well as we can throughout 

851
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,861
life,
we probably need to be able to handle a 

852
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:12,861
bunch of different challenges.
You're talking about longevity now,

853
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:15,960
not like necessarily athletic 
performance and will equal athletes.

854
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:18,150
We would use this under that umbrella 
but very,

855
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:19,530
very carefully.
So for example,

856
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:24,531
I would not recommend a extensive 
fasting in during the middle of a six 

857
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:24,940
week camp.
Part of UFC fights.

858
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,170
Like this is not at all we're saying,
but this is something maybe we implement

859
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,160
outside of camp.

860
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,680
Okay.
So for example,

861
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,470
we have somebody who's very,
very carbohydrate dependent,

862
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,550
right?
And I have a hard time using fat as a 

863
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,550
fuel source.
Okay.

864
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,360
Well maybe in during that six week camp,
before UFC fight,

865
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:43,620
I'm not messing with a tremendous 
amount.

866
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:45,540
We're not going on a new diet five weeks
before a fight.

867
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,460
Like that's not gonna happen.
But maybe,

868
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,410
oh you got hurt,
you got,

869
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,710
you know,
you've got an extended lay off.

870
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,680
Now we start to work on another part of 
your physiology.

871
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,280
So that next camp we've got more what's 
called metabolic flexibility.

872
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,970
So we have an ability to switch back and
forth before between fuel sources.

873
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,090
Right?
So when you're preparing someone for a 

874
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,090
very specific event,
exactly.

875
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,490
Q,
you're ramping up for September twelfth,

876
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,700
boom with this is we have a protocol,
let's get ready.

877
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,730
But then after the fights over then you 
might be working on very specific 

878
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,350
balancing exercises or that kind of 
stuff.

879
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Exactly.
So I'm of the belief that during those 

880
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,171
last few weeks,
you need to be very specific to what 

881
00:37:24,171 --> 00:37:24,171
you're going to do.
Get on weight,

882
00:37:24,171 --> 00:37:25,470
get focused,
get all these things.

883
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,950
But now if we,
because if we overspecification for too 

884
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,740
long,
we have problems.

885
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,370
We have this complex,
these fighting forces called 

886
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,801
optimization versus adaptation.
So generally when you're optimizing,

887
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,050
you're not adapting and vice versa.
How's that work?

888
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,510
So for example,
uh,

889
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:48,510
you brought up earlier,
so we do this stuff a lot.

890
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:51,210
We've done a lot of studies and 
published in this area.

891
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,230
So we're,
we're just learning some of the 

892
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,230
physiology behind what's going on with 
ice.

893
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,890
And a lot of people ask me this like,
well,

894
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,900
you for ice are pro or against it.
I don't understand why we have to be in 

895
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,150
one side of the camp.
Well,

896
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:03,770
there's,
um,

897
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,920
there's one guy who does,
who,

898
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,120
who doesn't believe in ice.

899
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,470
And Misha tate had them on her podcast 
is like the anti ice guy.

900
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,880
He's like saying you shouldn't use ice,
but I've looked at some of the pub med 

901
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,490
studies and some of the various.
There's a lot of benefits to ice,

902
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:22,980
like I don't understand why anybody 
would be anti ice,

903
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,750
but it makes sense at all to.
No,

904
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:26,820
it totally does and this is exactly 
where I'm going.

905
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,920
Anti ice makes sense to you or no?
It can.

906
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,710
Ken?
Yes.

907
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,960
In what way?
Because there is.

908
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,200
There's good scientific evidence to show
that there are consequences of the ice 

909
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,100
as well,
like in post injury or postworkout for.

910
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,340
So it depends on the workout context.
Okay.

911
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,400
So we'll go to easy examples so it's not
so vague and theoretical.

912
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,600
A post a workout that you try to get 
bigger and more muscle mass,

913
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,100
you don't want to do that right 
afterwards.

914
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,450
Bingo.
And why?

915
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,820
Well,
because your body has time to recover in

916
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:57,250
the actual inflammation is supposed to 
be good for you.

917
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,010
Exactly.
Yeah.

918
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,100
It's not good for you.
It is the signal to grow.

919
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:05,130
Right?
So people have this really weird thing 

920
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,030
where they like to personify your 
humidify chemicals and physiology.

921
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,920
It doesn't know,
it's not good or bad,

922
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,710
like inflammation isn't great or bad,
it just is.

923
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,470
It's a chemical like it doesn't give a 
shit at all.

924
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,760
It doesn't know.
It's not conscious.

925
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Right.
So if you were to do and hop in an ice 

926
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,750
bath post of a lifting session when 
you're trying to add muscle mass,

927
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,350
is gonna fuck up your game?
Probably.

928
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Yeah.
But you're supposed to wait like two 

929
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,440
hours.
Right?

930
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,440
It's not the right number though.
The more the better.

931
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,900
Probably more.
Probably four to six.

932
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,440
Oh,
okay.

933
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,580
Why not?
Why mess with it?

934
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,670
And I interference.
I read something about to the two hours 

935
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,731
is good after a hard lift.
Well we don't have any numbers to say 

936
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:39,250
optimal yet.
Like they would take a lot of studies to

937
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,320
figure out,
well two's not good but three is better.

938
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,470
So everything she knows rough.
We would have to titrate it up.

939
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,690
We'd have to do a study that says one 
group gets two hours,

940
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:51,691
one group,
it's three hours and then you'd have to 

941
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:52,060
like concentrate our effort.
Like how much exactly.

942
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,760
Effort is just kind of putting it all 
have to be in the same training program.

943
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:57,160
We have to biopsy them all.
Preimposed take blood marks,

944
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,110
a lot of jobs to do.
There's a lot of work.

945
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:05,170
That's why I'm so busy and there's 
creativity involved in it too because 

946
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,141
you have to Kinda like manipulate things
and figure stuff out and contemplate.

947
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,520
Well that's why I'm the director or the 
CO director and I am the run my own lab 

948
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,030
and I've got fantastic postdocs and 
students that are actually the operators

949
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:15,690
that execute

950
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,010
but it seems like everything is 
constantly evolving and shifting and 

951
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,010
changing and it's like,

952
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,800
well I find myself honestly spending 
more time being in the middle of saying 

953
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,390
like let's stop all the fighting between
things and let's spend time saying,

954
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:33,391
well,
what was good about this and what was 

955
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:33,391
bad about this?
Now when it comes to ice,

956
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:34,330
what about an entry?
Like what are so many twists their ankle

957
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,470
or something like that.
Do you,

958
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,540
do you believe in and icing it right 
away?

959
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,700
I have to defer.
Not My area.

960
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,210
Okay.
But to finish the example,

961
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,340
so post lifting session,
maybe not great,

962
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:50,341
but maybe if you wait six hours or do it
the next day and when we're talking 

963
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:54,301
about ice and we're talking about ice 
baths that we were talking about or 

964
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:54,301
you're talking about like a cryo 
chamber,

965
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:55,720
we don't have a tremendous amount of 
crowd chamber research,

966
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,900
so I'll have to say,
well actually I should say this with 

967
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:00,900
everything like this is as we know it 
now.

968
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,470
Right?
But as I started the show with like if 

969
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,850
I'm wrong in a year,
I'm going to say like actually all that 

970
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:08,850
was wrong.
This is part of it.

971
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:08,850
So what I've read about that

972
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:13,220
cryo chambers is the big thing is the 
anti inflammatory markers in the blood 

973
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,220
or the reduction of inflammatory markers
in the blood and improvements inside of 

974
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,890
cold shock proteins,
things along those lines that those 

975
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:23,890
would be beneficial.
But if,

976
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,440
if you're saying that,

977
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,030
but you got to be careful and 
beneficial.

978
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,220
Okay.
So beneficial for some things,

979
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,440
but they're always going to come in a 
compromise is something else.

980
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,200
So maybe beneficial for a power lifter 
that may be beneficial for an endurance 

981
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,870
athlete.
Does that make sense?

982
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,900
But I'm going to make it worse.
Oh No.

983
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,620
So you have physiology,
which is what I do.

984
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,060
Right.
And this is what science is.

985
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:48,500
We we biopsy,
we took blood,

986
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:53,501
we measured one market,
but that doesn't take into context 

987
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:53,501
anything else in their life.
Right?

988
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,280
So for example,
if you get a lift in and you're like,

989
00:41:55,281 --> 00:42:00,281
Oh man,
my elbow always things up on me after I 

990
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:02,651
lift and I bought.
I got a competition in eight weeks or a 

991
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:05,351
show in eight weeks and would be like a 
power lifting competition or body 

992
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:08,641
building competition.
And if you get in the ice that takes 

993
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:10,841
that pain away for whatever reason,
physiologically or animalistic or 

994
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:11,030
anything and that allows you to train 
more.

995
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,550
Well then we can't see that that was bad
for you.

996
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,250
Or if you were like some of my fighters 
who they like,

997
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,810
they feel more accomplished when they do
it.

998
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:22,811
They feel like they've done some work so
they feel less anxiety because they got 

999
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:26,030
in work.
Well then now we were playing a game 

1000
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,541
here.
It's more complex when they got in the 

1001
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:29,810
exercise or the ice bath in this 
example,

1002
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:31,760
the ice bath.
But it would be true of anything.

1003
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,460
Right.
So setting them up for a psychological 

1004
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:37,460
when.
Oh,

1005
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,060
that's fascinating.
So you factor that in,

1006
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,370
you have to like,
we're dealing with human beings.

1007
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:40,640
Right?
Right.

1008
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,680
But it might not even be real.
Totally,

1009
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,860
but really,
but really perceptive.

1010
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:46,370
Right,
right,

1011
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,090
right.
Yeah,

1012
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:48,960
I guess so for sure.
I mean confidence is,

1013
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,240
is a giant factor.
Absolutely.

1014
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,320
With combat athletes.
And there's some preliminary evidence 

1015
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,320
that suggests perhaps an ice bath.

1016
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,940
I think specifically post exercise in 
crude model increased mitochondrial 

1017
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,180
biogenesis.
Yeah.

1018
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,730
So now you say like,
well it's bad or good post-exercise 

1019
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:06,730
while I'm like,
well,

1020
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,001
what's the goal of the training session 
now when you say increased bio 

1021
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:10,400
mitochondrial biogenesis,
um,

1022
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,460
is that within a certain time period 
post exercise or is that just period?

1023
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,890
Well,
it'd be a,

1024
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,950
it'll be when they took the biopsy of 
the blood marker.

1025
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,800
Right.
What I'm saying,

1026
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,610
like within an hour after exercise,
within the sessions.

1027
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,390
Yes.
Yeah.

1028
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:26,690
So this one I believe was immediately 
post exercise.

1029
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,490
So like finishing good event.
Yeah.

1030
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,240
Huh.
Wow.

1031
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:34,520
So now you've got a conundrum,
but this is physiology,

1032
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:35,590
right?
It's crazy.

1033
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,760
So I get so fucking irritated when 
people say like,

1034
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,630
no,
this is the thing.

1035
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:40,370
And then they pull up plant flags about 
like this.

1036
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,040
We do what we don't do it because I sit 
in the middle going like,

1037
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,400
you're going to be a terrible coach 
[inaudible] because you're going to be 

1038
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,250
in a situation where you're going to 
need to violate those rules.

1039
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:50,650
Right.
Wow,

1040
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,600
that's complicated.
It is.

1041
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,540
I mean this is why we're utterly wrong.
Do you find that that's the case,

1042
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,550
his diet as well?
Like I am a big proponent of variable 

1043
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,760
diets and I think that there's a lot of 
biodiversity in.

1044
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,360
Well obviously there is where people are
allergic to certain cup type of foods,

1045
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:09,380
you know?
Um,

1046
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,180
but I just think this one size fits all 
approach to diet seems.

1047
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,940
The more I studied diet,
the more it seems crazy.

1048
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,690
So I would ask you this,
what do you think about if I came to you

1049
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,240
and said I'm going to do one workout 
style the rest of my life,

1050
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,940
everyone would be like,
that's stupid.

1051
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,360
Well,
if you want to be a Yogi says where to 

1052
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,360
go?
But most of us would say,

1053
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:31,690
Oh yeah,
no,

1054
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:31,960
I

1055
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,950
will also.
I just don't think it's fun,

1056
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,980
but why do we.
So why is that acceptable to do that 

1057
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:39,980
with nutrition?
Then why is that?

1058
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,400
I have to be ketogenic and this is what 
I do the rest of my life,

1059
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,870
or I have to be a paleo or have to be 
anything else lie.

1060
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,690
In fact,
it's you,

1061
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,320
you.
When you said variability,

1062
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,280
I assume you mean having a wide variety 
of foods in your daily?

1063
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:58,730
Yeah.
I think also a wide variety of foods in 

1064
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,651
your daily life,
but also I think what works for you 

1065
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:01,950
might not work for Jamie or might not 
work for me.

1066
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,380
Yeah,
I think that's the bio variability,

1067
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,500
but we're going to go inception on that 
one because you're ready to go another 

1068
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:09,500
level.
Okay.

1069
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,340
If that is absolutely true and most 
people recognize that,

1070
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,341
but what we don't appreciate is the fact
that there's not one diet that works 

1071
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:16,341
best for you.

1072
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:20,840
Right?
So there might be one day that works 

1073
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:20,970
best for me from power lifting,
but it might be different if I'm running

1074
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,520
hills or it might be the exact same.
Uh,

1075
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,030
what's,
uh,

1076
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,050
what the fuck bro it is.
I mean,

1077
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:33,230
what you're highlighting is a real issue
and it's also one of the reasons why 

1078
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,760
there's a lot of what I would call 
confidence men out there and I don't use

1079
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:38,510
that in a good term.
Yeah.

1080
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:41,040
I mean confidence been like con men 
because there's,

1081
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,860
there's a lot of people out there that 
still tell you like,

1082
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:46,380
this is my diet,
this is the way to go.

1083
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:51,381
You got to follow my way and you know,
and they almost always mock other diets,

1084
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,270
which is.
Yeah.

1085
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,100
How helpful is that?
Not Good.

1086
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,540
No,
it doesn't help anything.

1087
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,570
It's a big issue in the MMA community.
I see a lot of these guys popping up 

1088
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,000
where they're trying to make a name for 
themselves.

1089
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,020
It seems super common that someone wants
to diminish the,

1090
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:12,150
the other people out there doing 
different things and like this is our 

1091
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,890
way and this is the only way is the 
right way.

1092
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:15,240
And,
and that's a straight ego shot.

1093
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:20,390
Well also I think what they're playing 
to is that fighters in particular want 

1094
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:21,600
someone to come along.
Go,

1095
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,640
Andy,
I got the fucking solution.

1096
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,380
Okay.
You come to me.

1097
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,570
This is a fucking house of power.
We're going to get this shit right.

1098
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:33,420
We know what we're doing.
We've got a team of experts to.

1099
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,310
He's got a team.
You've got a team.

1100
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:36,680
Yeah.
And then you go,

1101
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:37,740
I'm,
I'm with the team.

1102
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,200
Yeah,
yeah,

1103
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:38,880
yeah.
I started,

1104
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,630
I signed up with Joe's team and,
and you really start believing like,

1105
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,650
okay,
this is gonna work.

1106
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:48,651
But did you think,
do you think physiology is that 

1107
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:49,200
precious?
It's pretty precious.

1108
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,600
Not like that.
It doesn't carry mean in terms of like,

1109
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,400
oh,
it has to be lined up perfect.

1110
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,710
And there's a one magical combination of
everything.

1111
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:56,490
No,
I don't think so.

1112
00:46:56,491 --> 00:47:01,020
But I think for some people clearly,
like some diets sure fit better.

1113
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:06,021
Like I had a bunch of friends that went 
plant based and not maybe not even 

1114
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:11,121
Vegan,
but the majority of their food is plant 

1115
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:13,461
based and they just feel better.
Their body just works better than the 

1116
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:13,461
vast majority of us would.
Yeah.

1117
00:47:13,461 --> 00:47:18,430
Then I know,
but I know a lot of other people that 

1118
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:18,430
went fat based then they feel better 
too.

1119
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,390
I mean like a lot,
a lot of coconut oil,

1120
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:25,391
a lot of Avocados.
That seems to me especially true with 

1121
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:28,470
people that are in intense exercise and 
I don't know why that is,

1122
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,500
but it seems like a lot of dudes that I 
know that Lyft,

1123
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:34,450
a lot of weights or that are involved in
Jujitsu or wrestling or anything or this

1124
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,660
law explosion.
It seems to me like a lot of fats and,

1125
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,400
and fish oils and things along those 
lines when they add those to their diets

1126
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,820
officially in particular seems to have a
big effect on grapplers.

1127
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,270
It seems to help them with joint issues 
and a lot of pain and maybe 

1128
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,310
inflammation.

1129
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,010
Yeah,
I could.

1130
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,170
Um,
I would say that most people are gonna 

1131
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,030
far better on a more traditional 
carbohydrate diet that are in the more 

1132
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,861
explosive power strength stuff,
especially at the volumes that mma 

1133
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:07,880
fighters are on because of the amount of
output they're doing,

1134
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,210
less amount of glucose requirements of 
the muscles.

1135
00:48:11,211 --> 00:48:16,211
Exactly.
And you have to be careful because this 

1136
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:19,450
is the exact same principle.
Either you're adapting or you're 

1137
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:19,450
optimizing.
If you're optimizing all the time,

1138
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:24,311
then you're not adapting and vice versa.
So if you push yourself to one end of 

1139
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:27,281
the spectrum,
you're going to probably compromise the 

1140
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:27,950
metabolic ability to go back to the 
other side of the spectrum.

1141
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,060
So spectrum meaning what,
like when you're defining it in any way,

1142
00:48:32,061 --> 00:48:33,470
but in this particular case,
I mean,

1143
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:36,110
so say for example,
you get very good at metabolizing fat as

1144
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:41,111
a fuel that may come with the 
consequences then of being able to use 

1145
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:41,111
carbohydrates as a fuel.

1146
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,160
So if you're in a sport that requires 
that,

1147
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,490
that's potentially problematic,
what sport would it require you to use?

1148
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,310
Carbohydrates versus ketones?
Anything that's anaerobic.

1149
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,660
So almost by definition.
So anything that's maximal intensity,

1150
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,070
a difficulty is going to be heavily 
carbohydrate for them.

1151
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,890
I wish I had got you in here with Dom 
D'agostino.

1152
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:01,760
Oh,
you just had him on,

1153
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:02,980
right?
He's,

1154
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,530
he's all fat based.
I mean he's a,

1155
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:10,610
a hundred percent Keto and he believes 
that key to genic diets have a host of 

1156
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,520
benefits and that the human body just 
functions better on them.

1157
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,260
Well,
so here's a good example.

1158
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,620
Uh,
I,

1159
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,660
I don't know,
dom and I wouldn't say anything about 

1160
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:20,660
him without him being right here.
It's not,

1161
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,620
not fair,
but everything I've seen of him has been

1162
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:22,790
fantastic.
Like I,

1163
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,610
I,
I'm very much supportive.

1164
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,060
The vast majority of what I've heard him
say,

1165
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,750
but his main lens is being focused on 
cancer prevention,

1166
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:31,370
epilepsy,
these things.

1167
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,460
But if you look at some of the research,
and I'm not an oncologist,

1168
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,110
so I'm going to speak a bit out of turn 
here,

1169
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:41,111
but there are now actually 
identification of several cancers that 

1170
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,560
thrive on fat rather than carbohydrates.
Really?

1171
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Yeah.
I have not seen this because he was 

1172
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,200
talking about a host of different 
cancers that sugars and you stop them 

1173
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,260
dead in their tracks,
but yeah,

1174
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,770
I'm sure he's fully right.
I'm sure he's totally right on that.

1175
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:59,771
But I did read something about a type of
brain cancer though that is not.

1176
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,500
Does not feed on sugar,
right?

1177
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,940
Yeah.
So again,

1178
00:50:04,941 --> 00:50:05,540
it would be like,
well,

1179
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:08,500
good for cancer or what kind of cancer 
alfre prop.

1180
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,070
Maybe 80 percent of them.
He's right.

1181
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,450
Maybe,
maybe even 90 percent.

1182
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:16,451
I don't know what the number is being 
environmentally caused cancer or who 

1183
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:16,451
knows.
Right.

1184
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:20,290
But the vast majority of high intensity 
exercise is powered by carbohydrate for 

1185
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,540
most of us who know,
why would it be carbohydrate versus it's

1186
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,810
more efficient and it's faster.

1187
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,950
Man.
See,

1188
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:26,960
I wish I had you in here with him.
I,

1189
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,940
he would disagree with you.
Well,

1190
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:33,941
there's not really.
I mean I got to be careful to say this 

1191
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:34,010
faster and it works better.
Like,

1192
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:39,590
well,
you have carbohydrate directly in the 

1193
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,351
muscle cell.
That's where it's stored as muscle 

1194
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:41,351
glycogen.
Okay.

1195
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:42,770
And so it is an immediate fuel source.
So when you're at work,

1196
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:44,030
then those,
your systemic,

1197
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:45,560
those are coming from the entire 
circulation.

1198
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,490
So when you use carbohydrate for fuel,
you're using the carbohydrate in the 

1199
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,850
muscle that is exercising.
So if you're doing bicep curls,

1200
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,490
you're burning glycogen from the BICEP,
fiber,

1201
00:50:55,610 --> 00:51:00,610
not even the muscle,
but the individual fiber that's 

1202
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,801
contracting.
And how would that be more beneficial 

1203
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:02,801
than systemic.
So it's faster.

1204
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,900
I'm right there contracting.
I don't have to move it throughout my 

1205
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:07,900
bloodstream.
When I use fat as a fuel source,

1206
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,710
it has to be,
has to be go through life policies,

1207
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,620
which means it's say it's stored fat in 
your entire body.

1208
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,300
So people right now,
listen to this podcast,

1209
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:16,010
go,
I don't know who the fuck to believe.

1210
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,410
It's not a bug on a dude on Monday.
He says,

1211
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:21,170
one thing you gotTa do,
Dude on Wednesdays is another thing.

1212
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,130
Yeah.
So that's the.

1213
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,220
I guess that's what I would say my 
biggest message is.

1214
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:30,221
It's not like a right or wrong thing.
That's the wrong question entirely is 

1215
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:33,700
who's right or wrong.
Do you have any athletes who are on a 

1216
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:33,700
fat based?
Absolutely.

1217
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:33,890
Who.
Totally.

1218
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,350
Uh,
probably those ones.

1219
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:38,300
I shouldn't say that there's Mrs.
Civic Athlete.

1220
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,140
No,
they're just like,

1221
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,640
hey,
don't talk about my diet stuff.

1222
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,650
Who Really.
They say that.

1223
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,410
Yeah,
some do.

1224
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,750
Okay.
The vast majority don't get.

1225
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:48,751
But Helen did ironman about appellant.
We go through periods of that with her 

1226
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:48,751
for sure,
for a lot of reasons.

1227
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:51,110
A,
it's very successful with her periods of

1228
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,430
that,
but not when she's competing.

1229
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,130
Even during training but not when she's 
competing.

1230
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,990
Yes.
Not like on competition day?

1231
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:58,730
No,
but sometimes a week of.

1232
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,950
So on competition day?
No.

1233
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,951
Because you feel like the glucose based 
diets are more efficient in terms of 

1234
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:06,500
actual physical performance?
Well,

1235
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:08,570
most specifically for rehydration 
purposes too,

1236
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:14,130
so because she's dehydrating heavily and
if you don't consume carbohydrates and 

1237
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,230
the rehydration process,
you're gonna have a real problem.

1238
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:15,860
Oh,
okay.

1239
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:20,861
That makes a lot of sense.
So we don't go there but we'll do it 

1240
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:21,860
even maybe like five days out or the 
working of or something.

1241
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,270
But what we have to be careful there,
and this is one,

1242
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,330
again,
this is.

1243
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:28,810
No,
I'm not badmouthing dom at all.

1244
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,400
No,
like nothing,

1245
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,740
but he's not dealing with somebody who's
generally hypo caloric,

1246
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,580
right?
So when we're going through an athlete 

1247
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,351
who is six weeks of coming down in 
calories and if we start cutting out 

1248
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:42,170
carbohydrates,
we actually did address that.

1249
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,610
He was saying that when you're talking 
about kidogenic states in particular,

1250
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:49,880
when you're talking about most people 
during regular life,

1251
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:55,570
50 grams carberry carbohydrates would 
keep you in a ketogenic state,

1252
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:59,970
but when you're talking about like some 
pro athletes powerless,

1253
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,810
you're in the hundreds,
100,

1254
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:07,811
250 and you're still cute agentic 
because your body is much more 

1255
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:07,811
requirements.
So like I told you,

1256
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:12,401
he's smart guy like I'm.
I'm generally on board with what he's 

1257
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,381
saying is a scientist just like you.
But the problem is micronutrient 

1258
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:18,881
quality.
So if an athletes coming down and 

1259
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:20,300
calories that and especially if those 
calories are coming from carbohydrates,

1260
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,420
carbohydrates are their main source of 
carbohydrates or plants.

1261
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,730
So if we've compromised that and they're
really low in calories,

1262
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,210
then they go down to nutrients about 
chemicals and that's a real problem.

1263
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,430
So we have to be very careful with 
getting them into Quito.

1264
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,420
If it comes with a compromising of 
vegetables,

1265
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,310
nutrition,
right,

1266
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,010
cold press juices or anything like that.
That's exactly what we do.

1267
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:46,220
Actually.
A lot of the times we did that 

1268
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:46,220
specifically.
In fact,

1269
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,420
that almost single handedly saved Rio 
for a.

1270
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,090
It was a real problem.
She had a real physiological crash.

1271
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,960
Like just just sucks to think that at 
the highest level of amateur competition

1272
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:56,320
they have poor food.
Yeah,

1273
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:01,370
well we had a.
We had to do because especially because 

1274
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,651
she was basically broke.
We had to like go up real struggle to 

1275
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:06,321
find a cold press.
Things that we could get to her that 

1276
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:09,740
because we had.
She was on like 40 ounces a day of that 

1277
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:09,740
for awhile and it's,
you know,

1278
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,190
it's funny we did that and that's,
I don't know,

1279
00:54:11,191 --> 00:54:13,740
you could do the math but 200 grams of 
carbs or something.

1280
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,160
And the second we did that her weight 
just started falling.

1281
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:18,270
Really?
Oh,

1282
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:23,271
interesting.
So we added 200 grams of carbs and poem 

1283
00:54:23,271 --> 00:54:23,271
whites just flu.
And what would,

1284
00:54:23,271 --> 00:54:24,260
what do you attribute that to?
Combination of,

1285
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,730
of physiological and psychological 
factors.

1286
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,560
Psychological.
She felt better.

1287
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,390
So it caused her weight to drop?
Yeah,

1288
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,690
she was stressed out.
She was freaked out the w and that's 

1289
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:35,880
cortisol level capture with higher.
Absolutely.

1290
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,170
Uh,
interesting.

1291
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,200
So she was panicked and she was freaked 
out and she was stressed because she 

1292
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:42,200
didn't feel good and she's like,
I'm not losing any weight.

1293
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,581
And once one,
a part of it was we gave her a system 

1294
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:46,581
that she believed in.
Okay.

1295
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:47,040
And so she like,
oh,

1296
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,080
okay,
we can do this.

1297
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,140
Oh now I also physiological pumps some 
nutrients into you.

1298
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,750
So I don't know,
like honestly,

1299
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:57,660
I don't know what part of it was.
It could have been all psychological,

1300
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,160
it could have been all physiological,
I don't know.

1301
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,160
But what we know is it worked and we 
gave her a bunch of nutrients and we're 

1302
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,970
like 40 ounces a day or up to 60 ounces 
a day of,

1303
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:09,971
of,
of fresh pressed vegetable juice and 

1304
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:09,971
just like clockwork every day,
you know,

1305
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:10,440
this,
this,

1306
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:15,441
this is such a complicated subject and 
it's so nuanced and there's so many 

1307
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:19,371
different variables that I feel like you
have to be a scientist to really truly 

1308
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,480
understand this.
I mean,

1309
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,940
yes and no.
It's one of the problems with the Bro 

1310
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,510
Science people,
the people that do not have the real 

1311
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:31,200
education and this stuff that are out 
there to coaching athletes and and teach

1312
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,970
them what to do and what not to do.
It's like,

1313
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,140
yeah,
don't really know what you're talking 

1314
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,140
about and that becomes a real problem.
You have to get care.

1315
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,010
Like it's funny because I don't know,
don't dominic said,

1316
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:41,700
but he's example.

1317
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,380
I've never heard him plant the flag and 
be unmovable.

1318
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:49,410
Movable on idea.
And it's funny because those of us that 

1319
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:49,410
do this for a living.
Yeah,

1320
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:51,060
rarely do we do that.
It's the other dicks that do it.

1321
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,340
I think you're right.
It's like everyone else is like,

1322
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:58,341
what do you mean?
I get this one on fiber type more than 

1323
00:55:58,341 --> 00:55:58,800
anything in the planet fiber type.
That's what I do for a living.

1324
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,220
Like I could tell you more about that 
than vast almost anyone on the planet 

1325
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,580
and yet I'll still have people who like,
I read this guy's instagram posts,

1326
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:06,240
bro,
you're wrong.

1327
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,690
Like I've hunted up,
biopsied hundreds of people have 

1328
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,671
isolated tens of thousands of fibers and
random under the lasers and studied 

1329
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,841
them.
And you're gonna tell me because you 

1330
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:16,841
read one instagram post or one review 
from two lanes.

1331
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:16,841
Look put the.
Well,

1332
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:18,180
people love doing that though.

1333
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:20,980
I mean nuts and they love it because of 
that reason.

1334
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,100
I know they love to call bullshit on 
you.

1335
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,200
I don't respond,
so it doesn't matter what it still gets 

1336
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,200
you.
Now they know.

1337
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,250
Yeah,
good luck because I bombed them with 

1338
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,400
youtube videos,
showing them walking them through the 

1339
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,400
science and it's like,
all right.

1340
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,521
Yeah,
but they don't read or watch that like 

1341
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:38,521
blah blah blah.
Dude,

1342
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:41,521
you're wrong on instagram post.
I had somebody on something a few weeks 

1343
00:56:41,521 --> 00:56:43,020
ago,
some instagram or something and was like

1344
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:48,450
going through.
She was being super respectful so I 

1345
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:48,450
didn't mind helping,
but I was like,

1346
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,771
okay,
we're done here because I already told 

1347
00:56:52,771 --> 00:56:52,771
you about my three hour video on this 
and you didn't watch it.

1348
00:56:52,771 --> 00:56:53,380
Right.
Fuck off.

1349
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:53,980
Bingo.

1350
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,630
Three hours.
Videos are hard,

1351
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:03,631
man.
A three hour video is a Goddamn gift 

1352
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:06,841
from God because if you stop and think 
about how much schooling you would have 

1353
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,460
to go through to get the information 
that's in that three hour video,

1354
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,880
it would take a decade.
It took my career and you can boil it 

1355
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:17,380
down to three hours and people like,
man,

1356
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,100
I'm not interested.
Well,

1357
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,480
I went to an instagram page,
this guy or some shit that said,

1358
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,780
you're an asshole.
Well I did a five minute videos.

1359
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:30,781
Why?
The first one was like a five minute 

1360
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:30,781
video and I just kept getting so much 
like blah blah blah.

1361
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:30,781
Yeah,
but you didn't do this.

1362
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,480
And I'm like,
really?

1363
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,190
You think I missed that?
You think I didn't read that one?

1364
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,120
And I was like,
fuck this.

1365
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:35,920
Like here we go,
here's the whole Shebang.

1366
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:36,970
Bmi.
And there you go.

1367
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,410
There's the link.
That's it.

1368
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:43,411
I'm done.
And throw it all up there and I still 

1369
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:43,411
get the change.
They don't change when you train.

1370
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:43,600
I'm like,
Oh my God,

1371
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,740
here we go again.
Now.

1372
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:49,741
Um,
so if someone has like a lot of fast 

1373
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:49,741
twitch muscle fiber,
like let's see,

1374
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:51,730
like Mike Tyson in his prime as an 
example,

1375
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:56,731
it's like a ball of fast twitch.
Could you turn a guy like Mike Tyson 

1376
00:57:56,731 --> 00:57:58,320
into like an ultra marathon?
No,

1377
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,760
no,
I mean he could maybe complete one,

1378
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,140
right?
For sure.

1379
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,030
Okay.
So genetically he's elite at fighting.

1380
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,470
He's just an explosive individual.
But making him like,

1381
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:12,970
uh,
you know,

1382
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,220
fill in the blank.
David Goggins type character.

1383
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,180
No,
I mean we have.

1384
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,240
So the easiest way to understand this is
plasticity.

1385
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:25,230
Your ability to change your adaptability
is far higher than what people 

1386
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:29,821
understand and in fact there's almost a 
direct link between the increase in 

1387
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:33,841
technology and the increase in the 
thoughts of what change and how much 

1388
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:33,841
they change.

1389
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:34,450
Oh.
So our ability to measure it.

1390
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:35,650
Bingo.
Okay.

1391
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,680
So the reason why we didn't think fiber 
type change 20 years ago is because we 

1392
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,131
didn't have the technology to actually 
have the fidelity to measure all the 

1393
00:58:44,131 --> 00:58:47,821
ones that we were missing.
And those are also probably a 

1394
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:48,080
psychological factor in there as well as
from the people that are measuring it.

1395
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:52,330
It's probably easier to say that it 
doesn't change then to say that it does.

1396
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,790
I don't know that it was just more of 
like that was the evidence.

1397
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,250
The comp.
Yeah.

1398
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,670
Right.
So it's confirmation bias.

1399
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:02,671
The first 10 studies had not shown it,
so therefore you're not looking for it 

1400
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:02,671
really hard.
Okay,

1401
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:03,220
got it.
Move on.

1402
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,260
Yeah.
Because otherwise you'd be chasing your 

1403
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,260
own tail forever on that.
Well,

1404
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,820
I can tell you right now like it's hard 
to,

1405
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,600
to,
to get things into,

1406
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,200
into publication when they completely 
challenged and entire the entire 

1407
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,670
thought.
An example.

1408
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,850
So for example,
if,

1409
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:23,910
uh,
if you were the first one to try to 

1410
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:23,910
publish a study,
that fiber types

1411
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:27,130
changed as response exercise training 
and 20 years of research suggested 

1412
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,060
otherwise you'd have a very hard time 
getting through review.

1413
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,890
They would hammer you for every little 
thing that like,

1414
00:59:31,891 --> 00:59:33,440
wow,
do you do this and did you do this?

1415
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,940
And because we're going to be very 
skeptical and that's not a good reason,

1416
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:37,490
right?
Yes.

1417
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,080
That's how it should be.
It should be,

1418
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:44,110
right.
A extraordinary claims require 

1419
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:44,110
extraordinary evidence,
right?

1420
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,390
Yeah.
So I have no beef with that is what the 

1421
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,141
problem is when the other people who 
aren't scientists and don't pay 

1422
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,920
attention,
like if you don't know what like I do,

1423
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,510
then you need to like,
you can talk about it.

1424
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:58,511
That's fine.
I talk about stuff I'm not an expert 

1425
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,101
about all the time,
but you need to be careful when someone 

1426
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:00,101
else walks in the room and goes like,
well,

1427
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:00,700
I do this for a living.
Uh,

1428
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,270
then,
uh,

1429
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:02,420
you know,
just concede the point,

1430
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:05,720
but you need to be a little more open 
with listening and gone.

1431
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh really?
Right.

1432
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:07,700
Didn't know that.

1433
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,580
Hm.
Yeah.

1434
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:10,180
That's,
uh,

1435
01:00:10,181 --> 01:00:15,181
that's interesting.
Can you think of anything that has 

1436
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:17,851
changed other than the fiber types?
That's a change the way people look at 

1437
01:00:17,851 --> 01:00:18,580
things recently because of technology.

1438
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,390
Yeah,
I mean,

1439
01:00:19,391 --> 01:00:20,620
that's a good example.
Um,

1440
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,300
the,
the,

1441
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:25,540
uh,
hyperplasia is probably the biggest one.

1442
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,240
And what does that.
So when your muscle gets bigger,

1443
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,660
you the diameter of each individual 
muscle fiber gets larger.

1444
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,030
So it just thickens right?
Well,

1445
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:37,510
hyperplasia is a concept that you 
actually add more muscle fibers total,

1446
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:42,900
so you add sells to the entire muscle 
and for decades basically if you say 

1447
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,701
that doesn't actually exist in humans 
now as we're improving our fidelity of 

1448
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:49,570
our measurement techniques,
it looks like a.

1449
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,760
It happens a lot.
We know it happens in other mammals.

1450
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:57,180
How what happens in humans when it does,
it's going to be very difficult and 

1451
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,301
probably impossible to ever show,
but we have more and more evidence 

1452
01:01:00,301 --> 01:01:02,500
because we know the mechanisms now 
behind the cell growth.

1453
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,980
So once we see the physiology and the 
mechanics behind it and the molecules 

1454
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,470
and the gene expression and then we say,
okay,

1455
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:09,700
it lines up with a,
b,

1456
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:10,180
c,
d,

1457
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:15,181
and e.
We just can't show up with f because of 

1458
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:17,820
technology.
Now we need to really rethink our 

1459
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,670
position here.
And that's probably the biggest one.

1460
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:25,330
Now when you're dealing with athletes 
and especially athletes that are trying 

1461
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,590
to make weight like a,
like a fighter.

1462
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:33,040
And do you ever tell them like say like 
a Jake ellenberger was a pretty thick 

1463
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,680
guy.
It's done 170 pounds and you got,

1464
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:39,681
I'm exercising and doing all these 
things and you do a body composition of 

1465
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:43,721
them.
Do you ever tell them like you got to 

1466
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:44,330
lose some muscle like theirs?
Do you ever say that?

1467
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:49,331
Like your 200,
five pounds getting down to one 

1468
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:49,331
seventies really gonna fuck you up.

1469
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,730
We've done that a little bit in the 
past.

1470
01:01:50,731 --> 01:01:51,570
People have come and said,
hey,

1471
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:56,571
will you test me and tell me if you 
think I can go down to 55 or 85 or 

1472
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:56,571
something?
Um,

1473
01:01:56,571 --> 01:02:00,030
my general approach is you're better off
staying or going up.

1474
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,750
It's almost,
almost always better if they're going to

1475
01:02:03,751 --> 01:02:05,050
go stay at a class or go up awake.

1476
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:10,180
I could not agree more.
And you've seen the performances of 

1477
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,680
fighters when they do go up,
they look so much.

1478
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,590
The Jorge Mazda doll is a perfect 
example.

1479
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,560
Yeah.
Forty,

1480
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,400
55 forever fought at one seven.
He's one of the best in the world now.

1481
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,720
Donald cerrone and another example.
There's been a ton of fighters that move

1482
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:24,290
up in look so much better because their 
body,

1483
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,700
like Calvin Gastrula,
he's another great example.

1484
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,530
Yeah,
he's a,

1485
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,300
he's a diet one though for the most 
part.

1486
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:30,500
Like he's,
he gets that dialed.

1487
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,480
He should be able to make 70 no problem.

1488
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,030
But.
But God damn it looks good at 85,

1489
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:36,470
he looks good.
You see tank,

1490
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,880
he's awesome.
But when you see a guy like him and you 

1491
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:41,880
know,
you gotta out powered by.

1492
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:41,880
Golly,
Chris Weidman.

1493
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,390
What's the line in the sand you draw 
where you say,

1494
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:49,391
okay Calvin,
let's put on some muscle and some 

1495
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,551
strength so that you could deal with the
oil Ramiro's of the world or let's lean 

1496
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,830
you out and get you off the Tacos so you
can,

1497
01:02:54,831 --> 01:02:59,831
uh,
you could fight guys that you're 

1498
01:02:59,831 --> 01:02:59,831
supposed to be fighting.

1499
01:02:59,831 --> 01:02:59,831
Yeah,
that's it man.

1500
01:02:59,831 --> 01:03:01,750
That's it.
Internally questioned that if they,

1501
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,600
if they really buy in to what I say,
it's,

1502
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,760
it's an easy conversation,
but a lot of them won't,

1503
01:03:06,761 --> 01:03:07,840
which is fine.
Like,

1504
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:08,700
um,
so I,

1505
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:13,701
I don't,
I don't think you have a good answer 

1506
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:13,701
there man.
Like it's tough.

1507
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:13,701
He's a classic example though,
like there's this almost,

1508
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,060
I mean it got to be careful.
I don't know his camp,

1509
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:18,370
like I've met him a handful of times but
we've never been in my lab.

1510
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,270
I don't know like how bad his stuff his 
or,

1511
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:25,350
or how like if he's got medical problems
that no one knows about or if he has any

1512
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,160
other issues that are going on and make 
it hard.

1513
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:32,190
So that happens from time to time.
So they don't want to just like ice 

1514
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,801
cream.
Ice Cream is a lot of guys that are 

1515
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:34,801
super talented.

1516
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:35,650
They just love to eat,
you know,

1517
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,430
man,
it's crazy.

1518
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:41,431
Like a lot of those folks will go to 
food for comfort for that and for the 

1519
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:43,840
control control.
That makes sense.

1520
01:03:43,841 --> 01:03:48,190
Especially in such a crazy world of the 
world of competition in combat sports,

1521
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:53,250
especially in this sport where like 
winning and losing so finite and when 

1522
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,641
you get to the top like nobody.
Well rarely people win more than they 

1523
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:57,210
lose,
right?

1524
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,290
Like it's just so hard,
so hard.

1525
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,750
And there's so many with the,
you know,

1526
01:04:00,751 --> 01:04:03,130
like in Nfl and major league baseball 
and soccer,

1527
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,140
there's a clear pecking order.
You beat this person,

1528
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,610
then you'd beat this team,
then you'd beat this team,

1529
01:04:06,611 --> 01:04:08,980
then you get to play for the 
championship or an mma.

1530
01:04:08,981 --> 01:04:11,740
It's not like that.
Well it's definitely not anymore.

1531
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,960
You know,
in the UFC it's real weird.

1532
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:17,200
Like especially the 185 pound division,
like good fucking luck.

1533
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:22,410
Oh you know,
everybody's waiting in line to fight 

1534
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,781
Michael Bisping.
He's probably going to fight George St 

1535
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:24,970
Pierre and everybody be like Luke 
rockhold.

1536
01:04:24,971 --> 01:04:27,130
So those other guys,
like what the fuck?

1537
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:32,340
When he beat rockhold,
that's my single favorite mma moment in 

1538
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:32,340
history.
Really.

1539
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,430
I'm not like a noxious bisbing fan or 
anything.

1540
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:38,460
But that was the culmination of a dude 
who put in so much time and he did 

1541
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,080
everything to make it a business.
He did everything and then he not only 

1542
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,320
steps in and fights,
I just killer and rockhold who I thought

1543
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,300
was been underrated his whole career.
Like he's this insanely good,

1544
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,510
but he'd already,
he'd already lost them convincingly,

1545
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,420
you know,
bad subs in the first round.

1546
01:04:55,430 --> 01:05:00,430
Yeah.
And older guys don't come back and beat 

1547
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:00,430
younger guys in the rematch is ever 
right.

1548
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:04,860
Especially on short notice.
Short notice when he had a whole camp 

1549
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,940
and has every reason to not have 
confidence in like 90 percent or more.

1550
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:08,000
Fighters would have just been like,
no,

1551
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:08,890
I'm out.
Like no way.

1552
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,280
He takes the flight,
like no one would take that flight 

1553
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:14,280
because if you lose twice to the 
champion,

1554
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,640
you're done.
You're not gonna get third.

1555
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,070
Just every risk possible.

1556
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,010
And he just nails like this.
Unbelieve clips him and knocks him out.

1557
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:21,700
Yeah.
Amazing.

1558
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,560
Like I loved rock whole book.
That was just incredible.

1559
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:28,590
It really was crazy.
And you could really tell that rockhold 

1560
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:29,440
just thought he was going to win the 
fight no matter what.

1561
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,530
It is a done deal.
Totally underestimated.

1562
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,250
Bisping's so scrappy.
Like he's one of the most mentally tough

1563
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:41,251
guys in the sport because he doesn't 
have like some freak issue while we're 

1564
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:42,610
Merrill athleticism or anything.
He's just,

1565
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:44,890
it's just hard work.
He's not particularly fast.

1566
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,550
No,
he's not.

1567
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:50,850
He's not super mobile.
He's very skilled and he's got a lot of 

1568
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,860
physical issues to see out of one I 
know.

1569
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:57,870
Is that a bunch of issues with joints 
and disks and he doesn't move willing 

1570
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:57,870
injuries?
No.

1571
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,290
And he's not baked for the division or 
anything.

1572
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,430
Didn't have people at while.

1573
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,980
He's pretty big for when any five.
Well,

1574
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:06,981
not like amazing.
He's not like towering over white men 

1575
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:06,981
are rockhold like,
no,

1576
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:07,010
he's not those guys.
Yeah,

1577
01:06:07,011 --> 01:06:09,220
those guys are giant.
He doesn't have some amazing skill set.

1578
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:14,221
Either way he can fall back on a world 
championship in wrestling to get 

1579
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,890
through.
Like he just is like pretty good at 

1580
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:16,890
everything.
Yup.

1581
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:16,890
Yeah.
Still just finds a tough kid.

1582
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:21,180
He's a guy I would love to biopsy and 
figuring out like how much slow twitch 

1583
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,630
and fast twitch does he have?
Thirty four beats per minute.

1584
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:24,700
Resting heart rate is fit.
Yeah.

1585
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,670
He's a big factor.
It's a big factor and that he could push

1586
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:29,530
a tremendous pace and then keep it 
going.

1587
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:33,970
Like one of my favorite fights of 
Michael's was when he beat Conley.

1588
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Oh yeah.
Because he's just overwhelmed them and 

1589
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,260
just starting to get tired and bisping 
just poured it on.

1590
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:46,330
Yeah,
just gave him a beating and that was 

1591
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:46,330
sort of a in a lot of ways,
like a,

1592
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:50,721
a shift towards.
I mean he was always a world class 

1593
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:53,821
fighter.
There was a shift towards the upper end 

1594
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:53,821
of the,
of the division.

1595
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:55,510
It was a big moment for his career too,
because if he lost that,

1596
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,610
that's probably about nine tonight for 
him in terms of.

1597
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:58,570
Yeah,
you could say that,

1598
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:01,680
but he doesn't give a fuck.
He got knocked out by Vittorio,

1599
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:06,720
comes right back.
You know he got knocked out by 

1600
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:06,720
Henderson.
Comes right back.

1601
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,750
He's one of the guys.
I've been around him a bit.

1602
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,080
He's hilarious.
But he's one of the guys were like,

1603
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:16,081
he doesn't,
he just not going to shake him like 

1604
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:16,081
that.
No,

1605
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:16,750
not at all.
He's undeniably tough.

1606
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,140
Yeah.
And he's undeniably like,

1607
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,270
when he says like,
all fight,

1608
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:20,980
that dude,
he legit.

1609
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,090
Oh yeah.
He's there.

1610
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,380
And you can say like,
oh,

1611
01:07:23,381 --> 01:07:24,340
he's scared of Romero.
No,

1612
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:27,190
he's not scared of any of these students
he's trying to cash in.

1613
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,660
When he said,
well,

1614
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:31,900
I think the bisping GSP fight is a 
fascinating fight.

1615
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,550
It's fascinating.
First of all,

1616
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,980
GSPS never fought at 85.
He comes back,

1617
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,860
he fights for a world title.
It makes it compelling.

1618
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,620
Yeah.
I just wonder if this is unfortunate,

1619
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:46,420
but I wonder how many of these young new
fans I would like to say like post Ronda

1620
01:07:46,421 --> 01:07:51,421
Rousey fans,
how many of them even know who fucked 

1621
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:51,820
GSP is?
I think there's a lot in my life.

1622
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:53,830
Definitely does.
Well she's a fan,

1623
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:57,010
but I mean I'm wonder if how many of the
new ones,

1624
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:02,100
you know,
the people coming up actually know who 

1625
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,100
he is and it means it's been a long 
time,

1626
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,420
you know,
a couple of years,

1627
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:04,630
right?

1628
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,030
More than that.
Yeah.

1629
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:11,070
When did he lose to Johnny Hendricks?
I want to say it's three years ago at 

1630
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:11,070
least.
At least.

1631
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,210
Yeah.
Well Pete Johny Hendricks.

1632
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,080
Yeah,
I,

1633
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,670
I'm not.
I'm not a big believer in that decision.

1634
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:24,410
I feel like at most that was a draw.
I felt like Hendrix got the most of it.

1635
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:27,080
My buddy troy,
it's brother had 50 k on Hendrix on that

1636
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:29,540
fight during and afterwards he's like,
here we go.

1637
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,760
We're done.
Done.

1638
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:37,410
Hendrix thing was interesting because a 
Hendrix is one of those guys that you 

1639
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:39,720
kind of like what happened to that guy?
Yeah.

1640
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,450
You know,
like what?

1641
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,440
A lot of speculation on that where you 
can all read between the lines there.

1642
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,040
Well,
that's,

1643
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,330
that's the problem,
right?

1644
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,710
Yeah.
There's the Usada speculation.

1645
01:08:49,711 --> 01:08:51,410
There's the motivation,
speculation.

1646
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:56,411
There's a lot of speculation.
You also have that thing to what guys 

1647
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:56,420
like that,
that put in that many years of wrestling

1648
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,800
and you start competing that hard,
that young like that.

1649
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,310
That wears on you a timeframe that you 
run out of.

1650
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:09,670
Yeah.
There's a like people believe there's a 

1651
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:09,670
nine year window as a world class 
fighter.

1652
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:11,420
I've heard that before.
It depends on the sport,

1653
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:16,421
but yeah,
that's probably fair as a fighter and 

1654
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:16,790
that as a fighter,
like can you get to mma in particular?

1655
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:21,850
Guys have nine years to compete at a 
world class level and then the wheels 

1656
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:21,850
just fall off.
Yeah.

1657
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:22,700
Get in and get your money.
Get Out.

1658
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:23,840
Yeah,
if you can,

1659
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,870
if you can.
Yeah.

1660
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,720
That's why 38,
I think.

1661
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:29,150
Bespeaks 38.
That GSP fights,

1662
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:29,840
right?
Move.

1663
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,420
Oh,
for $100 move.

1664
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:33,920
Anyway.
What does a business typically do?

1665
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:36,920
Well with like the fighters?
He handles wrestlers decently well.

1666
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:40,520
He's a very good defensive wrestler.
His styles can be fantastic.

1667
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,990
It doesn't get tired,
which is what GSB relied on a lot is,

1668
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,200
is his stamina.

1669
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:50,230
Conditioning was great,
but that stamina is dependent upon 

1670
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:54,371
activity.
Like do even if you're just physically 

1671
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:54,371
fit,
but you haven't fought in a long time.

1672
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:56,450
I don't necessarily know if it's 
applicable.

1673
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,280
Yeah.
Well it's also going to be different too

1674
01:09:58,281 --> 01:09:59,870
with.
We'll see what he does weight wise.

1675
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:04,930
Yeah.
So what people don't understand about 

1676
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,601
when you watch professional athletes,
fighters in particular as a lot of what 

1677
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:10,991
happens in that fatigue is either 
psychological or it's bad weight cut 

1678
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:11,180
stuff.
So now he doesn't have that,

1679
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:16,181
but if he's lugging around extra weight 
that he's not used to potentially 

1680
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,400
problematic depending on how he does it.
Now he's got some smart people in this 

1681
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:21,400
camp,
so he's probably going to be fine,

1682
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,300
but that's a real problem that he may or
may not be ready for.

1683
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,940
Yeah,
if he's lugging around extra weight,

1684
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:28,910
but he was always walking around 
somewhere around one 85 slash 90.

1685
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,070
He might just decide to compete at that 
weight.

1686
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,450
That's what I mean.
Like if he stays there,

1687
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:37,451
he's probably fine.
But if someone gets in his head and 

1688
01:10:37,451 --> 01:10:37,451
tries to get them up to two,
oh,

1689
01:10:37,451 --> 01:10:37,451
two or something and then come back 
down,

1690
01:10:37,451 --> 01:10:38,480
like he's probably not going to feel 
normal there,

1691
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,270
which he's not gonna run out of gas 
because of that.

1692
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,400
Like having more muscle doesn't make you
fatigued more.

1693
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:48,730
It's the training that does it now.
Do you have fighters use cardio 

1694
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:49,910
machines?
Like do you have,

1695
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:54,940
do you have them use versa climbers or 
treadmills or anything along those 

1696
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,651
lines?
I don't feel like those are super 

1697
01:10:59,651 --> 01:10:59,651
important,
uh,

1698
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:03,130
differences in terms of we're generally 
trying to get most of their physical 

1699
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:07,271
activity from training.
Like if you have an extra hour with the 

1700
01:11:07,271 --> 01:11:07,271
training,
we could get in the week.

1701
01:11:07,271 --> 01:11:08,840
You mean by martial arts training,
right?

1702
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:09,670
Really?
Yeah.

1703
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,540
Interesting.
So,

1704
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:15,610
but having said that,
if we want to do a small circuit or 

1705
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:15,610
something

1706
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:15,720
that incorporates one of those things in
there,

1707
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,330
sure,
but I'm never going to prescribe.

1708
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:19,560
If they're not doing it like,
Hey,

1709
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,510
let's hop on and let's get an hour on 
the elliptical.

1710
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,370
Like that's never going to come out of 
my mouth.

1711
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,540
That's not to say I would never use it.
I'm not throwing anything out.

1712
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:30,510
I'm not pro or con,
but that's chip judicially not where I'm

1713
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:33,450
going to go because it's far easier for 
us to help them lose weight through food

1714
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,620
than it is adding on an extra hour and 
that adding on an extra hour of activity

1715
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,750
can be real harmful for them.
Muscularly,

1716
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,420
but we're not necessarily just talking 
about losing weight.

1717
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:44,670
We're talking about increasing 
increasing performance.

1718
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:48,210
Do you believe in any of those machines?
It's not a believer or unbeliever in.

1719
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,770
Right.
I would go to it if I needed it.

1720
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:54,771
I don't feel like in camp it's a huge 
need with the exception of maybe like a 

1721
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:55,380
recovery,
so you want to do like,

1722
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:57,390
hey,
let's go and easy 45 or something on the

1723
01:11:57,391 --> 01:11:57,870
bike.

1724
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:00,900
Uh,
but as like a 45 hard,

1725
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:06,380
um,
with the exception of when you start 

1726
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,271
moving to championship fights.
I do think there's good cause for doing 

1727
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:12,020
maybe once a week of saying like,
we do this with Dirk and all the time 

1728
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,020
like,
Hey,

1729
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,861
he loves to ride mountain bikes.
So go out in the mountain bike and go 

1730
01:12:15,861 --> 01:12:15,861
ride for.
When you're saying dirt,

1731
01:12:15,861 --> 01:12:15,861
I mean pat comments.
Yeah,

1732
01:12:15,861 --> 01:12:17,070
sorry.
It's okay for people.

1733
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:18,660
Not mostly,
I don't know,

1734
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,760
but that's because of it is because he 
loves that.

1735
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,210
That's his real mental release.
Mountain budgeting.

1736
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,850
Yeah.
It's a great workout tour.

1737
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:26,760
Yeah,
it's fantastic.

1738
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,050
It's,
he gets in the sun,

1739
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,080
he gets away from people,
he gets to breathe and we're not 

1740
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,140
counting things which can be a problem.
But if I had another athlete,

1741
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,670
it was like,
I absolutely hate jogging.

1742
01:12:35,671 --> 01:12:38,070
Like it's the worst thing I got knee 
problems,

1743
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:38,700
hurts my back.

1744
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,200
I'm never going to ask them,
hey,

1745
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:42,080
go jog and hour,
but if you did,

1746
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:47,100
I'm like,
what if someone has knee problems and 

1747
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:47,100
you want to get them to do cardio 45 
minutes,

1748
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,690
something like that.
Maybe in the pool.

1749
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:52,530
A lot of pool work can be really helpful
if they have access.

1750
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,740
If they can't,
um,

1751
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,360
no one has ever not love the Airdyne or 
our assault bikes.

1752
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,720
Those are fantastic.
Versa.

1753
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,010
Climates are great and I got no problem 
with those things.

1754
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:06,210
What is a,
is there a one machine that is like your

1755
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:09,030
standby or go to when it comes to cardio
machine?

1756
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,260
Well,
those would probably.

1757
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:13,980
Those are the rower diverse climber,
the rower and the Airdyne.

1758
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:14,730
Yeah.
Aerosault,

1759
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,340
any of those things.
Anything that allowed them to move,

1760
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:21,180
that minimizes the amount of technical 
teaching you have to do.

1761
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,570
So that's.
Most people run horribly.

1762
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,210
Um,
this is like a real,

1763
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:27,930
real,
real problem.

1764
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,060
Especially wrestlers,
if you ever watch the rest of the run,

1765
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,200
it's like you're,
you're a,

1766
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:34,530
you're a knee pain,
you're busted ankle waiting to happen,

1767
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:39,890
so I'm not going to throw that on them.
And they try to teach them a new 

1768
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:39,890
movement skill.
It's just not needed.

1769
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,160
There's a thousand ways we can get there
if they already run,

1770
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:44,350
well never running background.
And we could go there if they want,

1771
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:46,320
if they want.
Some of them do like it.

1772
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:47,340
Okay,
fine.

1773
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,080
We can get there.
But if they don't run well,

1774
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:50,950
I mean technically well,
um,

1775
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,870
if they're landing in bad positions that
their fear out everywhere and they don't

1776
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:58,620
want to take time to go to a running 
coach like Brian Mackenzie or something,

1777
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,770
then we're not going to add that.
We're not going to add a new skill.

1778
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,040
They know a lot of,
uh,

1779
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,940
Greg Jackson's work.
A lot of his camp,

1780
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:09,840
they do these uh,
hill runs in Albuquerque.

1781
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:10,420
Yeah.
Good.

1782
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,760
That stuff going up a hill is a little 
different though.

1783
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:18,030
Yeah.
Because generally the foot position of 

1784
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:21,691
the hill as much easier to get to.
And it's harder to run bat uphill than 

1785
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:23,650
it is on flat ground generally.
So it is something you'd go to.

1786
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:28,651
But that's also probably something where
you don't have as much teaching and 

1787
01:14:28,651 --> 01:14:31,420
you're an altitude.
So that by itself is going to reduce how

1788
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:36,421
hard you work,
which is going to reduce the stress on 

1789
01:14:36,421 --> 01:14:36,421
your joints and bones and ligaments.
So that helps.

1790
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:41,520
So all that can be integrated where you 
have you reduced the likelihood of them 

1791
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,540
getting a sore back or knees because you
added some 45 minute running on there.

1792
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:46,390
That didn't really have to happen.
Well,

1793
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:50,020
he'll seem to reduce that anyway because
you're really almost like doing squats.

1794
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:55,410
It's almost like doing or a lunch or 
something like that because you just 

1795
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,770
kind of running and pushing your body up
instead of like the pounding,

1796
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,310
the East centric pounding is gone.

1797
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,190
Yeah.
This is a very good.

1798
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:06,180
One of the most important things we 
stress during fight camp is you want to 

1799
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:09,301
minimize the Essentra contractions 
because that leads to more soreness and 

1800
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:14,041
if you got really sore legs and you've 
got to go to movie tie practice and 

1801
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:14,650
somebody in the leg like that,
that's a problem.

1802
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,830
And so you have to be able to get work 
in without getting extremely sore.

1803
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:20,920
So hills are great example.
Aerodyne is like the same thing,

1804
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:22,270
right?
It's pushing the whole time.

1805
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:25,150
It's not landing and impacts running,
rowing,

1806
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:27,470
all these versaclimber,
that's why they're so good at.

1807
01:15:27,471 --> 01:15:29,500
Or one of the reasons you can do a lot 
of work

1808
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:34,630
is air dine or reverse Karma.
Those things limited in the fact that 

1809
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,771
like the movement is very specific and 
that law is in terms of doing that 

1810
01:15:39,261 --> 01:15:42,380
versus like maybe like a Kettlebell 
cardio workout.

1811
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,250
Yep.
You should do.

1812
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,650
That's why you need to do a combination.
Okay.

1813
01:15:45,651 --> 01:15:48,170
So it's a bunch of different stuff.
Just like we talked with nutrition,

1814
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,260
it's variability that gets this is what 
we're looking for,

1815
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:55,310
especially when the goal is not that 
modality.

1816
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:01,210
So for example,
if you're competing in a kettle bell 

1817
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:01,210
swinging competition,
like you should be focusing on that,

1818
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:04,010
but when you're using that for another 
modality that doesn't transfer over,

1819
01:16:04,011 --> 01:16:07,010
then you need to have a wide range of 
stresses.

1820
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,830
How do you know like what to tell them 
to do though?

1821
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,270
So that's the thing is I,
I don't,

1822
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,510
I don't think that stress is necessary.
Like who cares?

1823
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,600
What do you mean?
So the stress of worrying about which 

1824
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,200
one to do is not important.
You shouldn't focus on being like,

1825
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:26,201
ah,
should we pick versaclimber today or 

1826
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:26,201
should we add,
it should be,

1827
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:26,990
what's the training outcome we're 
looking for?

1828
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,070
Right?
Oh,

1829
01:16:28,071 --> 01:16:30,590
we're trying to improve your ability to 
repeat maximal,

1830
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:35,030
sustained 15 second intervals with short
rest and all at the same time,

1831
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,240
keeping your breathing mechanics.
Okay,

1832
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:44,140
that's the goal.
Now what modality do we want to use 

1833
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:44,140
today to introduce that insult?

1834
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,140
And so you think the good move would be 
to introduce a bunch of different things

1835
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:50,090
like wild day.
Yeah.

1836
01:16:50,091 --> 01:16:52,430
One day,
do the Kettlebell cardio workout another

1837
01:16:52,431 --> 01:16:57,431
day do the aerosol,
was that air assault bike puts across 

1838
01:16:57,431 --> 01:16:57,830
salt air assault,
punch another day.

1839
01:16:57,831 --> 01:16:59,140
Do a verse climate climber

1840
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,180
as a general quick statement.
Yeah,

1841
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:06,690
absolutely.
But I would say that the smarter 

1842
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:06,690
approach would be to step back and say,
well,

1843
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:07,690
wait a minute.
What's the goal of that workout?

1844
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:11,210
What's the goal of this week,
this camp,

1845
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,210
this fight?
That's where you then that guides you to

1846
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:16,850
make that exercise choice.
So don't like.

1847
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:19,130
You should never choose the exercises 
because you love the exercise.

1848
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:21,200
That's a stupid reason you're getting 
angry.

1849
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,520
Yeah,
it really irritates me.

1850
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,260
No.
Do you measure a resting heart rates,

1851
01:17:26,261 --> 01:17:27,790
body fat,
all that jazz?

1852
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,030
Not really,
no.

1853
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,970
No.
Some folks do it.

1854
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,400
Um,
it's not super important for me that you

1855
01:17:33,401 --> 01:17:38,401
don't feel like it's important in terms 
of finding out whether or not a 

1856
01:17:38,401 --> 01:17:39,070
fighter's overtrained oh,
that's a little bit different question.

1857
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,880
So you can use things like hrv to track 
those things.

1858
01:17:42,881 --> 01:17:44,680
What's that?
A heart rate variability.

1859
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,560
So it'll effectively think of it like a 
heart rate monitor,

1860
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,880
but it's going to look at how so your,
your heart doesn't disco beat,

1861
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:53,710
beat,
beat,

1862
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:54,730
right?
It has variability.

1863
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,560
Beebee Beebee,
Beebee,

1864
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,190
beebee.

1865
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:58,880
Well,
that actually is,

1866
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,580
has some relationship with your 
autonomic nervous system.

1867
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:06,080
So if it's really variable,
you're in a good spot.

1868
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,640
If you lose your variability and it 
becomes

1869
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,140
beat,
beat,

1870
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:10,280
beat,
beat,

1871
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,910
you're actually potentially being 
overtrained.

1872
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,270
So your,
your nervous system is a little bit shot

1873
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:17,830
there.
So you can use those in Joel.

1874
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:19,420
Jamison again has done a ton of this 
work.

1875
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,380
Um,
and you can look at that to,

1876
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,180
to have an idea of whether or not the 
overtrained so you can use that.

1877
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,000
I don't particularly use those things 
for a couple of reasons.

1878
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:33,930
Number one,
I know what's going to happen for the 

1879
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,080
most part over the six weeks,
like as camps going on,

1880
01:18:35,081 --> 01:18:37,210
like it's based on performance,
the coach,

1881
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:42,211
the athlete when I've been around them,
like we planned it out so that this is 

1882
01:18:42,211 --> 01:18:42,610
a,
this is the volume this week,

1883
01:18:42,611 --> 01:18:44,740
this is the volume this week,
this is the volume this week,

1884
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,780
so that we don't get ourselves in those 
situations.

1885
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:49,340
And how do you know how to plan the 
volume out?

1886
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,090
Like say if you got a gun like,
you know,

1887
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,320
fill in the blank.
Chris Weidman comes to you and he wants,

1888
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,000
uh,
wants to train with you.

1889
01:18:56,290 --> 01:19:01,290
He's getting,
preparing for a five round championship 

1890
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,971
fight.
How do you know how much work to give 

1891
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:03,971
him?
Like how do you,

1892
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:03,971
how do you schedule?

1893
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:05,860
So I would never have the arrogance to 
step in and go,

1894
01:19:05,861 --> 01:19:07,030
okay,
this is the volume you're at.

1895
01:19:07,031 --> 01:19:07,800
Chris,
I've never met you.

1896
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,040
Great to meet you,
but here's your volume.

1897
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,620
Like that'd be stupid.
Would you have him come and do a test 

1898
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:17,341
workout for you?
And I wouldn't have a conversation with 

1899
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:19,831
as many as coaches and honestly the 
first time I worked with them for 

1900
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:20,530
something like volume,
I generally would just shut up and watch

1901
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:21,910
and go,
okay,

1902
01:19:21,911 --> 01:19:26,911
like here's,
here's what you're going to tell me you 

1903
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:28,681
did.
So write on a piece of paper what you 

1904
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:28,681
did for the camp,
what's your plan for the camp?

1905
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:31,861
What have you done in the past?
Then I look and we can assess some 

1906
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:32,530
volume and then I can generally tell,
okay,

1907
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:37,950
this is normal for a person of your 
caliber of your aid and your experience 

1908
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:41,401
or like you're way over what's normal,
but I don't know how that lands on you 

1909
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:44,680
and then I watch and as we go along and 
it's conversations continuing going,

1910
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,410
this is happening.
Your other coach told me this,

1911
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,650
you're telling me this is going on blood
working back here,

1912
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:56,650
[inaudible].
I don't know if we're in the right spot 

1913
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:56,650
here and then the second or third camp 
around.

1914
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:57,400
Then I can have a feel and I can go back
at the previous notes and go,

1915
01:19:57,401 --> 01:20:02,401
well,
this is 10 percent higher this year for 

1916
01:20:02,401 --> 01:20:04,740
three more times here I think,
and then I'll always almost always 

1917
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:04,740
matches up with,
yeah,

1918
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,530
I'm feeling terrible,
etc.

1919
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,130
Etc.
What arE your thoughts

1920
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,590
on like plyometrics?
Box jumps,

1921
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:12,010
things on those lines?
Yeah,

1922
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,870
box jumps are generally misused so 
people don't understand,

1923
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:19,590
especially in and crossfit or an mma or 
in wrestling.

1924
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,290
People use crossfit for conditioning for
the most part,

1925
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:27,291
which is fine,
but they don't get the biggest benefit 

1926
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:27,291
out of it,
which is strength,

1927
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:27,930
speed,
powertrain,

1928
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,690
the reactive part of the system,
training muscle spindles,

1929
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,380
so absolutely fine as a modality that 
they don't get that out,

1930
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,090
like how do they.
So for example,

1931
01:20:36,091 --> 01:20:37,320
someone does a box jump in,
they're like,

1932
01:20:37,321 --> 01:20:38,160
okay,
box jumps,

1933
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:43,161
I Want to get better power my legs,
so they'll go and do like a bar for five

1934
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:46,500
rounds and then I'll go do 100 box jumps
as fast as I can.

1935
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:50,220
You're not getting any faster like that.
You just getting more tired.

1936
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:55,290
That will not improve your power at all.
It won't know because you're not jumping

1937
01:20:55,291 --> 01:21:00,291
halfassed,
you're actually jumping at a very sub 

1938
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:00,870
max speed the whole time because you're 
already fatigued.

1939
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,610
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

1940
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,980
So if you want to use those for power 
now,

1941
01:21:04,981 --> 01:21:07,500
if you're using it for conditioning,
fine,

1942
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:13,460
no problem,
but if you're using it for the sake of 

1943
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:13,460
improving your foot speed or your power,
your strength,

1944
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,610
or your explosiveness,
you should be west rep.

1945
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,660
Well rested.
Yes,

1946
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,760
yes.
One to three reps take a break,

1947
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:22,970
etc.
What do you think of like that strong 

1948
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,281
first protocol?
Do you know the pavel tatsu lean idea 

1949
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:28,140
that you know he.
He feels that strength is.

1950
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:30,210
It's along the same sort of lines.
What you're talking about.

1951
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,430
The strength is essentially a skill.
Oh,

1952
01:21:32,431 --> 01:21:37,431
absolutely.
You should not be doing things to 

1953
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:40,371
failure.
That the best way to do it in his 

1954
01:21:40,371 --> 01:21:40,920
estimation,
is to do more sets with more,

1955
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,130
more break in between them.
That is very strength one-on-one.

1956
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:51,590
Like you'd have a hard time for a true 
strength person disagreeing with a lot 

1957
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,590
of that.

1958
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,550
It's hard to get stronger when you're 
tired,

1959
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:59,150
so going to failure is not as now I've 
talked to a bunch of people about this 

1960
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:04,521
that have started doing this recently,
like within the last year or two and 

1961
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:07,530
they've all experienced great results 
and that the idea being that you used to

1962
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:12,531
go to failure and then he'd be wrecked 
for like three or four days instead of 

1963
01:22:12,531 --> 01:22:16,821
that,
like say if you could do 10 reps or 

1964
01:22:16,821 --> 01:22:16,821
something,
you do five and then you take a big rest

1965
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:19,950
and then you do five again and he took a
big risk and then you wind up.

1966
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:24,951
Instead of doing 15 reps,
you wind up doing like 30 over the 

1967
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:27,360
course of an hour and a half and then 
you're fine the next day.

1968
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:29,930
Well,
I mean you had lujan simmons,

1969
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,200
right?
Yeah.

1970
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,750
This is classic fucking maniac.
That guy.

1971
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,000
He was awesome.
I love that guy.

1972
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,850
I always tell my kids,
my students to google him Because you're

1973
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:40,350
not going to get like an.
I could get bored.

1974
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:41,970
Oh,
listen to my podcast with him.

1975
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:44,160
It's one of the most entertaining things
I've ever heard in my life.

1976
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:46,180
He's such a character.
The basic idea.

1977
01:22:46,181 --> 01:22:51,181
Um,
well we'll have to back up for a quick 

1978
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:51,181
second.
It depends on the goal,

1979
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:51,181
right?
Strength.

1980
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:54,840
If gold pure strength is the goal,
failure also has to be defined.

1981
01:22:54,841 --> 01:22:56,610
So what do you mean by failure?
Now?

1982
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:58,360
My family because of fatigue,
right?

1983
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,850
Then he's totally right.
Right?

1984
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,410
Am I failing though?
Because the two heavy.

1985
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,240
Well you do want to go to that failure 
for strength.

1986
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,980
I also though,
so need to at some

1987
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,330
point pick up something that you can't 
pick up or really close to camp.

1988
01:23:09,331 --> 01:23:11,560
Pick up to get stronger.
Really close to it.

1989
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:13,930
Like you can do,
right?

1990
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,750
But you can't do a second one.
Put it down.

1991
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:21,780
Or maybe you could do two,
but you can do three or something like 

1992
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:21,780
that.
The,

1993
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,470
the very textbook answer is anything 
below five repetitions ish is going to 

1994
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:28,060
be good for strength to the maximum.
Anything more than five is bodybuilding.

1995
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:29,550
That's what paul says.
He,

1996
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:31,420
that's the.
That's pretty dead on.

1997
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,220
I mean he's not too wrong there.
And we're like,

1998
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:34,930
well,
a reason I brought louie up his,

1999
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,190
his,
his classic.

2000
01:23:36,191 --> 01:23:39,250
We're saying first reps,
so if you did three sets of 10,

2001
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:43,210
right?
Well you had three first repetitions,

2002
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,540
right?
So you had three reps that you did after

2003
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,750
rest,
but if you did 10 sets at three,

2004
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,130
now you have 10 for strips.
Oh,

2005
01:23:54,131 --> 01:23:55,360
interesting.
That's right.

2006
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:57,130
So now you did the same total 
repetitions,

2007
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,530
but 10 of them were done after full 
rest,

2008
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:01,600
which means you're gonna have more power
and more force.

2009
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,880
Does that make sense?
That it seemed smarter.

2010
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:04,840
That's basically it.

2011
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,450
So you're better off doing 10 threes,
then three,

2012
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:10,390
10 for strength for strength or power or
speed.

2013
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:15,420
And then taking a big break in between 
them is sort of counterintuitive to a 

2014
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:15,420
lot of people.
They feel like,

2015
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:19,891
oh,
I don't want to be a pussy and then let 

2016
01:24:19,891 --> 01:24:20,570
myself get fully recovered.
I want to push while I'm still at.

2017
01:24:20,571 --> 01:24:21,490
Come on,
come on,

2018
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:21,980
broke.
Right?

2019
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,670
And they'll help you up.
Come on,

2020
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,420
come on,
come on.

2021
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:28,270
Yeah,
I see that all the time.

2022
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,390
Meat heads in the gym and they think 
that's the way to go.

2023
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:32,050
And I'm like,
man,

2024
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:32,800
I don't know.

2025
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,500
And they're gonna.
Well,

2026
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:38,501
they're gonna.
It's the way to go if they want to get 

2027
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:38,501
sore,
if they want to maybe prove awesome.

2028
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:39,230
Do that though.
They love to walk around sore.

2029
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:43,430
You know what's funny?
This is like the number one reason I got

2030
01:24:43,431 --> 01:24:46,460
into mma was that that question,
like right there,

2031
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,590
people kept coming to me with this and 
I'm like,

2032
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:53,710
you don't know basics of speed training 
or strength training and the mma guys 

2033
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:53,710
were so wrong,
and then I.

2034
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,730
That's how I got into this for the most 
part is people are like,

2035
01:24:55,731 --> 01:24:57,680
oh my god,
this is changing like everything.

2036
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:57,870
I'm like,

2037
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,140
well,
mma training is.

2038
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:02,870
It's weird.
It's really strange because mma training

2039
01:25:02,871 --> 01:25:05,750
is essentially.
It's still in its infancy,

2040
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:10,960
right?
It really didn't even exist until 1993 

2041
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,500
and then it didn't even really exist 
even then until like.

2042
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:18,910
I feel like frank shamrock was the first
real professional mma fighter because he

2043
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:24,401
was the first guy to figure out that you
have to be an insane cardio and he was 

2044
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:27,400
the first guy to be able to strike and 
also be able to grappled,

2045
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:32,420
be able to fight off of his back and 
piece it all together and the cardio is 

2046
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:33,530
was.
It was a huge factor,

2047
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:34,280
you know,
he,

2048
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:36,080
he was like,
when he beat tito ortiz,

2049
01:25:36,081 --> 01:25:39,530
it was way smaller than tito,
but he beat them because of cardio.

2050
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:44,980
But one of the things that I used to see
early on that was so confusing to me 

2051
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:49,421
because I came from a striking 
background was how many of these guys 

2052
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:52,780
were willing to beat the fuck out of 
each other in the gym and like that they

2053
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:57,781
were just going to war but not even 
going to war with like good skills,

2054
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:01,070
like going to war while they were 
learning for the sake of war.

2055
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:01,730
Yeah.
I mean,

2056
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,010
I mean I'm watching them getting and 
they're

2057
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,850
beating the shit.
I'm like,

2058
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:08,030
you guys are professionals.
Like this isn't like,

2059
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,360
this isn't like some idiots.
At the y like you guys are,

2060
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:14,930
you're supposed to be pros like you 
could have damage yourself.

2061
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,700
The takes years off of your career.
The vast majority of you know me working

2062
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:24,650
with athletes is doing these very,
very basic things like I'm not.

2063
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,300
I'm asking not.
The guru was like,

2064
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:27,050
oh,
I know the,

2065
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,480
the 18 point blood tests and we're going
to get these.

2066
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:32,360
The vast majority of what I do is go,
oh,

2067
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:33,380
okay.
I see the problem here.

2068
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,660
Oh,
we need to do this basic thing.

2069
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,000
Right.
You haven't eaten a vegetable in a week.

2070
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:41,180
Got it.
Like that as not as much anymore,

2071
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,650
but I used to really?
Yeah.

2072
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:48,010
We get a lot of the pro athlete that 
doesn't eat vegetables we get is 

2073
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:51,401
honestly it's because probably 
[inaudible] assholes like you and they 

2074
01:26:51,401 --> 01:26:51,401
want your show or something.

2075
01:26:51,401 --> 01:26:52,970
I tell people to eat vegetables all the 
time.

2076
01:26:52,971 --> 01:26:53,240
No,
they.

2077
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,530
When they watched this and then like,
okay,

2078
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:59,531
they'll come at me with a thousand 
really weird nutrition questions or 

2079
01:26:59,531 --> 01:27:03,111
something.
A really weird advanced training ones 

2080
01:27:03,111 --> 01:27:04,961
because I went to a seminar or something
and I'm like back the train up like 

2081
01:27:04,961 --> 01:27:07,760
you're sparring six times a week.
We've got a whole nother conversation,

2082
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:08,030
like,
oh,

2083
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:09,020
we don't do that.
No,

2084
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,010
that's not normal.
Really?

2085
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:10,970
No.
Okay.

2086
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:14,000
Or you're doing that or you're running 
35 miles a week.

2087
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:19,690
Got it.
That's the vast majority of what I do 

2088
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,421
is,
is bring this guy's back to life and go 

2089
01:27:22,421 --> 01:27:24,191
like,
let me help you sift through all this 

2090
01:27:24,191 --> 01:27:26,440
internet stuff that's really complicated
and let's take what's actually good and 

2091
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:30,401
bad and dial in a very usable system.
So I think people just get overwhelmed 

2092
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:32,150
with options for me internet.

2093
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:37,150
absolutely.
Because too many people get on exposure 

2094
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:38,840
and get on shows or platforms and they 
try to make sure that,

2095
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,450
that they are known as the guy that 
knows something different.

2096
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,950
Right,
right,

2097
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:43,390
right.
Well,

2098
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,050
it's like it's not very exciting if I 
come up here and tell you like,

2099
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,430
oh,
joel has pros and cons to everything.

2100
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,170
Great.
Like,

2101
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:49,910
well that's not fun,
but it's good.

2102
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:55,300
I mean,
I think what you're saying is very 

2103
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:55,300
important for people to hear,
like the no wait,

2104
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,200
they get bogged down in the details,
way too much if things that really don't

2105
01:27:57,201 --> 01:28:02,201
matter,
your body's not that sensitive or 

2106
01:28:02,201 --> 01:28:04,471
sensitive enough where it can't convert 
something from from something to 

2107
01:28:04,471 --> 01:28:05,390
something else and if it needs it,
it will do that for the most part.

2108
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:08,390
So there are some real small things at 
the end,

2109
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:13,391
but a lot of what we can do is just get 
you on a reasonable program that's 

2110
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:18,400
actually possible for you to implement 
and that doesn't drive you so crazy or 

2111
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,050
so is so difficult and so confusing for 
you that you get halfway into it.

2112
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,430
You abandoned it and then you want to 
start over.

2113
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,300
Well,
you know,

2114
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:26,570
I always think about dan gable and when 
dan gable was young,

2115
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:32,480
I pretty much outworked anybody and he 
was just an unbelievable savage when it 

2116
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,940
came to his training and then that 
manifested itself in the competition.

2117
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:39,941
He was just like,
the momentum behind him because of his 

2118
01:28:39,941 --> 01:28:42,731
roof was training was so intense,
but now he can't even walk right.

2119
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,830
When these hips are gone,
his knees or guns got artificial,

2120
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:46,640
everything,
you know,

2121
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:51,670
he's just fucked up because of it.
And soMe guys were willing to MAke that 

2122
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:51,670
sacrifice.
But is that,

2123
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:53,870
here's the question,
is that sacrifice necessary?

2124
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:59,380
Like can you be too tough versus smart 
in your training?

2125
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,340
It's impossible to say,
right?

2126
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,520
Because like you said,
that here's where it gets so tricky is 

2127
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,191
physiology versus psychology.
So if that gave him that extra mental 

2128
01:29:10,191 --> 01:29:12,240
confidence that he needed to perform 
better,

2129
01:29:12,241 --> 01:29:14,310
well then it's hard to say that it 
wasn't necessary.

2130
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:16,530
Yeah.
Like he was always talking about guys on

2131
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:21,531
steroids that he liked competing against
guys on steroids because he knew they 

2132
01:29:21,531 --> 01:29:21,531
were mentally weak and they would break.
Right?

2133
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:23,310
So who the hell knows?
Right.

2134
01:29:23,311 --> 01:29:25,690
Like you've got,
you have all this conflicting stuff and,

2135
01:29:25,691 --> 01:29:27,300
and you try to do this dance,
which is why again,

2136
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:32,301
you need People,
you need a team to do this stuff and 

2137
01:29:32,301 --> 01:29:32,301
say,
okay,

2138
01:29:32,301 --> 01:29:35,481
this is what I think.
So people have a really hard time with 

2139
01:29:35,481 --> 01:29:38,840
physiological truth or scientific truth 
and implementation.

2140
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,110
so a very easy one.
Sugar,

2141
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:48,980
right now,
like I don't know anyone in the world 

2142
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:48,980
who advocates adding sugar to your diet.

2143
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,460
It's a good thing like no one's gonna 
say that.

2144
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,520
Right,
but what you tell somebody a scientific 

2145
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,671
truth versus what the message you spread
it spread to either your athletes are a 

2146
01:29:58,671 --> 01:30:01,911
bunch of people that can be very,
very different because because of 

2147
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:03,420
unintended applications are 
consequences.

2148
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:08,690
So for example,
there is no physiological harm with 

2149
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:08,690
sugar.
It's not bad for you in any way,

2150
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:14,300
but as a message to the general public,
that's not the worst thing to say.

2151
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:20,870
And so most of the fighting that goes 
back and forth between any conversation 

2152
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:20,940
like this is people saying,
yeah,

2153
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:21,270
yeah,
yeah.

2154
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:23,580
But the actual effect of it is good.
Yeah,

2155
01:30:23,581 --> 01:30:28,581
but the science is wrong and they're not
conceding that they're actually talking 

2156
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:29,010
past each other far more than they're 
talking to.

2157
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,810
You don't think that sugar is bad for 
you?

2158
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,950
No,
it can't be.

2159
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,980
It can't be unless implementation.

2160
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:35,660
No,
no,

2161
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:35,790
no,
no,

2162
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,250
no,
no.

2163
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,260
what he's saying.
So now we've.

2164
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:39,240
Okay,
so sugar in your diet.

2165
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,510
No.
Sugars is where it gets confusing.

2166
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,900
Exactly.
Because you want to break down sugar,

2167
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:48,210
having sugar in your diet,
like eating sugary foods and snacks,

2168
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,540
having an excess of sugar has dire 
health consequence.

2169
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:52,680
Totally correct,
absolutely.

2170
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:55,950
But there's a key word you said there 
which was excess excess.

2171
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,920
Okay,
so like meaning a piece of fruit,

2172
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:01,410
like a nectarine not bad for you at all.
No,

2173
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,280
of course.
Good for you.

2174
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,930
And plus fiber.
Absolutely.

2175
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:05,760
Yeah.
But processed sugar,

2176
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:10,170
whether it's removed from that fiber and
put into a cocacola dot becomes an issue

2177
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,860
because of concentration issue because 
now you can consume that a concentration

2178
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:17,580
that probably wouldn't happen normally.
And quantities that would never happen.

2179
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:22,581
Normally thing go.
So now you could have a person in the 

2180
01:31:22,581 --> 01:31:22,680
corner of left who that says like,
no,

2181
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:23,220
you're an idiot.

2182
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:26,340
Look at the science says sugar is not 
bad for you for a thousand reasons.

2183
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:31,250
And they're technically right.
But when we have conversations to $350,

2184
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:36,251
million americans,
they don't want all that detail in 

2185
01:31:36,251 --> 01:31:36,251
between.
They want do,

2186
01:31:36,251 --> 01:31:38,790
do I do it or do I not?
And so if I have to take a hard line and

2187
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:39,300
I go,
you know what?

2188
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:40,560
Sugar is bad,
don't eat it.

2189
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:44,250
It actually causes a generally good 
effect on people.

2190
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:44,700
They go,
oh,

2191
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:45,750
okay.
I didn't know this.

2192
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,920
Adding sugar to my stuff is not good.
Don't do it right.

2193
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:53,300
Which is a net good thing.
Although technically individually it's 

2194
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,720
not true.
I see what you're saying.

2195
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:59,930
So sugar in and of itself is not bad.
excess sugar and processed sugar

2196
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:05,220
and added sugar in mass quantities is 
bad and that's what you're dealing with 

2197
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,680
with the average american diet,
whether it's through breads or pastas or

2198
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:10,120
actually sugar and soda itself,

2199
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:13,030
right?
or sucrose or are or any of those things

2200
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:15,420
and added to it.
And so when people go,

2201
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:17,740
the poor souls go on the internet and 
they're trying to figure out like,

2202
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:18,080
wow,
god,

2203
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,530
are carbs bad for me or not?
It's like,

2204
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:25,531
well,
you're fighting over stuff that's not 

2205
01:32:25,531 --> 01:32:27,751
important and we're missing the message 
because people want real answers and 

2206
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:30,380
you're not helping them give it to them 
anyway.

2207
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,560
I don't care if it makes you look right 
on the internet.

2208
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,840
We need to come together and say,
okay,

2209
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:37,450
well here's good,
here's bad and bad and here are the pros

2210
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:38,290
and cons,
etc.

2211
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:43,340
now here's the information for you folks
and it doesn't matter whose book it is 

2212
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:43,870
or who wrote it,
like that's not the important part.

2213
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:48,910
Well even having this conversation 
though is going to be really confusing 

2214
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:52,211
to a lot of people because you're,
you're talking about so many different 

2215
01:32:52,211 --> 01:32:55,001
variables in by your being 
intellectually honest about all this 

2216
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:55,710
stuff and saying,
well it's,

2217
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,920
you know,
there's no real good answer.

2218
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,700
Yeah.
You know,

2219
01:32:58,701 --> 01:33:00,830
and it's different for one person is for
another person.

2220
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:05,831
Some,
some people might get over really well 

2221
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,430
on like macadamia nuts and almonds and 
get their protein from,

2222
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,540
you know,
and other people they might actually had

2223
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:11,630
an allergy to those things.

2224
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:12,560
Yeah.
And you know,

2225
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:17,580
trust me and tried to be my students.
They get irritated this shit when I do 

2226
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:17,580
this to him,
but it's probably

2227
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:21,890
good thing.
But when a fighter in particular is 

2228
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:24,651
thinking about their career,
they sort of exist in these six week to 

2229
01:33:24,651 --> 01:33:27,060
eight week lifespans like their whole 
life.

2230
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:32,090
Unfortunately,
or fortunately when it works out well 

2231
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:34,050
that they go through these,
ruth was training camps

2232
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:39,160
and to have any variability had to have 
any unknown to have any.

2233
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:45,010
So this is bringing up a good point.
This is not a kind of conversation I 

2234
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:45,890
would have with a fighter,
right?

2235
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:51,190
Not during,
not specially 10 weeks out from a fight 

2236
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:51,190
overload their brain with possibility.
No,

2237
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:51,190
no,
no,

2238
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:52,100
no.
It is very clear.

2239
01:33:52,101 --> 01:33:53,390
Like what do you do?
What do you like to do?

2240
01:33:53,391 --> 01:33:55,430
What do you hate to do?
What have you done before,

2241
01:33:55,431 --> 01:33:56,270
what's worked well,
et cetera.

2242
01:33:56,271 --> 01:33:57,300
Okay.
Uh,

2243
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,430
so,
uh,

2244
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:02,060
I have an analogy called the cook,
the baker and the chef.

2245
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:07,900
I give you the very quick story of it.
You can listen to the whole episode on 

2246
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,270
my podcast if you want.
What's the podcast called?

2247
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:10,020
The body of knowledge.
Okay.

2248
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,340
So it's on itunes,
all that stuff,

2249
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,170
all that stuff.
Body knowledge.com.

2250
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:20,640
It's,
it's actually a not to talk about that 

2251
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:20,640
too much is only nine episodes.

2252
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,690
It's not like going on running podcasts.
it's like radio lab dan carlin,

2253
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:27,740
but for physiology and finishing.
So not to that extent,

2254
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:28,830
but you get that here.
Yeah.

2255
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:33,850
Okay.
So I like to look at people as either 

2256
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:34,490
the easy one is either a baker or a 
cook,

2257
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:40,060
right?
So do you know what the difference 

2258
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:40,060
between baking and cooking is?
No.

2259
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:40,060
Cool.
most people don't.

2260
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,200
Baking is chemistry basically,
right?

2261
01:34:42,201 --> 01:34:45,020
You can't.
Like I'm a little tablespoon here.

2262
01:34:45,021 --> 01:34:46,190
Maybe a teaspoon.
Baking soda,

2263
01:34:46,191 --> 01:34:47,340
baking powder house,
same thing.

2264
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,610
That does not work.
You can't bake like that.

2265
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,060
Right?
You will not make anything.

2266
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,770
You would have a mesh of crap.
And an oven baking is chemistry.

2267
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:59,771
You can do this in this order and,
and then you add this and you cannot do 

2268
01:34:59,771 --> 01:34:59,771
these.
And other orders.

2269
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:03,620
It's very specific.
like roughly cooking is like,

2270
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:04,790
well all right,
well what's left?

2271
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:06,140
I get some oil.
It gets some hot.

2272
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,160
Kind of dicey.
Yeah.

2273
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,310
Throat throw some whatever you give them
mishmash,

2274
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:15,311
right?
So people generally I find work well 

2275
01:35:15,311 --> 01:35:16,760
with nutrition information,
either one of two approaches.

2276
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:18,440
So if I said,
joe,

2277
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:20,900
I'm going to do a nutrition program for 
you for the next six months,

2278
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:22,760
whatever you want.
And I said,

2279
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:24,860
you can either do this one of two ways,
uh,

2280
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:30,070
we can work together every morning,
weigh every single thing you eat on the 

2281
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,070
scale,
text it to me,

2282
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:32,990
I'll tell you exactly how many slices of
avocado to have,

2283
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:38,440
how many jalapenos,
and I'd tell you exact weights and 

2284
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,021
volumes for everything.
Or we can maybe text once a day or once 

2285
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:41,990
a week and we would just go over 
concepts and ideas.

2286
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:43,520
Here's what we're trying to get to do 
what you want.

2287
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,220
Which would you like,
man,

2288
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:47,690
I don't know.

2289
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,550
What should I look?
It's not a should.

2290
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:52,580
It's a personal preference.
So some people would.

2291
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:55,130
I cook,
just wants ideas,

2292
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,740
give me the concepts,
like one or two things to work through.

2293
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:59,180
Cool.
I don't,

2294
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:04,190
I get anxiety with all those rules.
All the information like I can 

2295
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:04,910
implemented.
Like it's too complicated.

2296
01:36:04,911 --> 01:36:06,830
I don't have that much time,
et cetera.

2297
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:07,970
I called these people,
cooks,

2298
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,420
other people get anxiety.
Like my wife natasha,

2299
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:14,750
when I don't give her exact numbers,
she's like,

2300
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,670
well,
is six grams for the eight almonds or is

2301
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:17,240
it nine?
Almost like,

2302
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:18,230
what is it?
Right?

2303
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:23,210
So giving people the information in the 
way that they absorb it is important.

2304
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:26,660
So if you talk to a baker,
so chemistry details,

2305
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:29,930
weighing everything out and I go are 
just,

2306
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:31,520
here's what I want to do,
a little bit of fat,

2307
01:36:31,521 --> 01:36:32,810
a little bit of protein,
some grains,

2308
01:36:32,811 --> 01:36:34,640
and it's not going to work for them.

2309
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,300
You have to give them a very,
very specific system.

2310
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:42,500
Having a cup of this tablespoon of that,
even if that system isn't perfect.

2311
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,560
What about chef?
So chef is someone who knows the 

2312
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,521
chemistry of baking,
but has the years of experience of 

2313
01:36:51,521 --> 01:36:54,791
mixing it in different ways.
Now you can go ahead and break those 

2314
01:36:54,791 --> 01:36:54,850
rules,
right?

2315
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:56,480
Chefs break camp,
cooking result of time.

2316
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:59,660
Baking roles.
So a chef was like anderson silva.

2317
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:00,740
well,
a fighting.

2318
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:01,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

2319
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:04,520
But a chef would be maybe where you're 
at in nutrition,

2320
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:06,110
where you like,
I can do that.

2321
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:11,111
I could follow a very Specific diet,
but I know the concept and I know these 

2322
01:37:11,111 --> 01:37:11,111
rules.
Let me experiment here.

2323
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:16,510
And you have room to maneuver.
The problem is most people want to jump 

2324
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:17,330
in and be chefs.
People want to fight like anderson silva

2325
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,000
their first day and you get overwhelmed.

2326
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:24,070
I see what you're saying,
so get a detailed understanding about 

2327
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:27,971
how your body functions under very 
specific protocols and then start 

2328
01:37:27,971 --> 01:37:28,580
fucking around with it.
Or the opposite.

2329
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:30,440
Start off with a cook approach was to 
say,

2330
01:37:30,441 --> 01:37:32,690
let's give me.
Let me give you one or two concepts this

2331
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:37,690
week.
I want you to eat one fresh green every 

2332
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:38,480
day and I want you to do make sure you 
have protein every time you eat.

2333
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,640
That's it.
My only role.

2334
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:42,170
Okay,
next week we had a rule.

2335
01:37:42,171 --> 01:37:47,171
maybe we got another concept,
and as you get better and you get more 

2336
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:47,780
confidence and you get more comfortable,
you can go,

2337
01:37:47,781 --> 01:37:49,040
okay,
well how much protein?

2338
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:50,070
Exactly.
Well,

2339
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:51,620
let's just try a hundred grams.
All right,

2340
01:37:51,621 --> 01:37:56,010
well that's a that unless they're 150 
and we've slowly pushed you,

2341
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:01,430
but generally being a baker,
all those rules weighing everything 

2342
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:02,280
generally that's not sustainable for 
most people.

2343
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:09,030
now when you coach,
do you coach them as far as their diet 

2344
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:12,351
goes?
Do do you actually tell them what they 

2345
01:38:12,351 --> 01:38:12,351
shouldn't need?
Depends on if they're a cook or a baker.

2346
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:14,550
So a cook.
I do not.

2347
01:38:14,551 --> 01:38:16,920
I tell them basic concepts.
Right?

2348
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:19,050
So I talked to them how,
what's going to be helpful for them?

2349
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,130
They go,
what you think I should do.

2350
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:22,980
Should I add more carbs or shit out?
Here's what I'm feeling when I'm.

2351
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,840
I'll go.
All right.

2352
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:25,050
Where were you at?
Like here's our diet.

2353
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:26,490
Yeah,
let's add more carbs.

2354
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:27,840
How should I do this or this?
Uh,

2355
01:38:27,841 --> 01:38:32,841
this one.
Do you generally tell people to avoid 

2356
01:38:32,841 --> 01:38:35,571
any specific foods or are there any 
things that interrupt training or get 

2357
01:38:35,571 --> 01:38:38,070
into the way outside of the obvious?

2358
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,760
No,
no,

2359
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:39,960
I mean the basics.
Candy,

2360
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:40,840
pizza,
right?

2361
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:46,190
Not really,
unless we have some very specific 

2362
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:49,221
history with them that hey,
remember you don't react well when this 

2363
01:38:49,221 --> 01:38:49,221
happens.
Um,

2364
01:38:49,221 --> 01:38:50,520
but generally,
I don't know.

2365
01:38:50,521 --> 01:38:55,521
When you say like protein,
do you specify fish or chicken or meat 

2366
01:38:55,521 --> 01:38:57,110
or fits a cook?
No.

2367
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,230
No?
If it's a baker,

2368
01:38:58,231 --> 01:38:59,700
absolutely.
Absolutely.

2369
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:03,960
And whether it's important that I chose 
fish or chicken almost doesn't matter as

2370
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,930
much as telling them that the fact that 
they all go,

2371
01:39:06,931 --> 01:39:07,950
he's got it dialed for me.
Credit,

2372
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:11,130
I got a sense that you have here eight 
ounces of halibut.

2373
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:12,300
There it is.
Bam,

2374
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:13,650
right?
Because you'd be like,

2375
01:39:13,651 --> 01:39:18,651
the vast majority of the ones I work 
with are already pretty good with their 

2376
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:20,010
nutrition and it's really more concepts.
Um,

2377
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,950
some of them would want the stress 
relief telling them what to eat and they

2378
01:39:22,951 --> 01:39:24,370
want someone to come in and hey,
like,

2379
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,740
do you know anyone that would come in 
and food prep,

2380
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,810
meal prep for me and yeah,
okay,

2381
01:39:27,811 --> 01:39:28,320
we can do that.

2382
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:29,790
Um,
but some of them like it,

2383
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:32,400
some of it is their distress.
Some of them like that control.

2384
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:34,440
So I try to help them.
Again,

2385
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:37,800
it's not about me.
I don't care if my system worked.

2386
01:39:37,801 --> 01:39:40,050
I don't have a system.
My system is what do you want to do?

2387
01:39:40,051 --> 01:39:42,180
How can I help you and your team?
What can we do?

2388
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,390
That's the approach.
Wow.

2389
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,070
God,
that seems so.

2390
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:52,360
It's,
there's so many variables and it's so 

2391
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:52,360
complex,
which is why I get so irritated you,

2392
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,420
you're teasing me earlier,
bucketing all fired up about it.

2393
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,760
I could understand,
but I appreciate this intellectual 

2394
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,981
honesty about these variables and about 
how there is not one approach because 

2395
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:07,080
again,
there's so many dickheads out there that

2396
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:10,770
are teaching their method in air quotes,
so here we go.

2397
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:12,120
Let's take those dickheads.
Right?

2398
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:15,830
If you're a baker,
landing on one of those systems is going

2399
01:40:15,831 --> 01:40:20,831
to be fantastic for you and you're going
to five star review and you're going to 

2400
01:40:20,831 --> 01:40:23,510
try it out everybody because you're a 
baker and you needed a system.

2401
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,420
Yeah,
and if,

2402
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,830
if you're a cook though,
you're going like,

2403
01:40:25,831 --> 01:40:26,850
well,
who cares?

2404
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:28,530
And if a scientist could step in and go 
like,

2405
01:40:28,531 --> 01:40:31,170
well those are all the problems and this
and this and this and this,

2406
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,820
and then everyone's fighting back and 
forth.

2407
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:33,390
They were like,
well fuck.

2408
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:38,391
Do.
I guess though he felt like I'm so 

2409
01:40:38,391 --> 01:40:38,391
confused.
Well,

2410
01:40:38,391 --> 01:40:40,620
it's not the right question.
I think what irritates a lot of people's

2411
01:40:40,621 --> 01:40:45,621
at some people are finding like this 
insecurity that people have and they're 

2412
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:52,101
exploiting it by telling them exactly 
what they think is right.

2413
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,950
It's human,
right?

2414
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:54,070
We

2415
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,290
want the next solution.
We want all this stuff.

2416
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:58,390
We want it all dialed into one.
It's a,

2417
01:40:58,391 --> 01:41:03,391
I call it fallacy of unicorn.
Like I'm just gonna keep searching 

2418
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:03,880
because there's.
There's this one thing and if I fix that

2419
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:05,580
one thing,
everything else align up.

2420
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,350
It doesn't work like that.
Yeah.

2421
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:13,530
Now what about vegetables?
Like do you specify the type of 

2422
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:13,690
vegetables you like?
Do you prefer a dark,

2423
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:18,691
leafy green vegetables,
general statement beats or the more 

2424
01:41:18,691 --> 01:41:18,691
color,
the more texture.

2425
01:41:18,691 --> 01:41:19,420
The bedroom.
Right,

2426
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:22,450
and like you said actually earlier,
it's the variety that matters.

2427
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:25,060
What these folks as sustainable.
Now having said that,

2428
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:28,420
here's what I'll do outside of camp.
These are conversations we're having,

2429
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:31,660
like I want as many different vegetables
as you possibly can,

2430
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,280
different colors,
different countries,

2431
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:35,530
different seasons,
all this stuff,

2432
01:41:35,531 --> 01:41:36,040
right?
Let's,

2433
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,110
let's cook them sometimes.
Let's steam them.

2434
01:41:38,111 --> 01:41:39,790
Let's eat them fresh,
let's eat them raw.

2435
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,460
There's pros and cons.
Exactly.

2436
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:48,210
Oh,
now you got to fight in four weeks and 

2437
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:48,820
we're 25 pounds overweight.
Sometimes I will take those options away

2438
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:51,730
because it's easy.
Then to control numbers.

2439
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,170
If I say,
okay,

2440
01:41:53,171 --> 01:41:55,240
here's the approach,
you're going to have a,

2441
01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:00,280
b and c at these three meals every day.
Every other day we'll rotate.

2442
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:05,640
Then I've just removed a bunch of 
variables from there and they can just 

2443
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:05,640
refocus and go,
okay,

2444
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,190
boom,
and we can watch the weight.

2445
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:08,350
We're down to half a pound,
we're down half a pound down a quarter,

2446
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:13,351
pound were great.
Let's maybe exchange out kale for 

2447
01:42:13,351 --> 01:42:16,261
spanish this time or something,
but the hard part about extreme 

2448
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:19,411
variability is lack of control and so 
sometimes if you're like,

2449
01:42:19,691 --> 01:42:20,860
why am I mean not anything you're 
telling me,

2450
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:22,660
I'm meeting a bunch of different stuff 
and I'm not losing weight.

2451
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:25,140
Well,
maybe they don't understand yet,

2452
01:42:25,141 --> 01:42:28,120
but this type of vegetable has a lot 
more calories in this type of vegetable,

2453
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:31,270
so we're getting really high up in your 
numbers or when you eat this,

2454
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:34,240
the way you prep it,
the way you like it is glaringly dense,

2455
01:42:34,241 --> 01:42:37,630
so I will reduce options for them.

2456
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:42,680
So it was funny because if you looked at
one of mine nutrition programs for my 

2457
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,050
athlete,
you could look at it and be like,

2458
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,040
oh,
this guy's an idiot.

2459
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:46,240
He doesn't have this,
this,

2460
01:42:46,241 --> 01:42:46,780
this,
and this.

2461
01:42:46,781 --> 01:42:48,100
You stupid.
He doesn't have any of this.

2462
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:49,360
And you're like,
dummy.

2463
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,060
You think that that three day plan is 
what we did the whole year round.

2464
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:53,680
Your argument is someone who's not even 
real.

2465
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:58,060
They're real you of all people know the 
real.

2466
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:00,360
What about water?
No,

2467
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:03,010
I've always wanted to ask somebody this.
I hope you know the answer.

2468
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:07,000
This is all these,
these ways to treat water,

2469
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:09,740
alkaline water on bullshit,
right?

2470
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:10,810
Mostly.
Yeah,

2471
01:43:10,811 --> 01:43:12,100
I would assume so,
yeah.

2472
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:14,230
We actually did a study on that six 
weeks alkaline.

2473
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:17,260
What does it mean?
Like what the fuck is alkaline water?

2474
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:20,670
That's ph right?
So it's the opposite of acid or alkaline

2475
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,140
is the base,
but I mean,

2476
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,950
how do they make the water that way?

2477
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:25,240
Like what are they doing to it?
Oh,

2478
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:28,210
so generally water comes a probably a 
little bit acidic,

2479
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,040
especially our tap water.
Uh,

2480
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:33,850
and so I would imagine they just do some
sort of combination of salt or d salting

2481
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:37,810
pretty easy chemistry wise.
So to get it a little bit technical,

2482
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:39,820
but just,
I think it's salt to your water.

2483
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,230
I think somebody did,
um,

2484
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:46,500
actually did a study of a bunch of those
alkaline waters and tested them in the 

2485
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:50,041
store,
like bonding different brands and they 

2486
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:50,041
were all over the place.
I said,

2487
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:50,041
eddie wise.
Yeah,

2488
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:51,190
I would imagine that we're not even 
close to alkaline,

2489
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:56,260
but just remember it's going to change 
and it sits on the shelf when it's 

2490
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:57,680
exposed to sunlight and all that crap.
I call it holy water.

2491
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:58,950
Yeah.
It's kind of silly.

2492
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,400
I always feel like,
oh yeah,

2493
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:02,450
that's the blessed water.

2494
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:03,320
Like,
come on man,

2495
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:04,430
it's fucking water.
I mean,

2496
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:04,820
dude,
look,

2497
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:09,890
I'm open.
If studies came out and we kept doing 

2498
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:09,890
it,
we're like,

2499
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:09,890
oh shit.
There's something here,

2500
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:11,550
but there no studies currently before 
with friends.

2501
01:44:11,551 --> 01:44:13,160
I'd be like,
that's not a sense that stupid.

2502
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:18,100
I mean a punch of things.
The training mask is training masks.

2503
01:44:18,101 --> 01:44:19,540
Yeah,
absolutely is good.

2504
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:21,140
Well,
it's not good or bad.

2505
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,120
It depends on what you use it for.
How dare you.

2506
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:24,440
Yeah.
I needed an answer.

2507
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,580
I'll give you an answer.
Okay.

2508
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:28,790
So what I'd like to do is give examples 
of,

2509
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,200
of when good one bed.
Right.

2510
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:33,350
And this is a brian mackenzie.
I keep bringing him up,

2511
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,660
but he taught me this lesson.
This is a great lesson in humility.

2512
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:37,070
Uh,
so he's,

2513
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:37,880
uh,
if you don't know him,

2514
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:42,881
he's a,
he was really disruptive in the running 

2515
01:44:42,881 --> 01:44:42,881
community and the movement.

2516
01:44:42,881 --> 01:44:42,881
He's,
he came up,

2517
01:44:42,881 --> 01:44:43,400
kelly started at like,
that came up together.

2518
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,750
Okay.
Um,

2519
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,780
so I wasn't interested in him.
People kept getting at me like,

2520
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:48,680
hey,
go look at his stuff.

2521
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:49,270
And I'm like,
well,

2522
01:44:49,271 --> 01:44:51,680
he's a crossfit coach out like 
nonchalant,

2523
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,660
like crossfit coach.
I have nothing against that.

2524
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:56,690
but at the time I was like,
what does crossfit coach?

2525
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:57,760
No,
right.

2526
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:58,820
Again,
arrogance on my part,

2527
01:44:58,821 --> 01:45:00,140
mistake and second,
I'm like,

2528
01:45:00,141 --> 01:45:02,460
you're running coach,
like I'm doubling on uninterrupted.

2529
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,040
Yeah.
Again,

2530
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:06,380
this is me highlighting my mistakes.
And so,

2531
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:08,200
but then I actually,
funny enough,

2532
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,510
paid attention to what he was saying and
it turns out there was something there.

2533
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:16,540
So it's funny how much you hated someone
when you don't actually listen or read 

2534
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:16,790
their stuff.
So,

2535
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,880
uh,
he was promoting the training mask and 

2536
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:21,880
I'm like,
you know,

2537
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:21,880
like everyone else,
I'm like,

2538
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:22,070
does it work evidence so it doesn't 
work,

2539
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:22,520
et cetera,
et cetera,

2540
01:45:22,521 --> 01:45:23,030
et cetera.

2541
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:26,090
And then I listened to what he was,
how he was actually using it,

2542
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:31,720
so he wasn't using it to simulate 
altitude because that's not really 

2543
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:35,081
effective,
but he was using it to teach people how 

2544
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:35,480
to use their diaphragm.
And that's when I was like,

2545
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,960
oh,
I get it here.

2546
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:42,230
So I'll come back and I'll finish this 
in.

2547
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:46,910
But the quick analogy here would be if I
handed you a pen and said,

2548
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,380
you know,
like does this pen work?

2549
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,750
Well,
it may not work as a dagger,

2550
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:56,260
but it worked pretty good as a pen.
So the problem with the mask was it's 

2551
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:59,651
flipped,
it didn't work for what it was told you 

2552
01:45:59,651 --> 01:46:00,020
to work for,
but it worked because in this case,

2553
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:05,320
the active restricting people's 
breathing sometime can help them learn 

2554
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:08,801
to use their diaphragm.
People who breathe with their shoulders 

2555
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:11,741
up and they don't use their stomach and 
their diaphragm a lot when you put one 

2556
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:13,610
in front of their face,
they don't have that option.

2557
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:16,370
And so they learned to breathe their 
belly and user diaphragm.

2558
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:22,400
Interesting.
And so I just didn't give him the time 

2559
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:22,400
of day because I'm like,
training mass doesn't work,

2560
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:22,400
elevation,
et cetera,

2561
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:22,860
et cetera,
et cetera.

2562
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,440
Right?
Oh,

2563
01:46:24,441 --> 01:46:29,441
that's not how you were using it.
What's the benefit of breathing through 

2564
01:46:29,441 --> 01:46:32,440
the diaphragm with a mask on?
It's not the mask that's important is 

2565
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:36,491
the fact that it would use.
It's a quick way to identify if you're 

2566
01:46:36,491 --> 01:46:39,050
bringing this.
So you figured out it's like a white 

2567
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,390
belt boss route and has some sort of a 
breathing device.

2568
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:42,780
And he,
um,

2569
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,750
he was telling me about some studies 
that they did with it was showed.

2570
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:47,840
Was it you?
That was mine.

2571
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:48,650
Oh,
beautiful.

2572
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,350
My lab,
well,

2573
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:54,360
what he was saying is that what makes 
his better is that it's easy to breathe 

2574
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:58,380
out the valve open so you can exhale 
really good dump your carbon dioxide.

2575
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,130
Whereas other ones that have just 
smaller holes are not as good.

2576
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:04,170
So we did that study.
Oh,

2577
01:47:04,171 --> 01:47:09,171
okay.
And this is actually what turned me on 

2578
01:47:09,171 --> 01:47:12,170
to brian initially because I'm like,
my boss came to me with the o two 

2579
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:12,170
trainer.
I was like,

2580
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:14,520
like this stuff doesn't work bro.
It turns out it does.

2581
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:17,160
But here's a good example.
Um,

2582
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:22,560
so his device restricts airflow in,
but you can change the setting so it can

2583
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:25,080
be a lot of restriction or a little bit 
of restriction.

2584
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:29,370
He has lIke filters that you put on it.
So right there boss route and yeah,

2585
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:31,740
the o two trainer.
Exactly.

2586
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:36,910
Uh,
so all those little valves on the left 

2587
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:36,910
and right hand side,
they're thick.

2588
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:37,220
TheY have increased airflow or decrease 
airflow.

2589
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:42,230
So what we did is we had people come in 
four times and they either got the 

2590
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:42,840
height restriction,
low restriction,

2591
01:47:42,841 --> 01:47:44,340
medium restriction or no restriction.

2592
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:49,860
And what we saw is in every person under
one of those,

2593
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,670
sorry,
let me back up.

2594
01:47:50,890 --> 01:47:55,890
They came in and either they did some 
breathing drills like blowing it out,

2595
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:58,290
inhaling as hard as they can,
blowing it out.

2596
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:02,550
And they did that 30 times and then they
did basically a vo two max test.

2597
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:07,610
So they ran to exhaustion which took 
them five to eight minutes kind of 

2598
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:10,251
thing.
So we want to see like I was interested 

2599
01:48:10,251 --> 01:48:12,771
in performance,
like does this actually make me perform 

2600
01:48:12,771 --> 01:48:15,351
better?
And so they either got a lot of 

2601
01:48:15,351 --> 01:48:15,351
restriction,
a little restriction medium or none.

2602
01:48:15,351 --> 01:48:17,610
Every single person got substantially 
better,

2603
01:48:17,611 --> 01:48:21,480
like 20 to 30 percent better under one 
of the conditions,

2604
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:25,080
but they also got worse under one of the
conditions as well.

2605
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:29,820
So what that told us was this,
if for example,

2606
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:34,410
you went under the high restriction,
so you're like you can't get any aaron.

2607
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:39,890
It actually fatigued your intercostals,
which are the muscles between your ribs 

2608
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:42,570
that open up your ribs and allow airflow
in the diaphragm.

2609
01:48:42,571 --> 01:48:45,180
and those got fatigued.
So when you did your performance,

2610
01:48:45,181 --> 01:48:46,920
you got slower because you were already 
gassed.

2611
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:53,220
But if you had really strong 
intercostals the lower,

2612
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:58,550
so the real open valve wasn't enough 
resistance to actually caused those 

2613
01:48:58,550 --> 01:49:01,710
muscles to warm up.
So that didn't help your performance.

2614
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:07,490
So what we found is my point here 
basically is the individualization of 

2615
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:08,220
the approach here is really,
really important.

2616
01:49:08,221 --> 01:49:09,780
So there's something there for all of 
us,

2617
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:12,690
but you're going to have to titrate out.
You might need heavy,

2618
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:17,990
you might need light,
you might need middle and one of those 

2619
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:17,990
situations might actually make it worse 
for you.

2620
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:23,330
So the,
the individual variability is the 

2621
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:24,981
important point there.
How would You figure out which one you 

2622
01:49:24,981 --> 01:49:27,261
needed a performance test and what kind 
of performance sets would use in this 

2623
01:49:27,261 --> 01:49:27,261
project?

2624
01:49:27,261 --> 01:49:31,850
You can do anything.
You can say I'm going to run a mile and 

2625
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:33,561
a half and recording my time and put 
that thing in your mouth as you're 

2626
01:49:33,561 --> 01:49:34,200
running or as your.
As your warmup as your warm.

2627
01:49:34,201 --> 01:49:39,201
Yeah.
So you sit there and you put it in your 

2628
01:49:39,201 --> 01:49:39,201
mouth and you do you just.
So you only use it to do drills.

2629
01:49:39,201 --> 01:49:42,420
You don'T necessarily use it to actually
work out the vast majority of the time.

2630
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:45,300
That's what I recommend.
You could do it in your workout,

2631
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:48,160
um,
but it would be for different reasons.

2632
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,830
So when you do it,
what would you recommend doing?

2633
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,810
Like say,
say if I got an o two trainer,

2634
01:49:52,811 --> 01:49:57,811
I've put it in like what kind of 
workouts am I doing with this thing in 

2635
01:49:57,811 --> 01:49:57,811
my mouth?
What am I?

2636
01:49:57,811 --> 01:49:58,120
Or breathing exercises.
And again,

2637
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:03,300
you're going to hate this,
probably some of your fans getting 

2638
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:05,341
irritated by now,
but it depends on the goal of the 

2639
01:50:05,341 --> 01:50:05,341
workout.

2640
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:08,920
So if the goal of the workout is to get 
the best score possible,

2641
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:14,010
right,
then you do probably 30 or 40 breaths 

2642
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:15,340
with the optimal resistance feel great.
Okay.

2643
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:20,430
But at the point of the workout is to 
actually improve the strength of the 

2644
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:24,990
diaphragm and go then you,
then you put yourself in sub optimal 

2645
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:28,231
positions.
It's right back to what I said at the 

2646
01:50:28,231 --> 01:50:29,631
beginning,
adapting or optimizing a different 

2647
01:50:29,631 --> 01:50:29,800
thing.
So the muscles in between the ribs,

2648
01:50:29,801 --> 01:50:31,590
can you actually strengthen those to the
point where.

2649
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,090
I mean that's a huge issue with guys 
getting injured.

2650
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:36,370
Absolutely.
You can strengthen those with that o two

2651
01:50:36,371 --> 01:50:41,371
trainer with.
That's one mechanism that you can do it 

2652
01:50:41,371 --> 01:50:42,400
a bunch of different ways.
We have done a.

2653
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:44,620
You've had,
you've had wim hof on,

2654
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:44,800
right?
Yeah,

2655
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:49,840
sure.
So I've been working with for couple of 

2656
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:49,930
years now,
so doing initial stuff with him and it's

2657
01:50:49,931 --> 01:50:54,931
very clear like we,
we can mess with a lot of different 

2658
01:50:54,931 --> 01:50:56,110
breathing protocols and get you a lot of
immediate and delayed.

2659
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,110
sorry brian,
one more time.

2660
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:04,660
Uh,
he had his conversation with jon jones 

2661
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:05,640
on wednesday before the fight.
First time that ever met someone,

2662
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:10,650
put them in contact.
Brian put them through some of these 

2663
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:12,601
breathing protocols.
As soon as they hung up the phone or as 

2664
01:51:12,601 --> 01:51:12,601
soon as they are done,
don was like,

2665
01:51:12,601 --> 01:51:12,730
hey,
will you fly down here on saturday?

2666
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,980
Flew them down that day.
Had I'm in his corner,

2667
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:19,981
walked him all the way down,
was right next to probably you and dana 

2668
01:51:19,981 --> 01:51:22,840
are when he's doing all the things.
So like this is how impactful some of 

2669
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:23,380
these breathing things aren't.
Our women's was great to get us started.

2670
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:26,980
Bosses device was awesome,
the train master work work concepts,

2671
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:32,400
but now brian has really evolved and 
developed and said actually there's a 

2672
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,580
bunch of different ways we can do it and
he has protocols you're going to have to

2673
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:35,200
ask him,
but he is the one that can say like,

2674
01:51:35,201 --> 01:51:40,201
do this for this thing to exactly this 
way for this thing and you this 

2675
01:51:40,201 --> 01:51:40,201
adaptation,
you want this effect.

2676
01:51:40,201 --> 01:51:41,020
Wow.
He has it all dialed in.

2677
01:51:41,230 --> 01:51:46,230
I go to a cryo chamber cryotherapy place
where you put a surgical mask on your 

2678
01:51:47,261 --> 01:51:50,920
mom's and your whole body's immersed.
It's not just a below the neck.

2679
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:51,540
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2680
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:56,560
Have you seen those?
And when I use the wim hof breathing 

2681
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:00,031
method,
it's almost like somebody made it 50 

2682
01:52:00,031 --> 01:52:00,031
degrees warmer.
It's ways.

2683
01:52:00,031 --> 01:52:04,000
And I just got back from montauk.
I spent three days and jumping a nice 

2684
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
bass the whole time out there.
Uh,

2685
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:09,120
but we actually have multiple protocols.
So that's more akin to what some would 

2686
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:10,150
call the breath of fire.
Is this when you're with dennis said.

2687
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,100
Yeah,
we were at an event out there with laird

2688
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:14,110
hamilton and and those folks will brian 
also,

2689
01:52:14,111 --> 01:52:19,111
they layered and gabby and brian 
vocabularies and laird hamilton started 

2690
01:52:19,111 --> 01:52:22,561
a company called xpt that kind of puts a
lot of this lifestyle stuff into 

2691
01:52:22,561 --> 01:52:24,070
practice and so they put on these live 
events.

2692
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:29,100
They also sent me some of their new 
super food stuff that they add to the 

2693
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:29,840
creamer stuff.
It's really good.

2694
01:52:29,841 --> 01:52:31,000
It's amazing.
Yeah,

2695
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,370
it's a little espresso based powder plus
super star.

2696
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,460
I like it.
It's fantastic.

2697
01:52:36,461 --> 01:52:37,030
yeah.
Um,

2698
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:40,690
so I've been working with for a couple 
of years,

2699
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,310
um,
since they got started,

2700
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:45,290
but we go out there,
we do these things and so we can say,

2701
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,390
okay,
we'll get you through the breath of fire

2702
01:52:47,391 --> 01:52:50,060
protocol and you'll feel like,
wow,

2703
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:55,180
you get hot and get warmed up.
There's other ways we can do it that'll 

2704
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:55,180
bring you back down where you're like,
yeah,

2705
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:55,850
I'm gonna.
Take a nap.

2706
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,950
There's euphoria ones where you can get 
like,

2707
01:52:57,951 --> 01:53:02,951
wow,
I feel like I'm on psychedelics right 

2708
01:53:02,951 --> 01:53:03,140
now.
I'm super high tropic breathing,

2709
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:06,320
bunch of apnea stuff.
I'm pranayama stuff.

2710
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:10,220
All of these things can have different 
outcomes depending on,

2711
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:11,420
on what you're looking for.

2712
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:17,650
So they have.
Brian has got the system developed now 

2713
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:17,650
we're like,
it's,

2714
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:17,880
that's what he did was john the first 
one he did,

2715
01:53:17,881 --> 01:53:19,280
um,
it was like 10:00

2716
01:53:19,281 --> 01:53:20,260
at night and he's like,
all right,

2717
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:21,800
let me relax you to kind of bring it 
down.

2718
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:22,850
He's like,
oh,

2719
01:53:22,851 --> 01:53:23,750
this is amazing.
But then he's like,

2720
01:53:23,751 --> 01:53:25,060
actually got to go train right now.
He's like,

2721
01:53:25,061 --> 01:53:26,290
can you give me back up?
it's a garden.

2722
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,580
Let's go back the other way.
Sort of backup.

2723
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:34,650
So is there any benefit stuff too?
I'm using those breathing techniques 

2724
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,150
versus an o two trainer or is it 
different situations?

2725
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:39,590
Exactly.
Its situation based.

2726
01:53:39,591 --> 01:53:44,591
There's things I like.
So you mentioned what boss says of the 

2727
01:53:44,591 --> 01:53:47,741
opening valve at the end of the o two 
trainer and allows you to dump out 

2728
01:53:47,741 --> 01:53:47,741
carbon dioxide.
Okay.

2729
01:53:47,741 --> 01:53:49,220
The training masks for example,
wouldn't.

2730
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:51,560
Right?
So it's not right or wrong,

2731
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:54,050
it's just depending on what you're 
looking to do,

2732
01:53:54,051 --> 01:53:59,051
because one thing you can train your 
body to do is how well do you perform 

2733
01:53:59,051 --> 01:54:00,380
when you generated a bunch of carbon 
dioxide.

2734
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:04,010
So carbon dioxide is what actually makes
you feel like you want to breathe,

2735
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,990
right?
It's not lack of oxygen,

2736
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:07,070
right?
Right.

2737
01:54:07,071 --> 01:54:12,071
So I can put you in a situation where 
you get a bunch of carbon dioxide build 

2738
01:54:12,071 --> 01:54:16,331
up and if I don't let you dump it,
then you're going to fatigue a lot 

2739
01:54:16,331 --> 01:54:17,990
faster.
but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

2740
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:20,720
You could learn to then deal with a lot 
of fatigue,

2741
01:54:20,770 --> 01:54:25,770
deer with it mentally,
psychologically as well as 

2742
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:25,880
physiologically there's going to be 
adaptations.

2743
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:29,570
So because of the fact that your body 
has more carbon dioxide in the system,

2744
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:34,980
you,
your body adapts to process that carbon 

2745
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:37,571
dioxide more efficiently.
This would be the assumption like you 

2746
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:37,571
have to be scientifically shown.
Oh,

2747
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:38,380
but this is,
you know,

2748
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,370
where we were.
This is the thought process.

2749
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:43,130
You can feel this intuitively.
You're like,

2750
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:43,810
wow.
Um,

2751
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:46,580
and it's also a way for us to get a lot 
of training volume in,

2752
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:52,100
or sorry,
a lot of cardiovascular training in 

2753
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:52,730
because your heart rate goes way up 
without actually doing a lot of physical

2754
01:54:52,731 --> 01:54:53,150
work.

2755
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:56,750
And so for mma guys,
this is what we're looking for sometimes

2756
01:54:56,751 --> 01:55:01,751
because of physical work and their 
training camps so high we can't add any 

2757
01:55:01,751 --> 01:55:02,120
more volume to them is going to beat 
them up.

2758
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:04,970
SO now we can get them a cardiovascular 
workout in.

2759
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:07,490
That's easy on the joints and ligaments 
and the bones.

2760
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:13,510
So the other approach would be dump all 
the ceo two or do other things like 

2761
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:16,520
nasal breathing only.
So the whole workout you're only allowed

2762
01:55:16,521 --> 01:55:18,980
to breathe through your nose.
When you breathe through your nose,

2763
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:23,060
It actually can release nitric oxide,
which is a basal dilator.

2764
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:25,670
So this is why when you,
only,

2765
01:55:25,671 --> 01:55:27,320
when you breathe through your nose,
not only,

2766
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,180
but especially when you breathe through 
your nose,

2767
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:34,660
huh?
Why does your body produce more nitric 

2768
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:34,660
oxide when you breathe through your 
nose?

2769
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,530
I don't know.
I don't know.

2770
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:39,290
That's weird because you would think 
that just breathing wim hoff.

2771
01:55:39,290 --> 01:55:42,790
I was asking him like,
just anywhere.

2772
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,060
Yeah,
he always says like any hole,

2773
01:55:45,061 --> 01:55:46,550
I don't care.
Um,

2774
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:49,590
but again,
women's not wrong or anything like that,

2775
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:54,591
but a whimsy style is great,
but there's many styles is the point I 

2776
01:55:54,871 --> 01:55:56,490
guess.
Like he'S great.

2777
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:59,430
We've done some science stuff together,
but how do you feel about saunas?

2778
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:03,090
Same thing,
amazing benefits their potential,

2779
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:06,210
but there's no free passes and 
physiology.

2780
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:09,010
So when you get something,
you're probably coming to the compromise

2781
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:11,250
that something else.
What would the compromise be when you do

2782
01:56:11,251 --> 01:56:14,820
a sauna to know we just don't have 
enough evidence on this stuff.

2783
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:16,950
We know we focused on the heat shock 
proteins.

2784
01:56:16,951 --> 01:56:18,930
That's like everyone knows about those 
by now.

2785
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:23,450
Um,
the ability to deal with a uncomfort,

2786
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,320
fatigue,
like there's a lot of stuff.

2787
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:27,990
The difficult is when you run a 
scientific study,

2788
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:29,640
you get one or two or three variables.

2789
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,320
You don't get a thousand,
right?

2790
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:34,050
So we focused on the one or two that 
you're like,

2791
01:56:34,051 --> 01:56:35,610
wow,
this is moving something here.

2792
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:41,840
But I mean,
just like the example we went over with 

2793
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:41,840
the cold,
it's like,

2794
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:41,840
wow,
yeah,

2795
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:42,360
it's great for this.
Or actually it's terrible.

2796
01:56:42,361 --> 01:56:47,361
And people say no,
they want to make blanket statements 

2797
01:56:47,361 --> 01:56:47,361
like heats,
good or cold is good or bad.

2798
01:56:47,361 --> 01:56:48,180
Well,
as we study it more,

2799
01:56:48,181 --> 01:56:53,181
we start to finding out,
well actually it's good for this and 

2800
01:56:53,181 --> 01:56:53,181
it's good for this and it's bad for that
and that and that and that.

2801
01:56:53,181 --> 01:56:54,930
So we'd have to assume someone would be 
the same way.

2802
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,560
There has to be consequences to it.
It just depends on application.

2803
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,250
But there's gotta be some sort of 
benefits in terms of recovery.

2804
01:57:02,251 --> 01:57:07,251
Right.
So do you think that someone should do 

2805
01:57:07,251 --> 01:57:07,600
maybe like cryo one day sauna,
the neck?

2806
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,410
Should they do them in the same day?
Like so for example,

2807
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:15,470
a fighter in camp,
I generally don't go out of my way to 

2808
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:15,470
recommend sauna because they already get
really hot and training.

2809
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:17,970
You're grappling,
especially if they're doing stuff,

2810
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,000
they're getting heat shock protein.
I don't want to go to hot yoga in 

2811
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,571
particular.
There's this study they're doing right 

2812
01:57:26,571 --> 01:57:26,571
now at harvard apparently,
uh,

2813
01:57:26,571 --> 01:57:27,630
somebody was telling me about it the 
other day where they're,

2814
01:57:27,631 --> 01:57:32,631
uh,
they're concentrating on hot yoga and 

2815
01:57:32,631 --> 01:57:32,970
the benefits of hot yoga and heat shock 
proteins.

2816
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:38,020
Yeah.
I'm sure they're gonna find a lot like 

2817
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:38,020
that.
That's pretty.

2818
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:38,820
I mean that ship's sailed a little bit.
Like we're,

2819
01:57:38,821 --> 01:57:40,890
we're confident something.
There's a lot of detail to workout,

2820
01:57:40,891 --> 01:57:43,580
but something's going on there.
probably something similar to sauna.

2821
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:48,360
So I generally say for people like you 
and like me,

2822
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:52,650
I don't go out of my way to do too much 
sauna work because of the way I train.

2823
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:57,680
I get really hot and sometimes we'll 
train specifically with a little bit 

2824
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:58,590
more clothing sometimes and get kind of 
like,

2825
01:57:58,591 --> 01:58:03,591
well,
instead of sitting in a sauna for 45 

2826
01:58:03,591 --> 01:58:05,091
minutes,
let me wear a little bit extra clothing 

2827
01:58:05,091 --> 01:58:05,091
during my training session and get real 
hot dr.

2828
01:58:05,091 --> 01:58:09,210
But for the average people,
I think it's a fantastic modality 

2829
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:11,010
because there may be only working out 
once a week or less,

2830
01:58:11,490 --> 01:58:13,200
and you gave,
you can get them hot and we can actually

2831
01:58:13,201 --> 01:58:17,940
work on those health benefits.
While we're building good quality habits

2832
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:20,530
and we can eventually lead them down the
path to more exercise.

2833
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:22,790
And emmanuel stewart,
he used to run the crump.

2834
01:58:22,791 --> 01:58:23,880
Jim,
um,

2835
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:27,300
he used to crank the temperature of the 
gym over 100 degrees.

2836
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:32,500
that was his thing,
like he wanted guys to box like in 

2837
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:32,940
essentially like a hot yoga room.
Well,

2838
01:58:32,941 --> 01:58:36,660
there's a couple of things too that I've
done a lot of that in my life and I used

2839
01:58:36,661 --> 01:58:37,110
to hate it.

2840
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:42,530
We used to just fight for the door,
like wait for the round to go over 

2841
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:42,530
wrestling,
wrestling practice theory.

2842
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:44,710
So it really has to mma with it all the 
time.

2843
01:58:44,711 --> 01:58:47,680
And like the problem was it was scary 
because the floor is water.

2844
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:48,850
Oh yeah.
And you're like,

2845
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,700
I'm not kicking,
like,

2846
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,490
you're terrified.
That's not good.

2847
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,900
He was awful.
I hated it.

2848
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:55,150
That's real bad for kicking.
Skip those practices.

2849
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:57,240
A logical.
Um,

2850
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,970
but so example,
uh,

2851
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:01,750
I don't think that's particularly 
needed.

2852
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:05,020
What the exception of one time when pat 
comes fought in Brazil,

2853
01:59:05,021 --> 01:59:08,080
it was like 110 outside and it was 80 
percent humidity or something.

2854
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:09,500
Which fight was a,
uh,

2855
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:11,230
it was,
um,

2856
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:13,950
uh,
yeah,

2857
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:14,920
I remember that.
Was that fight?

2858
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,180
It was outdoors,
I think.

2859
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:17,560
No,
it was indoors,

2860
01:59:17,561 --> 01:59:19,180
but if everything was open,
oh,

2861
01:59:19,181 --> 01:59:21,040
that's what it was.
So super,

2862
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:26,041
super hot.
Now we didn't train for that or 

2863
01:59:26,041 --> 01:59:28,051
anticipate that,
but you could see if you knew you're 

2864
01:59:28,051 --> 01:59:28,051
fighting in a venue like that.

2865
01:59:28,051 --> 01:59:32,260
I'm like,
what they used to do in bodog and Costa 

2866
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:32,260
Rica and like,
oh yeah,

2867
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:32,260
they would fight on the beach dot.
Yeah,

2868
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:33,490
right.
Just horrid outside.

2869
01:59:33,491 --> 01:59:34,600
So you could say like,
well,

2870
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:36,070
in that situation,
maybe it's needed,

2871
01:59:36,071 --> 01:59:41,071
but you're fighting in vegas or 
something indoors and maybe we don't 

2872
01:59:41,321 --> 01:59:42,830
need it for that.
Right.

2873
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:45,730
But that doesn't mean you couldn't 
implement it once or twice.

2874
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:48,250
I wouldn't go on my way to do it though.
right?

2875
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:50,510
So it wouldn't be a daily thing.
No,

2876
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:54,250
because what's gonna happen is you're 
going to compromise performance.

2877
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:59,730
A pacing is a real problem.
Bisping's a great example of this to 

2878
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:01,180
dennis was a bunch of people.
If you fight an environment like that,

2879
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:06,480
your pace and the amount of output you 
can do is going to slow way down in the 

2880
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:06,480
gym,
right?

2881
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:11,450
It can be hot,
you're to gas out and then when you go 

2882
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:11,450
to fight and your fight and it's 
temperature controlled,

2883
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,270
you're not used to that pace.

2884
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:16,900
So if you're used to fighting at the 
pace that it takes for you to sustain 10

2885
02:00:16,901 --> 02:00:21,901
rounds of sparring and the gym at 100,
10 degrees and then we come in and you 

2886
02:00:21,901 --> 02:00:21,901
and I fight and I'm ready to go with 
this.

2887
02:00:21,901 --> 02:00:26,580
You're not ready for that pace.
So it's not that you don't physically 

2888
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:26,580
have the conditioning,
but you're just like,

2889
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,950
oh man,
I'm just not skies and you know,

2890
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:33,960
you don't feel right.
So you have to be careful of training 

2891
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:33,960
too far outside of what you're actually 
gonna encounter.

2892
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:34,990
Um,
which is,

2893
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:40,010
you know,
some of these guys run into those 

2894
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:41,131
problems when they do.
I'm going to spar 10 rounds so that I 

2895
02:00:41,131 --> 02:00:41,131
can go five easy.
Yeah.

2896
02:00:41,131 --> 02:00:45,570
Yeah.
But your pace for your five is way 

2897
02:00:45,570 --> 02:00:47,761
different than your pastry or 10.
So you have to be careful there a lot of

2898
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:49,930
questions,
man,

2899
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:50,740
physiology,
dude,

2900
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:52,360
that,
that is part of the problem,

2901
02:00:52,361 --> 02:00:52,720
right?

2902
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:57,720
That there are so many variables.
There are so many questions that there 

2903
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:57,720
is no real definitive protocol to 
follow.

2904
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:59,170
No,
it was a bunch of different ones.

2905
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:04,200
The pursuit,
the way I always say it is the truth is 

2906
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:08,611
mostly a lack of perspective.
So when you think that you are on some 

2907
02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:13,770
unbreakable truth,
it's because you haven't looked at it 

2908
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:15,340
from a big enough perspective for the 
most part.

2909
02:01:15,390 --> 02:01:16,100
Right?
Right.

2910
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:21,300
And there's some,
I'll put it this way and I'm in 

2911
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:24,340
biological truth.
That's almost always true in physics.

2912
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:27,550
Truth of that's a lot less true.
Like we're pretty sure gravity is real,

2913
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:30,060
like we're pretty sure and we can 
mechanically,

2914
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,780
water's good for you.
Pretty sure.

2915
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:34,460
Uh,
now quantum mechanic physically,

2916
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:35,710
those get kind of weird.
Right?

2917
02:01:35,711 --> 02:01:40,711
But for the most part that is true.
But science in terms of biological or 

2918
02:01:40,711 --> 02:01:42,350
medical is a lot less true.

2919
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:44,270
I mean how many times we have to see 
that,

2920
02:01:44,271 --> 02:01:45,320
where it's like,
this is true,

2921
02:01:45,321 --> 02:01:46,760
this is true for 50 years.
Oops.

2922
02:01:46,761 --> 02:01:49,040
It's not,
is this all fun for you,

2923
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:49,640
do you.
I mean,

2924
02:01:49,641 --> 02:01:51,560
it seems like you're very passionate 
about it,

2925
02:01:51,561 --> 02:01:53,840
but I mean it's,
it also seems like wow,

2926
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:58,100
it can become stressful having so many 
variables and possibilities and I don't,

2927
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:59,810
I don't think stress is even close.
It's,

2928
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:04,870
I would say 99 percent fun.
Like it's stress for me in terms of I 

2929
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:06,620
don't want.
I like it would break my heart if I gave

2930
02:02:06,621 --> 02:02:08,300
someone the wrong advice and it ruined 
their career.

2931
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:13,060
Like that would be the stress stress in 
terms of being right or like saying that

2932
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:15,080
much some stuff and being proved I don't
care about that at all.

2933
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:20,470
Yeah.
That it's an issue with a lot of 

2934
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:20,470
trainers.
Right?

2935
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:20,470
Were they given bad advice and.

2936
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:22,460
Yeah.
You see it play out in a fight.

2937
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:27,670
I mean one of the reasons I.
I used to do a lot of professional 

2938
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:31,001
athletes in other sports or because 
other ones I gave that almost up 

2939
02:02:31,001 --> 02:02:34,571
entirely and I gave up.
I've done some actors and things like 

2940
02:02:34,571 --> 02:02:34,571
that,
but I generally stay away from that.

2941
02:02:34,571 --> 02:02:38,240
Even though the money is far,
far higher for me and those things,

2942
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:41,690
but I did it because like these mma 
folks,

2943
02:02:41,691 --> 02:02:46,691
like I have a real passion for someone 
who's going to put all that on the line 

2944
02:02:46,691 --> 02:02:50,380
and they're going to risk everything and
they're going to go out there and that 

2945
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:50,690
is more exciting to me and I'm like,
that's a fun,

2946
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:54,560
a really fun investment in me and it and
it's worth me investing my emotion.

2947
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,170
I mean,
when helen won a golden reel,

2948
02:02:57,171 --> 02:02:58,190
like I just lost it.

2949
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:00,710
Like emotionally I was like gone for 
weeks,

2950
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:03,740
like just exhausted because I invested 
so much into that.

2951
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:08,741
I don't want to do that for somebody so 
that they can make an extra million on 

2952
02:03:08,741 --> 02:03:09,500
top of that 30 million.
Like it doesn't motivate me that much.

2953
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:12,560
So I like working with these folks and 
so because of that,

2954
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:13,840
like it breaks my heart.
If you're like,

2955
02:03:13,870 --> 02:03:18,870
man,
you gave up everything for this kind of 

2956
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:20,750
living and the best outcome for you was 
that you made 20 instead of 10 k and 

2957
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:26,830
then I lost that for you because I gave 
you really bad rehydration advice for 

2958
02:03:26,830 --> 02:03:28,970
something that's a stress for me,
but the rest of the stuff man,

2959
02:03:28,971 --> 02:03:33,971
like it's fun.
It's invigorating for me to continue to 

2960
02:03:33,971 --> 02:03:33,971
be like,
well we,

2961
02:03:33,971 --> 02:03:36,560
we answered that,
but now we don't know this oR this.

2962
02:03:36,561 --> 02:03:41,561
Like it's continual progress and and by 
like I take karl popper stance on this 

2963
02:03:41,561 --> 02:03:45,170
one in terms of like science is not 
about identifying truth.

2964
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:49,400
It's reducing uncertainty.
That's a good way to put it.

2965
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:50,630
That's all it is.
Right?

2966
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:53,030
I wish I could take credit for it.
It's a good way to put it.

2967
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:55,880
So we just,
we get closer and we know more of,

2968
02:03:55,881 --> 02:04:00,881
okay,
we know this is not as an but we're 

2969
02:04:00,881 --> 02:04:00,881
still.
Do you anticipate a day when we do,

2970
02:04:00,881 --> 02:04:05,320
like when it comes to bio mechanics are 
there are some things that I would be 

2971
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,640
confident in saying like basically we 
know that this is true,

2972
02:04:07,641 --> 02:04:11,510
now you need to drink water,
like basically say that that's true.

2973
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:13,170
Uh,
we need to have a lot of it,

2974
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:18,580
like the verY standard stuff.
Then those are things I'm comfortable 

2975
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:19,310
saying this is basically true and as we 
go on,

2976
02:04:19,311 --> 02:04:22,850
we only keep adding to that list.
SO more things get piled on.

2977
02:04:22,851 --> 02:04:26,660
Now we know for a.
I had told this story also on my podcast

2978
02:04:26,661 --> 02:04:30,770
about the history of strength 
conditioning and how it went from the 19

2979
02:04:30,771 --> 02:04:31,940
hundreds to where it is now.

2980
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:38,020
And the quick story is,
there was a guy named peter [inaudible] 

2981
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:38,670
who was a scientist and he was 
extremely,

2982
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:43,671
he was the guy who started the idea that
lifting weights causes you to lose 

2983
02:04:43,671 --> 02:04:45,720
flexibility and a,
it's bad for your health and,

2984
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:46,650
and all these things,
right?

2985
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,760
This is 1950 2:54,
something like that.

2986
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:54,720
And he's a scientist phd and he calls it
a guy.

2987
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:57,360
He gets a guy named bob hoffman is 
called in,

2988
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:59,880
do you remember bob hoffman year from 
the generation?

2989
02:04:59,881 --> 02:05:03,750
You may remember york barbell muscle and
strength,

2990
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:06,960
like the magazine.
You may recognize all this stuff,

2991
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:10,440
but basically there was a show and I 
said,

2992
02:05:10,441 --> 02:05:11,890
bring in this,
these weightlifters,

2993
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:13,380
because back then weightlifting,
powerlifting,

2994
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:14,820
bodybuilding was all kinda the same 
thing,

2995
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:18,390
is it bring them in and let's put on a 
demonstration.

2996
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:23,600
And so they bring in all these lifters 
and they put on this demonstration in 

2997
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,540
front of the whole school in front of 
dr.

2998
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,300
Carpet,
kitchen.

2999
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:28,620
And uh,
everyone's like,

3000
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:29,160
cool.
They're great.

3001
02:05:29,161 --> 02:05:32,010
They're strong enough athletic and 
everyone knoWs like the showdowns coming

3002
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:34,500
like everyone's there to watch the show,
but everyone is really there to watch,

3003
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:36,000
like the,
just like they are on the internet now.

3004
02:05:36,001 --> 02:05:38,040
It's like let's watch this shit show 
afterwards.

3005
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:43,310
Right?
So everyone's done and carpet stands up 

3006
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:43,320
and he's like,
that's great,

3007
02:05:43,321 --> 02:05:45,420
you're strong and you got a lot of 
muscle and all that.

3008
02:05:45,421 --> 02:05:47,100
But um,
let me ask you a question,

3009
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:50,490
can you scratch your back?
I think I was like,

3010
02:05:50,491 --> 02:05:53,610
sure.
You know where at like what,

3011
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:58,840
where,
and he starts scratching both land and 

3012
02:05:58,840 --> 02:05:58,840
everywhere.
What he wants to do,

3013
02:05:58,840 --> 02:05:58,840
what do you want me to do?
Drops into a full splits,

3014
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:03,650
grabs 50 pound dumbbells,
does a standing back flip and at this 

3015
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:04,050
point carpets is like,
oh,

3016
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:08,100
like my entire career is that strength 
training is bad for you.

3017
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:10,620
It's unhealthy.
You lose flexibility and these dudes the

3018
02:06:10,621 --> 02:06:13,470
strongest in the world just showed up.
Not only are they not inflexible,

3019
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:17,130
but they just did a splits there.
Bodybuilders ring world champions.

3020
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:20,360
So he was at a crossroads right there in
his career to say like,

3021
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:25,430
do I admit in front the whole world 
about how wrong my entire research line 

3022
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:26,840
was?
Or do I find some excuse?

3023
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:28,560
Well you that.
Well,

3024
02:06:28,561 --> 02:06:30,900
he does the,
the honorable thing and goes,

3025
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:36,470
I'm sorry I'm wrong.
And change his entire career research 

3026
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:40,131
going on to actually studying three 
training and of course shows that 

3027
02:06:40,131 --> 02:06:40,950
doesn't do any of these things.
We do.

3028
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:46,820
So this is the nature of science is 
we're mostly wrong until we actually 

3029
02:06:47,311 --> 02:06:49,590
study and then we get less than,
less than this wrong.

3030
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:51,960
So that's really where we're at with 
with everything.

3031
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:54,600
That's an easy example.
But if you tell somebody 50 years ago,

3032
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:57,320
flexibility or strength training makes 
you inflexible.

3033
02:06:57,321 --> 02:06:57,620
Still like,

3034
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:02,700
well,
I don't know how they look at this 

3035
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:02,700
study.
Look at this study.

3036
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:02,700
They used to be an issue with boxing,
right?

3037
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:06,161
They used to always say boxers should 
never strength trained till vendor 

3038
02:07:06,161 --> 02:07:09,041
holyfield came along with mackie.
She'll stone right and won the title as 

3039
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:09,170
a heavier yesterday.
Yeah,

3040
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:10,340
the airport.
He looks great.

3041
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,900
Oh man.
It's crazy huge.

3042
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:16,960
He was pulling like walking out of the 
bathroom by himself and he had like a 

3043
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:16,960
cell phone up to his ear.
Like I'm on the phone,

3044
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:21,161
but I think his cellphone was dead,
but he just didn't want anybody to talk 

3045
02:07:21,161 --> 02:07:21,161
to them,
which I don't blame him.

3046
02:07:21,161 --> 02:07:21,650
No,
he looked fantastic.

3047
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:23,900
I just signed a buddy of mine to his.
He's doing,

3048
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:26,840
do you know he's a,
he's like coach or managing fighters now

3049
02:07:26,841 --> 02:07:27,980
or something?
Yeah,

3050
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:31,080
hopefully not financially.
I Don't know.

3051
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Event.
Just like buy the biggest house that 

3052
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:37,000
exists.

3053
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,400
Yeah.
Had that fucking stupendous mansion in 

3054
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:42,130
atlanta who was like a hundred and 50 
rooms or something like that.

3055
02:07:42,170 --> 02:07:44,680
Did you Put that much money in front of 
people in sport like that?

3056
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:50,430
Especially when you're balling,
when you and other people were bawling 

3057
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:50,590
and trying to ball harder,
got to do what you gotta do.

3058
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,130
I don't think mma is ever caught up to 
that in terms of financially.

3059
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:55,910
Yeah,
iT's getting close with conor mcgregor,

3060
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:58,540
but honestly his biggest windfall right 
now as a boxing match.

3061
02:07:58,541 --> 02:08:03,250
So you know,
the thing about a vendor that's weird is

3062
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:06,760
that he never got out of shape.
He looked fantastic.

3063
02:08:06,761 --> 02:08:07,630
Yeah.
He's still fit.

3064
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:12,660
He's got to be sneaky.
Plus he's one of the rare guys and I 

3065
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:13,330
think he had a fight as recently as a 
year ago.

3066
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,340
No,
no.

3067
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:15,460
Yeah,
yeah.

3068
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:20,990
Oh wow.
Find out when a vendor holyfield's last 

3069
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:21,880
fight was.
I really want to say he had a fight like

3070
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:22,360
a year ago.
Oh,

3071
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:23,830
that's terrifying.
Yeah,

3072
02:08:23,831 --> 02:08:25,210
but he's okay.
It's weird.

3073
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:26,840
It's not like,
whoa,

3074
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:32,280
what's this dude?
She just retired or just got smashed 

3075
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:32,280
really bad.
Getting bernard.

3076
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:32,950
THat gets amazing.
Yeah.

3077
02:08:32,951 --> 02:08:35,320
That was a freak incident,
man.

3078
02:08:35,321 --> 02:08:38,740
That's one of the things about like,
why don't they have pads around the ring

3079
02:08:38,741 --> 02:08:41,950
case guys fall through the ropes.
Like I can't imagine that they didn't.

3080
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:47,420
They have seen that happen before.
Guys are getting fucked up through that 

3081
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:47,420
before.
That's all fight style,

3082
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:47,450
right?

3083
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:50,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

3084
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:52,570
But that was lIke a fake charity boxing 
match.

3085
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:55,670
What does it say though in terms of,
uh,

3086
02:08:55,810 --> 02:09:00,810
when his last fight,
that's what popped up when I hit last 

3087
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:00,810
fight.
Yeah.

3088
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:01,320
But that's not real.
I think you're lying.

3089
02:09:01,410 --> 02:09:01,820
I think,
you know,

3090
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:03,460
just pull up his,
uh,

3091
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:08,490
his record wikipedia record.
I'm sure there's a wikipedia on evander 

3092
02:09:09,731 --> 02:09:14,731
holyfield.
Brian know nielsen a 2011.

3093
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:16,420
Oh,
okay.

3094
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:18,490
So six years ago.
Yeah,

3095
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,890
that's pretty recently in consideration.
Oh,

3096
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:25,891
you know what it was,
I believe he was planning a comeback a 

3097
02:09:25,891 --> 02:09:27,790
few years ago and he was having a really
hard time getting licensed.

3098
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,950
oh,
I think that's what it was.

3099
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:33,070
I would still say if you had asked me,
I would've said 12 years ago.

3100
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:34,900
Like I would've guessed way longer than 
that.

3101
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:35,260
Well,
he,

3102
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:36,160
how old is he now?

3103
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:42,890
Sixty one and 62.
Okay.

3104
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:44,050
Oh,
okay.

3105
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,250
So 5:55.
Yeah.

3106
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:48,790
So We essentially had his last fight 
when he was like,

3107
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:49,750
what?
Forty eight,

3108
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:51,010
49.
Something like that.

3109
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:52,930
Yeah,
it makes sense.

3110
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:54,970
That's a stylish.
Well,

3111
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:57,550
I dunno,
I don't really remember his that much.

3112
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:59,230
He didn't take a lot of stuff.
Did he take a lot of shots?

3113
02:09:59,260 --> 02:09:59,980
Oh,
hell yeah.

3114
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:01,350
Bruiser.
Yeah.

3115
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:04,510
I mean he took some.
He just had a tremendous chin.

3116
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:09,040
He just did an unbelievably tough guy 
and unbelievably fit.

3117
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,620
You know,
that was the thing about holy failed was

3118
02:10:11,621 --> 02:10:13,900
that unbelievably fit.
Unbelievably game.

3119
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,090
Like when he beaT Mike Tyson,
the first fight,

3120
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:20,350
like I remember it was,
you know Kevin James.

3121
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:23,020
Kevin was actually over my house.
We were watching it together.

3122
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:28,060
Really?
We're jumping around screaming like a 

3123
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:28,660
bunch of school girls because it was 
insane because nobody saw that comment.

3124
02:10:28,661 --> 02:10:30,550
You know what I'm saying?
Right.

3125
02:10:31,110 --> 02:10:32,350
Yeah.
That was amazing.

3126
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:33,920
Yeah.
He had a career though.

3127
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:35,240
Oh,
he certainly did.

3128
02:10:35,241 --> 02:10:37,280
Yeah.
Hope you still got it together upstairs.

3129
02:10:37,281 --> 02:10:41,960
Like that's just a tough one.
Certainly is.

3130
02:10:42,370 --> 02:10:43,010
Yeah.
That.

3131
02:10:43,011 --> 02:10:44,570
It's got to be weird.
I wonder what,

3132
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:46,370
do you ever have that conversation with 
a fighter?

3133
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:48,350
I do.
It's not my role,

3134
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:53,650
so I don't bring it up at all,
but if they asked me on like a friendly 

3135
02:10:53,650 --> 02:10:53,650
advice thing,
um,

3136
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,730
and look at will be very careful with 
names here.

3137
02:10:55,731 --> 02:10:58,880
Um,
but I generally tell them all tO retire,

3138
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:02,740
like regardless,
like my approach is no,

3139
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:05,000
this is a,
this is the,

3140
02:11:05,001 --> 02:11:06,950
the risk is not worth the power in the 
ufc.

3141
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:09,860
It's just not like there is the 
occasional connor,

3142
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:12,740
but this is,
this is the anomaly that proves the rule

3143
02:11:12,741 --> 02:11:17,741
actually.
So my advice to all of them is if it's 

3144
02:11:17,741 --> 02:11:19,580
not a good investment,
it is not worth the risk because even if

3145
02:11:19,581 --> 02:11:24,581
you get the wind bonus and the fight of 
the night one fight like that is 

3146
02:11:24,981 --> 02:11:26,120
potentially years.

3147
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:28,760
And how much income could You make in 
those 10 years of working?

3148
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:31,880
Probably more than that hundred k.
Well in terms of income for sure,

3149
02:11:31,881 --> 02:11:36,881
but for a lot of them it's not really 
what they're doing or not doing it for 

3150
02:11:36,881 --> 02:11:36,881
glory.
Right.

3151
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:42,040
So I mean that's.
but I'm taking it from a logical 

3152
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:42,040
perspective.
I'm not telling them what to do.

3153
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:42,830
I'm saying though,
like me as your friend,

3154
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:45,170
I would love for you to never fight 
because it was great,

3155
02:11:45,171 --> 02:11:50,171
but having said that you do that,
so let me help you as much as I can to 

3156
02:11:50,171 --> 02:11:51,230
get there,
but I mean you can kind of tell too,

3157
02:11:51,231 --> 02:11:53,650
like if you're,
if,

3158
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:56,900
if you just don't,
if you're not in that x factor,

3159
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:59,150
charisma wise and stuff,
you're never going to make that real.

3160
02:11:59,151 --> 02:12:01,420
Like life changing money.
We're just talking about money though.

3161
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:06,450
In terms of damage,
do you notice in terms of physical 

3162
02:12:06,450 --> 02:12:08,180
performance when you're seeing an 
athlete move around?

3163
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,490
I haven't gotten to the.
I haven'T gotten anybody like that.

3164
02:12:10,491 --> 02:12:12,260
Or have you had someone come to you and 
say,

3165
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:13,910
hey,
I'm thinking about,

3166
02:12:14,330 --> 02:12:15,710
you know,
when I get out,

3167
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:18,110
I'm not exactly sure when.
What do you think?

3168
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:19,430
Yeah,
I mean I would,

3169
02:12:19,431 --> 02:12:21,620
I would look at them from the 
performance side of it.

3170
02:12:21,621 --> 02:12:23,300
I wouldn't look at brain damage and all 
I would say,

3171
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:28,301
well here are your numbers in the room 
stack up to other folks we've had in 

3172
02:12:28,301 --> 02:12:29,420
this room and you're far below their 
performance wise.

3173
02:12:29,421 --> 02:12:34,421
I would say you might have a performance
problem in terms of you might not be 

3174
02:12:34,421 --> 02:12:37,600
talented enough physically to compete.
Like I'm not gonna make a comment about 

3175
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:38,030
your other reasons to retire,
but if yeah,

3176
02:12:38,031 --> 02:12:40,880
if I tested you across the board and you
were terrible at everything,

3177
02:12:43,230 --> 02:12:44,380
then I might be like,
well,

3178
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:49,570
physically from my perspective,
I don't know if you have what it takes 

3179
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:49,570
anymore.

3180
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:52,970
Do you see a deterioration in physical 
skills from like punishment?

3181
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:57,880
I don't know if I could really say that,
but that's just because I don't like.

3182
02:12:57,881 --> 02:13:02,881
I don't have enough exposure to enough 
of those folks to make a qualified 

3183
02:13:02,881 --> 02:13:02,881
comment on that over long periods of 
time.

3184
02:13:02,881 --> 02:13:07,470
Yeah.
I would need dozens and dozens of guys 

3185
02:13:07,470 --> 02:13:09,761
over years to really fairly.
What's the longest you've ever worked 

3186
02:13:09,761 --> 02:13:10,090
with a guy?
A five,

3187
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:11,090
six years?
Probably.

3188
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:13,070
Yeah,
probably six years.

3189
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:14,720
That's a lot of time.
It is.

3190
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:16,410
And it's not like,
uh,

3191
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:16,960
like,
uh,

3192
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:22,060
some of them is not every single,
I'm not talking to him every day and 

3193
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:22,060
sometimes it's like once a camp,
uh,

3194
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:26,620
generally what my goal is is to teach 
them how to think as much through this 

3195
02:13:26,691 --> 02:13:31,691
stuff as they can.
And so ideally they don't need me after 

3196
02:13:31,691 --> 02:13:33,750
more than a couple of camps than the few
chickens want to come to the lab,

3197
02:13:33,751 --> 02:13:37,590
get this test that I got a hunch about 
this or we did this type of training for

3198
02:13:37,591 --> 02:13:38,280
six weeks.

3199
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:43,700
We think we are addressing this problem.
Can we come to get it tested to see if 

3200
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:46,050
it actually got better and no problem.
But the other stuff I do is,

3201
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:51,080
like I said,
it's so much usually helping them calm 

3202
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:54,381
down through all the nonsense that I can
give them a settling presence in terms 

3203
02:13:54,381 --> 02:13:58,011
of you,
this is not something you should worry 

3204
02:13:58,011 --> 02:13:58,011
about or get to here.
So,

3205
02:13:58,011 --> 02:13:58,011
um,
buT yeah,

3206
02:13:58,011 --> 02:14:00,270
multiple five,
six years and we've got data.

3207
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:02,760
We've got biopsy data off them from over
the years,

3208
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:04,620
which has been very,
very interesting.

3209
02:14:04,621 --> 02:14:09,621
Actually.
That was one of the first reasons I 

3210
02:14:09,621 --> 02:14:09,621
wanted to get into the sport because I'm
like,

3211
02:14:09,621 --> 02:14:09,621
I want to biopsy these dudes.
Yeah,

3212
02:14:09,621 --> 02:14:14,420
that's got to be really as a scientist,
got to be really an interesting 

3213
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:14,420
opportunity to.
Yeah.

3214
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:14,520
We had,
um,

3215
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:17,940
we had one fighter.
It was pretty crazy because he's a,

3216
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:20,610
he was a wrestler and a very,
very um,

3217
02:14:20,730 --> 02:14:22,200
he was,
he went through attrition,

3218
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:23,400
like that's his style.

3219
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,080
He's not like a knockout artist and like
that.

3220
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:28,230
And he was almost 70,
75 percent fast twitch,

3221
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:30,660
which is.
Yeah.

3222
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:36,640
And then we also look this other thing.
So one of the things that we measured 

3223
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:39,710
our lab is called mild nuclear domain.
So the nucleus is what holds the dna and

3224
02:14:41,071 --> 02:14:42,720
it tells the cell to grow,
shrink,

3225
02:14:42,721 --> 02:14:44,490
die repair.
Well,

3226
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:47,580
like human biology or human muscle is 
really unique.

3227
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:51,600
It's one of the only cells in all of 
biology that is multinucleated.

3228
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,120
So that means it's got not only more 
than one,

3229
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:57,150
but it's got thousands of nuclei per 
cell.

3230
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:03,470
The obvious advantages that allows us a 
lot more plasticity so we can recover 

3231
02:15:03,721 --> 02:15:06,480
and repair and adapt and adjust really,
really quickly,

3232
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:09,630
which is why we see people's fiber type 
change in a matter of weeks.

3233
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:12,990
A paper that came out last year showing 
actually high fat,

3234
02:15:12,991 --> 02:15:14,910
high sugar diet can change five 
prototype.

3235
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:17,340
We've seen carbon dioxide 
concentrations,

3236
02:15:17,341 --> 02:15:19,040
alter fiber type con,
uh,

3237
02:15:19,170 --> 02:15:24,170
things like that.
So the nucleus is really interesting 

3238
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:27,030
because the more nuclei you have,
the faster you recover.

3239
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:30,570
It's also what determines how big a 
muscle will grow.

3240
02:15:30,650 --> 02:15:32,430
Um,
you've heard of like muscle memory.

3241
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:35,700
So that's me.
This is what's doing muscle memory.

3242
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:39,720
That makes sense.
I always wondered if that was real,

3243
02:15:40,070 --> 02:15:42,300
uh,
well working right now through it.

3244
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:43,530
Um,
a lot of people are,

3245
02:15:43,531 --> 02:15:47,280
but the old theory would be satellite 
cell would come in,

3246
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:52,760
it would turn into a nuclei and the cell
will only grow as big as the amount of 

3247
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:55,290
nuclei that are around it or that inside
of it.

3248
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:58,530
Right?
And so what that basically means is,

3249
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:04,040
uh,
there's a certain domain or a certain 

3250
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,291
size that each nucleus will control and 
it won't exceed that size because it 

3251
02:16:06,291 --> 02:16:07,650
loses control.
So if,

3252
02:16:07,710 --> 02:16:09,180
if you,
all three of us,

3253
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:12,120
you know,
we're all the nuclei and this whole room

3254
02:16:12,121 --> 02:16:12,930
was one cell.

3255
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:17,040
If we wanted to expand the wall we would
have to bring in another nucleus because

3256
02:16:17,041 --> 02:16:17,690
you'd be like,
dude,

3257
02:16:17,730 --> 02:16:22,730
like it's too much area to control.
So when you go through about a training 

3258
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:26,360
a year or something of heavy lifting and
we add those satellite cells that turned

3259
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:28,920
into my own nuclei and we expand the 
size.

3260
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:34,550
Well we used to think like if we stopped
training in this and the room gets 

3261
02:16:34,550 --> 02:16:37,621
smaller,
we used to think that are like time to 

3262
02:16:37,621 --> 02:16:41,041
kick me out of the room.
He's gone but now will look like 

3263
02:16:41,041 --> 02:16:41,041
happening.
Is he staying around?

3264
02:16:41,150 --> 02:16:46,150
So then when I go to retrain,
I've got more of those nuclei right 

3265
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:46,150
there.
And so it's easy.

3266
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:46,450
It's easier.
So I got excited,

3267
02:16:46,451 --> 02:16:51,451
hit the mic.
It's easier for me to expand my size 

3268
02:16:51,451 --> 02:16:51,451
because the nuclear there.
Oh,

3269
02:16:51,451 --> 02:16:51,451
that makes sense.
Okay,

3270
02:16:51,451 --> 02:16:53,920
so there's an actual scientific reason 
for muscle memory.

3271
02:16:53,930 --> 02:16:58,930
Yeah,
and you can increase the amount of 

3272
02:16:58,930 --> 02:17:01,381
nuclear just by increasing the size of 
the muscle and that makes it easier to 

3273
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:04,000
go back to that if you lose some muscle.
Well,

3274
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:09,001
right.
The demo nuclei would allow for the 

3275
02:17:09,001 --> 02:17:09,001
muscles get bigger.
Yeah,

3276
02:17:09,001 --> 02:17:09,280
so a little bit in reverse,
but basically the same thing.

3277
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:11,500
Dude,
this was really fascinating.

3278
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:13,120
Anything else to add before we get out 
of here?

3279
02:17:13,310 --> 02:17:18,310
I'm the book man.
I got a book out on all this stuff 

3280
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:21,670
called on plugged,
evolving from technology to upgrade your

3281
02:17:21,671 --> 02:17:24,850
fitness performance and consciousness 
isn't on amazon,

3282
02:17:24,851 --> 02:17:27,160
although all that stuff.
Is there an audio book available?

3283
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:28,390
There is,
but I'm telling you.

3284
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:29,050
No,
sorry.

3285
02:17:29,051 --> 02:17:31,630
There's a kindle that I would highly 
recommend.

3286
02:17:31,631 --> 02:17:34,360
You don't get it because the kindle.
No,

3287
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:36,160
you mean that's the digital version,
right?

3288
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:38,080
Why get the hard copy?
Why?

3289
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:43,170
Because the book is really a guide for 
how to use some of these training 

3290
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:46,411
technologies in your training and how it
can ruin your training and how it can 

3291
02:17:46,411 --> 02:17:46,411
help your training.

3292
02:17:46,930 --> 02:17:50,230
So a part of that is the importance of 
doing a couple of things,

3293
02:17:50,231 --> 02:17:55,231
getting back to nature and how that,
the physiology behind how that helps as 

3294
02:17:55,231 --> 02:18:00,121
well as this concept of choosing 
suffering and choosing discomfort and 

3295
02:18:00,371 --> 02:18:02,410
how that's physiologically important for
you.

3296
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:06,730
So a part of the book is built in a way 
where the photos,

3297
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:12,180
the layout,
the quality of the paper is all part of 

3298
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:12,180
the reading experience.
They don't have that in.

3299
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:14,530
I'm like kindle with the photographs 
now.

3300
02:18:14,531 --> 02:18:15,630
It's not even close to this.
It's,

3301
02:18:15,730 --> 02:18:16,990
you know,
it's all black and white.

3302
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:21,100
The texture of the paper is different.
Have one of those kindle hds,

3303
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:25,290
the ones that are digital and maybe 
maybe.

3304
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:26,530
Yeah,
maybe that would be good.

3305
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:27,370
But.
So what you're saying though,

3306
02:18:27,630 --> 02:18:29,220
but you recommend the proper.
Yeah,

3307
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:30,820
I mean I don't change.
I don't really care.

3308
02:18:30,830 --> 02:18:33,690
Like for the experience of it,
it's still cheap.

3309
02:18:33,850 --> 02:18:38,850
It's not expensive.
What's the physiological benefit of 

3310
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:38,850
getting back to nature?
Oh,

3311
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:39,070
we have so much.
Yeah,

3312
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:45,420
it's pretty incredible in terms of 
everything from visualization or.

3313
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:47,970
Sorry,
eyesight.

3314
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:51,550
Did you listen to that amazing podcast?
Eyesight?

3315
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:54,880
Yeah.
Radiolab did one on the color blue.

3316
02:18:55,710 --> 02:18:56,700
I didn't hear that one,
which was,

3317
02:18:56,720 --> 02:19:01,720
what's it called?
This is a teaser and I could tell you 

3318
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:01,720
the whole story.
What's it called?

3319
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:01,720
The,
the,

3320
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:02,530
the,
I don't know the episode.

3321
02:19:02,531 --> 02:19:05,560
Find it if you google the radio lab 
episode on the color blue.

3322
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:10,660
Okay.
Basically we as humans didn't really 

3323
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:11,770
recognize the color blue until the 
bible.

3324
02:19:12,730 --> 02:19:13,750
What?
Yeah.

3325
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:19,320
So we had the cones and the like,
the physiology didn't change but we 

3326
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:20,520
didn't have a word for the color blue 
until the bible came along.

3327
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:22,780
So if you look at any past there prior 
to that.

3328
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:28,740
Yeah,
that's probably why isn't the sky blue 

3329
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:28,740
on radio?

3330
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:28,880
Radiolab?
Yep.

3331
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:32,540
Exactly.
So what,

3332
02:19:32,541 --> 02:19:37,541
uh,
what they've identified is we didn't 

3333
02:19:37,541 --> 02:19:39,101
have a separate color for several word 
for the color blue because we didn't 

3334
02:19:39,101 --> 02:19:42,161
differentiate blue shade,
so it wasn't important for the world 

3335
02:19:42,161 --> 02:19:42,161
because blue doesn't happen very 
frequently.

3336
02:19:42,161 --> 02:19:47,141
And in biology in nature it wasn't until
we had textiles and we started printing 

3337
02:19:47,141 --> 02:19:49,310
and making cloth and paper and stuff 
like that,

3338
02:19:49,311 --> 02:19:51,320
that we had all these different dyes and
shade the blue.

3339
02:19:51,321 --> 02:19:53,750
So then we developed different shades of
blue in different colors,

3340
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:59,170
so because of that we started perceiving
and focusing on different shades of 

3341
02:19:59,170 --> 02:20:03,311
blue.
So now the average person that comes in 

3342
02:20:03,311 --> 02:20:04,130
the room and be able to identify all 
these different blues or prior to this,

3343
02:20:04,131 --> 02:20:05,840
we didn't care about it,
we didn't focus on it.

3344
02:20:05,841 --> 02:20:07,610
So we all just saw that as one color 
blue.

3345
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:11,240
So things like that are important.

3346
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:13,610
So what are we paying attention to?
What are we being conscious of?

3347
02:20:13,611 --> 02:20:15,470
What are we perceiving?
What are we focusing on?

3348
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:18,140
Has a direct influence on our 
physiology.

3349
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:24,070
It's very adaptable to those things.
So how does that make going to nature?

3350
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:29,830
So if we think about it from this way,
what's happening in the exposure when 

3351
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:31,490
we're in this artificial environment 
versus being in the external environment

3352
02:20:31,491 --> 02:20:36,491
like nature.
So what are we not being exposed to now 

3353
02:20:36,491 --> 02:20:37,850
that we could be exposed to out in 
nature?

3354
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:41,360
The third part of the book is the 
consciousness aspect,

3355
02:20:41,361 --> 02:20:43,850
which is we talked to a lot of people.
Um,

3356
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:47,070
tim ferriss wrote a section or a little 
interview thing for it.

3357
02:20:47,071 --> 02:20:52,071
Steven kotler did one as well and they 
talk about the things like getting into 

3358
02:20:52,071 --> 02:20:55,601
flow state and the stress relief of it 
and all the other psychological benefits

3359
02:20:56,001 --> 02:21:00,170
that we have from detaching a little bit
from our constant tech exposure.

3360
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:03,590
Um,
dopamine as another great example,

3361
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:08,620
right?
So if we look at the dopamine rush that 

3362
02:21:08,620 --> 02:21:09,620
we get from the constant exposure,
not from the actual tech,

3363
02:21:09,621 --> 02:21:10,520
but from things like,
oh,

3364
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:13,010
I want to look at my likes,
I want to continue to look at this.

3365
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:18,700
That's completely different than when we
didn't we get out in nature and expose 

3366
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:22,211
ourself to physiological elements 
similar to the cold and the hot and 

3367
02:21:22,211 --> 02:21:22,640
thirsty,
the Hungary.

3368
02:21:22,641 --> 02:21:25,370
I mean you've been out in the woods and 
stuff before,

3369
02:21:25,371 --> 02:21:29,030
like you know what it feels like going a
full day without food or being extremely

3370
02:21:29,031 --> 02:21:32,990
cold for a few days and then getting 
back and then you like the euphoria,

3371
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:34,790
like the sensations,
like you can't really.

3372
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:39,820
Well you can,
but it's really beneficial to have 

3373
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:39,820
herself exposed to that.
Um,

3374
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:41,420
and,
and it's a problem now,

3375
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:45,020
but really the book is about like,
wait 20 years.

3376
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:50,860
And think about the problem that's going
to be in 20 years when this technology 

3377
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:51,980
thing only gets more advanced and it 
takes more portion of our life.

3378
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:54,230
Alright dude,
one more time.

3379
02:21:54,231 --> 02:21:55,670
What's the name of the book?
Unplugged.

3380
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:58,250
Evolve from technology to upgrade your 
fitness,

3381
02:21:58,251 --> 02:22:00,320
performance and consciousness.
Beautiful.

3382
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:01,700
Thanks man.
I really enjoyed it.

3383
02:22:01,730 --> 02:22:03,590
That's great conversation.
Really appreciate it.

3384
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:05,660
