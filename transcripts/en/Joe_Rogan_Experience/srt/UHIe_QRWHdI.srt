1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,211
Try My day,

2
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,870
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:04,711
Well,

4
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:08,220
that brings up this the thing that's
going on this week with Conor McGregor.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,770
We got caught off guard last episode.

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:13,830
Jamie and I were talking
and just out of nowhere,

7
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,760
it's just breaking news.

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,930
And Jamie brought it up.

9
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,670
The Conor announced his
retirement and I said,

10
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,570
I thought he was trolling you.

11
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:20,010
And I had the exact same reaction.

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,701
I was like,

13
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,210
he's trolling,

14
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,043
he's fucking around.

15
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,221
It's all weird.

16
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:23,491
He wouldn't,

17
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,280
he'd be more eloquent than that.

18
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:26,700
He'd be,

19
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,450
he blew it up,

20
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,740
put it out better than that.

21
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:28,891
But,

22
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,500
and then the news started coming
out and I also started thinking,

23
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:31,681
well,

24
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,700
maybe,

25
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,200
maybe something happened in training or
maybe it was because of that guy that

26
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,930
died recently and people were saying,

27
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,130
you know,

28
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,070
they were shocked that I didn't know
the full details and the guy's death.

29
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,233
Honestly,

30
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,860
with things like this,

31
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,490
like you know what's
going to happen and um,

32
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,700
it's unavoidable.

33
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,090
It's,

34
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,090
there's a certain amount of risk
involved in any extreme sport.

35
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,570
Plus that's the exception.

36
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,433
Yeah.

37
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,690
Yeah.

38
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,250
It's going to happen.

39
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,750
That's the exception.

40
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,750
It is like seeing mad at peanut
butter when someone dies.

41
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,091
It's like,

42
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:03,930
I'm still gonna eat peanut,

43
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,350
you know,

44
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,041
it is exception,

45
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,690
but I was waiting for
all the details come out.

46
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,220
I don't think they've done an autopsy yet.

47
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,270
They don't think they know.

48
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,553
I don't either.

49
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,090
I and I,

50
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,930
I didn't think that with Connor
and I don't know if this is,

51
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,610
I don't think it's sharing
too much information.

52
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,170
When Khan and I had lunch together,

53
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,260
I just talked to and he kept bringing
up is a reoccurring theme when we were

54
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:22,711
talking,

55
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,130
he goes,

56
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,180
the the media man,

57
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:24,781
like for this,

58
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,010
it's such a beast.

59
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,460
He's like,

60
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,690
like I've done interviews before,

61
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:28,501
but you know,

62
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,041
it's different.

63
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:33,150
Like he's not a guy where when any other
fighter sit down and do an interview,

64
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,180
they're really not selling the fight the
time about their camp and they're doing

65
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,210
the same thing over and over and Connor's
up fucking master that we've never

66
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,290
seen do it before.

67
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,020
So he's coming up with
original content nonstop.

68
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,710
He's on.

69
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:43,981
You know,

70
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:44,814
like when,

71
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,200
when he came on our podcasts,

72
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:46,861
he,

73
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,160
you could,

74
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,760
he was on,

75
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,350
he did the whole car wash.

76
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,300
He was exhausted and then we came down.

77
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:54,480
You could tell him he was thinking
and just start spitting out gold.

78
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,620
He's just a beast man.

79
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,670
So to have that guy fly around
the world and do all this shit,

80
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,180
I mean at the end of the day we
got to remember this is a sport,

81
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,500
this is not the WWE.

82
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,900
So to keep putting on the spectacle,

83
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,410
like it's similar to WWE
at some point yesterday,

84
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,990
man,

85
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,150
what these guys do is it's a real,

86
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,740
real,

87
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,710
we're in the HERP business.

88
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,270
He has to focus man.

89
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,500
And I just feel like,

90
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,450
I think Connor's to blame,

91
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,710
to Dana's to blame.

92
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,580
I think both of them just need to
talk because if Connor before it's bad

93
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,990
planning him bad playing on Dana,

94
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,980
if he just went do,

95
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:26,814
listen,

96
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,260
I've sold this flight more than anyone.

97
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,680
Man,

98
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
this is nuts.

99
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,210
I have to,

100
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,410
if I lose this next fight,

101
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,340
I'm screwed though.

102
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,900
A problem is it sets a precedent.

103
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,320
Now,

104
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,640
if I'm looking at it from a,

105
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,600
as a businessman,

106
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,710
if I was,

107
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,610
if I was a businessman,

108
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,380
let's pretend,

109
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,910
okay,

110
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,520
I would say this sets a precedent.

111
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,220
You can't let someone decide
what press they don't press.

112
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:49,020
They don't do like you have an obligation
to fulfill certain responsibilities

113
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,030
like with the media for sure.

114
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,390
Like,

115
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,260
like create hype.

116
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,370
But the question is,

117
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,430
but the question is like when do those
responsibilities move into like a purely

118
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,210
digital realm and when
do those responsibilities
only in showing up places,

119
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,470
physically old school,

120
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,940
retro going places.

121
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,840
Because like there's nothing wrong
with the occasional press conference,

122
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,340
right?

123
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,760
No,

124
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,070
but,

125
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,390
but also you can accomplish way more
with a few fucking viral videos than you

126
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:16,811
ever could.

127
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,370
Going to some weird interview with
two people that aren't MMA fans.

128
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,290
And I think he made a really
good point about that.

129
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,270
Doing this fucking these morning shows,

130
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,490
they make them go do where you know,

131
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,170
nobody knows who the guy is or the girl,

132
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,670
they don't give a shit about MNA.

133
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,211
Yeah,

134
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,600
they don't,

135
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,280
they don't want to talk to him
the way you want to talk to him.

136
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,330
Or I want to talk to him,

137
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,961
you know,

138
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,030
and I'm talking to Connor
like before a fight.

139
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,430
I'm,

140
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,980
I'm trying to find out what's going
on in the head of a guy who's going to

141
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:42,551
engage.

142
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,920
One of the most exciting things
that I'm going to see all year.

143
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,101
No,

144
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,330
you're not going on a morning show going.

145
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,470
How about that cauliflower?

146
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:47,710
Huh?

147
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,371
How'd you get that?

148
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,300
Shut the fuck up.

149
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,060
But also like that.

150
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,431
I know,

151
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,750
but congress is a guy where he's
crossed over into pop culture.

152
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,960
He's such a big star now.

153
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,950
A tweet from him.

154
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:01,630
We'll hype the fight if I guarantee if
Connor Dana had conversation and Dan was

155
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:01,751
like,

156
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,141
all right man,

157
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,810
I understand it's a big fight cause you
got to remember if you were to lose this

158
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,170
one,

159
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,370
now you're losing your golden boy.

160
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,650
The biggest star by far by far.

161
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,290
I also feel like he could just focus.

162
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,940
Let's just let him focus a little bit.

163
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,450
Why I also feel like
the magnitude of this,

164
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,440
the dilemma that's in front of him
and Nate Diaz is also very apparent.

165
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,970
This is not a guy you can half ass.

166
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,850
And even if you are 100% ready,

167
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,580
you've never even fought him at 100% Oh,

168
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,140
you fought him when he had 11 days.

169
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,850
Notice what he'd been drinking in Mexico.

170
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,490
I mean he posted typical matchup man.

171
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,140
And then you want to fly him on a plane.

172
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,550
Did anyone think?

173
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,610
Man,

174
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,210
all right.

175
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,540
If you're looking at them
with three months away though,

176
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,650
okay,

177
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,410
but still Connor's exhausted
man from doing this stuff.

178
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,303
And also,

179
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,150
you know,

180
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,200
I see some fighters go,

181
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,350
it's our obligation to do
these press conferences slowly.

182
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:50,980
Roll Homie,

183
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,110
you're not Conor Mcgregor
press conference.

184
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,880
That's a big difference.

185
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,260
And,

186
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,840
and,

187
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,441
and uh,

188
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,310
lost to him.

189
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,040
You're talking millions and the UFC,

190
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,510
if I'm looking at as a businessman,

191
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:01,790
I go,

192
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,300
all right,

193
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,130
all right man.

194
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,430
Hell,

195
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,450
he's gonna do a press conference,

196
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:05,560
but we're going to come to him.

197
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,000
Did anyone think to do that?

198
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,990
Well,

199
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,591
first of all,

200
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,410
Connor is one of the
most charismatic guys,

201
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,690
seriously of all time in all sports.

202
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
No doubt about it.

203
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,041
I mean,

204
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,110
he is a fucking marketing machine.

205
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,960
Like they're just the quotes in his style,

206
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,490
his tweet player interrupt you.

207
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:25,120
But his tweet is the biggest
tweet by an athlete this year.

208
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,020
Beat Koby Bryant's retirement tweet and
you want me to go do a fucking interview

209
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:29,860
for ESPN?

210
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,071
Well,

211
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,000
they don't know the sport.

212
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,930
Oh as well.

213
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,040
I watch ESPN every morning.

214
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,500
They were talking about Lebron
James The playoff game tonight.

215
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,150
They interrupted this shit
with breaking news top out.

216
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,190
Connor's not retiring.

217
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,810
That's how big he is now.

218
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,690
The PR team at UFC could not get this.

219
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,910
They could not get this sort of attention.

220
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,661
Even if they want to.

221
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,494
Connor can.

222
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,540
It's a different age,

223
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,150
man.

224
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,020
Those old interviews,

225
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,190
that else press conference.

226
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,510
You have a legit fucking superstar
man who makes more money than anyone.

227
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,590
The ice skates.

228
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,380
Totally.

229
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,210
What I was going to say,

230
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,520
sorry.

231
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,353
Series points.

232
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,740
It's okay a sometimes I just
go now where you know you,

233
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,050
you have a,

234
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,620
you have all good points are all
valid points and I get this contracts,

235
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,371
I get stuff like that,

236
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:10,160
but there has to be where you
can't have a pissing contest.

237
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,701
You can't say,

238
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:10,911
well,

239
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,130
we're going to run it like a business
this time and then not this time because

240
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,940
it's good for the company with Conor
Mcgregor and this big of a fight.

241
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,560
If he wins this dude,

242
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,270
you know how much more
money you're gonna make,

243
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,920
not the fucking press conference.

244
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,160
[inaudible] you're absolutely right that
he's one of the most charismatic guys

245
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:25,760
were all time.

246
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,380
But Nate Diaz right now
is God damn gigantic.

247
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,030
And I think we're going to
realize he's not as big.

248
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,691
It's kind of close,

249
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,580
but he's goddamn gigantic.

250
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,414
He's huge.

251
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,590
And see what happens.

252
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:37,640
That's because of that.

253
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,050
That's part of that fight.

254
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,230
Part of that fight is that Connor is
also fighting another mercurial superstar

255
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,380
character.

256
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:45,860
I agree.

257
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,810
Especially now after the first fight.

258
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,411
I agree Joe,

259
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,780
but let's say Connor
doesn't fight at UFC 200.

260
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,140
And,

261
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,530
uh,

262
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,410
let's say Nate fights
Woodley or Robbie Lawler.

263
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,830
Let me know how this rating scale and we
know even pray fight at one 70 animals.

264
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,750
Let's say at one 55,

265
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,450
let's say fights.

266
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,090
Dos Anjos let me know how those ratings,

267
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,100
because here's where it won't be as close.

268
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,310
Oh,

269
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,690
we need to be a quarter of it.

270
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,670
I wonder.

271
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,270
It'd be close.

272
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,103
Maybe half.

273
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,770
I mean,

274
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,530
that's the sense that maybe
half half makes sense,

275
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,300
but half would still
be pretty spectacular,

276
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:14,680
you know,

277
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:14,951
at night,

278
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:15,470
even half.

279
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,770
Um,

280
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,410
I'm being generous and he's the biggest,

281
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,310
there's no doubt about it.

282
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,144
He's the Vegas.

283
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,681
Yeah.

284
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:22,461
Well who knows?

285
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,390
It's all speculation.

286
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,350
But here's what's interesting.

287
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,840
They offered the fight
apparently to normal go Madoff,

288
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,780
but he can't take it because it's
only four days after Ramadan.

289
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,473
Fuck man.

290
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,380
So he's very religious,

291
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,000
so he does that whole fascinating.

292
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:35,781
I had a buddy of mine,

293
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,510
my friend Con clayly from back in Boston.

294
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,620
He used to do that shit.

295
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,560
He's training.

296
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,153
He would do that.

297
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,640
Um,

298
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,140
he would fast when he was training,

299
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,341
it was crazy.

300
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,174
You just,

301
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,421
you,

302
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:50,680
you have certain rules where
you're not allowed to eat anything.

303
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:50,841
What,

304
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:51,321
how's it go?

305
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,350
You're not allowed to eat
anything or drink anything up.

306
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,810
Sun Down.

307
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,310
Right.

308
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,110
It upside down.

309
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,390
Do you see?

310
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,670
Do it?

311
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,791
Yeah.

312
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,270
And you can't,

313
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,530
there's no food or water.

314
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,810
And at like 6:00 PM,

315
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,644
they have this feast.

316
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,040
Yeah.

317
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,580
But it,

318
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,680
it can weaken you and so he'd be upset.

319
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,251
It would have a real,

320
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,630
it'd be a real problem if you had a fight.

321
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,740
Four or five rounds.

322
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
I get it and I would
love to see that fight.

323
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,290
Habib,

324
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,700
Nigga Murdoch Verse Nate Diaz.

325
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,280
He's such a beast,

326
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,640
right?

327
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,450
He's phenomenal.

328
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,283
Yeah.

329
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,020
To us who are balls deep in the UFC world.

330
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes.

331
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,831
No,

332
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,230
you're right.

333
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,660
Espn and covering that fight.

334
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:20,961
Dude,

335
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,130
you should start a promotion.

336
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:22,461
Look at you.

337
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,480
You're a God damn promoter.

338
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,314
You know how to do this.

339
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,010
I'm not.

340
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,830
I've been through it and when I see
a guy like Conor comes in once in a

341
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:28,311
lifetime,

342
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,840
if you think there'd be
another condom at Gregor,

343
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:30,950
you're bat shit crazy.

344
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,870
I think when we invest in arts,

345
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:33,201
the UFC,

346
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:33,741
they keep going.

347
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:34,520
I think you're crazy.

348
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,880
I think Conor is a special dude
and I think there's a few other,

349
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:38,930
I think Brock Lesnar was,

350
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:39,651
I think Rhonda is,

351
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:39,950
there's,

352
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,210
there's very few players.

353
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:46,211
Is it possible that this is a calculated
gamble based on not thinking he has

354
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,010
enough time to prepare for Nate?

355
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,850
No,

356
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,560
I don't think some possible impulses just
just as just a matter of digging your

357
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,760
heels into the ground and saying,

358
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,930
there's no,

359
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,880
there's no way I can do this much percent.

360
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,661
I think he's just like,

361
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:00,811
dude,

362
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,491
I'm exhausted.

363
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:02,700
You and me on this world tour is it?

364
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,900
Can I please get ready for this?

365
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,430
It's not the WWE man.

366
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,780
Go,

367
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,111
go,

368
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:07,411
ask,

369
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:11,940
go ask a major superstar Lebron and
I know you think it's not the same,

370
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,930
but Lebron,

371
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
any of these guys,

372
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,410
these superstars in Sports Ranalda gone.

373
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,150
These world tours not get paid.

374
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,900
Sell the fight when like put my social
media will cover way more than this.

375
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,920
Go Fuck Yourself.

376
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,630
But we have no one fighting like he,

377
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,800
he can't say anything.

378
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,521
You say anything.

379
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:26,701
Look,

380
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:27,660
you got pulled from the car.

381
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,840
So more is not better is a certain
amount of a certain amount you do.

382
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,590
We had a certain amount.

383
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:35,580
You're doing it for the UFC.

384
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,320
You're not doing it for
the Conor McGregor brand.

385
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,610
You're not doing for the fighters brand.

386
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,960
You think by him going to ESPN,

387
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,820
he's going get more followers.

388
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,690
Would you think that there's like there's
certain consideration that looked like

389
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,530
it looks good to have file
of fighters show up on ESPN.

390
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
He's been there,

391
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:50,820
he's on,

392
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,960
he's on breaking news.

393
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:52,151
He's,

394
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:52,360
he's,

395
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,680
he's,

396
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,630
he's been doing it maybe the week before,

397
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:55,380
do it.

398
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,470
But when he wants to prepare for a camp
and you have a guy of his magnitude

399
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,330
coming off a loss and he's like,

400
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:00,930
man,

401
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,230
I really think doing all this press
and all this stuff has fucked with my

402
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,220
capabilities to be a fight.

403
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,120
I need to get back to that.

404
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,620
Will you please let me focus?

405
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,461
It makes it very hype.

406
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,270
The fight.

407
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,103
It totally makes sense.

408
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,520
Well you can't have exceptions.

409
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:11,730
No,

410
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,421
no mother fucker.

411
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,310
You can cause you do make exceptions.

412
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,700
Well here's what,

413
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,640
you have certain people in the
UFC roster where they can't,

414
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:18,151
you know what I'm saying?

415
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,070
Where they pick and choose when
they fight or who they fight.

416
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,000
There are exceptions.

417
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,600
Right.

418
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,460
And here's another thing to Kate
and take into consideration.

419
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,560
One of the most important
things that anybody,

420
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,740
any athlete does while they're
in training is get proper rest.

421
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,970
It's one of the most important things
and what fucks up when you go traveling

422
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:33,630
all the time.

423
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,463
Your rest.

424
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,860
So number one thing that wrecks you,

425
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,530
you know,

426
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,780
let me think how much you travel too.

427
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:38,310
I just,

428
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,900
I just flew in from Seattle this morning.

429
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,520
I got up at five this morning,

430
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
flew here,

431
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,880
got right off the plane
and drove right in here.

432
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,570
Yeah,

433
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:45,870
that's,

434
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,800
that's what happens man.

435
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:46,951
You're,

436
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,060
your body gets a,

437
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,770
your immune system gets jack from that.

438
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,340
It's all good.

439
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,173
I just think of the,

440
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,850
I think this is great for the sport,

441
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,410
a good discussion to have because
now future superstars will say,

442
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,191
I'm only doing this,

443
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,024
may interviews this,

444
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
this much before the fight.

445
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,690
Well maybe when all of
the sink going to happen.

446
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,600
Maybe there's a debate.

447
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Maybe the debate could be
held as to like what is the,

448
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:07,260
what's the amount that you need to do
once the amount that you should do,

449
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,490
you know,

450
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:08,940
like what,

451
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,040
how do you have it set
up and what would be the,

452
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,160
what would be the best way for
the performance of the athlete,

453
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,170
the consideration of their,

454
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,011
their,

455
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:17,641
their time.

456
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:22,080
And focus to put 100% effort
into something and not
leave anything on the table

457
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,830
because they really weren't rested enough
cause we were or distracted too much.

458
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:26,940
Cause they're doing too much press.

459
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,570
But who is it?

460
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,560
Who's it helping the end?

461
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,320
The UFC and Dana white
light by using paper view.

462
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,890
If they have pay per view buys and
they get a percentage of the buys,

463
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,813
it helps.

464
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,671
It helps everyone.

465
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:36,030
But,

466
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,990
but if the fighter,

467
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,130
I mean there should be a direct,

468
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,250
there's a direct if a fighter as a
percentage of pay per view with which guy

469
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,020
like Conor does.

470
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,450
Yes.

471
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,770
The more paper view deals where
maybe he does it a title fight.

472
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,540
We don't know what his deal is.

473
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,430
So I'm talking about the
pantry you buys for sure.

474
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,211
I would have smacked her.

475
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:51,380
Why?

476
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,230
I would assume yes.

477
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,050
Um,

478
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,300
but so the more press he does,

479
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,370
the more things get sold,

480
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,020
the more money he makes.

481
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,480
But in his point of view,

482
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:05,860
like tweets and things that he's doing
right now are getting more attention to

483
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:08,560
it than any of these stupid interview
going to pay for this kind of,

484
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,394
you can't,

485
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,570
and you can't argue with that.

486
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,560
That's absolutely true,

487
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,940
but the question is like,

488
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,433
where were,

489
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,050
you know there should be like a contract
and the contract should state from x to

490
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:20,680
y.

491
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:20,951
You know,

492
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,240
pick a date and time.

493
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,610
I would be left alone if you
saw it or wants to get me.

494
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,090
I'll be up in Iceland freezing
my deck off thrown sidekicks,

495
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,140
come get me.

496
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,710
I see.

497
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,830
I think this whole thing is
a misspeak miscommunication.

498
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,650
I see Dana side and I see
countersigned right as a fight.

499
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,670
I definitely see Connor side.

500
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,990
I think it's just a miscommunication.

501
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,670
I think if before all this came out,

502
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,211
if Conner was like,

503
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:40,661
listen man,

504
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:41,570
I can't be doing all this fucking,

505
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:43,030
I guarantee you have
Dana was sitting right.

506
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,920
There would be no miscommunication.

507
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,730
I don't think.

508
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,280
I don't think he would agree that
it was a miscue communication.

509
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,290
I think he would say the Connor just
does want to do the press and I got to do

510
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,070
the press.

511
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,660
And to me that's a miscommunication.

512
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,110
But can I get some miscommunications,

513
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,963
a disagreement?

514
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,301
No,

515
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,800
I disagree because I eat,

516
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,760
I disagree.

517
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,690
And this is why Joe,

518
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,040
because I think after,

519
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,943
after,

520
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
even though we fought Aldo,

521
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,130
he expressed,

522
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,510
do I need to chill on these interviews?

523
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,650
He,

524
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,400
he beats a Nate Diaz or
he loses Nate Diaz again.

525
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:12,641
He's like,

526
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:12,821
dude,

527
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:14,200
this fucking press is killing me.

528
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,580
So He's been voice in it.

529
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,030
And I don't know if his camp has
had the discussion with Dana,

530
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,340
but at some point maybe they haven't.

531
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,930
We don't know.

532
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,350
Maybe his total speculation,

533
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,200
miscommunication down and
come up with a schedule.

534
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,600
I guess you got to leave
me alone for eight weeks.

535
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:28,930
But he,

536
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,800
but what if,

537
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,800
what if Dana and Connor had
a conversation right now,

538
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,900
man to man and Cognito's listen,

539
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,763
what I'll do,

540
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,240
I'll film videos every day.

541
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,760
I'll do this after my practices.

542
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,890
I'll put all this social
media out for you guys.

543
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:42,161
Craig,

544
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:42,730
this fight,

545
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,500
no one has the pull that I do,

546
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:44,771
right?

547
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:47,590
And I can create this many
views for millions and millions.

548
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,700
No other fighter can,

549
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,780
don't pay me for it.

550
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,980
Just don't make me travel.

551
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,440
You don't think Dana and the
UFC would agree to any of this?

552
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,270
I bet.

553
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,420
I bet they'd be open to it.

554
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:55,901
You know,

555
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:56,734
it's interesting,

556
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,550
Kevin Hart,

557
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,230
he was like one of the
biggest stars in the world,

558
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,281
one of the biggest,

559
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,114
uh,

560
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,570
comedians ever as far as
like sales and volume,

561
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,080
like 90,

562
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,980
no one even close.

563
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:06,160
I mean,

564
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,321
he,

565
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,210
he crushes it.

566
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:07,721
He sells out.

567
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,380
Like,

568
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,650
what is that like 50,000
plus soldier field?

569
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,543
It's nuts.

570
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,100
Anyway,

571
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,930
um,

572
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,621
that's not important.

573
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,630
What's important is he's,

574
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,200
he's like gigantic on social media,

575
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,220
super active,

576
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,840
and he does it all himself.

577
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,340
So if he does a movie,

578
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,440
like he'll do a movie and they'll say,

579
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,041
oh great,

580
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,270
and you can use your,

581
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:28,601
you know,

582
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:33,130
5.8 million social media followers and a,

583
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,180
it'll boost up the movie.

584
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:34,601
And it was like,

585
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:34,751
Whoa,

586
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:34,921
Whoa,

587
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:35,111
whoa,

588
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:35,321
Whoa,

589
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:35,980
whoa.

590
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,813
That's mine.

591
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,840
That's mine.

592
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:37,931
No,

593
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:38,800
if you want that.

594
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,120
Yup.

595
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,230
And we've got to talk about
that first guy to dude.

596
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,120
They like all the people that were in
those movie meetings must have been like,

597
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,470
oh shit.

598
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,370
Because then the rock goes,

599
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,210
Huh?

600
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,541
Yeah.

601
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:54,541
Because there's a giant difference
between a guy like the rock,

602
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,690
like what he can do to sell a movie with
social media and the average person,

603
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,950
the average actor,

604
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,993
I mean he's,

605
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,350
he's constantly on it.

606
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,490
He has a dedicated loyal fan base because
he's really funny and self deprecating

607
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,210
follows us,

608
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,050
works hard.

609
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,000
So he's shown pictures of,

610
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:10,791
of the alarm clock.

611
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,210
It says like four 15 in the morning and
he's up there fucking doing dead lifts.

612
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,193
He's an animal,

613
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,920
right?

614
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,510
So a guy like that,

615
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,130
that's a business on the side,

616
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,993
that's his,

617
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,511
that's his,

618
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:25,511
like he's got a hype business as well
as a business to promote himself,

619
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:27,920
but he can also hype things.

620
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,701
You know,

621
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:32,870
he's not promotion once he give
me some money when he does that,

622
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm sure he's got it worked.

623
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,910
It was talking about it.

624
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,530
And it's got to worked into movies now.

625
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,160
So it's like,

626
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,341
Oh,

627
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,880
if you want a part of the Kevin Hart
money machine that I put together,

628
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,950
well you gotta give me something bitch.

629
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,210
Like she kind of be any different.

630
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,350
You're right,

631
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,530
you're right in that respect as,

632
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:46,901
as,

633
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:49,850
as a superstar now not every
fiber can pull that card.

634
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You legitimately have to be able to sell
out giant stadiums and be a superstar.

635
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:55,580
Yeah.

636
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,510
And he certainly can,

637
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,570
especially if you give
them the right match ups,

638
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,061
you know,

639
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:03,650
if you give Connor the right match
up at one 45 like I think honestly,

640
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,700
I mean I'm excited about this Nate Diaz
fight cause I like watching them fight.

641
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,210
I like watching Nate Diaz fight.

642
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,531
I like,

643
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,760
and I love the attention he's getting,

644
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,510
but if I was,

645
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,130
if I was in Connor's camp,

646
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,340
I mean I understand that he's obsessed
and he wants to get right back at it.

647
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,060
I would say go fight Frankie Edgar,

648
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,100
go fight Max Holloway.

649
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,050
Have a rematch of Max Holloway.

650
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,390
That shit would be epic if Aldo,

651
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
whoever Aldo does,

652
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,141
you know,

653
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:29,470
and they mix it all up a fight,

654
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,510
a rematch with all dumb.

655
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
All those been talking mad shit about him,

656
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,111
you know,

657
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:36,920
I think all go genuine and genuinely
believes that he fucked up.

658
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,470
And if he gets a hold of this dude
this time he get punished them,

659
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,161
which is awesome.

660
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,120
Fight and awesome story.

661
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,580
I want to see it.

662
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,260
I want to see homeowners can't think
those sites are still gonna be there if he

663
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,190
leaves his Nate Diaz.

664
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,360
I think it takes some of the,

665
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,283
it takes a stock.

666
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,540
A lot of the star power
already got taken away.

667
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,470
Too much of a risk.

668
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,720
It's just way too much
power got taken away.

669
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,560
And that second fight,

670
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,490
not 100%,

671
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,211
not 100%,

672
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:57,170
he's still the biggest draw,

673
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,123
but he was,

674
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,550
uh,

675
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,810
an assassin before that
fight on [inaudible].

676
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,130
Whether there was something going on,

677
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,440
like when he flatlined,

678
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,220
although with one punch and then did it,

679
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,520
like it was nothing and smiled and I was
talking to him when the interview and

680
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:10,970
he's just saying,

681
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,300
you know,

682
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,133
no power,

683
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,003
no power,

684
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,341
just,

685
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:14,060
just put it,

686
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,840
put it right where it's the,

687
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,060
her,

688
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,800
anything like it.

689
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:15,981
Yeah,

690
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:20,030
I mean the way he gobbled up the pressure
and the way he controlled the shit

691
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,570
talking.

692
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,261
This is the thing,

693
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:21,441
Joe,

694
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:21,670
we've,

695
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,410
we've never had a guy of his
capabilities and his mass appeal go,

696
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:26,640
man,

697
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,890
I don't want to do this.

698
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,630
Like everyone else has
jumped through these hoops.

699
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:29,960
I don't.

700
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,070
I want to fucking train,

701
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:31,281
man.

702
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,031
This is ridiculous.

703
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm already big enough.

704
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,610
We've never had a guy really do this.

705
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,970
He's also a guy where I
think if he wanted to,

706
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,860
if he was involved with the UFC,

707
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:40,670
let's say Dana,

708
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,540
which would never happen.

709
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,081
Cut Goes,

710
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:42,901
go do what the fuck you.

711
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:43,221
I'm sick.

712
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,054
You go do what you want.

713
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,380
He could sell out a giant arena in Dublin
against Datta 5,000 every Saturday.

714
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,770
That's how powerful he is.

715
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,230
That's what I literally make and
just make more and more money.

716
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:52,980
Well,

717
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,040
I don't know about that because I think
part of the excitement about him was

718
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,540
building up to that Aldo fight.

719
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,000
That was part of the
man who would be king.

720
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:03,930
Story was that he was going to fight
the longtime king and when he flat the

721
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,830
longtime king,

722
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,550
he reached this level
of legendary popularity.

723
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,120
There does that.

724
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,530
It happens once in a hundred
generations when it comes with fighters,

725
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:13,950
right?

726
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,630
There's this,

727
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,630
this is moment,

728
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,500
this boom.

729
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,780
How many guys reached that moment?

730
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:23,220
Like when he flatlined Aldo with one
punch and then it was 13 seconds of the

731
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,054
whole world was like,

732
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,811
he fucking did it.

733
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,820
The answer is none did it?

734
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,251
Yes,

735
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,360
it's fucking crazy.

736
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,631
Yeah,

737
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:28,950
that was epic.

738
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,250
But the lustre gets taken off by the
Nate Diaz fight and if he loses to Nate

739
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:34,560
Diaz,

740
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,390
he's got a very good point that,

741
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,080
you know,

742
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,000
he can't lose because he wasn't given the
right amount of opportunity to present

743
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,601
or to,

744
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,050
um,

745
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,040
to prepare himself because
he had to do all this press,

746
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,631
like right now,

747
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,930
the Conor McGregor fan base
and guys hugging his nuts,

748
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:50,310
which I might be one of them,

749
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,210
but he,

750
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,511
you know,

751
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:51,841
they're going,

752
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,590
well,

753
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,070
you know,

754
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,040
Nate Diaz is way bigger and he
kind of caught him off guard.

755
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,251
Well,

756
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:56,731
all that good.

757
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,100
And there's a little asterisk I
guess if you're this Conor guy,

758
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,470
well now if he loses again,

759
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,590
there's no more excuses because
the fuck there's no astrick.

760
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,690
Nate had 11 I'm saying it.

761
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,470
You could,

762
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,011
you know what I'm saying?

763
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:08,930
I'm not saying there is Nate.

764
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,330
Straight up beat them with
11 days preparing sip and
coronas on a boat and came

765
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:13,050
and whooped his ass.

766
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:18,050
I thought ne was going to beat him just
by first of all the size and length and

767
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,070
deceptive boxing skills.

768
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,540
That's not what I thought.

769
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,200
I was like,

770
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,010
this is going to be the first guy that
Connor's ever fought that's been in wars

771
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,260
with like a legends.

772
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,260
I mean he's been in there with a lot
of fucking super high level dude.

773
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,130
He's a monster and like this is a big,

774
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,170
big fight and this is not
a fight you want to take.

775
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,060
Even if he's not ready on 11 days notice,

776
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,660
you got to get ready for this dude
and his Jujitsu is off the chain.

777
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:42,991
Man.

778
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:46,980
His Jujitsu is at a super high
level and she's bigger than comment.

779
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:50,250
There couldn't be a worse
match up bars with Andre Ward,

780
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,000
world champion and Joe
showing on a regular basis.

781
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,480
I know him and his brother Nick.

782
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,100
I know Gilbert Melendez,

783
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:56,934
Jace Shield,

784
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,840
no joke,

785
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,621
no joke.

786
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,060
Dangerous fucking fight,

787
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:00,331
man.

788
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:00,601
Whore.

789
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,434
What's stressing me out?

790
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,610
Fuck with Adrian.

791
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,060
But the guy who we're not talking
about in all this is Nate Diaz.

792
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,150
Cause even though if Nate Diaz and
you guys can say whatever you want,

793
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:10,500
you'll see 200 still going to be dope.

794
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,461
I get that.

795
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,920
That's all fun and Dandy
for the the absolute fans.

796
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,970
If there's no Connor,

797
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,380
Nate doesn't make the same pay day.

798
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,730
So he gets fucked man.

799
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,091
You're right.

800
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,950
And I want to see the,

801
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,850
the dues that Nate has paid.

802
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,850
And remember the Diaz brothers
were the first guys to go.

803
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,691
Not Fuck that man.

804
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,860
I don't think it should be done that way.

805
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,560
And you got appreciate that man in a,

806
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,280
in a land full of fucking sheep.

807
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,750
They were the first kind of wolves go,

808
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:30,961
no,

809
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:31,651
fuck that man.

810
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:32,484
This ain't right.

811
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,290
Well they're also the first guys to put
a ridiculous emphasis on extreme cardio.

812
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,513
Yes.

813
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,540
And it shows in their style.

814
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:39,840
Yeah.

815
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,720
I mean like nick doing
marathons and triathlons and a,

816
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,300
I was,

817
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,900
it's funny,

818
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,640
I keep quoting and nick
corrected me the other day.

819
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,490
I said that he swam back
from Alcatraz twice.

820
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,100
He just correct me the other day.

821
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,921
It was five times.

822
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,150
Now it's fucking nuts.

823
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:59,860
Five times he swam from Alcatraz
to the fucking mainland.

824
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,420
They didn't think you could do that.

825
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,830
They didn't think it was possible.

826
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:06,160
That's why they put a prison there cause
they didn't think people could swim.

827
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,090
Well this mother fucker is
a stoner and an athlete.

828
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,100
These aren't even a prisoner.

829
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,830
Oh fucking let,

830
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,760
don't lock that dude.

831
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:14,230
I was going to swim right the fuck out.

832
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,080
He oh quickly on a bunch
of guys like him in prison.

833
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,510
But how crazy are people these days
do be doing things for recreation?

834
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,230
The only,

835
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,930
the only guy who could bring Nate Diaz
money is George Saint Pierre Grc parent.

836
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,170
Yeah,

837
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:28,540
I agree.

838
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,980
I think we might begin honey Dick,

839
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:33,220
if George Saint Pierre does happen
just shell up at UFC 200 it's like,

840
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:34,110
wait a sec.

841
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:34,720
Well,

842
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,980
George has openly said that he wants to
go to a camp and decide whether or not

843
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:39,401
he could do it.

844
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:40,180
At the end of it,

845
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,013
he's done it.

846
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,241
Did he go through the,

847
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:43,030
the prep camp?

848
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,863
That's what I heard.

849
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,733
When did you hear this?

850
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,390
You got the inside scoop.

851
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:46,581
Dot.

852
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:47,010
I mean,

853
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,680
I know he's been training a shit load
and I know he doesn't care about belts or

854
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:50,891
anything.

855
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:51,820
He just wants to take the fight.

856
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,900
You know what the holdup is?

857
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,920
Why Reebok?

858
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,920
Okay,

859
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,270
that's awful.

860
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,110
Oh,

861
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,850
well you're George Saint Pierre
sponsored by under Armour.

862
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,230
And then how many fights do you have?

863
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:02,861
And Reebok's.

864
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:03,191
And we're like,

865
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:03,401
yeah,

866
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:04,570
here's whatever,

867
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,610
50 grand where these Reebok pumps.

868
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:06,821
He's like,

869
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:07,690
what the fuck?

870
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:08,141
No Man,

871
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:09,130
I'm George Saint Pierre.

872
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,660
So he's saying either the USC has to
make up for it in his purse or Reebok has

873
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:14,440
make up for it.

874
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,730
So I think it's a money thing right now.

875
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,593
Really?

876
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,150
That's what you hear is this inside scoop.

877
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,900
I don't know,

878
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,140
man.

879
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,650
We just scooped a shit out of this.

880
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,213
That's what I hear.

881
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,160
Well,

882
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,590
I had been hearing
rumblings of negotiations,

883
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,933
but uh,

884
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,661
you know,

885
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,270
it's one of those things you don't
want to hope he wanted to just wait,

886
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,990
but also I only got,

887
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,843
you can save the code.

888
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,140
Well he would,

889
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,970
he would most certainly saved the card.

890
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,133
Oh my God.

891
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,780
You know,

892
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,480
it would be crazy.

893
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,470
Would be him and,

894
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,303
and Connor.

895
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,871
I man,

896
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:45,800
that's fucking nuts.

897
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,380
Tim.

898
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,830
Encounter Madison Square
Garden to what you would,

899
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,390
it was not enough seats there.

900
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,530
No,

901
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,640
there'd be full of just fucking GSP versus
it looked like the Oscars is just be

902
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:56,930
as crowd full of celebrities.

903
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,460
Regular folk can afford the tickets,

904
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,440
especially if you get angry GSP GSP
that wanted to punish Bj Penn GSP.

905
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,290
I think it's really tough to bring it out.

906
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,870
But you didn't like rush rush.

907
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,330
Yeah.

908
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,120
Yeah man.

909
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,310
Yeah.

910
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,330
He was a motherfucker.

911
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,571
Oh,

912
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:16,571
GSP was one of the weirder guys because
he was such a nice guy at all times slot

913
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,590
when guys fucked with him.

914
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,640
There was this,

915
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,900
this switch that would go off in that
head and he would go on seek and destroy

916
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,940
mode and he was so good at it.

917
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,850
Man when he fucked up
Bj Penn fucked up Fitch,

918
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:29,641
you,

919
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,400
you wash those fights and you just go,

920
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:34,850
that is arguably the greatest
welterweight of all time.

921
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,710
I agree.

922
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,081
I mean,

923
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,650
his ability to mix up the
strikes and the take downs.

924
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,210
We never knew what the fuck was going on.

925
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,690
His,

926
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,180
his constant victories and a scrambles,

927
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,201
you know,

928
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:48,050
and the Bj fight to where
he was punishing Bj,

929
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,520
he wanted to punish him.

930
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:49,941
And when he,

931
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:53,480
when he beat him down and didn't stop
them and then walked over to the wall and

932
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:54,950
fucking punched it afterwards,

933
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,230
that's the motherfucker now.

934
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,180
Does he come back or do we get that that
safe GSP cause a safe GSP verse condom?

935
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:02,501
We're not trying,

936
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:03,470
I'm not trying to see that.

937
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,020
There's a lot,

938
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,570
there's a long time gone.

939
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,530
Who knows?

940
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,410
Who knows where G we're
talking about GSP and Bj.

941
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,090
Bj Penn's coming back to,

942
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,481
yeah,

943
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:12,800
well I'm a,

944
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,600
I'm excited to see what that looks like.

945
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,160
Bj's fight in Tennessee.

946
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,700
Vre and he's been at Jackson Winkeljohn
his camp for quite a while now.

947
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,090
So I'm assuming they're not
letting him cut any corners.

948
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:23,631
Uh,

949
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,450
not really running them
through the real paces.

950
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,840
If,

951
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
if you're at Jackson's,

952
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,770
there's no cutting corners.

953
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:28,610
If you do your skin,

954
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,740
you're asked Molly Wahpeton,

955
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,950
then you wouldn't be there that long.

956
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,251
Right.

957
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,084
And get back on a plane,

958
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,540
go home.

959
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,200
And why would he,

960
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
I mean he's been living out
there for quite a while now.

961
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,853
Hawaii down.

962
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,630
That'd be pretty legit.

963
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:39,890
GSP Negotiating Uba.

964
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,840
UFC returned,

965
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:43,670
but Reebok deal considers
roadblock or there's a story.

966
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,700
Mm hmm.

967
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,521
Yeah man.

968
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:47,354
I don't know.

969
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,700
Just this whole thing bums me out.

970
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,680
It was complicated.

971
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,640
We'll see.

972
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,570
We'll see what happens.

973
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,000
But man,

974
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,401
hope you can.

975
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:56,450
That would be the 200 to end it.

976
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,180
If you think you saved from
asking square guy and fuck,

977
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,430
do you think that would be Nate versus
GSP of Connor doesn't do the car.

978
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:03,950
So Connor's not on the card anymore.

979
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,851
He's off today.

980
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,140
He said I'm down to fight.

981
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,173
He even goes,

982
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,260
I will fly to New York
and do a press conference,

983
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,280
but then I gotta go back.

984
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,900
So he's given a little wiggle room.

985
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,830
I think it's time to drop the egos come
to agreement and save 200 let Connie

986
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,640
[inaudible] name is Brennan
Shab the reasonable one.

987
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,320
How is this possible haired dude
houses fossil Kenogenic Diet?

988
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,160
Kido kid,

989
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,690
I was super positive.

990
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,980
Super clear mind.

991
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,570
I like everyone and I hope they work
that out for UFC 200 it'd be even better

992
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:36,230
story if they're worked there too.

993
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,350
They do get,

994
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,000
they do.

995
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,660
I would almost guarantee they do
or they do a GSP Nate Diaz fight.

996
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,000
Then we got honey dick and
then something smells fishy.

997
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,440
Something smells fishy for sure.

998
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,310
If GSP is like,

999
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,070
what?

1000
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,270
Hey,

1001
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,103
I've been training.

1002
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,650
What if they come with the cash that come
with that fucking Reebok makeup money?

1003
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,040
I bet you,

1004
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I bet you everybody has a set of
Reebok pumps in 6 million share.

1005
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,820
You go push it in for us.

1006
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,290
Shit in.

1007
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,530
We're all in for GSP.

1008
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,081
I think a,

1009
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,040
I bet they figured it out.

1010
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,880
Yeah,

1011
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,210
I bet.

1012
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,250
I Bet Yukon or ends up fighting on UFC 200

1013
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,340
that's why.

1014
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,730
That's what I believe in,

1015
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:11,031
and that's,

1016
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,910
I think Dana and the UFC
brass gonna figure it out.

1017
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:18,140
I think GSP Nate Diaz takes its place
and they use it as a negotiating tool

1018
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:21,080
because the paper view numbers are bigger
than any of the Connor fights because

1019
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,870
the UFC has in fact grown
through their strategy.

1020
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:24,920
See,

1021
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,450
I don't think the numbers beat Connors.

1022
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,313
What if they do?

1023
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,681
Well,

1024
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:28,220
then you got,

1025
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,550
then,

1026
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:28,671
hey,

1027
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,520
then Connor's GSP and Nate
Diaz that you're like,

1028
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:31,910
Ooh,

1029
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,870
Connor fucked up.

1030
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,061
Yeah,

1031
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:33,894
I kind of fucked up.

1032
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,680
I don't think it beats as numbers though.

1033
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,830
[inaudible].
