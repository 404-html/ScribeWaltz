00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,900
The Joe Rogan experience podcast.
Full charges here.

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,360
Can you type in and not look at the 
screen?

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,820
Yeah.
I took a typing class in high school.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,560
Had no idea I was going to pay off.
So huge.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,660
I can barely do it.
I kind of do it.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,870
My mom was a receptionist.
I can type it runs in the bloodline.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,680
Crazy,
bro.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,690
You got skills to pay the bills.
Even if this comedy thing doesn't work 

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,030
out,
I can still type like a Kelly girl.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,550
Fuck.
That's amazing.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,060
That's amazing.
I wish that was still a thing.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So full motherfucking child.
It's good to be here on a special day.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,230
Good to.
Good to be here with your brother.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,660
Um,
comedy store tonight.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,720
Oh yeah.
My first set of the comedy store in 

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:58,720
seven years.
I went there the other night.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,080
It was just too much fun.
It's great.

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,660
I got to go back.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,450
It's not the same sadness that it turned
into when you left.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,770
No,
it's way more upbeat.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,360
It's crazy.
The management's great.

22
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,160
Everybody's like all professional and 
everything.

23
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,790
Like a in that show they do that roast 
battle show.

24
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,930
Holy Shit.
Is that,

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,620
that might be one of the best shows like
for an audience member to attend in La.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
It's fun.
It's so fun.

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,910
It's so well done.
All those dudes that are in the.

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,910
Well this week there were terrorism guys
and some weeks there are black guys.

29
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,200
What do they call the Negro Wave League?
What do they call it?

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,390
Oh my gosh.
Watkins who's also the host of the desk 

31
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,900
bod pod podcast.
Thunderpussy is a hilarious comic on,

32
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,950
you know,
in his own right,

33
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:41,951
but he's a part of this little group 
that during the roast battle when our 

34
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:45,630
joke does really well,
they run on stage and do these crazy 

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,420
antics and the terrorist guys joke 
murdered.

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,810
It just murdered and they ran on stage 
and they water boarded to dude.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,190
They threw a towel over his mouth.
Poured water in his mouth.

38
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,410
I mean cause like,
you know what it's like when when 

39
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,711
someone kills with a bit shit.
And this is a small room where we saw 

40
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:08,081
this is in the belly room.
The comments to which might hold 100 

41
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:11,261
people if you stuffed to the gills.
That might've been 100 people in there 

42
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,170
that night.
Hanging out the window is everything.

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,200
I mean,
people would just see just crammed into 

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,340
this fucking spot.
And uh,

45
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,510
we had a great fucking time.
We really had a good time.

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,990
I saw Joe joke over so well one time and
the Negro wave league,

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,260
there was one white guy and they threw 
all this paper on the ground at first,

48
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,290
just kind of for the sketch started and 
they start picking it up and his cotton 

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,500
face because it's white guy starts 
whipping them all.

50
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,930
Oh my God,
they got a whites only section that says

51
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,000
racist shit.
Totally Racist Shit.

52
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:46,001
And is a sign on their table that says 
whites only really good and you know,

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,090
it's just fucking good.
And Brian Moses who hosts it,

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,920
he's fucking funny,
man.

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,010
Funny.
And he's great at that Gig.

56
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,130
It's reminiscent of eight mile and the 
whole the MC battles and he's very MCI

57
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,310
for whatever that guy's name.
You know what I like to that he says,

58
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,540
Hey,
at the end of it all,

59
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,980
we hug it out.
Yeah.

60
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,180
You know,
I liked them.

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Not like it comes,
the whole thing comes off like what it 

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,280
is.
It's a joke writing contest.

63
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,090
Did you know that if two white guys go 
head to head that they're allowed to say

64
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,600
the n word once each?
I didn't know that.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,090
Yeah,
yeah,

66
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:24,091
yeah.
They allowed to allow me to put their 

67
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:27,781
phones in a basket when they go into 
that because someday someone's going to 

68
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:30,430
be on stage and the people that are like
on fucking whatever,

69
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,700
you know,
super progressive blog that gets US 

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,450
radio.
I'm sure Brian said something about it 

71
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:39,450
the other night.
He goes,

72
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,120
listen,
if you get easily offended,

73
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,820
get the fuck outta here.
What happened on a blog?

74
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,910
Somebody wrote about like,
you know the n the n word is thrown 

75
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,770
around a lot in that room from the 
whites only from the black guys,

76
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:55,210
from the judges,
from the all Negro wave crew.

77
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,780
They say it a lot and who is the was 
somebody went home and blogged about it.

78
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,870
Really?
Yeah.

79
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,830
As that's how it goes down now.
Los Angeles,

80
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:07,831
the comedy store giving white comics as 
you're saying,

81
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,010
it's gotten more professional at the 
comedy store,

82
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,220
but that's so far old school that way.
It's so funny that someone,

83
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,490
first of all,
it's someone just doesn't get what 

84
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,400
they're doing at a place like the comedy
store in a show like the roast battle,

85
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,510
like the whole point of the thing is 
pushing it over the top way over the top

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,620
in the most ridiculous unrealistic.
No one's actually saying that it's 

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,550
almost the white section is almost 
progress.

88
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,760
The whole thing is pretty much progress 
in a lot of ways,

89
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,120
which is one of the reasons why 
Hinchcliffe fucking loves it.

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,160
It's fucking great.
Love it.

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,680
Great God damn show.
So I went there for that and then I went

92
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,010
there for red taping of his show and it 
was just too fun.

93
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,150
I was like,
I got to come back.

94
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,180
It just doesn't seem like what I was 
running from the old school vibe is 

95
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,580
there again,
like just,

96
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,410
I don't know,
it's just really cool.

97
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,000
It's like Swanky,
classy and,

98
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:06,010
but kinda dirty and down and out at the 
same time.

99
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,920
There's just no place like that and I 
felt it when I was there.

100
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,820
I was like,
this place,

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,600
there's something,
you know,

102
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,920
it used to be Ciro's nightclub in the 19
whatevers,

103
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:19,921
the early,
the Bugsy Siegel owned it and the story 

104
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,970
that we always heard from everybody 
there was at taunted and that a bunch of

105
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:26,971
people had been killed there and they 
say there's a sniper point in the green 

106
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:29,170
room looking down on them and well there
is not a sniper point,

107
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,940
but there's a small window.

108
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,610
But apparently it was like with Jerry 
Lewis wanted,

109
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,210
like Jerry Lewis wanted to watch the 
opening act so you could,

110
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,530
I guess know where they're at so he 
could get nervous,

111
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,750
you know,
she can get a view,

112
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,780
see how everything's going right now.
Like in case they didn't have cell 

113
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:45,780
phones,
it couldn't tech somebody,

114
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:45,780
uh,
you know,

115
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,500
it's,
this fucking crowd sucks at Dick.

116
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,720
He couldn't just,
no way to let each other know.

117
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,380
You couldn't call.
Hey,

118
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,670
just to let you know,
there's a guy,

119
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,850
a drunk guy in the front row.
And so I guess he just would watch the 

120
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,890
opening or maybe he's,
you know,

121
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,300
he's insecure you opening.
Yeah,

122
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,310
exactly.
There's kinds of tell you to take it 

123
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,201
down a notch.
I've got guys on the road like a work 

124
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:08,201
with guys and the guys tell him,
dude,

125
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,040
you're going a little too hard down.
Yeah,

126
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,900
I've,
I've had people tell me not to do 

127
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:15,900
certain jokes really,
that,

128
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,330
that really didn't kill their jokes.
You know what I mean?

129
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:17,810
Well,
well,

130
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,811
well did they tell you not to do it?
Like I was just starting out and I had 

131
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:26,711
this closer and it was very hip hop 
oriented and this guy and he's awesome 

132
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:30,971
comic.
I won't even say who it is because I 

133
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:30,971
think he's awesome.
But he was like,

134
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:35,231
Hey,
I got one hip hop joke so you can't 

135
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,971
throw it.
And it really hurt me at the time 

136
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:36,971
because it's all I really had,
you know.

137
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,060
But that's life.
That doesn't,

138
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,430
that doesn't seem too bad.

139
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
Oh,
that's a tricky one man.

140
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:47,681
You know,
I've worked with guys before and they 

141
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,020
were opening for me and they touch on 
the same subject that I'm going to touch

142
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:53,021
on later and so unless you already been 
doing a bit and then the dude does it 

143
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,900
and he's opening for you and then it's 
Kinda like you're paying someone to trip

144
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,730
you up,
you know,

145
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,130
you can.
That can,

146
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,310
that can be argued,
I guess.

147
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,820
Yeah,
we maybe it was,

148
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,830
it didn't harm is bit.
You said,

149
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:10,831
no way.
This guy is way too funny to have 

150
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:11,240
anything I say harm them,
but there's just like a maybe a paranoia

151
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,850
or something there,
you know,

152
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,400
maybe.
I don't know.

153
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,600
I was telling Brian earlier,
it's like all the road trick is just to 

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:19,600
go,
hey,

155
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,290
Brian was talking about this earlier and
then you do your fucking thing.

156
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,150
That is,
that's all you have to do.

157
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,770
Real.
Yeah.

158
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,150
That's the road trick.
Yeah.

159
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,160
And that's a great way to segue into it.
We don't pretend that it wasn't already 

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,640
discussed exactly 40 minutes ago where 
the subject wasn't.

161
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,610
Yeah.
The,

162
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,800
you know,
Brian Cowen had a,

163
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,590
an interaction with a guy on the road 
once and it was,

164
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:43,591
it was real weird because I was on 
Brian's side because Brian's a great 

165
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:44,360
friend,
but I was also not on the side,

166
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,490
you know,
it's hard.

167
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,730
He worked with some guy and the guy 
opened for him and the guy apparently in

168
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:56,180
the course of like his bombing,
like he wasn't doing so well,

169
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,990
he started talking to the crowd and like
telling the crowd just some shit that 

170
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:08,381
whatever,
just something about like the way they 

171
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,980
were reacting or the way the show is 
going to be for the rest of it.

172
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,980
It was some non funny thing.
We were just talking to them and Brian 

173
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Goes,
what are you doing?

174
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,760
Like why,
why are you just talking to them?

175
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,660
And he goes,
hey man,

176
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,980
that's my time on stage.
He's like,

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,010
no,
you're opening up for me and you weird.

178
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:23,540
And the whole crowd out.
He just like started bombing.

179
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:28,541
Then he started talking about comedy or 
talking about why they're not laughing 

180
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,720
at you or whatever the fuck it was.
I don't remember specifically,

181
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,130
but I remember thinking like,
man,

182
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,280
I kind of see both sides part like the 
guy sucked,

183
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,930
right?
It wasn't doing well,

184
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,610
but we all sucked at one point in time.
Like how do you not suck?

185
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,210
And that's also how you get past sucking
is to go.

186
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,040
All right,
jokes are off the table.

187
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,130
I'm just going to talk like a regular 
human being now.

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Sort of maybe your jokes are not funny 
about.

189
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,220
I mean there's a bunch of things that 
you do,

190
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,730
but you know,
it's weird when a guy tells you not to 

191
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:01,730
do something,
it is in you.

192
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,590
Just like,
oh,

193
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,220
I don't know,
like the only thing that I could see.

194
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,950
It's like what I said earlier,
I'd say if you have your bit about uh,

195
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,010
the Dolphin bit,
like if you had a guy who went on before

196
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:16,011
you who also did like a super similar 
bit about having sex with something like

197
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,090
really similar,
you know,

198
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,280
like a monkey or something like that.
Something smart,

199
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,370
you know,
you can be like super trippy.

200
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,870
Like it would trip you up.
Meaning,

201
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,520
you know,
like if you went up and did your bid,

202
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,300
the whole premise has been kind of 
beaten down even if it's a different.

203
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,110
Yeah.

204
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,350
Yeah.
And that's my dolphin bed actually 

205
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,031
started as a sex type joke about having 
sex with a dolphin and then now it's 

206
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:38,031
nine

207
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,430
has nothing to do with sex,
with adults.

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Isn't that interesting how that happens?
It's like when you come up with a bit 

209
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,460
like it starts off as like a seed and 
then from there it goes off and 

210
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,150
sometimes like just a tag line becomes a
totally different branch that becomes a 

211
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,651
totally different tree and,
and a lot of the lines come from our 

212
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,710
eating didn't get a laugh at first and 
then you're trying to save it and then 

213
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,660
you're on a totally different page in.
There's just some weirdness in the room.

214
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,930
You went left when you should've went 
right and a new line just pops into your

215
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:05,880
head.
Absolutely.

216
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:09,580
Whatever weird reason.
That's why I like the act of comedy,

217
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:12,100
like creating comedy is so it's so 
complicated.

218
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,420
There's no,
no one exactly knows where all that 

219
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,351
shit's coming from.
It seems like the only consistent thing 

220
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,051
that seems to work for me,
because you just got to do a ton of 

221
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:22,051
sets.

222
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:22,051
Yeah,
it's about.

223
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,981
It's about doing it because like you can
sit there and memorize your bit and 

224
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:26,350
you're like,
it's got to go exactly like this.

225
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,900
You do it exactly like that.
It doesn't go over that well.

226
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:33,901
Then you start talking,
you start riffing and all of a sudden 

227
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:34,840
all this stuff you just made up on the 
spot is way funnier,

228
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,320
way funnier.
Sometimes you need the audience there.

229
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,040
Dick Sandwich sign.
Sometimes it's Dick and poop on bread.

230
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,200
Yeah.
And you just gotta eat it.

231
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,020
You got to eat it like you like it.
So it's kind of get that.

232
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:47,980
Brian was saying,
Hey,

233
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,860
this guy's bombing out the crowd before 
my,

234
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,780
my set.
But then I kinda get that this guy is,

235
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,060
you know,
he's just doing a shit.

236
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,520
That's why I take guys I know with me on
the road.

237
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Absolutely way I know.
I know what already does.

238
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,910
Doesn't know what Brian does.
I know what you know.

239
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,480
We know what everybody does and it's 
funny.

240
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,660
So you get to enjoy it,
like I like enjoying the worst is when 

241
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,750
you don't like your guy and you're 
working with them and then they laugh at

242
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,640
him and you're like,
what happened to this guy?

243
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,210
Or it's like,
yeah,

244
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:19,540
it's like if they liked this shit,
are they going to like la?

245
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,960
But even if they do,
you're like,

246
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,210
I don't even like you guys saw what you 
liked the like awfulness.

247
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,750
One thing that we ran into I last week 
in Toronto is all there.

248
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,760
People were really funny but like 
getting people that you don't know 

249
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:34,760
thrown up in front of you,
you know,

250
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,880
because it could go really bad and it 
could go really good,

251
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:42,881
you know?
Luckily there was a lot of funny people 

252
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:42,881
in Toronto,
but you know,

253
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:45,761
we did this one show and this one guy 
who opened it up did 10 minutes opening.

254
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:50,630
He was only supposed to do five and it 
was some of the worst comedy you ever.

255
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,990
It's one of those words that guy's 
screaming at the eye,

256
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,880
right?
Right.

257
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,160
Guys.

258
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,230
Like,
like trying to make them say yes,

259
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,040
you're right.
All right,

260
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,100
that's fun.
You know,

261
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,120
homeboys in a panic.
Was it angry?

262
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,920
It was just loud,
loud in just inexperienced and just like

263
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,110
the audience just sat there and watched 
him,

264
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,510
but he was like trying to get them like,
no,

265
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,700
you have to respond,
respond,

266
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,380
you know,
it was bullying,

267
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,480
bullying,
bullying.

268
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,770
Well you know what it is,
man.

269
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:22,771
It's just misguided energy.
He's just trying to get a result and 

270
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:23,140
it's just not happening.
So he thinks that he's just really big.

271
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,050
Like people will like watch some standup
and they go,

272
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:27,070
oh,
I know how to make it.

273
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,270
I know how to do it.
Sure.

274
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm going to do with Kevin Hart's House.
I'm just going to do that kind of thing 

275
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,380
and we'll just literally try to emulate.
But Kevin Hart's funny is his funny.

276
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,430
He knows how to do that.

277
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,430
Funny.
Like if you try to do that funny it 

278
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,561
could fuck you up.
And definitely it'll definitely like 

279
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:45,820
sort of hide what ever real funny is 
inside of you.

280
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,720
You'll be trying to be Dane Cook.
You'll be trying to be Steve Byrne,

281
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,370
you know,
whoever it is that you think is funny.

282
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,840
And when you do that,
man,

283
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,730
it can really fuck with your head.
Absolutely.

284
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,150
It takes so many years.
It takes longer and comedy than anything

285
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:58,750
else.
Right.

286
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,270
Neurosurgery is probably weird.
Comedy,

287
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,600
I think.
I think a bunch of things you do quicker

288
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:09,601
than or they would take a way longer 
time than being able to get a laugh 

289
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,630
consistently.
You're right about that,

290
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,260
but doesn't it take most guys like three
years to even be somewhat funny?

291
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,290
Sometimes.
Some didn't really funny out of the 

292
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:19,290
gate,
like with her a couple of years.

293
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,531
Like it depends on how much alcoholics 
anonymous they've had up in front of 

294
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:22,531
those people and talk.

295
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:23,800
How about substitute teaching?
They've done,

296
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,910
do we have guy back in Boston?
A rest his soul.

297
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,700
He's passed since.
But his name is Dave Fitzgerald.

298
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,290
And it was a funny guy,
man.

299
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,100
And he fucking.
He learned how to do stand up completely

300
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:38,950
from a do an alcoholics anonymous 
speeches.

301
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,430
He was a guy who like was longstanding 
drunk,

302
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,170
you know,
and then got his shit together.

303
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,240
Started doing stand up at these 
meetings.

304
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,170
Started telling us stories and the 
stories were fucking hilarious.

305
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,830
His stories of excess and just had a 
great delivery and timing.

306
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,890
Yeah.
That fucking guy was a solid 

307
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:58,890
professional like inside of a year.
Nice.

308
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,190
He just,
for whatever reason,

309
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,980
like we were all like marveling at him.
Like the guy used to be a drunk,

310
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:05,070
but look at how organized he is,
you know,

311
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,590
he's constantly performing and 
networking and he got sick.

312
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,620
I don't know whatever happened to the 
guy but something,

313
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:12,880
some cancer or something.

314
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,770
He died.
A couple of guys from Boston were really

315
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,820
funny.
Died of cancer,

316
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,630
but this guy,
my point being that he did something 

317
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:21,630
else,
like if you do something else,

318
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,650
like some guys like uh,
like your buddy was in bands.

319
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,390
I'm Dean Delray,
Dean del.

320
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,050
Right,
right.

321
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,840
And like being on stage all the time and
being in bands.

322
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,050
He had a point about that.
It's like kind of understand what it's 

323
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,400
like to be on stage so that,
that part of it is not as difficult.

324
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,210
Right.
Yeah.

325
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,760
I mean he jumped into it pretty quick,
you know what I mean?

326
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:40,810
He started,
I don't know,

327
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:41,950
like five,
six years ago,

328
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:46,951
but he had been in a band for 25 years 
and he toured with some of some major 

329
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:47,800
acts.
Yeah.

330
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,970
Uh,
so yeah,

331
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,430
he,
he,

332
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,980
I mean I used to do open mic him at the 
beginning

333
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,820
and he jumped right into it.
Well,

334
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,210
they've got to get him on.
He's got some funny stories.

335
00:14:56,211 --> 00:15:01,211
I saw him on his podcast.
It was really funny because he's toured 

336
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:01,880
with bands for what,
like decades,

337
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,670
right?
He's got a story.

338
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,260
We'll go to the Dama rare one.
He's got a student,

339
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:11,261
don't go to it now,
but I mean if people listening to this 

340
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:11,930
go to the dom irrera podcasts and he's 
got the story about,

341
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,200
I think it's Joe Walsh shitting his 
pants on stage.

342
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,080
They put waiters on because they were 
gonna fire him.

343
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,630
Like he really did have diarrhea,
but he was such a mess.

344
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,310
He was constantly missing shows and 
Shit.

345
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,330
So they were like,
dude,

346
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:28,331
if you do this,
they're going to fucking sue you like 

347
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:28,331
you,
you got to perform.

348
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,410
So he put fishing waders on it.
Just shit his pants while he was onstage

349
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,210
and it's,
it's dean.

350
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,310
Dean does a great job telling the story.
It's really,

351
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,410
really fucking funny and it's a good 
podcast.

352
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:41,411
So Dom irrera has a live from the laugh 
factory with dom irrera and can't say 

353
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,460
enough things about dom.
Check it out.

354
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,410
Shit.
I love that guy.

355
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,720
He's just so classic.
He's the man.

356
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:50,280
He's so classic.
He was always funny and in,

357
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,940
you know,
when he's at his best in situations like

358
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:54,200
Thunderpussy,
you know,

359
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,720
like when he was judging Thunderpussy Oh
my God,

360
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,620
he's a murderer.
He killed Tony.

361
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,210
Tony.
Oh,

362
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,670
United States on diversity yet you don't
judge thunderpussy killed Tony,

363
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,400
you know the,
the one with the cliffs obviously.

364
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,730
But he's so fucking funny on it.
The one he and I did,

365
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:10,320
it was just so good.
He's such a cool,

366
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:15,321
like I love a classic standup comic book
that with the attitude and the authority

367
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,410
and just the jokes and the whole deal,
the whole deal,

368
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,260
the whole deal just loved that car.

369
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,590
So,
uh,

370
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,770
you know,
I saw him the other day to joey was 

371
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:26,770
there the other day at the comedy store 
too.

372
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,910
It just felt great.
It felt great to just be there.

373
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,040
It's weird.
I was watching the uh,

374
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,180
I was watching the youtubes last night 
with you fight and hosting the show 

375
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:40,880
tonight.
That would be hilarious.

376
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,940
I almost asked you should ask.
I think if that would've been,

377
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,180
it would've been the funny shit of all 
time and say yet I was actually on that 

378
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,181
show that night.
I opened up the show that you really 

379
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:52,880
have 2007.
It was a 2007,

380
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,890
I believe it was February or something.
Yeah.

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,870
I still have the seven page letter that 
crazy sent me from the comedy store.

382
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,630
So did you get in trouble with the 
comedy store after that?

383
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,010
A little bit or something like that.
What exactly did they say?

384
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,850
It's a long story.
A guy behind it is gone.

385
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,270
Gotcha.
It's all,

386
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,550
it's different there.
I went there the other night too,

387
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:15,420
man.
And when he was filming a special,

388
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:20,210
I plopped myself down next to polly and 
I almost shit myself because people were

389
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:20,570
like,
dude,

390
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,940
go look inside this room right now.
And I look over and I'm like,

391
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,600
what?
Joe?

392
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,180
And polly's sitting there talking,
well I looked at him like,

393
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,120
I don't have a problem with this dude.
Go be friendly with this dude.

394
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,130
I just sat down next time I shook his 
hand and we had a nice little 

395
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,130
conversation.
We have a nice little conversation about

396
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,680
how happy he was that he was doing the 
special in the original room.

397
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,940
Really cool.
And I was like,

398
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,840
yeah,
I mean it's a classic room and you know.

399
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,550
And Paula was like,
yeah.

400
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:45,551
And he's so comfortable here.
Like he was a nice little conversation 

401
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:45,551
we had.
So it was good.

402
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:45,551
Yeah,
he's very.

403
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:49,290
A poly is very matured now.
It seems like the more I lately

404
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,140
I think it's totally unfair to judge,
judge,

405
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,100
judge anybody based on who they were.
And then you kind of know who they are.

406
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:04,101
But to say that that's who you are that 
defines you right now in this current 

407
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:04,101
moment.
It's pretty unfair,

408
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,390
so I,
I try not to do it as much as possible,

409
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,740
but there's,
you know,

410
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:10,170
there's obviously exceptions like Ted 
Bundy was out.

411
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,520
I'd probably have to kill.
I'm sure.

412
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,580
You know what I'm saying?
Like the certain dudes like you can't 

413
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,401
get away with what you can't cut women's
pussies out and put them on your head 

414
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:21,390
and some things you can't shake on 
photos and then you get out of jail.

415
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,340
And then I'm gonna yeah,
you did that in the past.

416
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,390
We're going to judge you on that.
We're going to hold you to that which is

417
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:27,490
going to end it for you.

418
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,730
But,
but you know,

419
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,020
there's,
there's people that you become enemies 

420
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,341
with that.
It's almost like getting a pattern of 

421
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:38,740
remaining their enemy.
So it's like,

422
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,240
and that was never enemies with poly 
entries had been been CEO.

423
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Never really enemies with poly.
But you get into this sort of a thing 

424
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,020
where it's,
this is just what we do.

425
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,760
You know,
we can't just let it go.

426
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:55,761
Like I fucking hate that fucking guy.
What he tried to do to me and fucking 

427
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,151
this and that.
And then he turned around when the shit 

428
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,280
goes on for like years and years where 
you think the echoes of one conversation

429
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:06,510
or the echoes of one interaction can 
remain with you for your whole life just

430
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,640
because you choose it,
that person remains your enemy.

431
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:12,300
You put so much vested interest in 
energy into it's a complete waste.

432
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,750
And if you can just,
whenever you have like these little 

433
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,230
conflicts with people just as many times
as possible,

434
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,190
resolve them.

435
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:25,370
Absolutely.
You'd be amazed at the psychic weight 

436
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,860
that's lifted off your soul when you do 
that.

437
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,980
I think you're in a really negative 
space every time you think about that.

438
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,610
Totally.
Yeah,

439
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,380
totally.
Yeah.

440
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,130
People that you have,
like there's.

441
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,260
There's some conflict in life that it's 
unnecessarily necessary.

442
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,900
You know,
it's necessary,

443
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,730
but it's unnecessary in the sense that 
if we were all living in Utopia,

444
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:50,610
if we all had our shit together,
if everybody was cool and balanced,

445
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,670
it wouldn't be taking place.
But the vast majority of conflict 

446
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,161
wouldn't be taken place.
Because if you really think about how 

447
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:03,351
many people there are on earth and think
about how little actual conflict or is 

448
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,990
everybody was always wants to dwell on 
the horrible aspects of our current 

449
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,071
existence.
They won't get Iraq and Afghanistan and 

450
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,920
murder and crime and a woman walked down
New York City Street for 10 hours and 

451
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,640
all she got was met at wanted to fuck 
her.

452
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,130
You know,
I understand that.

453
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,020
That's an issue.
I do understand.

454
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,100
Look,
I have daughters.

455
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,490
I have a mom.
I don't want anybody feeling harassed by

456
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,500
a bunch of apes shares because some 
dudes like,

457
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,020
Yo,
Yo,

458
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,660
I got some.
I got a picture on my wall.

459
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,520
I think I've told,
talked about it before,

460
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,940
but it's for like 1951.
It's an American woman in uh,

461
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,910
in Italy and she's walking down the 
street.

462
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:43,911
Have you ever seen it?
It's a classic image of it's huge 

463
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,540
picture and it's these guys from like 
1940 or whatever the fuck it is.

464
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,360
And they're holding a dick.
Say,

465
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,700
hey,
with this fucking broad,

466
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,160
oh,
I ripped us congee,

467
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:57,170
Lo va with a fucking piece of this.
And this is like,

468
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,060
I used to think that people were like 
fucking father knows best back then.

469
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,900
Well,
you know,

470
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:02,710
I,
I heard that.

471
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,840
I mean obviously those guys actually 
acted like that.

472
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,140
But I read that that photo was somewhat 
staged in that they did a couple takes 

473
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,290
of it.
No.

474
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,950
And they knew they were going to get the
picture.

475
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,610
They knew they were going to get it.
Dude,

476
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,990
that's reality TV.
And in 1951 or whatever it was,

477
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,100
what year is it,
Brian?

478
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:23,101
Does it say I'd love that picture.
She knew the photographers and they set 

479
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,550
that up kind of.
I mean,

480
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,570
even though they're actually really a 
boss yelling at her,

481
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,440
those are really,
that's real.

482
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,100
That's my people.
That's my ancestors.

483
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,090
Savaging monkey folk.
They're savage monkey folk.

484
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,890
I'm allowed to say that because I'm 
Italian.

485
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,990
I'm glad that I'm Italian because I 
could shit on an Italian behavior.

486
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,020
Some Italian behavior.
Nineteen 51 and 51 and their animals 

487
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,510
look at them.
But Tony Hinchcliffe,

488
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,140
you know the woman walking down the 
streets in New York,

489
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,160
some of it they should've just not left 
in the video because it really fuck with

490
00:21:57,161 --> 00:22:00,160
their point because some of it was like,
God bless you.

491
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,410
Beautiful Day.
You look beautiful.

492
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,700
Some of them,
I mean,

493
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,290
come on,
people meet each other.

494
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,840
What they,
what,

495
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,920
what bothered me a lot,
which is one guy who stood next to her 

496
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
and kept walking with.
That guy was a creep.

497
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,330
Yeah,
because a piece of shit.

498
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:18,331
There was a couple of guys that were 
real legit piece of shit and that I 

499
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:20,590
think should have been highlighted in 
that video that these guys are out there

500
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:21,910
and that a girl could get,
you know,

501
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,980
your wife,
your girl,

502
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:28,210
your mom stuck next to some asshole 
who's creeping on her.

503
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,310
That was real.
But you know,

504
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,180
hey,
beautiful.

505
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,670
Bless you.
I got a lot of shit because I said I 

506
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:36,680
just tweeted that video when it came out
and I said,

507
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,570
God,
this has to be annoying.

508
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Because I was thinking if it was me just
trying to walk down the street for me,

509
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,700
that would drive me crazy.
Just be able to high five the dues and 

510
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,191
keep walking,
stick their penis inside you and 

511
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:54,920
ejaculate.
I don't want any interaction with people

512
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,960
that I don't know.
How great would it be?

513
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:01,961
What are you doing?
Why are you doing shows and why you're 

514
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:04,210
doing a podcast show because these 
people know me more than anyone telling 

515
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,800
me no.
In real life.

516
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,830
You wouldn't like to walk down the 
street and have girls try to fuck you 

517
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,830
all day long.
No.

518
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,070
Hold up.
These people know you more than anybody 

519
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,690
in real life.
You mean people listen to the podcast.

520
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,740
People that listen to the podcast know 
me more than like my friends back home 

521
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:20,740
in Ohio.
Well,

522
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,511
they listen to the podcast or my sister 
because these people know hours and 

523
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
hours and years and years of almost a 
biography of all this is the last place 

524
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,500
you want people to judge you on.
This podcast is literally

525
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,250
last place on earth,
right?

526
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,030
You should have like,
this is basically me,

527
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,090
like someone like a smash house made a 
compilation of you,

528
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:42,300
like if you're confused as to who Brian 
is,

529
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,260
watch this.
Those

530
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,720
guys are walking down the street that 
has to be running at you.

531
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:49,910
Asking questions.
Hey,

532
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,980
do you believe in evolution wire black 
Dick.

533
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:56,650
So much more delicious.
Brian didn't take it.

534
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,380
Take it.
This is how I am.

535
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,910
If I were to imagine my sister walking 
down the street and this happened to my 

536
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,171
sister nonstop,
I would be pissed off if all these guys 

537
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:11,441
are pretty much just like,
you know like hawks in a wounded animal,

538
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:11,720
you know?

539
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,610
Well some of them,
but some of them were like,

540
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:15,480
Hey,
beautiful.

541
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,710
I like she would walk by,
Hey,

542
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:17,630
beautiful.
Right?

543
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,470
And here's something that someone told 
me online them I read this.

544
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,890
Someone was saying that they have a 
friend who's a girl who's from South 

545
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,580
America and in South America.
Women like it.

546
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah,
we will be upset if they made cat calls 

547
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,591
the illegal what?
Girls like it when they walk down the 

548
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:37,591
street and guys talk,

549
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:38,280
Hey baby,
what's up baby?

550
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,930
Because their butts or swallow,
they're wanting to make it

551
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,480
in estrus.
I'm not.

552
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,510
I don't think that's the issue.
I think the issue is that they,

553
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,650
it's a different culture and that our 
culture is becoming hypersensitive,

554
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,900
acutely aware of sexual assault and rape
and they,

555
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,340
they connect every single act of.
I won't even say aggression,

556
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,420
but like enthusiastic courting,
like on the street,

557
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:09,980
like even an unrealistic like Yo baby 
won't come park that shit on my face.

558
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,310
Is that ever worked ever backed up and 
just planted her ass on dude's face when

559
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:17,350
he said that?
Probably.

560
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,580
Yeah.
No it works though.

561
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,080
Probably as your horn honk every.
That's how my parents met.

562
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,110
You could honk your horn,
you could yell out the window.

563
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,350
All that stuff is valid.
Do you remember checks out?

564
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,410
Do you remember?
Like a year ago I told you that I was 

565
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:34,410
trying an experiment where I would add 
lights out,

566
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,590
like honk the horn and be like hey,
what's up?

567
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:40,591
What's up kitty?
And like talk to people and cars and it 

568
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:44,101
was really uncomfortable to do what 
would happen and it really was girl just

569
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:47,350
sitting there like,
don't look,

570
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,340
don't look over.
And that's what I feel like that,

571
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,720
you know,
like even if you say,

572
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:53,380
Hey,
beautiful,

573
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:54,730
hey,
beautiful girls are like,

574
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:55,560
come on man.
Like,

575
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,710
like,
leave me alone.

576
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:58,510
I'm just trying to walk for the most 
part.

577
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,070
I,
most girls,

578
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,770
the reality of being a woman,
but don't women,

579
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,830
uh,
accept or love aggressiveness on some 

580
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,651
level.
Maybe like a subtle aggressive because 

581
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,781
they don't like to do that.
That's not guys they liked though women,

582
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I

583
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,690
can appreciate a certain amount of 
aggression from a person that they like 

584
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,441
and trust,
but a certain amount of aggression like 

585
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:22,441
that kind of an aggression.
Sure.

586
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:23,230
The average person,
obviously there's going to be with women

587
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,900
and no one likes to say this.
There's going to be women that have rape

588
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:29,260
fantasies.
There's men who have rape fantasies.

589
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,200
Men who have rape fantasies of them 
being raped.

590
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,260
There's everybody,
there's.

591
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,660
Everybody has their own kink share now.
So there are some people that have like,

592
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,730
maybe they have fantasies,
like have you ever see that?

593
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,980
Louis ck jokes got a great joke about 
that,

594
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,010
about how we made out with this girl

595
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,010
and tried to push it and she said no.
And so he stopped and then the next day 

596
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,410
she's like,
what happened last night?

597
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,090
And he said what?
And she goes,

598
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:52,290
I thought you were just going to go for 
it.

599
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,500
And he's like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

600
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,660
She was like,
I was hoping you were just going to go 

601
00:26:59,660 --> 00:26:59,660
for it.
He goes,

602
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,080
what do you think I'm going to take a 
chance on the off chance that you're 

603
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,180
into it.
I'd be really into rape.

604
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,950
It's a really funny bit,
but it's like there are.

605
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,090
Those people do exist.
Absolutely.

606
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,200
But that said,
the majority of women don't want to be 

607
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,270
cat called when they walked on the 
street.

608
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,420
But this.
There's a difference between like some 

609
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,571
of what we saw on that video and some of
what you're just going to get when you 

610
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:20,571
pass by a group of men.

611
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:25,330
Right.
You know there's going to be a group of 

612
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:25,330
men that go,
God damn,

613
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,880
even if they don't look at you,
if you're hot and you walked by men,

614
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,850
they'll go cheat us is what is that?
Is that.

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,830
Is that cat calling?
Is that bad?

616
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I don't know.
But if you're wearing a fucking tiny 

617
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,561
miniskirt that's just clinging to your 
ass and you have high heels on and you 

618
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:43,521
smelled like the nectar of the Gods and 
you're walking past a group of men and 

619
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,670
there's more than two guys.
Yeah,

620
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,550
we're going to curse.
One guy is probably gonna.

621
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:48,670
Keep talking about shut.
Yeah.

622
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,680
There's something that happens when we 
get in packs of apes where it's almost 

623
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,090
like if you get over it exponentially 
gets more likely that someone's going to

624
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:01,091
say something or three almost.
And a lot of it is men trying to make 

625
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:01,091
each other laugh.

626
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:05,930
You know?
A lot of it is not even like trying to 

627
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,631
pick up the girl.
It's certainly not being considered the 

628
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:08,631
girl's feelings,
but a lot of is like,

629
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:09,180
Jesus,
what I would do to that,

630
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,750
you know,
and people fall down laughing or we make

631
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:14,950
each other laugh,
but there's a victim in that column.

632
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,150
We're to feel like shit.
I just curse quietly to myself.

633
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:23,151
I can't help.
I'm just gonna come kind of like that.

634
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,910
That's quieter.
Yeah.

635
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,370
You know,
just go Jesus Christ,

636
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:34,110
but it's in A.
I know it's positive,

637
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,750
but I keep it to myself because I don't 
like to make people feel uncomfortable.

638
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah.
Problem is,

639
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,010
isn't like there's five or six guys 
around.

640
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,050
That's when it gets uncomfortable and 
that's what you saw.

641
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,090
Like even like two or three when you 
saw,

642
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,120
when you saw like a lot of what she's 
getting catcalled it was dudes like 

643
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,140
almost making each other laugh as they 
were doing it as like passing the comedy

644
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:53,160
store on sunset.

645
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,600
If you're,
you know,

646
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,470
all the comics are sitting there on the 
patio.

647
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:57,840
Anytime a girl walks by like a mini 
dress.

648
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:02,841
It's just kind of what did you just do?
You're going to do social justice 

649
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,291
warriors going to be out on sunset,
going to strap a camera to the most 

650
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,980
attractive woman.
They could find the best.

651
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,350
The best looking one is passed back and 
forth.

652
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,420
Nothing.
That's a game show or that show right 

653
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,420
there.
Just go back and forth at the comedy.

654
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,320
We should make a show called I'm 
offended and just get offended at 

655
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,220
virtually everything.
You see the fucking latest thing.

656
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,540
I tweeted this today,
and this is.

657
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,670
This is not bullshit.
This is actually real.

658
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,850
There is a Portland,
Oregon teacher that is against peanut 

659
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:36,300
butter and jelly sandwiches because she 
says they're inherently racist.

660
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,400
That's peanut butter and jelly getting 
along post.

661
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,910
Okay.
Peanut butter and Jelly Racist

662
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,170
Portland school principal tie sandwich 
to white privilege.

663
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,790
This is where we are,
ladies and gentlemen in 2000 and fucking

664
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,650
14.
They're saying black people can't afford

665
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,330
it.
Oh Man,

666
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,530
I don't even.
I mean,

667
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I don't know why my trash isn't it?
Peanut butter and Jelly.

668
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,230
Okay.
Super White.

669
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,180
What about Somali or Hispanic students 
who might not eat sandwiches?

670
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,640
You?
Tara says according to the Tribune.

671
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,750
Another way would be to say Americans 
eat peanut butter and jelly.

672
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,270
Do you have anything like that?
Let me tell you.

673
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,900
Maybe they eat torta or Peta.
Ugh,

674
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,960
what the fuck is going on?
What the fuck is going on in this 

675
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,720
country?
For Real?

676
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,550
It's just a god peanut butter and Jelly 
Sandwich.

677
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,200
There's not even any meat in it.
You can't even get Vegan pissed.

678
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,080
I really think that what's.
I mean,

679
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:37,081
this is going to sound completely crazy,
but I really think that what's going on 

680
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:40,410
when we're becoming more and more 
hypersensitive and more and more aware 

681
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,521
of like these little things that don't 
mean a goddamn thing and focusing on 

682
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:47,791
them and spending all this energy while 
you have this finite amount of time in 

683
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:47,791
life.

684
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:48,880
I think people,
especially as we get older,

685
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,780
our fucking terrified of death were 
terrified of death,

686
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,920
of death,
of the planet,

687
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,090
of death,
of our children,

688
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,800
death of our friend's death,
of our loved ones,

689
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,080
and as it,
as things move on,

690
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:04,081
we concentrate more and more a 
nonsensical minutia more and more on 

691
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:06,690
Pulse Shit,
more stupidity and it just,

692
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,910
it gets more and more ridiculous and 
even intelligent people if that's the 

693
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,060
creepiest thing about these social 
justice warrior folks that are just.

694
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,490
Some of them are just completely out to 
lunch on some shit,

695
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,060
but one of the things about them is 
they're almost all well read,

696
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,120
almost all articulate,
almost all intelligent be at the 

697
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
beginning completely roped up and this 
nonsense like wha,

698
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,320
what do they call outs and the doxing 
and they're just spending all their time

699
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:33,510
online going after perceived slights and
some of it is legit.

700
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:35,010
Like this bill cosby Shit,
right?

701
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,450
That's legit,
but some of it is like peanut butter and

702
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:39,460
Jelly.
Fucking sandwiches are racist.

703
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,350
Like,
Oh,

704
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,520
what?
What are you doing?

705
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,770
You're an adult.
Couldn't be any less important.

706
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,720
You're not even an issue.
You're making up an issue now.

707
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,380
I think you're right.
You're,

708
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,440
you're definitely avoiding your more 
complicated thoughts when you start 

709
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,620
bringing trivia into your fucking brain.
Complete total trivia and I also think 

710
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:58,620
that.

711
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,820
I think it's just super bad for your 
brain.

712
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,640
It's super bad for your brain to 
concentrate too much on.

713
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Well,
especially if especially if it's making 

714
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:11,720
you angry because then you're just 
sitting in a chair anger,

715
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,770
angry,
and it's like you need to use that 

716
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:16,770
energy in other ways.
You know?

717
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,510
I mean,
it's just that basic primal like ready 

718
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,120
to fight feeling,
but you're just sitting in a chair.

719
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,090
You don't put that energy anywhere,
so it's bad for your body to.

720
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,790
I've been paying attention to a lot of 
people's twitters lately,

721
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,040
like watching people that get into 
consistent twitter,

722
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,450
twitter wars,
and you just look at them.

723
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,740
You're like this person sleeping four 
hours a night madness.

724
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,290
It's the whole lifestyle.
They're fighting with strangers too.

725
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,320
There's a lot of people that are like 
living in front of the computer saying 

726
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,471
shit,
waiting for someone to respond and then 

727
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:47,471
saying something back.

728
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:47,620
Like sometimes it's a tweet,
something mean to me,

729
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:51,100
I'll just go to their site and see what 
they do and it's like all mean tweets to

730
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:56,130
to other people,
to everybody responds and they always 

731
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,350
have about 13 followers and you just 
gotTa let it go.

732
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,990
Even if you have a good comeback,
you got to let it go.

733
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:01,970
Otherwise you're in a twitter fight in 
public.

734
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,040
I don't care if they have hundreds of 
thousands of followers.

735
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,860
It's still the same thing.
What do you.

736
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,380
What are you doing?
You know,

737
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:12,381
like it's,
it's one thing if there's something 

738
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:12,381
legitimate,
if there's something legitimate,

739
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:16,720
vast majority of these discussions.
Have you paid any attention to Gamer 

740
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Gate?
You know what Gamergate is?

741
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,800
What's said about fucking completely 
baffled.

742
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,070
Yeah.
I backed out like I did when those 

743
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,070
things were.
I walked in and he's like,

744
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,070
yeah,
yeah,

745
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,840
well I definitely care,
but I think it's,

746
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,070
it's so confusing.

747
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,940
There's so many sides to it for this is 
the idea behind it.

748
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,610
The idea is ethics in journalism on one 
side,

749
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:39,611
that's what they're saying.
Ethics in game journalism and the other 

750
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,210
side is saying it's really about 
harassing women and that this,

751
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,180
this woman who they initially went 
after,

752
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,160
like,
uh,

753
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,770
like,
you know,

754
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:49,820
who gives a shit and what's the big deal
and she's just a game designer.

755
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,690
Apparently she slept with some guy's.
I'm butchering this story.

756
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,210
I've heard a little bit about this,
the worst part of it,

757
00:33:56,211 --> 00:34:01,211
the absolute worst part,
but was all the death threats and all 

758
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:04,391
the negative people speak.
This is feminist chick and Anna,

759
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:10,841
I think analysts are keys.
Anything thunder foot as a bunch of 

760
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:11,960
hilarious videos on her,
but whatever's her,

761
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,550
her idea is that she's trying to promote
gender,

762
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,720
not just um,
I wouldn't say like equality and gains,

763
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:25,100
but she just wants to discourage 
stereotypes and she wants cheese showing

764
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:30,101
that there's some aspects of video games
that show women as objects like,

765
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:35,111
you know,
like the fucking what is the vice grand 

766
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:35,360
theft auto,
grand theft auto game.

767
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,250
There's a lot of bad shit.
Well,

768
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,230
I don't think she's necessarily saying 
censor it.

769
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,150
I think she wants people to be aware of 
it.

770
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:44,810
You know,
and again,

771
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:47,270
I'm trying to be super open minded on 
all this stuff,

772
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,280
but the worst aspects of it for sure,
or the death threats,

773
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,680
sure,
but this is where it gets really crazy.

774
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,770
Some people believe this is the 
conspiracy theory.

775
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:02,771
Of course,
some people believe that some of these 

776
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,040
in fact death threats or some of these 
threats aren't real.

777
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,460
That what they're doing is trying to 
discredit the gamergate movement by 

778
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,971
making it out.
That there are all these massages and 

779
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:15,131
creeps,
so then these other people that are 

780
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:15,680
involved in Gamergate started this thing
calling not your Hashtag,

781
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,890
not your shield and it's all people of 
color or women.

782
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:23,891
All these people who support ethics in 
game journalism who think this whole 

783
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,810
issue is getting sort of misconstrued 
and distorted and twisted,

784
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,800
but it's so.

785
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,860
It's so convoluted and multi-sided.
I think both sides have some sort of a 

786
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,331
point for sure,
but I don't want an involved like deeply

787
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:40,920
in video games,
but I think what they're trying to do is

788
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:45,921
they're trying to discourage this 
extreme left from taking over from 

789
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:51,861
controlling the narrative from like 
saying that all video gamers are 

790
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:55,700
misogynists.
All video gamers are assholes and I 

791
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,790
think for a lot of these guys,
they're super socially awkward.

792
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah.
A lot of video gamers,

793
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,360
they,
you know,

794
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,810
they're,
they're online all the time,

795
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,310
like it's a big percentage of their 
social life.

796
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,640
I know this because I used to be in a 
fucking quake clan and I used to hang 

797
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,001
out with these dudes,
like we used to get together and have 

798
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:15,711
land parties.
I had dudes come over my house man when 

799
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:15,711
I was on TV.
Yeah,

800
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:16,020
I met dudes online.

801
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:21,070
Yeah.
They all came over to my house and we 

802
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,070
had a fucking land party,
you know,

803
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,590
I was a super dork.
I used to make my own computers.

804
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:25,350
I would go down to fry's electronics and
buy a motherboard and a case.

805
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,880
Fuck yeah.
Put the ad.

806
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:27,960
The hard drives,
the whole deal.

807
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,020
My friend Andrew would talk me through 
it when shit would go bad,

808
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,450
but for the most part I kind of figured 
it out.

809
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,430
Andrew,
who developed my website?

810
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,020
Yeah,
menthol.

811
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,190
Yeah.
Fucking jumpers.

812
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,970
Jumpers,
like one little jumper could make the 

813
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:43,970
whole computer work or not work.
It's like a Christmas light.

814
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,700
And this was guys that were like,
there were like overclocking.

815
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,500
They went over clock.
They would get these,

816
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,730
these,
uh,

817
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,690
these cpas that weren't as strong like 
the seller.

818
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,440
Ron's memory,
those celeron processors.

819
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,760
You can get a 300 Celeron and you could 
jack that sucker up to like four,

820
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:04,761
25 and guys would put like extra fans 
and shit and he'd blow cold air on it.

821
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,540
Yeah.
They were just trying to like.

822
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,950
And so I was involved in this culture.
Like this is not,

823
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm not talking out of my ass when I 
talk about these guys.

824
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,330
And for a lot of these guys,
they're,

825
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,240
they're very,
they're very sexually inexperienced.

826
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:19,530
Some of them,
you know,

827
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,050
some of them are there shut-ins a lot of
ways.

828
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:24,360
They don't go out and they don't,
they don't meet a lot in.

829
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:27,330
So like this idea that they're,
you know,

830
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,910
objectifying women in these,
in these video games,

831
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,510
I see your point,
but if you look at the people that are 

832
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,420
watching these things and playing these 
games,

833
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,240
if you really want to think,
I don't,

834
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,040
I don't think you can make a real 
argument that it's affecting their 

835
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,500
behavior and making them go out and 
assault and rape and others.

836
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,540
They're very shy.
People that aren't aggressive in the 

837
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:50,540
least.

838
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,630
I don't mean that's a huge.
I mean that's a huge generalization.

839
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:56,631
Obviously I've made a generalization,
but I think that it becomes an issue of 

840
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:02,870
you can be a really good person who 
doesn't have any malice towards any sex,

841
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,540
any gender,
any orientation.

842
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,460
A huge could be just non-racist,
normal,

843
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:12,690
cool person and enjoy playing some 
fucking crazy game.

844
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,990
We will,
you a,

845
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,880
you can smack a girl.
You know,

846
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,900
there's a game when you're in a fight 
and you're shooting guns at people and 

847
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:20,900
you know,
every now and then a girl comes out,

848
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,360
you screaming at a time the pimp slap 
swatter,

849
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,710
right?
And then you get a 10,

850
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,770
like 10 shows up,
like you can really catch her perfect 

851
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:30,770
with the pimp.
Slap this.

852
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,230
Not a real person.
I know.

853
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:37,290
It's no,
it'd be terrible to actually slap a 

854
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:37,290
woman in the face.
It would be terrible.

855
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,130
One of the worst things you could do,
but I really think that you can do that 

856
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,811
game where you can slap a cartoon,
women in the face and you're not a bad 

857
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:46,020
person.
I mean,

858
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,200
could it.
Because it's fantasy.

859
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:52,201
It's just like when you watch a movie,
like think of any number of movies that 

860
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:56,971
have,
have horrible scenes where women get 

861
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:56,971
beat up.
Or how about that fucking.

862
00:38:56,971 --> 00:39:00,130
I'm the Quentin Tarantino movie.
True Romance.

863
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,070
Perfect example.
That was um,

864
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,280
James James Gandolfini and applegate,
our cat,

865
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,660
our cat.
Patricia Arquette,

866
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,260
right?
Yeah.

867
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,750
Fuck too.
It's tough to watch.

868
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,130
Oh my God.
It's tough to watch.

869
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:17,220
He beats the shit out of her and she 
eventually kills them.

870
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,290
Yeah,
but I mean he's beating the shit out of 

871
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:22,290
it and you're watching it,
man.

872
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,800
You're watching this fucking movie.
Are you controlling it?

873
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,830
No,
but you're watching a movie that's 

874
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,000
depicting a horrific scene that could 
possibly happen now.

875
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I guess you could say that it's 
different if you're playing a game 

876
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,270
because then you're an objector.
You have an objective,

877
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,980
you know you're.
You're accomplishing something,

878
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:42,040
and if this is a part of your objective 
is that you get to slap girls.

879
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,080
I could see how that could be kind of 
fucked up,

880
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,570
but all of it is fantasy.
I know.

881
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,820
And if you're a good person,
I think the real issue is how much to 

882
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,300
games or any media for that matter,
how much they actually affect the way we

883
00:39:55,301 --> 00:40:00,301
behave and how much of it is how our 
parents raised us and the environment 

884
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:03,931
that we lived in.
The actual real human friendships that 

885
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:03,931
we had.
How much of is that?

886
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:08,880
All I know is I've smacked the girl in 
the video game but never in real life 

887
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,270
and I and I don't intend to,
and that real life,

888
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:15,330
unless it girl smacked you really 
fucking hard and really got your Irish 

889
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:15,330
up.

890
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,950
My Irish ego driven this flash.
Hm.

891
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,680
Um,
yeah.

892
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,710
Look,
that was the argument when that dude 

893
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:25,710
knocked the girl out in the elevator.
What was his name?

894
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,080
The football player,
Shawn Ray Rice Ray Rice,

895
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:34,350
who uh,
his girlfriend cracked him or his 

896
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,350
fiance,
whatever she is.

897
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,620
And then he left,
hooked her and knocked her unconscious.

898
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,640
Wow.
Yeah.

899
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,500
It's fucked up.
But is he right handed?

900
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,060
It doesn't matter because it was a short
left hook because very good punch punch.

901
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,840
But the point being like,
yeah,

902
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:50,470
absolutely.
It's way fucked up to knock someone out.

903
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:52,600
That's your wife or you know,
anybody like that.

904
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:57,601
Especially a woman.
Like you couldn't control her in some 

905
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:57,601
other way.
However,

906
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:58,630
she shouldn't have had him either.
Right?

907
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,690
She shouldn't have hit him and no one's 
saying she shouldn't have hit him 

908
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:03,690
saying,
hey,

909
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:03,850
you crazy bitch.
Why'd you hit ray rice?

910
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,940
It's almost like because of what he did 
to her in response to what she did,

911
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,950
she doesn't get blamed for what she did.

912
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:13,970
Right.
So if there was a video where she just 

913
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,680
punched him in the face in an elevator 
and then they left,

914
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,860
do you think there would be this giant 
outrage where everybody was like ray 

915
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,510
rice got assaulted by his wife?
That woman is a terrible person.

916
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:25,240
She needs to be in jail with.
Is it based?

917
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:30,070
Is it the action I've seen this is the 
action or is it based on how much damage

918
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,680
you actually do with what you've,
what your action is?

919
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,770
You know what I'm saying?
Like if this woman is hitting this guy 

920
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,380
and then he smacks her in the face.
This is,

921
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,880
take this off.
I don't want to watch a shit.

922
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,160
Um,
what,

923
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,000
but,
but look,

924
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,150
both people did the same thing.
It's just one person was better at it 

925
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,810
and one person actually started,
right?

926
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,300
I mean,
yeah,

927
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:53,420
it's more fucked up because he's a 
powerful man.

928
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,420
He's a professional athlete.
He obviously knocked completely 

929
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:58,420
unconscious.
It,

930
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,580
a whole lot of brain trauma there.
She could have died all the about me.

931
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,540
She fucking clanged her head off.
That bar handlebars was playing.

932
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,190
I mean,
she was out.

933
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,460
Do was one of the worst knockouts.
I've seen it.

934
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,990
I've seen a lot of people get knocked 
out.

935
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,020
That was a bad doc out,
but no one is saying she's a bad person 

936
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,780
for hitting him.
Yeah.

937
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,680
I haven't heard it once,
but yeah,

938
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:20,210
but it's not cool.
No,

939
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,830
that's what.
No one's supposed to hit anybody.

940
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah.
Right.

941
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:26,330
And you definitely shouldn't hit a 
fucking super athlete and a small space.

942
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:27,800
I wouldn't do that.
I mean,

943
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,150
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

944
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:32,510
It's not good that he hit her for sure.
But you're also dealing with dudes.

945
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,840
You know,
I talked to Michael Irvin about this 

946
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,341
once and Michael Irvin works with a lot 
of young kids that are coming up that 

947
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,190
um,
you know,

948
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,200
have been in impoverished situations 
growing up and they've had a lot of 

949
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,091
violence in the family and he was saying
that your body just gets when you're 

950
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,630
young,
especially when you're going through the

951
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:55,631
womb,
when your mother is going through a 

952
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:57,100
tremendous amount of stress,
your body gets almost designed to react 

953
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,941
instantaneously and make poor choices 
like your body almost as response just 

954
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:05,560
so shellshocked that your body's 
designed to like it's set up to deal 

955
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,790
with the trauma of a bad neighborhood 
really.

956
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,380
And it's based on when you're still in 
the womb.

957
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,010
So based on the stress that your mother 
experienced as well,

958
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:14,450
she's got you in her womb,
Jesus Christ,

959
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,180
crazy shit.
And so you make worse decisions based on

960
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:17,970
that.
You,

961
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,150
you follow your instincts,
follow your instincts.

962
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:23,210
You become more aggressive and violent 
and more aggressive and violent.

963
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,600
A lot of times leads to poor thinking,
poor,

964
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,910
poor planning.
And you know,

965
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:33,911
he was saying that this is what a lot of
these guys are dealing with a lot of 

966
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:34,310
these nfl players,
but a lot of young athletes,

967
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:39,311
it's like they were literally program 
different than people that grew up in a 

968
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:41,870
nice house with a nice family,
nice environment.

969
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,960
Like they're literally hardwired in a 
different way because your brain thinks,

970
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,670
okay,
well this is the game we're playing.

971
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,060
We're not playing pokemon.
We're going to go ahead and we're going 

972
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,081
to play fucking aliens vs Predator and 
I'm low on armor and it's best to act 

973
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:54,800
quick before you're in trouble.

974
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Yeah.
So when you see a guy like ray rice 

975
00:43:59,880 --> 00:43:59,880
clock,
a chick like that,

976
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,320
literally that guy might not even be 
able to control that kind of a thing.

977
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,710
Right?
I'm not giving him a free pass at all.

978
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,170
What he did was totally fucked up.
I would've never done it.

979
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,890
But when you're dealing with head 
trauma,

980
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,400
major head trauma,
that guy has been hit who knows how many

981
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,380
times throughout high school,
College.

982
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:23,381
And in the pros,
I mean he has collided with some giant 

983
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:23,381
men.
Yeah,

984
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:26,270
there is a hundred percent likelihood of
head trauma going on there.

985
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,810
One hundred percent percent.
Then you punch him,

986
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,730
you know,
and who knows

987
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,070
how much control he has over that 
switch.

988
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,470
You would like to say,
well me Matt,

989
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:40,470
the full charge,
I have full control of my situation,

990
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,220
but I don't claim to know what it's like
to operate his body and mind.

991
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,830
I definitely don't.
Or hers.

992
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,900
Why did she punch him?
I wouldn't have praised them.

993
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,140
Bitch woman.
Crazy.

994
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,670
I don't know.
I mean who knows?

995
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,400
Maybe he did something but we didn't see
before that,

996
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,820
but it's just craziness and should be 
avoided at all costs and definitely 

997
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:07,041
don't get married to somebody that that 
happened with the to the fence or unless

998
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,420
you really both don't ever do it again.
I mean,

999
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:10,890
is that possible?
Again?

1000
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,440
Can people grow and learn and so this,
this is beyond say sister is the head.

1001
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:19,200
This was no,
so it doesn't really different story.

1002
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,270
You son of a bitch,
you're racist.

1003
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,090
He's a totally different groups of black
people.

1004
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,010
Say sister started hitting Jay Z.
Okay.

1005
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:26,750
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

1006
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,800
Who knows what?
Yeah,

1007
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,610
I get it.
Mixed.

1008
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,700
Jay Z just dealt with it like a year.
He threw money at it.

1009
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,940
It should have not a fifth should 
fucking thrown diamonds on the ground.

1010
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,600
So she slipped.

1011
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,200
Isn't it funny what pitches we are.
We get a fascinating.

1012
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:48,201
What do you think he said?
She said to him exactly what you're 

1013
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:48,930
talking about.
So worried,

1014
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,820
worried about death and obscurity.
Worried about space.

1015
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,760
Worried about the fact that we're 
floating around.

1016
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,900
They landed A.
Oh,

1017
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:00,720
here's a great story.
They landed a fucking comment.

1018
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,990
They landed on a comet and uh,
the guy who landed on the comet was 

1019
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,060
wearing a shirt that had all these 
photos,

1020
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,460
are these drawings of women on it and 
land on a comment.

1021
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,070
They landed a drone on a comment.
It says,

1022
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:19,260
I don't care if you landed on 
spacecraft,

1023
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,330
landed a spacecraft.
I'll say it again.

1024
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,030
I don't care if you land a space craft 
on a comet,

1025
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,050
your shirt is sexist and ostracizing.
I'm not kidding.

1026
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,470
This is where our world is today.
Pull this up,

1027
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:32,000
Brian.
Pull,

1028
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,600
pull it up,
pull it up.

1029
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,270
Um,
it's on my twitter feed.

1030
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,570
I retweeted it,
but here's the title is I don't care if 

1031
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,130
you landed on ace 11,
landed a spacecraft on a comment.

1032
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,470
Your shirt is sexist and ostracizing.
It's just God damn a beautiful 

1033
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,270
representation by the way,
the shirt is designed by a woman.

1034
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,940
And who said that?
Who said that to him?

1035
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,410
That's an article.
There was an article.

1036
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Yeah.
I mean it's just a social justice 

1037
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:00,720
warrior status.
That is funny about the Internet is that

1038
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,190
everyone has.
Everyone has a voice,

1039
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:04,110
but the bad thing is everyone has a 
voice.

1040
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,460
Yeah.
Look at this carefully and is fucking 

1041
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,090
beautiful.
That's beautiful.

1042
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:19,020
And it's just women in scantily clad 
outfits.

1043
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,190
Now,
here's my question.

1044
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,190
This is,
we're willing to get real with this.

1045
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,700
When you see,
um,

1046
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,840
maybe there's a better picture of it,
but we can get a close up look at his 

1047
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:29,840
face,
look at his,

1048
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:29,840
find his name and find a shirt.

1049
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,890
I'm sure there's some closeup photos of 
it because there's a big event that they

1050
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:37,891
had and this guy chose to wear this 
shirt and everybody's freaking out that 

1051
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:38,090
he chose to wear the shirt.
Um,

1052
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,180
and you know,
people are saying,

1053
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,520
yeah,
they wonder why women aren't accepted in

1054
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:44,770
science and I don't even know that 
that's true.

1055
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,930
How much or how hard it is for women to 
get into science or how easy it is.

1056
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:52,090
I really don't know.
So I'm not going to be talking out of my

1057
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:52,860
ass,
but look it.

1058
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,870
There it is.
You can see the picture and it's just 

1059
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,080
women in lingerie and fetish outfits.
Comic Book.

1060
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:01,630
It looks like wonder woman in.
Well,

1061
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,100
no,
I wouldn't say that.

1062
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:08,101
I mean that chick has like a skin tight 
leather core set and I can just now make

1063
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:10,450
it out though.
You know,

1064
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:13,000
it's not like,
it seems like kind of cosmic too,

1065
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:13,210
right?

1066
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,800
What is that a son behind that one 
chick?

1067
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,360
Yeah.
It looks like Superhero.

1068
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,930
Other planets involved in there.
I don't know what it is.

1069
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,960
You should be able to wear a shirt.
One of those of like someone's killing 

1070
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,150
children are those online and I'll wear 
it for the next podcast.

1071
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,660
You can order a bunch of them,
find it,

1072
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:34,350
find out who makes it online,
what's where I'm willing to make the 

1073
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,080
guests.
Were it for a week at your hazing?

1074
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,500
Well,
you know,

1075
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:40,030
I don't know if a woman makes it,
how it could be sexist.

1076
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,100
Well,
I guess it could be if you were.

1077
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:47,101
It was sexist intentions,
but for some women it's not sexist at 

1078
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:50,671
all.
For some women it's just sexy women in 

1079
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:53,100
seductive poses.
Like would you think that it would be 

1080
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,640
sexist if a woman had like Chippendale's
dudes all over her shirt?

1081
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,890
I wouldn't get upset about it and I 
don't think it's either.

1082
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,380
Maybe I wouldn't even necessarily think 
she was a horny chick.

1083
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:07,381
Well,
if the dicks route that's a different 

1084
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:07,381
story had their dicks out and they were 
holding onto him like,

1085
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:10,500
like shotguns,
you can't ignore dicks that events.

1086
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,280
That wouldn't.
I wouldn't be mad.

1087
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:13,720
I wouldn't say that shirt,
sexist.

1088
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:18,220
I wouldn't be upset at all.
So is the object objectification of men?

1089
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,930
Is that acceptable?
But the objective,

1090
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,810
it is acceptable.
Everyone's fine with that.

1091
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,000
Do you see what's going on?
Man?

1092
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,180
You're going crazy,
the world's going to go a little crazy,

1093
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:33,181
but there there is a double standard 
with the sexes and I think it has a lot 

1094
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:36,301
to do with that.
Like you know when men are the 

1095
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:36,790
aggressors,
of course.

1096
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,460
And that's the difference.
Yeah,

1097
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,620
and when we,
when we get raped,

1098
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:42,190
nobody cares.

1099
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,360
No one cares that it's a joke photo.
It's a big joke,

1100
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:49,120
you know,
that I put up the other day of this dude

1101
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:54,121
who was blacked out in these three girls
with bikinis or climbing all over him 

1102
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:55,480
and the caption was captured,
was poorly spelled,

1103
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:57,210
but it was something like a,
you know,

1104
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,980
how different would it be if the sexes 
were reversed?

1105
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:04,490
Yeah.
In this particular photo blacked out.

1106
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,280
You almost go to jail just for that 
photo.

1107
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:11,281
You know,
even if it was an overweight woman that 

1108
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:11,350
was blacked out and a bunch of guys that
were like studly,

1109
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:16,120
every woman wants to fuck guys still.
It still be a creepy photo.

1110
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,240
Go down as harassment and borderline sex
crime.

1111
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,330
Why are they giving this guy a hard time
for his fucking shirt?

1112
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,140
They sit,
let them.

1113
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:25,730
God Damn bought on a comment.
Let them have.

1114
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,670
Can you land a robot on the comment I 
didn't even know was possible.

1115
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,630
I wish a hundred miles an hour.
I wish his reaction though when she said

1116
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:34,310
that to him,
I wish he would just be like,

1117
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,240
shut the fuck up and locked away.
But hold on a second.

1118
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,680
I don't think someone said anything to 
him.

1119
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,090
Oh No.
This isn't someone who interviewed him.

1120
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,050
This is a review of him doing it.
Yeah.

1121
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,660
The girl with the mic doesn't care at 
all.

1122
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,420
Right.
In the eyes.

1123
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,210
I thought this was him going like her 
freaking out.

1124
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:54,040
No,
no,

1125
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,330
and by the way,
it's by a dude,

1126
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,420
the articles written by two and he's 
ultimately just trying to get laid to.

1127
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,360
That's the funny part.
He is doing what he thinks is right.

1128
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,140
Yeah.
You know,

1129
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:07,490
he's,
he's pointing it out.

1130
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,520
He thinks it's right.
I mean we could disagree with them all 

1131
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:12,520
day.

1132
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,050
I don't know.
I don't think it's a big deal,

1133
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:18,770
but I also think people are so fucking 
hung up on bodies,

1134
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:23,771
man.
People are really hung up on the use of 

1135
00:51:23,771 --> 00:51:24,820
people's bodies and imagery and you 
know,

1136
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,100
comic book depictions of bodies and it's
primarily a female issue,

1137
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,900
primarily of objectification of female 
issue.

1138
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:38,290
Like if a guy showed up at work and he 
had a bunch of male bodies,

1139
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,070
just like really yolked superhero male 
bodies all over his shirt,

1140
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,660
it would just be hilarious.
It will be fine.

1141
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:45,980
It would be,
it would be funny.

1142
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,100
But if he shows up with these,
these looking at these women in these 

1143
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,100
photos are these,
uh,

1144
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,110
these images on a shirt,
they're just all like perfect specimen.

1145
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,160
Like,
yeah,

1146
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,630
cartoonish looking characters.
I just sent you a link to buy the shirt.

1147
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:02,180
I don't want to say it out loud so they 
won't sell out.

1148
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,880
Don't sell out there.
Fifty $9.

1149
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,440
I'll take it.
Go Up to seven xl.

1150
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,770
That's actually cut to layer it with a 
fat shaming version.

1151
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,100
That's what it is.
You know,

1152
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:15,800
it's just,
uh,

1153
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,010
a bunch of people that think those 
images look good.

1154
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,680
Is it sexist?
What,

1155
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,650
what is that?
Because of sexless Matt.

1156
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,790
Uh,
what is sexy exactly is sexist is when 

1157
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,851
you,
I think discriminator treat people 

1158
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:31,280
differently based on their sex or the 
way they look.

1159
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,390
All right,
so is having a shirt with a bunch of 

1160
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,220
pretty women on it like that.
Is that objectifying women?

1161
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,140
Kind of,
right?

1162
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,190
Um,
to some degree.

1163
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,150
But if you're asking me,
I don't find it offensive ones.

1164
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,100
One bit assurance.
God Damn Glorious.

1165
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:50,110
I can't wait for it to arrive.
We can make our own shirts and Brian 

1166
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Cowen,
that's me in the lower right hand 

1167
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:56,640
corner.
When you're 21,

1168
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:56,640
you're right.

1169
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:56,830
It is funny.
When there's naked guys.

1170
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,090
Foley,
if you went to the gym in the middle,

1171
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:03,530
man literally is kind of funny.
If you had that uninsured,

1172
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,970
I don't,
it wouldn't really bug me.

1173
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,860
No,
there'll be no blogs about it.

1174
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,970
Oh see that's type t t e a.
Why is this a tea?

1175
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:13,500
Is that a t shirt?
This is a fabric.

1176
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,350
So we can make our own clothes.
We should make our,

1177
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,970
all of our clothes bedsheets out of 
that.

1178
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,890
I should hire like a real shower.
Expensive.

1179
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:26,030
Tailored to make me an awesome suit of 
the jacket and the pants with a vest,

1180
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,700
a tie.
The whole thing will be on the inside of

1181
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:31,590
the vast,
like the ones the UFC made me.

1182
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:34,740
They have like little skull and 
crossbones and the sat and we could have

1183
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:36,170
all little dicks.
Yeah.

1184
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,720
Little Dicks.
And we're talking about this last night.

1185
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,720
Like I want to um,
have a house and have the people trim 

1186
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:45,720
their bushes.
Yeah.

1187
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,300
I want to cut my bushes in the shape of 
a cock and balls.

1188
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1189
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,210
Just have it all through the,
you know,

1190
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,770
the front of the yard.
Just all cock and balls shaped right.

1191
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:59,810
Bushes.
Do you think that would get you in 

1192
00:53:59,810 --> 00:53:59,810
trouble with the Neighborhood 
Association?

1193
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:00,380
Would,
would not like that one.

1194
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,850
They know exactly what it is.
It's a Bush.

1195
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,940
They,
they would still get pissed window 

1196
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:07,940
fucked up and talked about it.
That's what.

1197
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,180
Yeah.
Once you're in a neighborhood,

1198
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:14,181
like I'm assuming like if you have 
people cutting your bushes that it's a 

1199
00:54:14,181 --> 00:54:14,181
nice neighborhood.
If they can see that shit,

1200
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,140
they feel like they can say shit about 
that.

1201
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,140
I assume.
What could,

1202
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,170
what does that,
Brian,

1203
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,850
just this,
this fabric,

1204
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,430
a fabric.com
has all these sexual.

1205
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,250
That's fantastic.
That's fabric that is sexist,

1206
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,590
Brian,
and that's male.

1207
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:32,730
Patriarchy and I'm all bad things.
Wow.

1208
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,830
I'm going to write a blog about how 
great that is.

1209
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:38,780
How much of it.
I mean,

1210
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:44,090
how much of it is.
Is there a line that ever has to be 

1211
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,090
drawn?
I mean,

1212
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,600
what if you had like tits?
What if,

1213
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,780
what if these girls on this shirt,
we're completely naked instead of these.

1214
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,250
I mean,
these outfits are tiny.

1215
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:53,490
They're wearing these little corsets and
thongs.

1216
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,310
They're acids are hanging out.
If you ask me totally naked,

1217
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,600
if you ask me,
it's fine.

1218
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,520
I mean it's just,
it's just the body.

1219
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,500
But if you're a woman,
okay.

1220
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,290
And you're working with a guy and he's 
kind of creepy anyway.

1221
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:09,340
Yeah.
But he's got a shirt with naked chicks 

1222
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,151
all over.
It probably wouldn't like it if I was a 

1223
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:11,151
walking hate it.
So that is kind of sexual harassment,

1224
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:11,151
right?
Right.

1225
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:15,980
So if that sexual harassment and you 
take it just one step before that,

1226
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,100
which is their scantily clad,
it's pretty God damn close to them being

1227
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:22,730
naked step before it.

1228
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,400
Got to see how if you were a chick and 
you around a guy wearing that,

1229
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:31,401
that would be on the creep tip because 
although we would like to compare it to 

1230
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:33,440
men,
the problem is like a woman with a,

1231
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,450
a bunch of men on her shirt is probably 
not going to rape you.

1232
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,100
Right,
right.

1233
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,780
Yeah.
And it's not even the worst thing in the

1234
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:40,870
world.
If a woman ramps you,

1235
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,850
not that most men wearing this shirt 
would rape you because most wouldn't.

1236
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,940
Right.
But there's a few guys who would rape 

1237
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,940
you and it only takes one.
Let's face it before just,

1238
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:56,950
you know,
it's a huge inconvenience or they 

1239
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,521
probably would wear like some Mr Rogers 
shit so that you would never see it 

1240
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:58,521
coming.
Yeah.

1241
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,820
You got to watch out with those guys for
that with the sweater vest sweater.

1242
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,030
That's a dead giveaway.

1243
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,990
I don't know man.
I just to make a good point,

1244
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:12,020
I would hate to be a chick working in an
office with a dude who was creeping on 

1245
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:12,020
me.
Yeah,

1246
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,120
absolutely.
Have you ever worked in an office where 

1247
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:17,120
chick was creeping on you?
Um,

1248
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,050
I can't.
I can't remember a chick creeping on me.

1249
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,080
Yeah,
that was definitely flirting and 

1250
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,080
actually,
yeah.

1251
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,080
Now that you mentioned I did hook up 
with this,

1252
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,730
that I worked at it,
but that seems fun.

1253
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,980
That's like voluntary.
It's fun and say Hook Up.

1254
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,750
But you hear about the one dude that was
like jizzing in this chick's coffee for 

1255
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:32,750
like a year.
Yeah.

1256
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:32,810
That's awful.
Yeah.

1257
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,890
And then they caught him.
He admitted he'd been in her coffee for 

1258
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:37,890
a year.
That's so great.

1259
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,980
How long did it take from an admitted,
whereas he just like bad.

1260
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,140
Did it?
Let's find out.

1261
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,160
How long was he?

1262
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,590
He was just in her coffee for a long 
time.

1263
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:47,860
Right.
You would never drink liquids again.

1264
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,760
You would never let anyone hands you a 
cup of anything ever again.

1265
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,760
Fifty percent of women love the taste of
come.

1266
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,500
I saw 35 percent.
Actually,

1267
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:01,770
I saw one recently where a guy was 
caught on a hidden camera pissing in the

1268
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:05,230
coffee pot.
He was using pis to make coffee.

1269
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,380
Yeah.
And uh,

1270
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,460
he was,
he was making these guys that he worked 

1271
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,100
with drinking and everybody was like,
there's something going on here,

1272
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:13,390
man.
This coffee smells weird.

1273
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,600
As they install the hidden camera and 
you see this guy looking around and 

1274
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,060
pulling his cock out and pissing in the 
fucking coffee client like you to think 

1275
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,670
of how much of that guy's pissed.
Those dudes drank his coffee.

1276
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:27,800
He's given me a weird buzz man.
I hate to hear shit.

1277
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:31,030
Like that's what happens when you have 
to work in an office for 1130,

1278
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,150
literally insane.
Thirty four year old Blaine,

1279
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:40,390
Minnesota man is accused of ejaculating 
on his coworker's desk and inner office.

1280
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:45,400
You faces two counts of criminal sexual 
conduct for that.

1281
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:48,640
Allegedly happened since late February.
There's been checking off on her fucking

1282
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:52,570
death for like six months.
Creep arrested for ejaculate.

1283
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:59,580
Coffee Creek.
That's so non objective journalism.

1284
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,900
That's the difference between like the 
fucking Internet,

1285
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,300
like what you're doing a blog and like 
New York Times.

1286
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:12,410
That's why the Internet rules,
because the New York Times could never 

1287
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:14,980
have creep ejaculates in women's class.
It would be man.

1288
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,080
Yeah,
but the Internet is more accurate.

1289
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,490
Man.
Arrested for or allegedly.

1290
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:25,491
Yeah.
This is like how many girls I like 

1291
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:26,140
fingering themselves.
Then stirring your iced tea.

1292
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,060
Very few.
Like,

1293
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,120
I don't know.
Very 70 percent.

1294
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,570
Very few.
Yeah.

1295
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,850
No,
that never happens.

1296
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,000
It probably wouldn't.
It's Kinda happened somewhere.

1297
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:41,170
Someone has done it.
Is that the guy started off guy.

1298
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,410
Okay,
now think about that poor bastard life.

1299
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,560
Yeah.
How about we show a little empathy 

1300
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,331
towards him.
If you really get to the moment in your 

1301
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:53,311
life where you're jerking off and your 
coworkers Coffee Cup dudes are women 

1302
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,250
that were drinking the juice makes a 
lot.

1303
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,300
It means a lot.
He has one chicken particular and Jackie

1304
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,380
elated coworkers.
Coffee is that.

1305
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:07,730
Oh my God,
she's so prone to jerk off in her 

1306
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,930
coffin.
You GotTa do what?

1307
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:14,620
You got to get a little on her lip and 
she doesn't know his licks it off.

1308
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,630
Oh my God.
This is hilarious.

1309
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,580
She didn't.
She didn't taste that for a year.

1310
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:19,900
Huh?
She didn't listen to this.

1311
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,640
According to the criminal complaint 
employee

1312
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,010
at,
we don't need to say the names.

1313
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:29,020
Place hardware store called police.
On August 26th saying she thought Lynn,

1314
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:34,250
her coworker was leaving bodily fluids 
on her desk.

1315
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,640
She told officers that she found Lynn 
that afternoon standing in front of her 

1316
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,661
desk,
back turned to her and his hands near 

1317
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:46,391
his crotch.
The worker wasn't sure what Lynn was 

1318
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:49,751
doing,
but she told police that he had a deer 

1319
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:52,100
in the headlights expression on his face
when he noticed her behind him,

1320
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,370
quickly left the room and slammed the 
door behind him.

1321
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,700
The worker said seconds later,
Lynn came back and told the worker that 

1322
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:00,900
he had a question for her,
but for.

1323
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,870
Got It.
He then left the area.

1324
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:08,230
The worker told police.
She inspected her desk and found fluid 

1325
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,280
on the surface dripping onto the floor.
A lot of it had been absorbed into her 

1326
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,080
hair scrunchy,
which she put into a plastic bag when at

1327
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:17,240
the scene officers collected the coffee 
Mug,

1328
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:21,230
coffee and scrunchy the worst told 
police that she had been.

1329
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,280
She had problems with Lynn for months.
He had allegedly leave his zipper down.

1330
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:28,760
Often it happens so much that the worker
said she threatened to,

1331
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:30,440
uh,
portland if it happened again.

1332
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:34,100
She threatened to report.
And why don't you report them know.

1333
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,550
Wow,
this is what happens when you make 

1334
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,381
people work eight hours a day.
He admitted to ejaculating on his 

1335
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:42,860
coworker's desk and coffee on August 
26th,

1336
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,380
which was his birthday.
Well,

1337
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,640
come on.
Give him a pass or leave that the story 

1338
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:50,640
flows.
Fucking mean.

1339
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,910
Officers.
They arrested that guy on his birthday.

1340
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,600
Oh my God.
He said he ejaculated and the coffee 

1341
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,810
twice in the last six months and a on 
her desk four times wiping up the mess 

1342
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,880
with the scrunchie.
Hmm.

1343
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:09,460
He told police he was attracted to his 
coworker and did this to get her to 

1344
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:09,620
notice.
And her desk.

1345
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:15,410
Oh,
you also said that he knew it was gross 

1346
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:15,410
and wrong.

1347
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,310
The complaint states this is,
the world has become a fucking parody.

1348
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,880
Do Piano and Jelly sandwiches for racist
dudes jerking off and people's coffee.

1349
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,530
Yeah.
What the fuck?

1350
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,880
I think it all comes back to what you 
said.

1351
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:27,650
Like everyone's just trying to distract 
themselves.

1352
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,110
Yeah.
You know what?

1353
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,990
We're trying to just get over that.
I think living life,

1354
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,230
knowing that you're just a part of a 
giant mystery,

1355
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,820
we don't know how it's going to end.
You know,

1356
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:42,821
how works,
what's going to happen for me to do the 

1357
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:42,821
next.
Right.

1358
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:42,821
It's just too much for most people.
You also,

1359
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:47,171
a lot of people are doing things with 
their lives that they're not even into 

1360
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:47,210
like you got.
Get that guy's not into his job.

1361
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,770
Oh yeah,
no doubt.

1362
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,840
No doubt.
That's why he's jerking off on desks and

1363
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:51,830
shit.
Exactly.

1364
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,730
And so,
you know,

1365
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:57,731
you got to do something for a living and
most people don't get to do what they 

1366
01:01:57,731 --> 01:01:57,731
want for a living.
Poor bastard,

1367
01:01:57,731 --> 01:02:00,350
but,
but way more poor her than poor m.

1368
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:04,580
Oh poor that dudes come twice.
Who would you ever trust again?

1369
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,240
Not,
not dudes with their pants down.

1370
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,420
Tell you that the fact that she didn't 
the first time like report,

1371
01:02:11,421 --> 01:02:13,970
it means that she doesn't really care 
that she's been drinking.

1372
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:17,330
Come.
No Man,

1373
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:19,650
she still be embarrassing for her,

1374
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:26,190
but if you got caught drinking come,
you'd be like police,

1375
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,130
like your boss.
You'd go right to be like,

1376
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:34,160
I don't want to drink.
I think I might be a little embarrassed 

1377
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:34,160
to admit that I drank com.
If you found a.

1378
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,060
do you know what I mean?
What would you rather do?

1379
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,580
Have you found a dude he knew that he 
came and your Coffee Cup.

1380
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,830
Would you be?
Would you be like,

1381
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:42,780
look man,
you can't do that anymore.

1382
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:46,380
It was at work.
If it was like at a job.

1383
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,050
Can we talk about this?
I mean,

1384
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,110
would you be like,
Hey,

1385
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,300
don't do this anymore.
Would you hit them?

1386
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,640
Would you just go immediately to the 
authorities?

1387
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:56,340
Like how would you handle it?
I've kissed him on the cheek and go,

1388
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,350
you fucked up buddy.
I have no idea.

1389
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:03,351
I think I will report it within the 
company and let them take it to the 

1390
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:03,351
cops.

1391
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:06,170
Don't you think that a dude coming into 
your coffee cup is so extreme that you'd

1392
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,340
be real cautious about how you 
interacted with them?

1393
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,430
I don't think you'd beat his ass.
I'll tell you that.

1394
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,910
This is why if a guy came in your crop 
and you drank it,

1395
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,060
you'd be like,
whoa.

1396
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,980
Like what are you doing?
Like,

1397
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:18,230
who?
Who are you man?

1398
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:19,860
I'm like,
are you a fucking serial killer?

1399
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:24,150
Or something like what kind of a person 
can jerk off in your coffee and then sit

1400
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:27,540
back and watch as you drink it.
That's like a mentally ill person.

1401
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,700
Absolutely.
So you didn't have to think like how you

1402
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:32,040
handled that situation whether or not 
you beat their ass.

1403
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:33,990
No violent.
What'd you go?

1404
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:36,450
Then I would take the Coffee Cup and 
smashed it over his head.

1405
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:40,050
And then to that man,
if you hit someone with a Coffee Cup,

1406
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:41,340
that's like a fucking deadly weapon.

1407
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:46,340
Yeah.
But if he had to come in my fucking 

1408
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:46,340
coffee.
Okay.

1409
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,890
But if he had saliva and your coffee,
would you stab them with a broken clock?

1410
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,560
Spit.
I would scream at him.

1411
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:52,380
They'd go to the bus.
But comes completely different.

1412
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:57,381
What if your hot cocoa is different?
But if you have to be pretty close Cox 

1413
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:57,690
not regular snack,
I would.

1414
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,860
It would get violent probably if I.
If it.

1415
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,520
What?
Would you rather drink guys?

1416
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:06,560
Louis or a load?
Probably a load because I'm sure it 

1417
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,471
tastes better.
It tastes better smoke because there's 

1418
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,471
not one girl that goes.

1419
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:16,730
He's a mediator.
He opens your mouth and spit it.

1420
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,940
That should be a fucking new game show.
I should be a new game.

1421
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:25,941
Show me smokers.
Spit in your mouth and see how many 

1422
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:29,060
times you can take without swallowing.
Throwing up a smoker,

1423
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:31,950
hooking longyis and spitting in your 
mouth and the every.

1424
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,960
For every lucky that goes in there,
you get 10 grand.

1425
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,490
Yeah,
that'd be fun to train for.

1426
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:37,140
I know that much.
You know why?

1427
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:39,600
Because there's some people with some 
serious fucking student loans.

1428
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,930
You know like I know a friend who has 
$300,000

1429
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:47,931
in student loans.
I bet you could hook loogies in his 

1430
01:04:47,931 --> 01:04:50,061
mouth for a couple of days.
I would be very tempted this month to do

1431
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:51,630
that,
to play that game.

1432
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,640
I hate to tell you,
I don't know if I do it,

1433
01:04:53,641 --> 01:04:56,430
but I think about it,
if you could start to think about it.

1434
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,640
I'm going to start a business.
I look into some Novacane from my 

1435
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:01,640
tongue.
Why?

1436
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:01,980
No Dude,
who,

1437
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,480
uh,
he needed money to start a business.

1438
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:06,750
So he went to fucking Iraq,
whereas a mercenary.

1439
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,920
Really?
Yeah.

1440
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,940
He was in the military and went back and
worked as a contractor a couple of 

1441
01:05:13,971 --> 01:05:15,120
times.
Did it twice.

1442
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,660
He did it just because he needed money.
Does he work for when he does not have 

1443
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,090
those fucking unmentionable names?
Gotcha.

1444
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,480
Crossed.
But uh,

1445
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,990
people do anything if they need money.
I know people,

1446
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,320
people get to that situation where they 
have a serious debt and no way out of 

1447
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:31,320
it.
Yeah.

1448
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,500
You can split their mouth.
Absolutely.

1449
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:35,590
There's no doubt about it.
Spitting out cum in your mouth.

1450
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:37,810
That's a different game show.
And that's higher stakes.

1451
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,730
Well,
that's what God fear factor cancel.

1452
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,110
Really?
Yeah.

1453
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:41,830
They had a drink.
Come.

1454
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:47,110
There's a video of it online.
Have you noticed by the way that the 

1455
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,270
facebook for fear factor just started 
posting videos again,

1456
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,490
out of nowhere,
they're making all these new clips,

1457
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:56,491
these new fear factor clips with UNM and
it's probably because it was on like a 

1458
01:05:56,491 --> 01:05:58,900
bunch of those channels like chiller and
all those different things.

1459
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,690
It's been on them a few times out of 
nowhere.

1460
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,490
I'm just getting all these like,
hey,

1461
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,240
fear factor page released a new video 
that was a ridiculous show.

1462
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,150
It's hard to believe that the show was 
even real and I was,

1463
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,370
I was the host of it.
It was real.

1464
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,800
And so did you didn't really audition.
They came to you with that idea up and 

1465
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:16,800
running,
right?

1466
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:16,800
Well,
no,

1467
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,920
the idea already existed in another 
country.

1468
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,970
It was called now or never land in the 
Netherlands.

1469
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:24,490
In Holland.
And what was your reaction to this show?

1470
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:25,630
I was like,
this is ridiculous.

1471
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:32,310
I really did that,
that it was going to be cancelled 

1472
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:32,310
immediately.
I got a whole joke about it.

1473
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,100
Yeah.
You know,

1474
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,890
used to do on stage.
But um,

1475
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:41,010
I did have to audition for it though.
They had to see how I would interact 

1476
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:41,230
with people.
So um,

1477
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:47,250
I went down Hollywood boulevard with a 
camera crew and just stuck cameras in 

1478
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:47,590
people's faces and start asking them 
questions like,

1479
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:49,200
can I ask you a question man?
And they,

1480
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:50,740
you know,
they come over and then I started asking

1481
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,510
them like,
what kind of food and just be silly with

1482
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,440
them.
So they wanted that baby.

1483
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,600
Look at me.
Gorgeous fire dude.

1484
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:04,810
Damn that fear factor on twitter's now a
posting again too weird.

1485
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,630
Don't try to get me to do that show 
again.

1486
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:07,900
Brian.

1487
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,320
Joe,
come on.

1488
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,390
You're getting too busy already,
man.

1489
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,150
I'll do be doing less of this and I'm 
better at this.

1490
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,410
What if somebody like live leak bought 
the name fear factor in like,

1491
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:25,411
Joe,
we want you to do fear of not doing 

1492
01:07:25,411 --> 01:07:25,411
anything different.
No.

1493
01:07:25,411 --> 01:07:27,910
The only way I would ever do that again 
is if they broke the bank.

1494
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,240
I mean they'd have to.
I'd have to literally do some shit that 

1495
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,350
would bankrupt a small foreign country.
Drown you in cash.

1496
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,690
I'd have to literally make so much 
money,

1497
01:07:37,691 --> 01:07:41,450
I would think about like giant hunting 
preserves that I could buy,

1498
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,790
you know,
like in Colorado by a thousand acres and

1499
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,050
set up a fucking solar log cabin and 
vibe Brian over for dinner and then hunt

1500
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,980
him.
No ever have things like Brian.

1501
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,450
Brian's like,
he's like the puppy.

1502
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:58,220
You keep her on the house barks when 
Shit's going down.

1503
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:01,900
You don't want to chase him.
So rude.

1504
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,930
I had a friend that went to one of 
those,

1505
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:06,580
uh,
they have these hunting ranches.

1506
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,590
It's really kind of fucked up where they
will let an animal out there,

1507
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,380
like which animal do you want to hunt 
and what not,

1508
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,290
like have a menu and you go and you 
point it.

1509
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,010
And like this is

1510
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,910
one deer that has awesome antlers.
So.

1511
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,700
Okay,
let out number a.

1512
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:23,480
So the open the cage and this fucking 
thing goes wandering out.

1513
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:28,481
It goes right to the feeder because 
there's like a feeder that the deer's 

1514
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:31,570
eat from every day and you just sit and 
wait in front of the feet or for him to 

1515
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:31,620
show up and then you blast them.
Oof,

1516
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,650
wow.
I mean look,

1517
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:38,710
I guess that's better than farming.
I guess that's better than just,

1518
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,320
you know,
raise their cow houses I guess,

1519
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,710
but it's kind of,
I mean the only thing,

1520
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,480
I mean it's not a big area either,
so like a couple hundred acres.

1521
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:50,150
It's a pretty small.
I mean it's big for a yard,

1522
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,850
but it's not big for where a deer can 
get away from you.

1523
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,560
Sure.
No,

1524
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,580
they just let us fuck her out and you go
looking for them,

1525
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:56,890
but they keep pens.

1526
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,080
I was like,
that is one of the craziest things I've 

1527
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,080
ever heard of in my life and it's 
totally legal.

1528
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,990
Yeah,
I'm sure it is.

1529
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:04,430
Yeah.
I don't know about all that.

1530
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,220
I don't know about all that.
That seems.

1531
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:11,470
It seems like a good way to get antlers.
You know,

1532
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,480
if you want to make sure you shoot a 
deer with a big giant fucking head of 

1533
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:16,480
antlers.
But I mean,

1534
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,520
I guess it's what the supermarket,
if somebody wanted to kill you just for 

1535
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,310
like your teeth,
just to know that you're so crazy.

1536
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:29,330
It's worse than your teeth because you 
lose your antlers every year and then 

1537
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:33,080
the that baby teeth,
I'll give them to you.

1538
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:36,320
There's a whole thing about collecting 
sheds.

1539
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,230
Yeah,
like people collect these deer sheds and

1540
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:44,231
one of the things that does is it lets 
them know what kind of deer on their 

1541
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:44,231
land.

1542
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:44,780
So if you go collect the sheds and you 
find these big antlers,

1543
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:45,140
like,
Whoa,

1544
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:50,141
there's a big deer on this land I don't 
even know about because a lot of them 

1545
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:50,141
they'll,
there'll be like nocturnal,

1546
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:55,090
like especially when there's like 
hunting pressure or they think that 

1547
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,521
there's too many people around.
They bed down during the day and they 

1548
01:09:57,521 --> 01:09:57,521
only come out and eat at night.
So you don't,

1549
01:09:57,521 --> 01:10:00,560
you don't even see them there until you 
find these antlers like running around.

1550
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,800
So it's worse than that.
Someone would want to kill you for some 

1551
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,070
shit that you throw away every year.
But then there's the meat,

1552
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:12,810
the meat's delicious.
So sweet potato and garlic,

1553
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:19,310
little semen and coffee to full charge.
You need to wear that fucking shirt with

1554
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:22,520
all the guys on it and go sit in the 
corner.

1555
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,160
Fuckin terrible,
terrible person shirt.

1556
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:30,580
No.
This shirt with all with all the tax on 

1557
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:30,580
it.

1558
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:30,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

1559
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:30,740
We need a name for that shirt.
We should do that.

1560
01:10:30,741 --> 01:10:34,070
Like one day where the shirt will get 
them tailored.

1561
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,540
Would you wear them?
If I got stuff tailored,

1562
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,350
I'll wear a cream pie.
Okay.

1563
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:42,940
Try to find the gayest material that you
could find online and we'll bring it to 

1564
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,700
a tailor and we'll have some suits made 
up.

1565
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,860
Have you seen David shows?
Butthole hat?

1566
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,890
He has a butthole.
Just a butthole.

1567
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,270
Aso's Butthole.
Am I speeding?

1568
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,360
So there's no cheeks or anything.
It's just the whole.

1569
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,870
The butthole.
It's so great.

1570
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,550
It's the best part.
That's uncomfortable.

1571
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,660
David chose.
Fuck crazy man.

1572
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,450
He's fucking crazy.
That's exactly what happens.

1573
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,640
Like David chose exactly what happens 
when you say,

1574
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,910
what would you do if you had all the 
fucking money you could ever want?

1575
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:13,330
That's what you would do.
You do exactly what he's doing and on 

1576
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,130
top of that,
he can still sell those paintings.

1577
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:17,610
He makes for an godly sums of money when
he makes.

1578
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,410
It's not like he's not making money.
He,

1579
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,320
he sells his paintings were like insane 
amounts of money,

1580
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:25,650
but then on top of that,
he's got hundreds of millions of dollars

1581
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:28,140
that came from him painting facebook.
Right.

1582
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:28,630
So,
right.

1583
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:31,530
The whole thing,
he just doesn't give a fuck.

1584
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,390
Yeah.
He literally doesn't give a fuck.

1585
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:38,391
He's so crazy.
His shit that he's doing like on his 

1586
01:11:38,391 --> 01:11:38,840
instagram is so hilarious.
Have you watched any of them?

1587
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:40,590
No,
I gotta I gotTa look into dude,

1588
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,680
it's so funny.
It's him and Bobby Lee and they have 

1589
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,581
this thing called,
one of them is called Han Dynasty and 

1590
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:49,860
the other one is,
uh,

1591
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:53,250
what is the other one?
The other one is something about space.

1592
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,250
Let me pull it up because it's so 
ridiculous.

1593
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,150
But he's constantly doing shit 
constantly thing.

1594
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,640
This is the guy that took stock and 
facebook.

1595
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,950
This guy.
Yeah.

1596
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:09,590
He's hilarious dude.
And he's awesome as a podcast guest to 

1597
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:10,680
you.
Let me find out what the fuck is.

1598
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:15,710
His videos are called,
but they put them up all the time and 

1599
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:15,710
they're really ridiculous.

1600
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:20,490
That looks great guys.
A genius.

1601
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:23,990
It's made out of pizza.
The pizza crust.

1602
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:29,420
This is a.
He just recently did this mural that he 

1603
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:32,340
posted on his instagram.
Check this out.

1604
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:33,790
How awesome.
That is.

1605
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,150
Awesome.
He's a bad motherfucker,

1606
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:39,000
dude.
He's such a good guy too,

1607
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,710
man.
He's just like such a sweetheart.

1608
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,570
And he's,
he,

1609
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,600
he enjoys being shocking and he was a 
victim of a lot of people freaking out 

1610
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:52,860
about one of his podcasts because he had
said something crazy about how uh,

1611
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,340
he got a massage and forced them to suck
his dick forced.

1612
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,520
But people got mad at him because he 
raped somebody who kind of,

1613
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,900
you know,
he exaggerates shit.

1614
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,280
It's a girl he actually is dating or has
sex with on a regular basis.

1615
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:09,360
Like his version of the story is not 
completely accurate.

1616
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:14,790
Like he,
he leaves out stuff and add stuff to 

1617
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,790
make it more fucked up because he's,
he's,

1618
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:16,290
he's fucking with you.
Yeah.

1619
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:21,350
You go down until you find this one that
looked good.

1620
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:22,570
Okay.

1621
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,570
He's got underwear on his face and him 
and Bobby Lee and it's just,

1622
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,710
it's so ridiculous.
They're doing all these crazy videos.

1623
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,510
Hong Galaxies,
the other one.

1624
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:37,530
There's Hong Dynasty and Hong Galaxy and
he's just having fun.

1625
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,060
That's what he's doing.
He's just having fun.

1626
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:44,040
He was on vice for awhile,
but when he did that thing where they're

1627
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:48,030
doing the wrestling girls,
but when he did that thing where he,

1628
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:53,031
uh,
told that story about getting the 

1629
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:53,031
massage lady to blow them.
Yeah.

1630
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:53,910
They kicked them off.
Vice.

1631
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,130
Really?
Yeah.

1632
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:00,590
He got kicked off the show.
I know a girl that used to write for 

1633
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:03,081
advice and she got kicked off for 
writing something racist like two years 

1634
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:03,480
ago on twitter.
They went through a whole twitter feed.

1635
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,400
I should rephrase.
He didn't get kicked off,

1636
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:10,401
but they gave him an option.
The option was get rid of your 

1637
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:10,401
instagram.
Get rid of your twitter.

1638
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,070
No more social media stuff.
Get rid of your podcasts.

1639
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,450
And he was like,
what?

1640
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,550
That's what I did my thing.
He spelled it w t two.

1641
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,560
It was a fuck outta here.
He pulled out his bank card.

1642
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:29,050
I just want to show you how many Zeros.
There's a lot of Zeros.

1643
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:31,960
Those don't give a fuck points.
This is fuck you money.

1644
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:36,380
So fuck you.
I mean,

1645
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:36,800
I see it.

1646
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:37,890
Nobody's point,
man.

1647
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,650
I really do.
That's the real problem with twitter and

1648
01:14:40,651 --> 01:14:45,651
blogs is you get one point and even 
twitter it's one point and then one 

1649
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:50,271
point and then one point.
Then when you know one person back and 

1650
01:14:50,271 --> 01:14:50,271
you're playing tennis back and forth 
with the idea,

1651
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:54,780
it's just an ineffective way to 
communicate and resolve things.

1652
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,840
Communicating live in person is the only
way.

1653
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,730
Yeah.
Everything else is.

1654
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,760
It only works if everybody agrees to a 
certain series rules and like you 

1655
01:15:05,821 --> 01:15:10,821
establish that you're going to 
communicate with someone the way you 

1656
01:15:10,821 --> 01:15:11,760
would expect to be communicated with by 
then like best case scenario.

1657
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:14,760
I saw you on twitter sticking up for 
somebody that was just getting hammered.

1658
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:20,510
Oh,
that was a person who wrote something 

1659
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:20,640
bad about me too.
But you were like,

1660
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,050
hey look,
we can all have our opinions.

1661
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:22,590
It's all good.

1662
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:27,690
Yeah.
I mean I never said anything shitty to 

1663
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:27,690
her.
Yeah,

1664
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:27,690
no,
we,

1665
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,571
um,
when we went back and forth on twitter 

1666
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:32,670
we were,
we were talking about the actual issue 

1667
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:34,801
at hand.
She said a few ad homonym things about 

1668
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:34,801
me,
but they weren't anything really bad,

1669
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:36,940
you know,
it was like something about um,

1670
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:40,270
uh,
like what qualifies you to that opinion?

1671
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:45,271
Is it making people eat bugs on fear 
factor things along those lines was 

1672
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:45,271
like,
okay,

1673
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:50,370
you know,
even if you say something mean to me it 

1674
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,681
just means I'm going to stop 
communicating with you because I know 

1675
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:52,681
I'm getting better at this.
Right.

1676
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:56,691
And um,
I know when to engage people when not 

1677
01:15:56,691 --> 01:15:58,591
to,
but I also know like what I get out of 

1678
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:58,591
it,
you know,

1679
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:58,591
what do I get out of it?
I get it,

1680
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:02,910
something out of it.
If we can get a little long and get 

1681
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:03,010
through something civilly,
I get something out of it.

1682
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:03,870
I feel good.
Sure.

1683
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,940
When I have an interaction with somebody
online and if there's some sort of a 

1684
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:08,950
minor disagreement we could end with.
It's all good.

1685
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:10,690
That's cool.
Well thank you very much.

1686
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:11,470
Alright,
cool man.

1687
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,510
Nice.
I liked that.

1688
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:18,610
So I go towards that as much as I can in
this life and I've made mistakes.

1689
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:23,611
I think we all have,
but when I go to someone's twitter page 

1690
01:16:23,611 --> 01:16:25,990
and it's just a constant series of these
fucking bitter back and forth feuds,

1691
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:28,450
I'm like,
you're doing it wrong,

1692
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,680
right?
You're doing it wrong.

1693
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:30,540
We're all,
you know,

1694
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,320
we're all learning this as we go along.
I think.

1695
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,800
How'd you feel after the men see a 
fight?

1696
01:16:34,801 --> 01:16:36,840
I hate to keep bringing it up,
but I just watched it last night.

1697
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:41,841
Again,
Brian and I have talked about this a 

1698
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:41,841
million times.
Brian's favorite piece of,

1699
01:16:41,841 --> 01:16:46,230
or my favorite piece of Brian's work.
It was this cool to get all these 

1700
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,590
pieces,
it easy songs.

1701
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,220
Um,
but uh,

1702
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,320
there was a lot of negativity attached 
to it,

1703
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:57,440
a lot,
a lot of negative fucking comments and 

1704
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,160
tweets and messages I guess was like my 
space back then.

1705
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,170
But it was,
there was a lot of email.

1706
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:02,960
A lot of people got my email and sent me
a lot of,

1707
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:06,030
like really nasty shit,
but it was so poorly spelled,

1708
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:09,730
like the majority of it to save.
Think he's still

1709
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:20,410
got a folder on my fucking email called,
it's just called fans because it was so 

1710
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:23,540
bad.
It was so ridiculous.

1711
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:24,500
It was like,
come on.

1712
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:26,980
Is this real?
This is real.

1713
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:30,260
People like it didn't even like the big 
one.

1714
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:32,810
One of the big ones was them saying,
you know,

1715
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:34,460
he did it better.
Yeah,

1716
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:39,080
I heard that cause he did it better just
because he did it better.

1717
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:44,230
Okay.
You're like fucking all jealous over 

1718
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,961
there because he did it better.
But even that died off.

1719
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:51,440
Man Stopped.
It was a moment in comedy history.

1720
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,540
Yeah.
But a lot of negativity,

1721
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:55,280
man,
lot of negativity attached to it.

1722
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,410
But sometimes you gotta get your hands 
dirty.

1723
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,300
Well you stuck up for a lot of people.
That's the thing.

1724
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:00,830
And I remember you used to write about 
it.

1725
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,930
I think I used to see it on my space or 
whatever.

1726
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,330
I mean you stick up for a lot of little 
guys when you did that,

1727
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,370
you know.
Well that's where it all came from.

1728
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:12,371
It came from guys like Johnny Sanchez 
getting fucked over and are we getting 

1729
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:14,480
fucked over?
And countless numbers of dues.

1730
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:19,481
It's,
it makes for a hostile environment when 

1731
01:18:19,481 --> 01:18:22,110
you have to hit that flashing light at 
the store because you know he's in the 

1732
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:22,110
back of the room.
If everyone comics,

1733
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:22,910
I'll have that little little signal 
thing.

1734
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:28,300
They would go over and flick the light a
couple of times because he was in the 

1735
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:28,300
back of the room.
Right.

1736
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,300
That's just dark dude.
Yeah,

1737
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,330
but we're learning,
you know,

1738
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,380
and we're learning.
Now.

1739
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:38,381
Look,
if he had to start his career over 

1740
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:38,381
again,
dudes,

1741
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:38,381
good performer,
man.

1742
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,400
If he could start his career over again 
and just do it the right way,

1743
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:41,750
you know,
he,

1744
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:46,751
he would have been a different person if
he started out today as opposed to back 

1745
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:46,751
then,
yeah,

1746
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:48,950
probably be a different person,
but if you get off on the wrong foot and

1747
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:52,160
you stay on that wrong foot and then you
justify your actions all along the way,

1748
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:57,370
you get to a point where you're two 
decades into a career that's bullshit 

1749
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:57,370
and you don't know how to write.

1750
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:58,460
Yeah.
You don't know how to write it all.

1751
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,080
Yeah.
That's a super common thing.

1752
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:05,290
You see that with biters,
you see that with guys going back and 

1753
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:05,290
trying to create new stuff and it's 
like,

1754
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:06,560
oh my God,
you're lost at sea.

1755
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,320
Like you,
you literally don't know how to do it.

1756
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:15,330
Like the,
you would see the contrast between the 

1757
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:16,700
stuff that they obviously stole and then
the stuff they obviously wrote.

1758
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:17,600
Right?
And it's like,

1759
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:22,720
oh good Lord,
like this is like you're speaking two 

1760
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,901
different languages.
It's like one of these things is made 

1761
01:19:25,901 --> 01:19:25,901
out of vegetables and one of these 
things made out of shit.

1762
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,530
It's so obvious to anybody who's paying 
attention,

1763
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:32,390
but I don't know,
man.

1764
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:37,420
It's um,
sometimes it's important to do negative 

1765
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:37,420
things.
Yeah.

1766
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,590
It's just,
it depends on what's happening.

1767
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:44,890
But it also exposed a lot about the 
businessman that people didn't want to 

1768
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:44,960
believe.
Yeah.

1769
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,520
Because nobody wanted to believe that if
you like,

1770
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,160
had a beef with some famous person who 
had it out for you,

1771
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:53,830
that they could ruin your career.
Right.

1772
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,820
But he tried to do that to me.
Yeah.

1773
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:58,220
And he said he didn't have the power to 
do it.

1774
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,070
It did it work so far as the comedy 
store,

1775
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,380
was that where you work that weekend?
I mean,

1776
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,580
he got me banned from that weekend.
Right.

1777
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,160
But he made a deal with the guy that's 
not there anymore.

1778
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,250
Oh really?
I don't know the exact details of it,

1779
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:13,350
but it was the only time ever where his 
name was on the marquee.

1780
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,350
He never let them put his name on the 
marquee names on the marquee and he was 

1781
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:18,350
headlining the whole weekend.
Yeah.

1782
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:21,080
So it was like this big thing that I was
gone and he was headlining,

1783
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:25,260
put his name on the Marquee and um,
I forgot my point.

1784
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:30,780
It doesn't matter.
It's a pointless beaten into the ground 

1785
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:34,010
story.
But the bottom line was after all the 

1786
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:37,680
dust settled,
everybody sort of eventually got a sense

1787
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:42,681
of what it really was all about.
It's really all about is all these 

1788
01:20:42,681 --> 01:20:45,261
people.
Some have a similar story and we're all 

1789
01:20:45,261 --> 01:20:45,261
dealing with something that is just 
undeniable.

1790
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,800
Is that door open back there?
Jamie?

1791
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,710
See if that fucking doors up because 
that shit is super loud.

1792
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:55,970
It's not.
We need to figure out a way to like 

1793
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,190
soundproof the ceiling because when they
those guys are banging shit over there 

1794
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,340
banging shit.

1795
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:04,460
Not like that kind of bang.
I was at a hotel and I heard someone 

1796
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,490
fucker did happen in a long time.
I was in a hotel.

1797
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:11,520
I was 18.
I was in a hotel room with my parents 

1798
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:11,880
and the people next door were fucking.
We beat each other.

1799
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,440
No,
not at all.

1800
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:18,680
In the same room with your parents was 
in the same room with my parents and 

1801
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:18,680
those people.
Fucking next door's.

1802
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,430
Did your parents do Dave?
Everyone.

1803
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,800
We wanted the elephant in the other 
room,

1804
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:24,960
like good white people.
Oh my God.

1805
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,320
This lady was going like.

1806
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:29,430
Yeah.

1807
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:33,410
It was like a shaky thing.
She's been rattled.

1808
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,570
Right?
Who's weird?

1809
01:21:35,571 --> 01:21:37,550
One of the Caesar Girls.
Yeah.

1810
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,340
I don't know.
I wasn't loud enough for me to record.

1811
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,290
I was trying to get my.

1812
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,500
I phoned up to the door.

1813
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:48,990
He hotel.
We were in Washington dc at this old 

1814
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:48,990
hotel.
By the way,

1815
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:49,610
those old hotels,
they can all suck it.

1816
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:55,180
Those old hotels.
They try to pretend that it's cool to 

1817
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,431
stay in this creaky ass fucking hotel 
where when someone flushes their toilet 

1818
01:21:57,431 --> 01:22:02,050
three floors above you,
it's like a roaring train is running 

1819
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,291
through your room.
Every time someone walked above me or 

1820
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:05,850
hurt,
I was like,

1821
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,160
this is stupid.

1822
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:12,530
Yeah.
It's a boutique hotel and they're using 

1823
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:12,530
more expensive than like some of the 
newer hotels.

1824
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:13,070
Yes,
it was.

1825
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:16,130
It was expensive as fuck.
It was stupid dumb ass hotel,

1826
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:21,131
but people be fucking couldn't figure 
out where they were fucking there above 

1827
01:22:23,361 --> 01:22:25,580
me or to the side of me.
You ever hear that?

1828
01:22:25,581 --> 01:22:28,580
It'll stand bit where he's like,
not only can you hear them fucking,

1829
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:29,270
you can smell it.

1830
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,870
That's how bad the hotels where there 
was this place in Arizona,

1831
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:37,420
we stayed at that.
The bottom of the door had like a good,

1832
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:42,421
like three inches underneath it,
so you would just be in bed and you 

1833
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:44,050
would see people walking down the 
hallway.

1834
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,540
It's like,

1835
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,840
that's ridiculous.
Yeah,

1836
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:50,330
but that's part of the fun of the road.
Especially,

1837
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:53,600
you know when you're with friends.
The early days especially,

1838
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:56,900
I stayed once.
I did a Gig on this fucking island,

1839
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,720
block island,
an island outside of Rhode Island.

1840
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:02,320
I think that's a black guy on a blog,
but it's,

1841
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:07,340
uh,
it's the people that lived there were 

1842
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:10,860
the drunkest troglodytes I've ever 
performed in front of ever.

1843
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,220
I mean,
this guy,

1844
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:17,221
Scott Scott was the guy who booked it 
and he was the opening act and he went 

1845
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:20,281
up and just ate a plate of shit.
It was just no one was getting anything 

1846
01:23:20,281 --> 01:23:21,550
out of this crowd.
We both sucked at the time,

1847
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:26,970
but I mean it was,
the Gig was impossible because no one 

1848
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,450
was getting through this alive.
It was,

1849
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,850
there was maybe 30 people in the room.
It was like they had a bar and then they

1850
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,560
just announced the show was going to 
happen.

1851
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:35,410
It was the first one ever first and only
one it was me and him.

1852
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,900
So we did the Gig gigs,
death,

1853
01:23:37,901 --> 01:23:42,901
just hot death.
They didn't want to pay us because it 

1854
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:42,901
was awful.
They said,

1855
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:43,450
we've salted the people that were,
that came there.

1856
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,500
There wasn't a yelling shit the moment 
ago.

1857
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,620
It was just monsters.
There were,

1858
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:53,710
there were pirates and then we had to 
stay in a supply room.

1859
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:58,890
We had cots that they had set up in a 
room with stacks of like canned tomatoes

1860
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:00,320
and fucking,
you know,

1861
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:05,550
Syrup for soda machines and Shit and 
containers of nitrous oxide,

1862
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:10,651
that kind of shit.
It was like a storage room and they put 

1863
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:10,651
two cots there with no bathroom and 
that's where we slept.

1864
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:13,840
Shakey's they said they had a room for 
us.

1865
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:14,770
Where's the room?
Well,

1866
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:18,810
we take it back here and they brought us
to this room and it was a storage room.

1867
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:22,660
They put a cotton you could sleep here.
Fairy comes at six in the morning.

1868
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:25,960
So we had to sleep there and then we had
to leave on the ferry at 6:00

1869
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:26,710
in the morning,
whatever.

1870
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,010
Time was fucked.
Oh,

1871
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:31,320
it was gross.
And the dude I was with was partying.

1872
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:34,630
So he was a disaster.
It was just,

1873
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,270
you know,
if you wanted to get drunk and do coke,

1874
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:38,540
it was there.
Right.

1875
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,900
It was just everybody was just like,
there's no cops here.

1876
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,830
The cops are coming this fucking crazy 
island.

1877
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:49,690
There's only 100 people.
Everyone is like one drink away from 

1878
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:51,610
death,
just barely hanging on.

1879
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:56,640
You might as well stay up until six.
You could hear their liver like pop 

1880
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,920
rocks going off under their skin.
So they're shouting so much liver.

1881
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,530
It's just fucking struggling to stay 
together.

1882
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:06,400
Like the Millennium Falcon when it was 
shaking,

1883
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,710
trying to achieve the warp speed,
the liver.

1884
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:17,640
I'll just never forget.
There was this table of like three or 

1885
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,281
four people together talk and and Scott 
starts to show when he starts to show 

1886
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:24,211
that I got,
they just turn to them and like yelling,

1887
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:28,300
fuck it.
That's bobby missing teeth.

1888
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:33,250
And their faces are all pruned up from 
the fucking cold wind and the sea water.

1889
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:39,160
It's death.
It was one of those places you could not

1890
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:44,161
live if you lived.
Everybody would just slowly start 

1891
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:44,260
disappearing and horrible accidents.
Sure.

1892
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:45,910
Like if they made you live on that 
island,

1893
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,260
you'll go,
you know,

1894
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:50,980
and you had that guys your navy.
But alright today I'm taking him fishing

1895
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,660
and I ain't taking them back.
There's mother fuckers gonna fall in the

1896
01:25:55,661 --> 01:25:56,110
water.

1897
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:01,030
Yeah.
Where do you live?

1898
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,100
Fucking super important part of your 
life.

1899
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:08,990
You live in a shitty spot.
It's really hard to have fun and now 

1900
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:11,981
that means shitty spotlight.
You're way better off with like really 

1901
01:26:11,981 --> 01:26:11,981
good friends were the weather sucks 
Dick.

1902
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,130
Sure.
Well yeah,

1903
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:17,300
whether cannot destroy you that much,
but if you're in a bad neighborhood,

1904
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,790
that's why.
Yeah.

1905
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,760
Like anybody thinks kids should pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps.

1906
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:27,850
It's tough.
Imagine being born and fucking watts 

1907
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,180
living in the worst sections of 
Inglewood or or you know,

1908
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:33,080
being a Gypsy Caravan family and fucking
England.

1909
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,810
You might not even know someone that 
could teach you how to do it.

1910
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:39,500
And there's a lot about examples all 
over the place of what to do and like we

1911
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:41,750
were talking about with Michael Irvin,
like kids,

1912
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,350
everyone's programmed differently so it 
becomes like this repeating cycle.

1913
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:49,730
Unless you get out,
unless you are a performer or athlete or

1914
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:54,731
someone who figures out a way to start a
business and get out of the get out of 

1915
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:55,340
the neighborhood and sort of reset 
yourself and figure out what the foot.

1916
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:59,090
What kind of fucking trial was I on?
What kind of path was I riding on?

1917
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,960
It must be weird to mix with the rich 
after that.

1918
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:04,850
Well,
you know what's the weirdest shit?

1919
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,580
You could just drive to Beverley hills.
Yeah,

1920
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:09,830
it's right there.
It doesn't take long to get there.

1921
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:14,890
So you could live in the worst 
neighborhood in La and just close your 

1922
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:14,890
door.
Start Your car,

1923
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:19,720
start driving in 15 minutes later you're
standing in front of a house that's 

1924
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,310
worth $50 million.

1925
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:24,320
That's,
that's weird.

1926
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,310
It is weird.
I mean that we are.

1927
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:32,320
And then how about this?
The person who lives in Compton or 

1928
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,320
whatever,
shit neighborhood they could get in 

1929
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:35,320
their car and drive to Tijuana and go,
oh,

1930
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,460
oh,
I thought I had it.

1931
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:39,760
Let's get back to compton.
I'm worried.

1932
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,750
Get away from this cardboard house with 
no windows.

1933
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,660
You know,
are we allowed to make fun of Gypsies?

1934
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:47,630
Like is there any kind of.
Except for gypsy.

1935
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:48,950
That's not true.
That's not true.

1936
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:51,110
There's some feedback.
There's some blow back in England.

1937
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,300
Really Gypsy's yeah.
If you start shitting on Gypsies in 

1938
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:56,300
other countries,
they get very upset.

1939
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,880
Can we still call them Gypsies?
Rogatory yet?

1940
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,260
I don't think so.
I don't think it's derogatory.

1941
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:01,880
Hmm.
Let's look it up.

1942
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:06,470
Someone is offended.
A lot of Gypsies in Burbank and they,

1943
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:11,471
they,
they're always hanging out in my 

1944
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:11,471
dumpster there.

1945
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:11,471
American Gypsy hanging out in your 
dumpster.

1946
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:16,480
They pull up in these weird vans that 
have beads all over on me just like all 

1947
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,471
come out of this van and they all just 
start going through all the trash and 

1948
01:28:20,471 --> 01:28:21,200
there's a lot of bands in my 
neighborhood recently,

1949
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:24,950
like people just live on my street now 
in advance.

1950
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,060
Here we go.
Ready?

1951
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:27,890
Yo,
that's racist.

1952
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,560
A racial slur.
This was a surprise.

1953
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:37,570
The end where it wasn't in the retort 
article on Gawker about a child that was

1954
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:42,770
taken away from a couple because she 
didn't look like them and it says police

1955
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,910
rescue,
mystery,

1956
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:48,911
blonde child from Gypsy couple,
and then this article goes on to 

1957
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:52,970
describe that it says the term Gypsies 
and non preferred and often derogatory 

1958
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:56,000
term for Roma people.
For those of you who aren't aware of the

1959
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:01,060
Anti Roma Bigotry,
the Roma are an indigenous people of 

1960
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,420
Europe who continued to be pushed from 
nation to nation and mistreated.

1961
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:08,750
Okay?
That's one take on it by a friend who 

1962
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:12,711
lived outside of London who had these 
Gypsies move into the lot near their 

1963
01:29:12,711 --> 01:29:14,430
friend's house and absolutely destroy 
it,

1964
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,250
destroy the neighborhood,
leave their trash everywhere.

1965
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:22,251
Rob,
all the houses in the neighborhood like 

1966
01:29:22,251 --> 01:29:23,640
there are also notorious criminals,
notorious,

1967
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,750
right?
I mean there's no.

1968
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:27,060
They're not all criminals,
but there's a lot of them.

1969
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:29,850
They live a crazy lifestyle.
They're always bare knuckle fighting.

1970
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:32,130
They have these videos,
they challenge each other online.

1971
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:37,150
It's awesome.
Various beautiful slice of our human 

1972
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:41,691
culture in 2012,
but to this portrayal of it is so 

1973
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:43,570
ridiculously one side of him,
right?

1974
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,150
They are pushed from nation to nation 
and mistreated.

1975
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,060
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

1976
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:53,061
We don't want you leaving your garbage 
everywhere and fighting in the streets 

1977
01:29:53,061 --> 01:29:53,061
and stabbing my friends.
No,

1978
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:55,350
please don't do that anymore.
Or whatever you been doing.

1979
01:29:55,690 --> 01:30:00,690
Say stabbing.
I don't know if they're involved in 

1980
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:02,631
stabbing,
but that's part of the game is we got a 

1981
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:02,631
row of town to town and we got to hustle
money.

1982
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:02,850
They're wild people,
man.

1983
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,960
I mean,
it's fascinating.

1984
01:30:03,961 --> 01:30:05,650
The movie snatch was awesome.
Yeah,

1985
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:06,050
yeah,
yeah,

1986
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:07,260
yeah.
We're actually moving on it.

1987
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,770
Fucking awesome with the way Brad Pitt,
that whole dialect,

1988
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,770
so fucking awesome.
The article goes on.

1989
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:18,600
They are frequently denied legal status 
and therefore social services.

1990
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,910
There are many stereotypes about the 
Roma,

1991
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:24,150
but the most predominant is that they're
all sociopathic.

1992
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:29,151
Drifters who steal children and anything
else that isn't tied down well.

1993
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:34,990
It's been my experience that very few 
people who do nothing wrong or labeled 

1994
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:36,840
as sociopathic thieves who steal 
children.

1995
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:42,320
Very few people.
One of the things that they don't say 

1996
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,721
about those Tibetan Buddhist monks is 
that there's sociopathic thieves who 

1997
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:44,721
steal children.

1998
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:49,400
Yeah.
They said that about a mother theresa a 

1999
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:49,400
lot to.
Right,

2000
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:49,830
and all the stationary I think feeds who
steal children.

2001
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:54,860
Yeah.
I don't know man ejaculates in people's 

2002
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:59,331
coffee.
It's not healthy to paint things in a 

2003
01:30:59,331 --> 01:31:02,301
completely unrealistic biased way like 
this guy is doing just to prove that 

2004
01:31:02,301 --> 01:31:03,080
you're not racist.
Right?

2005
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:04,530
That shit's not healthy.
Now.

2006
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:07,530
I know you should talk about the reality
of their life.

2007
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:11,880
Like it doesn't help anybody if you 
bullshit people on what these folks do.

2008
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,470
Right in,
and again,

2009
01:31:13,471 --> 01:31:18,471
it's not all of them,
but the fact that you're saying that 

2010
01:31:18,471 --> 01:31:18,960
Gypsy's haven't been involved in 
conflicts or the Roma people,

2011
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:21,450
whatever the fuck you want to call them,
you'd be lying.

2012
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:22,250
Right?
Right.

2013
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:27,120
When we could all come up with different
reasons for why cultural biological,

2014
01:31:27,121 --> 01:31:32,121
you know,
there's all sorts of variables that are 

2015
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:32,121
entering into this equation,
but to portray it like this,

2016
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:36,771
like these,
these beautiful people that are just 

2017
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:38,481
roaming from town to town and everyone's
just pushing them away because of the 

2018
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:41,340
patriarchy because white,
white people privileged.

2019
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,500
Right.
I check my privilege online.

2020
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:44,070
Did you do that?
Yeah,

2021
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:45,180
I saw that.
Yeah.

2022
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,150
My Shit.
Lord.

2023
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,790
What?
What website is your shit?

2024
01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:53,430
Fucking asshole.
You're a part of the problem.

2025
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,480
What,
what,

2026
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,370
where can you get your privilege?
Check your privilege.com.

2027
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,050
Okay,
cool.

2028
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,460
Yeah,
I'm just about what should be an app and

2029
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:03,490
it already was.
And then someone sent me a link.

2030
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,270
It's an actual website.
So I went through the website,

2031
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:09,010
check my privilege and so you don't have
a lot of privilege.

2032
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:10,920
Your Shit.
Too much privileged.

2033
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,600
So I'm,
that's what it is.

2034
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:17,870
Everyone who's.
I think if you're white and you don't 

2035
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:17,870
have aids,
you're shit Lord.

2036
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:18,070
Okay.
I think that's pretty much how it goes.

2037
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:23,790
What's going on in this world?
There's something strange going on in 

2038
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:23,790
this world,
man.

2039
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:24,190
Just something strange,
this,

2040
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:28,060
this article is proof of it.
People are going way out of their way to

2041
01:32:28,061 --> 01:32:33,061
show that they're sensitive and open 
minded to the point where they're not 

2042
01:32:33,061 --> 01:32:33,061
really open minded.

2043
01:32:33,061 --> 01:32:33,330
You're denying reality.
Yeah.

2044
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:38,340
It's like it doesn't help anybody.
It doesn't help anybody to only only 

2045
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:43,651
side with the maligned and mistreated in
the misrepresented to always side with 

2046
01:32:43,651 --> 01:32:44,030
them.
Yes.

2047
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,880
That's not,
that's not healthy.

2048
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:50,050
Like marginalized people.
There's marginalized groups for sure and

2049
01:32:50,051 --> 01:32:53,170
it's good to recognize when they're 
being mistreated,

2050
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:56,080
but the reality of their behavior can't 
be ignored.

2051
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,450
Like you can't do that.
Right?

2052
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,350
It muddies up the whole thing.
Yeah.

2053
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:04,380
You can still sign with them,
but you have to admit the facts and you 

2054
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,531
have to admit that they survive ways 
that can hurt other civilians.

2055
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:10,130
Other people.
Yeah.

2056
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,340
And you know what man,
hey,

2057
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:15,100
that's the reality of the world they're 
thrust into.

2058
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,600
Yeah.
If you were there,

2059
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:17,160
like,
you know,

2060
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:21,360
I watched this video on poachers in 
Africa and all these people that like,

2061
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:22,360
they,
they,

2062
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:25,780
uh,
they illegally capture these animals and

2063
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:28,510
sometimes it's the only food that these 
people can get,

2064
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:31,420
like,
like they're in terrible situations.

2065
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:33,940
They have these ridiculous guns.
They construct,

2066
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,000
they,
they make their own charges and light.

2067
01:33:37,001 --> 01:33:40,360
They're gone sometimes with a lighter 
and then shoot it at these animals.

2068
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:42,490
I mean they pack these things like 
muskets.

2069
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:44,680
I think a rifle and a packet,
like a musket and then like,

2070
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:46,120
like,
like a fuse,

2071
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:47,050
like it's a bomb.
I mean,

2072
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:51,460
it's ridiculous how poor and rudimentary
some of this shit is.

2073
01:33:51,461 --> 01:33:53,260
These guys are doing.
You gotta wonder like,

2074
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:55,120
what are this?
What are these guys?

2075
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,590
Options man,
right?

2076
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:01,740
I mean,
you're getting mad at this guy for 

2077
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:01,740
poaching animal's needs.
Yeah.

2078
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,650
It's terrible to shoot someone else's 
property.

2079
01:34:02,651 --> 01:34:04,390
You know?
Even if you are starving to death,

2080
01:34:04,391 --> 01:34:05,530
it seems,
it seems wrong,

2081
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:07,540
but moved to America and work on Wall 
Street.

2082
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,500
Why does he do that?
He knows it's this should.

2083
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:14,170
Why doesn't he get an education?
Why hasn't he wash his feet?

2084
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:18,070
He's got old plastic water bottles that 
he's turned into flip flops.

2085
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,170
What's this Guy Thinking?
Why isn't he smarter?

2086
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:21,790
Yeah,
you can't.

2087
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:26,850
You can't judge people like that.
The way you would judge a person from a 

2088
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:27,370
normal neighborhood with a normal 
background.

2089
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,280
I mean normal bilich healthy.
No,

2090
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,550
no,
no.

2091
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,910
Serious trauma.
There's a reason he's in that situation.

2092
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:37,200
You're not in that situation.
You don't seek that situation.

2093
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,920
No.
What the fuck,

2094
01:34:38,921 --> 01:34:39,690
man,
that's,

2095
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:45,140
that's the real problem with the world.
The real problem in the world is like 

2096
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,420
the one percent that everybody wants to 
think about that if you make more than 

2097
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:49,120
$34,000
a year,

2098
01:34:49,121 --> 01:34:51,160
you're in the top one percent of all 
people on the planet.

2099
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,160
Really?
I did not know that.

2100
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:59,250
Yeah.
Kevin Smith and I talked about it the 

2101
01:34:59,250 --> 01:34:59,250
other day and I've talked about it on 
this podcast before too.

2102
01:34:59,250 --> 01:34:59,570
That's a real number.

2103
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,330
That's so when you talking about 
poachers,

2104
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:04,130
are you talking about impoverished 
people?

2105
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,640
The level of poverty that the people who
work at Foxconn have.

2106
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:08,720
When you say,
man,

2107
01:35:08,721 --> 01:35:11,210
those people live there.
There's nets around the building to keep

2108
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:16,211
them jumping off the roof,
like we can't even imagine what that 

2109
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:16,730
life is like.
And those are people just like,

2110
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:18,670
you just like me,
just like you,

2111
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:20,240
just,
just people just,

2112
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:21,650
if we were born in China,
we'd be like,

2113
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:23,090
fuck dude,
we got to go to the Foxconn.

2114
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:28,270
We can't go.
We can't have the option to go to the 

2115
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:30,161
store tonight.
You know what's called perform at the 

2116
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:30,161
comedy store?
No,

2117
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:30,260
we can't.
We have to make cell phones for a nickel

2118
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:30,680
an hour.

2119
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:33,980
I got a suicide at noon.
Um,

2120
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,330
how,
how does that work?

2121
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:40,330
They don't like apply for those jobs.
Do they just kind of.

2122
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:44,080
If they can,
I don't even know if there's enough jobs

2123
01:35:44,081 --> 01:35:47,920
to supply all the people that are poor 
and looking for jobs there.

2124
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,830
There's a billion people in China.
It's crazy.

2125
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:53,110
A billion and they just hacked our 
weather system.

2126
01:35:53,111 --> 01:35:58,111
Did you see that?
We're talking about the US said today 

2127
01:35:58,111 --> 01:36:01,141
that China has hacked our radar and 
satellite are or whether or like one of 

2128
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:06,770
our things that we use for our news 
every day and they packed it or 

2129
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:11,701
satellite and that's why I pull up an 
article on it so we can get a more 

2130
01:36:11,701 --> 01:36:12,220
definitive description of what's going 
on.

2131
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,170
That's why I feel like the whole month 
of October,

2132
01:36:14,171 --> 01:36:19,171
I think there was very limited radar in 
the news and the consumer from China 

2133
01:36:19,171 --> 01:36:20,820
hacked our radar dishes,
governments,

2134
01:36:20,821 --> 01:36:23,450
but that's hilarious.
China,

2135
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:28,480
so the Chinese government hacked our 
radar system or whether system,

2136
01:36:28,481 --> 01:36:30,530
whether it radar,
what are they doing with it?

2137
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:33,480
They stealing the data.
Why do they care what the temperature is

2138
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:38,490
over here?
US weather's so much while I'm at 75 

2139
01:36:40,781 --> 01:36:42,400
degrees in Los Angeles,
by the way,

2140
01:36:42,401 --> 01:36:43,790
terrible accidents.
Both of us,

2141
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,200
both of us.
I didn't know which way to go to go.

2142
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:48,760
Super Chinese are just weird.

2143
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,090
Weird.
If you don't know what you're doing.

2144
01:36:52,091 --> 01:36:54,610
Chinese reportedly hack us weather 
systems.

2145
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,320
What Chinese hackers allegedly broke 
into the US weather systems in September

2146
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:04,500
and caused federal cyber security forces
to block sensitive data needed for 

2147
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:08,911
crucial uses,
including disaster planning and 

2148
01:37:08,911 --> 01:37:08,911
aviation.
So they,

2149
01:37:08,911 --> 01:37:13,330
they,
they fucked with like a lot more than 

2150
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:13,330
just like the weather radar.
Wow.

2151
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:14,980
But uh,
who knows who's doing that though?

2152
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,150
You know,
we say China,

2153
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:21,170
like who just is a billion people.
Could be one asshole would call it 

2154
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:22,220
China.
Yeah.

2155
01:37:22,221 --> 01:37:24,610
It's only like one to 10 assholes.
Who were they saying,

2156
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,960
you know what I mean,
to be food in China.

2157
01:37:28,961 --> 01:37:30,430
Did this.
And we're blaming China.

2158
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:31,450
Right.
Let's go to war.

2159
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:31,950
I mean,
is this.

2160
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:36,980
Yeah.
Is this an official government a thing 

2161
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,800
that did this or looking by the way 
while we're looking.

2162
01:37:38,801 --> 01:37:43,801
Did you try to sit in that chair?
You prefer better?

2163
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,360
This is way better for my posture.
Right?

2164
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:49,090
Better for my back.
But I knew I was going to need to lounge

2165
01:37:49,091 --> 01:37:50,320
a little bit while I was here.
I don't know.

2166
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:53,950
That's your thing.
So this is a clearly better chair,

2167
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:56,490
but this me more relaxed.

2168
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,670
I'll give up relaxation for posture.
Yeah.

2169
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,830
Alright.
I'm still with the Ergonomic chairs,

2170
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:04,350
the best ergonomic chair I've ever had 
earlier this week.

2171
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:09,351
The posts also reported that Chinese 
government hackers were suspected of 

2172
01:38:09,351 --> 01:38:13,251
breaking into the US Postal Service 
computer networks and stealing the 

2173
01:38:13,251 --> 01:38:14,160
personal data belonging to hundreds and 
thousands of employees.

2174
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:17,730
Retires and customers or employees of 
the post office.

2175
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,760
Yeah.
The Chinese government's supposedly 

2176
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,190
awesome broken to our usbs or us,
but their.

2177
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:25,700
Their government hackers.
Yeah.

2178
01:38:25,701 --> 01:38:28,890
They're government hackers,
meaning that they know my po box.

2179
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:34,460
That's terrifying.
They're getting all those things that 

2180
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:34,830
try to get you to join scientology.
They're getting all those first.

2181
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:41,070
Getting all those postcards to again,
take a personality test before I can 

2182
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:43,200
fuck.
I've been scientists.

2183
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:46,740
Who knows what that means though.
Chinese government hackers who does.

2184
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:48,140
What does that mean?
You know,

2185
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:53,150
I'm not sure.
That's such a broad statement for what 

2186
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:53,150
department?

2187
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:54,720
Under whose jurisdiction?
Like with what objective,

2188
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,940
who are the humans that are doing it?
You know,

2189
01:38:56,941 --> 01:39:00,000
you say Chinese government hackers like.
Yeah.

2190
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,980
Okay.
It could be anybody.

2191
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,650
It could be someone blaming the Chinese 
because they are doing it.

2192
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,010
Know who the fuck knows.
They don't really break that down.

2193
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:09,000
Huh?
Fucking Gypsies.

2194
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,780
So.
So Gypsy Bro.

2195
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:18,320
Well,
Romas at black chips.

2196
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:20,580
So that's kind of like a loophole.
No,

2197
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:23,940
you better not transgender Gypsies to 
stop right there.

2198
01:39:23,941 --> 01:39:26,670
Don't say God damn.
Trend to Gypsies.

2199
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:31,840
Trans Gypsies got our podcast canceled.
You did this shit Lord.

2200
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,470
Tractor hit the roof.
Kind of look into that loophole.

2201
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:37,140
You're not supposed to say bitch 
anymore,

2202
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,650
which is a new one to try and take away.
Bitch sucks.

2203
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:43,770
It's such a nice heart out on a sentence
like fuck you bitch.

2204
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:46,530
You know,
listen to you and works comedically.

2205
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,240
Some girl at the comedy store the other 
day,

2206
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,580
one of the waitresses said,
get the fuck Outta here.

2207
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:53,250
Bitch said it to this dude.
And I gave her knuckles.

2208
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:54,330
I go,
that was a strong bitch.

2209
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:55,740
Yeah.
It's like she goes,

2210
01:39:55,741 --> 01:39:56,950
it was right.
Yeah.

2211
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,410
The way it came out just said,
yeah,

2212
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:03,590
I would hate to live in a world where 
someone couldn't say something like 

2213
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,920
that.
Like the Joe when Joey d is correct.

2214
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:05,580
You like,
please bitch,

2215
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:11,090
get the fuck Outta here bitch.
The best way to condescend and just and 

2216
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:13,380
humiliate someone and onstage.
It's one of my favorite words.

2217
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:16,670
I will not stop using it if you got.
If you got a sentence,

2218
01:40:16,671 --> 01:40:18,360
it's not.
Or a punchline is not really working.

2219
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:23,450
You can throw one bitch a set in there 
and that'll save that punchline 

2220
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:23,450
sometimes.
Yeah.

2221
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:27,600
Maybe you just need to get back to the 
drawing board with that fucking bitch on

2222
01:40:27,601 --> 01:40:30,960
it and call it a day.
Silly Bitch.

2223
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:31,630
I'll never give up.

2224
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:35,130
Say No matter what Allie bitches.
So unthreatening yeah.

2225
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:39,360
That it just should be let slide in it.
Which makes sense.

2226
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:45,290
You know what I'm saying?
It's like you can't say you silly kike 

2227
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:46,530
no.
Hey,

2228
01:40:46,531 --> 01:40:48,810
that's on you a,
it's not even cute.

2229
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,390
Rude,
silly gypsy.

2230
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,890
That middle ground.
Yeah.

2231
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,930
You know,
I wonder if you could still say homo.

2232
01:40:56,490 --> 01:41:01,490
No,
I haven't heard anybody trying to ban 

2233
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:01,490
it.
You'll be okay.

2234
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,620
But it's not.
It's frowned upon.

2235
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:04,540
I think it's not supposed to say 
something's gay.

2236
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:05,680
Sure.
Can't say,

2237
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:06,730
Oh my God,
this movie's Gay.

2238
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:08,050
That's uh,
that's not good.

2239
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:10,850
You obviously can't say the F bomb.
Yeah.

2240
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:14,950
He can't say fag.
She easily not even with the hail,

2241
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:17,920
usually you can say faggotry because it 
has not been defined.

2242
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:19,610
Yeah.
Um,

2243
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:21,160
yeah.
But,

2244
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:21,880
um,
Homo.

2245
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:24,220
I haven't heard a peep nobody's band at 
yet.

2246
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:28,000
Maybe I should shut the fuck up homo 
campaign.

2247
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:33,060
It's like the seven words you can't say 
on TV became the seven words you can't 

2248
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,060
say on TV in a way.
Well,

2249
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,250
like,
fag isn't Mafac is short for Faggot.

2250
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:40,170
So it's not like a part of a word that's
a legitimate world like Homosapian,

2251
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:44,200
Homosapian,
homosexual homeostasis,

2252
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:45,230
you know,
there's like a lot.

2253
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:47,290
I know there's a lot of trap doors in 
that.

2254
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:50,130
There's a lot of ways out of that.
I meant homosapien.

2255
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:50,640
Yeah,
yeah.

2256
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:53,110
No Homo sapiens.

2257
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:56,710
Gypsy,
you know,

2258
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:57,950
you can't say that.
That's,

2259
01:41:57,970 --> 01:41:58,680
that's.
Yeah,

2260
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:03,700
that's kind of gypsy though.
They don't procreate.

2261
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:11,290
They do.
Their magic balls had to ruin.

2262
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:15,760
It isn't like the ones with the magic 
balls and the cards and like the.

2263
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:16,350
Yeah,
they are,

2264
01:42:16,351 --> 01:42:19,540
they have the crystal balls,
crystal balls and the uh,

2265
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:21,130
reading your fortune.
I mean,

2266
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:22,720
there've been hustlers from the 
beginning,

2267
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:25,750
but again,
it's fucking born into.

2268
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,580
You're born into that shit.
What would you do?

2269
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:28,900
You're telling me that you would figure 
out,

2270
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:33,930
oh,
my culture is insufficient in so many 

2271
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:33,930
areas.
I need to get out and explore the subtle

2272
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:38,881
nuances of life and education and change
my verbiage and my vernacular and moved 

2273
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:41,770
to Cambridge and come on.
Yeah.

2274
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:46,771
Maybe by the time you're 15,
if you're lucky to have that kind of 

2275
01:42:46,771 --> 01:42:49,591
individual thought,
but otherwise you just don't fucking 

2276
01:42:49,591 --> 01:42:51,250
cards out three card Monte fucking 
hustling.

2277
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:53,020
Motherfuckers drugging babies.
Oh,

2278
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:56,020
that's what I heard about the Gypsies 
drug and babies stay drugged to babysit.

2279
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,330
I don't cry.
There was a story of a lady drug to baby

2280
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:00,250
on an airplane.
She got arrested.

2281
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:05,280
She was a stewardess and she gave a baby
benadryl because the baby was screaming 

2282
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:05,450
and crying.
Yeah.

2283
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,700
We get warm Jack.
Two babies in Ohio.

2284
01:43:07,701 --> 01:43:08,600
Put a little in there.
No,

2285
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:13,770
it turned out cooked your brain and shit
ain't good.

2286
01:43:14,681 --> 01:43:16,840
You think it's okay to say Homo Gypsy?
Yes.

2287
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:22,260
These are all terrible things.
When Israel terrible would have done 

2288
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:22,260
your lump better.
Yeah.

2289
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:25,450
Good night's sleep at some orange juice.
Get your fucking electrolytes in order,

2290
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:29,920
son.
It's bugging me,

2291
01:43:29,921 --> 01:43:31,900
man,
that like this already laying thing that

2292
01:43:31,901 --> 01:43:34,240
we were talking about yesterday and we,
we played his,

2293
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:39,241
um,
we read rather his tweet the other day 

2294
01:43:39,241 --> 01:43:42,660
during the Dahmer podcast and we were 
shocked at what everybody was upset 

2295
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:46,310
about.
Now did he said this on the podcast,

2296
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,100
is that what happened with twitter?
Twitter,

2297
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:52,010
he tweeted it as a fucking comedian 
known for being

2298
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:55,490
dirty and because he said something 
about an African American woman,

2299
01:43:55,491 --> 01:43:59,930
but her whipping him and him coming all 
over himself,

2300
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:01,640
like a fat father.
It was just,

2301
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:04,580
it was about her disrespecting the 
plantation.

2302
01:44:04,581 --> 01:44:06,050
I mean,
his tweets were hilarious,

2303
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:10,310
but people were so offended that he was 
kicked off of that midnight show.

2304
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:14,000
He couldn't do the midnight show.
And then on top of that he,

2305
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:16,130
um,
he got banned from Espn.

2306
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:21,131
He can't go on espn to care of ESPN.
Last night he torched espn for ripping 

2307
01:44:23,271 --> 01:44:24,950
him off.
He got up,

2308
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:27,400
he got it,
like a phrase or a bit stolen yet.

2309
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:30,440
And so he just,
he redid a whole sketch,

2310
01:44:30,441 --> 01:44:35,441
ripping them.
Tasha has this thing called Web 

2311
01:44:35,441 --> 01:44:35,441
redemption,
right?

2312
01:44:35,441 --> 01:44:35,441
Right.
Where he's,

2313
01:44:35,441 --> 01:44:36,180
you know,
he watches like famous,

2314
01:44:36,181 --> 01:44:37,870
like,
like videos and just,

2315
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:38,420
you know,
look,

2316
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:43,460
let's get redemption for this lien.
And so he meets the people there in the 

2317
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:43,460
veil.

2318
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,450
They pretty much exactly did the same 
thing.

2319
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:47,960
And so she's been on there since like 
six years or something.

2320
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:53,380
So they're doing the same thing.
They're just calling it a different 

2321
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:53,380
name.
Don't play it,

2322
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:56,180
don't play it.
It'll get us kicked off of youtube every

2323
01:44:56,181 --> 01:44:58,040
time,
every fucking time.

2324
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,860
Even though I've got a comedy central 
special coming out next week,

2325
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:05,890
they would still kick us off.
You can even play your clip for your 

2326
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:05,890
comments,
especially my clip.

2327
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:07,770
They'd pull me off youtube.
Not Kidding.

2328
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,520
Welcome to the world.
We live in full charge.

2329
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:12,680
I know you signed the paperwork.
I don't know what you signed,

2330
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,510
but I signed some shit that ain't mine 
no more.

2331
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,940
There's a lot of motherfuckers out there
that want to own everything.

2332
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:20,090
God,
that's the beauty of the podcast.

2333
01:45:20,091 --> 01:45:21,380
Full charge.
I know.

2334
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:24,170
We do whatever we want.
You've got a full charge podcast to full

2335
01:45:24,171 --> 01:45:24,800
charge power.

2336
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,200
Our very funny.
Everybody check it out on you.

2337
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:27,950
Sure.
It's very funny,

2338
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,450
very,
very funny.

2339
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:32,060
Very funny.
Nobody believer sees what's the matter.

2340
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,470
Oh,
nothing.

2341
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,660
Well we not recording.
Ah,

2342
01:45:35,661 --> 01:45:37,010
fuck.
I can't hear anything right now.

2343
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:40,580
Yeah.
The microphone is just not working right

2344
01:45:40,581 --> 01:45:41,120
now.
Oh,

2345
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,170
but it's recording.
Yeah.

2346
01:45:43,171 --> 01:45:44,010
Yeah.
His is recording.

2347
01:45:44,011 --> 01:45:45,800
So what happens when you park yourself 
there?

2348
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:48,860
Jamie is here.
Everything was nice and smoothly.

2349
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:51,860
Now.
SD cards in the middle of fucking show.

2350
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:57,130
I just want to remind people that all 
the equipment works on the full charge 

2351
01:45:57,130 --> 01:45:57,300
power hour.
It's very high.

2352
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:59,300
People don't edit it.
Actually.

2353
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:00,860
Are we fall?
Is that what it is?

2354
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:03,780
Why don't you guys fucking plan this 
shit in advance.

2355
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:06,110
There's not a lot of things that you 
guys have to do.

2356
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:10,770
This only gets full like once a year.
You should just check it.

2357
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:12,170
It's not a lot of shit to check here.

2358
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,010
Just fucking Christ.
Yeah.

2359
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,700
One SD card.
So what is this show being recorded?

2360
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:17,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

2361
01:46:17,101 --> 01:46:20,990
This is just backup all the time.
You spent going to massage parlors,

2362
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:23,930
son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

2363
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:27,950
Full charge man.
Have a tour coming out or something.

2364
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:29,760
Yes I do.
It's,

2365
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:31,910
um,
it's a little west coast tour,

2366
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,300
San Francisco Doc Ricketts,
November 29th,

2367
01:46:35,301 --> 01:46:36,110
Woodstock,
crickets.

2368
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:41,140
Doc records used to be the purple onion 
in north beach and it's a new club now 

2369
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:45,410
and November 29th.
So that's like a really small,

2370
01:46:45,411 --> 01:46:47,700
intimate room.
Didn't get special.

2371
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:48,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

2372
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:51,720
So it's pretty cool.
I'd never been there,

2373
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:53,760
but uh,
I can't wait to play it.

2374
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,510
And I'm going to be at the analog cafe 
on December fifth.

2375
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:58,710
That's in Portland,
Oregon.

2376
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:03,890
Beautiful.
And I'm going to be at highline in 

2377
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:06,531
Seattle,
Washington on December six and I would 

2378
01:47:06,531 --> 01:47:06,531
love for people to come out and see me.

2379
01:47:06,531 --> 01:47:06,531
Good Lord.
Full charge.

2380
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:08,310
How do you do it all?
I just,

2381
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,560
I get to writing.
I memorized the jokes,

2382
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:12,660
do some stage time company,
then I've,

2383
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:14,440
then I go to the city.
This is.

2384
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

2385
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,280
Do you bring people on the road with you
and you're working with Logan?

2386
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:20,550
Actually my co host from the full charge
power hour,

2387
01:47:20,551 --> 01:47:24,360
Craig Coleman is going to come open from
a code soured alone.

2388
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,050
Everybody's got a podcast now.
It's great.

2389
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,950
It's gonna come a time when no one wants
a television show,

2390
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:29,880
you know,
like,

2391
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,920
wow,
I kind of like podcasts or in the time 

2392
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:35,360
for this,
too many cooks tomb and what is too many

2393
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:40,370
cooks.
You guys keep saying this too many 

2394
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:41,991
cooks.
This amazing video that these two guys 

2395
01:47:41,991 --> 01:47:44,640
that work at adult swim has had been 
making on their own for the last year.

2396
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:45,990
I think they're like pas or something.

2397
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:50,990
Like I said,
they'd been taken like a little bit of 

2398
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:52,311
money and making this little stealing,
stealing project on the site and so 

2399
01:47:52,311 --> 01:47:53,490
they,
they got the a 4:00

2400
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:58,491
like info commercial spot on adult swim 
and it's kind of like a video that's 

2401
01:47:58,491 --> 01:48:03,201
making fun of eighties sitcoms openings 
by on mushrooms and at first year it's 

2402
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:07,500
just like this annoying song that starts
getting into your head and it's over and

2403
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:12,501
over.
And then a lot of people just turn it 

2404
01:48:12,501 --> 01:48:12,501
off after like four or five minutes 
because they are like,

2405
01:48:12,501 --> 01:48:14,340
I can't take anymore of this.
But if you get over the lump of like the

2406
01:48:14,341 --> 01:48:17,340
four minute mark,
it becomes one of the most fucked up,

2407
01:48:17,341 --> 01:48:22,341
demented.
Beautiful videos I've seen on a long 

2408
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:22,341
weird.
It's really weird.

2409
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:23,770
Yeah,
but there's a lot of that.

2410
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:29,190
Tim and Eric Style comedy these days.
They just keep going.

2411
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:34,220
Yeah,
there's a lot of cool stuff out there 

2412
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:34,500
now I know and especially when you could
just make a clip and just throw it up on

2413
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:39,501
youtube or throw it up on the Internet 
and there's so many people that could 

2414
01:48:39,501 --> 01:48:39,501
just do things now.
Yeah,

2415
01:48:39,501 --> 01:48:44,030
it's really cool that they did.
They took a chance and overnight it got 

2416
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:45,990
like 3 million hits in less than 24 
hours.

2417
01:48:45,991 --> 01:48:49,320
That's awesome.
That's beautiful man.

2418
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:52,170
We live in a great time.
So fucking best time ever.

2419
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:53,490
It really is.
It is.

2420
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,290
And it really wasn't and it's just so 
new.

2421
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,240
All these opportunities is so new,
you know?

2422
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:59,280
Yeah.
Trials and tribulations aside,

2423
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:04,340
all this shit about like peanut butter 
and jelly sandwiches being racist and 

2424
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:07,920
all this stupidity still awesome.
I know the most awesome time.

2425
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:10,080
It's just,
there's too many people talking.

2426
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:12,450
That's all it is.
It's weird that people use so much.

2427
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:15,630
They use the uh,
technology just like complain and stuff.

2428
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:19,170
There's creators and there's destroyers,
there's whiners,

2429
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:21,840
and there's just people that like 
fucking contribute.

2430
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,780
There's a lot of distributors out there,
but you know what I mean,

2431
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:26,850
man.
A lot of it is just misplaced energy.

2432
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:30,030
I've talked to destroyers.
Former destroys her now.

2433
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:31,230
Creators.
Yeah.

2434
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,540
Apologize to me.
Like for like some shit.

2435
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:35,020
They wrote like,
I'm sorry,

2436
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:36,240
tweeted that out.
You are sorry.

2437
01:49:36,241 --> 01:49:38,070
I said that.
I was just blah blah blah.

2438
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,650
And they want to.
They want to be creators,

2439
01:49:40,651 --> 01:49:45,651
but they don't have the balls or they 
don't have the experience and then they 

2440
01:49:45,651 --> 01:49:46,410
see you doing it and they get.
They put that energy towards you.

2441
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:47,020
Yeah.
Well there's.

2442
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:48,220
Yeah.
There's also

2443
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:51,680
some people look at other people's 
success as their failure somehow,

2444
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:56,720
like you're detracting from them.
Like every time a full charge goes on 

2445
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:56,720
tour,
people back home and go,

2446
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,490
fucking full charge out there in 
Portland.

2447
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,650
Fuck.
Now they're pissed.

2448
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:01,180
Fuck this man.
You know I,

2449
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:03,490
I started out that dude.
Fuck man.

2450
01:50:03,491 --> 01:50:05,020
I can't even get booked.
Who booked you there,

2451
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:07,690
man?
He should just call me.

2452
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:09,830
That's another beautiful thing about 
this.

2453
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:12,520
I just fucking.
I booked the venues myself.

2454
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,430
Segura said that to me.
He's like,

2455
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:17,200
this is the thing that people do.
That's like the grossest thing guide.

2456
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:18,850
How'd you get that?
Yeah,

2457
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,500
I've heard that expression since I 
started.

2458
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,930
How'd you get that?
How'd you get that?

2459
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:25,120
What's the formula?
What's the math equation?

2460
01:50:25,121 --> 01:50:26,580
So I can do it?
Yeah.

2461
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,200
Fucking Ian Edwards just talking about 
that too.

2462
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:34,590
He's like,
that's weird shit that people say to 

2463
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:34,590
you.

2464
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:34,590
How'd you get that?
Get that.

2465
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:37,630
I just called this guy jeff did a lap 
bro.

2466
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:42,340
Super easy.
You're writing a fast start talking.

2467
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:47,710
It was a million different things 
combined individual to me and that's how

2468
01:50:47,711 --> 01:50:49,270
it happened.
Million different things.

2469
01:50:49,271 --> 01:50:50,410
You freak pitches.
Yeah.

2470
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:51,200
So,
um,

2471
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,130
when you put together these tours are,
you're doing this shit with an agent,

2472
01:50:54,131 --> 01:50:55,930
you're doing it all by yourself.
I just do it by myself.

2473
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:56,830
That's cool.
Yeah.

2474
01:50:57,190 --> 01:51:02,190
That's a,
that's another thing that you can do 

2475
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:03,751
today that you could never do before.
The middle men across the board are 

2476
01:51:03,751 --> 01:51:03,880
getting cut out,
which is beautiful.

2477
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,790
Yeah.
And they don't have to be middlemen.

2478
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:08,440
It's not like there's not a whole lot of
opportunities for other shit to be done.

2479
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:13,500
Right.
It's just great because of email and 

2480
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,781
twitter.
You can have these people that are 

2481
01:51:15,781 --> 01:51:15,781
following me on twitter.

2482
01:51:15,781 --> 01:51:15,781
I'm like,
Oh shit,

2483
01:51:15,781 --> 01:51:18,781
there's this club that's following the 
in September and in Portland it's 

2484
01:51:18,781 --> 01:51:19,200
falling out.
Just tweet them and see what's up.

2485
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:21,640
Exactly.
Did you see the video of the,

2486
01:51:21,641 --> 01:51:23,590
uh,
the elephant fighting off?

2487
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:28,200
14 lines on my twitter.
Follow it.

2488
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:30,400
It's,
it's pretty awesome because the elephant

2489
01:51:30,401 --> 01:51:32,260
winds,
elephants just seemed,

2490
01:51:32,261 --> 01:51:36,850
spoiler.
Elephants just seemed so fucking cool.

2491
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:41,910
Like it's really kind of hard to believe
that people shot them just for their 

2492
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:41,980
ivory.
They just,

2493
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:44,320
I mean,
I know that they killed people sometimes

2494
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:46,680
and storm into villages and stomp 
everything down,

2495
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,690
but look,
don't hate the player.

2496
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:52,420
What game wasn't it?
This podcast you guys were talking about

2497
01:51:52,421 --> 01:51:57,421
how they used to.
They electrocuted an elephant as an 

2498
01:51:57,421 --> 01:51:57,610
experiment.
Yeah.

2499
01:51:57,611 --> 01:52:00,710
I'm with Thomas Edison.
Did to show the power.

2500
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:04,310
No one blogged about it.
You can just,

2501
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:07,780
you can cook an elephant and Times 
Square and nobody gives a shit.

2502
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:12,780
Back then it was for a,
so that video is the advancement that 

2503
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:13,500
video gets pulled,
but if we do like a screenshot,

2504
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:14,730
it really goes both ways.
Yeah,

2505
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:15,510
I'm sure it will.
Right?

2506
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,900
Here's a bunch of fighting over it and 
then we'll just skip ahead with second.

2507
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:21,310
Well,
here's what happens.

2508
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:26,080
The lions jump on these things back and 
they try to drag it down and just google

2509
01:52:26,081 --> 01:52:31,081
it.
It's worth watching because it feels 

2510
01:52:31,081 --> 01:52:32,581
good.
A young elephant fights 14 lines and 

2511
01:52:32,581 --> 01:52:32,581
wins,
but you know what,

2512
01:52:32,581 --> 01:52:33,010
man,
if you shot one of those lines,

2513
01:52:33,011 --> 01:52:37,330
everybody was super mad at you.
If he was sitting there watching,

2514
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:38,590
like,
imagine this is what happens.

2515
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:43,720
You're sitting there watching this 
elephant getting fucked up by these 

2516
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,291
lines,
so you just fucking pull out of your 

2517
01:52:46,291 --> 01:52:46,291
four by four,
climb up on the roof,

2518
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,050
line this motherfucker up and you see 
this lion's body.

2519
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:54,740
You'd be.
People would be really pissed at you,

2520
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,850
dear Internet.
I can't believe they shot that line,

2521
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:59,440
but if you,
you know,

2522
01:52:59,441 --> 01:53:03,980
if you'll just sit back and let the 
lions killed the elephant to do you pick

2523
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:06,260
a side.
Do you pick a side when you see 14 lines

2524
01:53:06,261 --> 01:53:08,300
trying to kill an elephant?
Elephant.

2525
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:10,190
You've picked us out to the alpha.
I think so too,

2526
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:13,400
because elephants are herbivores.
They're not predators.

2527
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,590
Right?
But isn't that just how it works,

2528
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:18,050
man?
If the lions can bring down the elephant

2529
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:19,160
to eat it,
that's how it works.

2530
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:22,100
That's the game plan is not the game.
We're all playing.

2531
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,410
That is the game.
They're all planning.

2532
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:28,440
Like if,
if it's a person like some chick on 

2533
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:29,210
facebook posing with a deadline,
she's the cont.

2534
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:30,170
Right?
Right.

2535
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:32,670
But if the lions take this elephant out 
there,

2536
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:35,720
like the lion had to do it,
the chick took a flight over here.

2537
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,760
She's an asshole.
She's just doing this for fun,

2538
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:43,300
just like a homo gypsy.
But if the chick was there and she was 

2539
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:44,180
doing it for fun and she saw this and 
she said,

2540
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:45,200
you know what?
Fuck these lines.

2541
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:46,250
I'm gonna.
Kill one of those lines.

2542
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:48,950
Would people be angry at her?
I think they probably.

2543
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:50,390
Would.
People pick teams?

2544
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:51,980
Yeah.
Even when it comes to animals.

2545
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,930
[inaudible].
That's a little weird.

2546
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:58,960
I love lions,
but I just know elephants are way 

2547
01:53:58,960 --> 01:53:58,960
fucking smarter than A.
Yeah.

2548
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,290
They can paint.
They can paint their face.

2549
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:02,410
You know what I'm saying?
No,

2550
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:02,900
no,
no.

2551
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,210
That'll get us pulled too.
But there's a video.

2552
01:54:05,211 --> 01:54:10,211
If you go and Google it,
there's a video of an elephant painting 

2553
01:54:10,211 --> 01:54:11,930
his own portrait or her own portrait.
So there's a,

2554
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:13,880
there's only the males have the horns.
Is that what it is?

2555
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:17,330
The tusks?
Don't know about that.

2556
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,720
Would they use only.
I'm the only antlered animal that's a 

2557
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,230
female.
Um,

2558
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:28,430
as far as like,
like deer and elk and Caribou.

2559
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:31,070
Female Caribou.
Have Antlers coming out of the fight off

2560
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:35,000
wolves and shit to female elephants.
What about female rams?

2561
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:36,920
Female Rams.
GotTa have horns,

2562
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:39,550
right?
Otherwise you're not around right now.

2563
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:44,930
It's a sheep.
Females,

2564
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:49,990
sheep rams just swayed on fuck ramps 
growing up.

2565
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:57,850
Both male and female.
African elephants have tusks unlocked or

2566
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:02,430
Asian relatives.
Um.

2567
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,790
Oh No.
I'm not like their ancient relatives.

2568
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:08,270
African elephants are not easily 
domesticated in incorrect sentence.

2569
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:10,910
I only had to click on it here.
So yeah,

2570
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:13,880
they both have tusks.
You guys hear about these cat dicks.

2571
01:55:14,010 --> 01:55:15,970
They have little knives in them.
They all have good nights.

2572
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:20,980
Yeah.
They stick in like a bb fishing the 

2573
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:22,250
fishing for pussy.
Get cat calls.

2574
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:25,420
You ever heard cat cat screaming every 
night?

2575
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:26,540
Yeah.
It sounds like they're fighting.

2576
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:31,570
You hear it night.
I have a lot of feral cat in my 

2577
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:31,570
neighborhood.
Did Gypsies brought on.

2578
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:36,740
That's what happens man.
When you live in a neighborhood where 

2579
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:36,740
people just let their cats out and then 
they.

2580
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:39,380
They like people like let their cats 
free.

2581
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:44,380
Especially male cats.
Most people don't want to get their 

2582
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:44,380
mail.
Cats fixed.

2583
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:47,861
It's paying the asset of the money and 
so just let the little cute ball you 

2584
01:55:47,861 --> 01:55:50,991
want to look at.
It's weird because you could tell that 

2585
01:55:50,991 --> 01:55:51,210
there was a couple of the cats that are 
just like they don't have homes,

2586
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:54,510
but then there's cats because I live in 
a nicer neighborhood that are mixed with

2587
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:56,520
like Persian cats that have callers and 
you're like,

2588
01:55:56,690 --> 01:56:01,690
it's a gangs of cats though and at night
they just fucking hanging out on your 

2589
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:05,091
car where you rarely see a cat with his 
balls and really see a male cat with 

2590
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:07,200
balls.
If you go over people's houses,

2591
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:12,320
their cats,
their male cats are always neutered 

2592
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:12,320
because if you're your male cat is 
annuity pisses everywhere.

2593
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:13,740
Right?
Back up and Piss on your wall.

2594
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:15,970
This is mine and you can't stop them 
there.

2595
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:17,550
You're going to do it.
I had a cat do it.

2596
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:19,740
I had my feral cat.
I don't know if you ever met him.

2597
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,160
Do you ever meet Jack Dempsey?
Was the all black cat?

2598
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:25,200
I don't think they'll kill them.
Yes.

2599
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:25,800
Yes,
I did.

2600
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,590
Frank Sinatra.
The pit bull told them was awful.

2601
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,910
He just got cocky one too many times 
with the dog.

2602
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:36,360
He's a.
It was a fierce little cat,

2603
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,740
but he.
I had him neutered,

2604
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:43,160
but um,
it's very rare that you find one that's 

2605
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:43,160
not neutered,
you know,

2606
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,190
that my cat was feral,
like I got him.

2607
01:56:44,191 --> 01:56:48,600
He was a couple months old and my friend
Lanie had rescued him and it was a total

2608
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:49,280
disaster.
It was,

2609
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:51,300
I should never done it.
But when I brought him home,

2610
01:56:51,301 --> 01:56:52,470
he's pissing everywhere.
Man.

2611
01:56:52,471 --> 01:56:54,420
He's picking his ass up and trying to 
piss on the walls.

2612
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:55,950
When I had to bring him to the vet to 
get them,

2613
01:56:55,951 --> 01:56:57,270
uh,
get them neutered,

2614
01:56:57,570 --> 01:57:01,440
I literally had a throw a bathrobe over 
them and tackle them in the bathroom.

2615
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:04,250
I trapped them in the bathroom and he 
was like,

2616
01:57:04,251 --> 01:57:06,150
hissing at me,
climbing up the drapes.

2617
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:07,230
I'm like,
listen motherfucker,

2618
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:08,850
I'm not going to kill you.
I love you.

2619
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:12,360
Just here to take you to the vet.
If I picked him up once I picked them up

2620
01:57:12,361 --> 01:57:13,680
and start preparing like instantly,

2621
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,410
like he would know that I was okay once 
I picked them up,

2622
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:24,411
but on the way to pick them up and,
but fucking scramble up the walls and 

2623
01:57:25,641 --> 01:57:28,290
it's run from me.
It was the funniest shit ever.

2624
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:31,380
And then I would,
when I first adopted him,

2625
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:35,160
I slept with him in a room for like 
several days,

2626
01:57:35,161 --> 01:57:37,950
just me and him in the room.
I pushed a bed into this room.

2627
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:39,820
I had a spare bedroom.
Uh,

2628
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:45,030
I pushed a push some books in there and 
like how to keep shutting the door real 

2629
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,700
quick so he couldn't run out.
I put them in there,

2630
01:57:45,730 --> 01:57:48,840
put a litter box in there and put some 
food in there and just hung out with him

2631
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,960
just so he totally got used to me.
And when I come near them,

2632
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:55,080
even like after he,
I picked him up a bunch of times.

2633
01:57:55,440 --> 01:58:00,440
I come here,
I'm going to run across the walls.

2634
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:03,630
He was a little tiny thing man.
But when I finally would get them

2635
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:05,710
right,

2636
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:09,000
but as long as I kept a hold of him,
he was cool.

2637
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:12,090
But as soon as I put them down,
fucking started hitting,

2638
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:13,170
running away.
Wrong

2639
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:14,440
cat noises,
man.

2640
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:19,060
You got that down man.
That guy was nuts,

2641
01:58:19,061 --> 01:58:21,010
man.
I had all black cat when I was a kid.

2642
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:23,430
What do you think my mother named this 
cat face?

2643
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,930
Sam.
Sambo.

2644
01:58:25,990 --> 01:58:28,060
Sambo,
nice parents you got there,

2645
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,150
don't react to people fucking and named 
the cat racist,

2646
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:36,070
but those are too fucked up things.
That's very fucked up.

2647
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:39,670
Why Sambo?
What does sambo?

2648
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:42,280
Sambo is reference to a chain

2649
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:45,310
of restaurants.
I guess 100 years ago,

2650
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:49,480
it's very.
That aunt Jemima minstrel show.

2651
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:51,910
Cartoonish.
A minstrel.

2652
01:58:51,911 --> 01:58:52,970
Not Menstrual,
right?

2653
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:56,630
I don't know what I'm saying.
The racist thing.

2654
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:59,470
Um,
but it's very like black face.

2655
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:02,220
And there was a chain of restaurants 
called Sam Bose.

2656
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:07,770
Um,
my mom said there was like a black guy 

2657
01:59:07,770 --> 01:59:08,170
in the Bible named sambo,
but I don't think that's true.

2658
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:11,980
I don't think that's true.
Will Your Parents Bible thumpers?

2659
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:13,240
No.
No,

2660
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:14,330
no.
They like,

2661
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:16,450
they're like Catholic,
so they're not really into it.

2662
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,190
They're just guilted into going every 
week.

2663
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:23,430
Yeah.
Catholic is a different kind of 

2664
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:23,430
relationship.
Yeah.

2665
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:25,770
That's why you'd never see Catholic 
suicide bomber had this whole bit about 

2666
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:25,770
it because no Catholics believe in it 
that much.

2667
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,090
Exactly.
They just know they have to go there,

2668
01:59:28,091 --> 01:59:29,530
guilted into it.
The whole deal.

2669
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:31,780
Did you hear about the fucking tiger 
that's loosened France?

2670
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:35,800
Yeah.
There's a real tiger loose in France,

2671
01:59:35,950 --> 01:59:38,770
like someone thought it was a links or 
something like that and they got a photo

2672
01:59:38,771 --> 01:59:40,390
of it and then they realize like,
oh shit,

2673
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:45,391
this is a tiger.
There's a young male tiger wandering 

2674
01:59:45,391 --> 01:59:45,850
around Paris.
Jesus Christ.

2675
01:59:45,851 --> 01:59:48,910
That's romantic.
That's fucking terrifying.

2676
01:59:48,911 --> 01:59:51,460
Isn't it?
Full American Werewolf in London.

2677
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:52,900
No,
American tiger.

2678
01:59:55,930 --> 02:00:00,930
There's no this.
There's more tigers in Texas than there 

2679
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:01,120
are in the wild.
Didn't know that.

2680
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:03,970
You know what I say?
Good.

2681
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,850
I like Texas and tigers can go fuck 
themselves.

2682
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:10,300
That's what I say.
I think we got a win win situation here.

2683
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:13,240
I like it.
Are there any tigers in Mexico?

2684
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:14,980
Like is it just Texas?
No.

2685
02:00:14,981 --> 02:00:17,190
Mexico has Jaguars.
Gotcha.

2686
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,060
Tiger on the loose in Paris,
suburbs.

2687
02:00:19,061 --> 02:00:22,900
People told stay inside.
You think fucking look at that guy.

2688
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:27,901
He's dead.
They're going to grab the back of his 

2689
02:00:27,901 --> 02:00:29,851
head and Disneyland.
Paris,

2690
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:35,200
strong cat noises.
Fucking horrible.

2691
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:40,260
Horrible feeling.
It must be to just feel that thing 

2692
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:43,081
biting down on the back of your head and
know you'd be so great at reading books 

2693
02:00:43,081 --> 02:00:43,480
to kids like,
like,

2694
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:43,910
like,
like,

2695
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:47,440
like a classroom of kids,
like a book about animals.

2696
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:49,150
You would blow that shit out of the 
park.

2697
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:50,560
I do.
Um,

2698
02:00:50,650 --> 02:00:54,250
I did read one book on tape once you 
remember the book.

2699
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:56,100
Was there any animal story?
No,

2700
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:56,830
no.
It's just,

2701
02:00:56,831 --> 02:00:58,240
you know,
I just had to be dramatic.

2702
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:00,520
It was a little kids book because a book
for little kids.

2703
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:03,020
I love reading to my kids though.
I get really.

2704
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:05,980
We read the Gruffalo yeah.
Or Cat in the hat.

2705
02:01:05,981 --> 02:01:09,690
I'm a bad motherfucker.
I do the different voices and shit.

2706
02:01:09,691 --> 02:01:14,691
Yeah.
They love it to make me read the same 

2707
02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:14,691
books over and over and over again.
Kids are weird,

2708
02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:15,280
man.
They want to watch the same shows.

2709
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:18,310
My daughter has watched frozen no less 
than 100 times.

2710
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:21,340
Like my four year old can sing the 
words.

2711
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:26,050
Yeah,
I,

2712
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:29,270
they,
they just want to see the same shit over

2713
02:01:29,271 --> 02:01:32,990
and over and over again.
The like Jamie with interstellar want to

2714
02:01:32,991 --> 02:01:37,991
see the same shit over and over is a 
little weird that like books are still 

2715
02:01:37,991 --> 02:01:38,990
interesting to kids too.
I mean imagination.

2716
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:39,780
Yeah,
it's.

2717
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:39,940
You

2718
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,880
know what?
These guys are called.

2719
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:43,160
No.
Bernstein bears.

2720
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:48,340
Berenstein bears.
Whereas my mom used to call them the 

2721
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:48,340
sambo bears.
That's a.

2722
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:48,340
here's a weird thing.
These aren't.

2723
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,480
These are not called the Berenstein 
bears.

2724
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:52,850
What are they called?
The berenstain bears.

2725
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:57,970
S t a I n,
but for some reason everybody thinks 

2726
02:01:57,970 --> 02:01:57,970
that's Bernstein,
including myself,

2727
02:01:58,290 --> 02:02:00,470
but yeah,
growing up,

2728
02:02:00,471 --> 02:02:01,910
we used to always call him the 
berenstain bears,

2729
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:06,170
but look at the name.
It's so weird.

2730
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:09,170
Weird fucking bear family will eat your 
asshole

2731
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:13,660
monsters,
but everybody wants to think are cute.

2732
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:16,180
There's a bear thing is so strange,
man.

2733
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:21,690
That's the weirdest thing that people 
have an attachment to because bears are 

2734
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:23,080
fucking.
They don't give a shit about you.

2735
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:25,060
Kill you as soon as they made 100 
percent.

2736
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:30,380
The only reason why they're not like 
when people run into bears and they're 

2737
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:33,331
not killing them,
it's because they have other food it 

2738
02:02:33,331 --> 02:02:33,331
just ate or something that they have on.
They have some.

2739
02:02:33,331 --> 02:02:36,060
They a bunch of salmon.
They have some berries that they ate.

2740
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,080
They don't need to eat you.
What about panda bears?

2741
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:41,260
Vicious rapist.
Horrible racists.

2742
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:42,760
Pandas are the worst.

2743
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:47,860
Koala bears.
Very lot of sexually transmitted 

2744
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:47,860
disease.
Chlamydia,

2745
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:52,180
like for real.
They call bears transmitted sexually 

2746
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:52,180
transmitted disease to each other or 
they die.

2747
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:52,320
People,
I think.

2748
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:56,290
Where'd you get the clap?
I never cheat on you with people.

2749
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:58,510
It was so cute and then you just start 
fucking man.

2750
02:02:58,630 --> 02:03:00,470
Yeah,
it's weird.

2751
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,580
Koala bears.
Yeah,

2752
02:03:01,581 --> 02:03:03,480
it's that.
It's killing them though.

2753
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:08,510
Like as a.
It really is threatening the funny to 

2754
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:08,730
take them out.

2755
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:11,930
Lydia,
the std threatening and Australian icon.

2756
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:14,420
Let's take them down to planned 
parenthood.

2757
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:17,120
That gets of.
Here's the thing,

2758
02:03:17,121 --> 02:03:18,310
man.
We're so funny.

2759
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,420
What we want to keep them around.
You know,

2760
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:24,590
we have this idea that we are in charge 
somehow or another.

2761
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:29,591
Make sure that animals don't go extinct 
and the like a Koala bear needs to stay 

2762
02:03:29,591 --> 02:03:30,140
around.
Like does it really?

2763
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:32,000
I mean I don't think we should go kill 
them all.

2764
02:03:32,090 --> 02:03:33,150
Okay.
I don't think that,

2765
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:35,300
but if they all died because of fucking 
herpes.

2766
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:40,530
Yeah.
I think maybe we should concentrate on 

2767
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:40,530
poor people before we concentrate on 
herpes.

2768
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:43,060
Written Koala bears.
Dude,

2769
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:45,560
you're writing crazy sensible when it 
comes to that shit.

2770
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:50,650
You can accidentally get an std from.
That's what you should have.

2771
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:53,600
You should have called bears in your 
house that way.

2772
02:03:53,601 --> 02:03:54,720
You always have a built in.

2773
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:59,760
You should.
You should get a fucking Koala.

2774
02:04:00,170 --> 02:04:02,630
It's not what you think.
Connie baby.

2775
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:07,730
Look,
I'm going to show you the article on 

2776
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:09,310
Google pdf.
File your house in Edu address.

2777
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:14,380
Your House has just tanning beds and 
just so you have an out of shit that can

2778
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:20,231
give you stds.
Has anybody ever really gotten to a 

2779
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:22,860
tanning bed?
Venereal disease?

2780
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:25,030
I have no idea.
I didn't.

2781
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:25,550
I know this is

2782
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,030
first I'm hearing of this.
Yeah,

2783
02:04:27,031 --> 02:04:32,031
you can get.
Supposedly you can get herpes from a 

2784
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:32,220
tanning bed.
Get herpes from a toilet seat,

2785
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:34,380
you know you can use.
My sister used to.

2786
02:04:34,381 --> 02:04:35,790
Oh,
I got it from my sister.

2787
02:04:35,791 --> 02:04:38,130
Used to own a tanning bed in Boston

2788
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:41,280
in a business that she started crying 
and she said the problem was girls would

2789
02:04:41,281 --> 02:04:43,320
masturbate inside of them and they had 
to clean it.

2790
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:45,680
She does.
Sometimes she could smell it.

2791
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:47,530
She would go in there.
You could smell it.

2792
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:52,540
These chicks just been fingering 
themselves,

2793
02:04:52,941 --> 02:04:55,010
whether in their tanning.
Keep it in your coffee,

2794
02:04:55,011 --> 02:05:00,011
girl you been off in the tangent because
especially since the beats off 

2795
02:05:00,011 --> 02:05:03,551
everywhere else that worked there,
they're all pretty high and Tan and 

2796
02:05:03,551 --> 02:05:03,551
they're all girls that worked there.
So you,

2797
02:05:03,551 --> 02:05:05,300
you come in,
you're just like,

2798
02:05:05,301 --> 02:05:10,301
you know,
she's just right on the other side of 

2799
02:05:10,301 --> 02:05:10,390
this little like little cheap door.
So you're just like naked or going,

2800
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:15,400
why not?
I'm just going to beat it up and it's 

2801
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:15,400
always those hollow shitty doors shut 
them.

2802
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,660
Clung,
Echo.

2803
02:05:16,670 --> 02:05:21,050
It's like this barely anybody could just
punch their hand through that door.

2804
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:23,990
The shade design,
you know like the shades,

2805
02:05:23,991 --> 02:05:26,270
like the window shade design where you 
can actually see through it.

2806
02:05:26,271 --> 02:05:28,850
So if you walk past one you can see like
a second,

2807
02:05:28,851 --> 02:05:30,190
you could see a woman like laying there.

2808
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,820
So yeah,
that's Kinda crazy.

2809
02:05:31,821 --> 02:05:36,821
Like you're naked and you're compressed 
in this thing that puts a light on you 

2810
02:05:36,821 --> 02:05:38,840
that comes from metal,
glass tubes.

2811
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:44,020
Like how weird are people man lying 
there and you got little goggles on and 

2812
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:47,591
shit.
But you're buttholes this but hold the 

2813
02:05:47,591 --> 02:05:49,811
glass and you get that Weird Tan spot 
where you get a little white spot in 

2814
02:05:50,631 --> 02:05:53,660
between your ass cheeks because your 
cheeks compressed when you lie there.

2815
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:57,800
So like I would try to spread my ass 
cheeks while we're in there to make sure

2816
02:05:57,801 --> 02:06:01,430
that I got some tanning on that one area
at tech.

2817
02:06:01,431 --> 02:06:06,431
My Dick though in between.
So I don't want my Dick Tam for some 

2818
02:06:06,431 --> 02:06:06,860
reason.
It never needs a 10 but it could make it

2819
02:06:06,861 --> 02:06:07,860
look bigger.
Sure.

2820
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:09,410
I don't know if it does.
It doesn't.

2821
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:10,670
I don't think it was bigger than their 
white.

2822
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:12,590
Isn't that why overweight people like to
wear black?

2823
02:06:14,030 --> 02:06:17,000
Black is slimming.
That's why black dicks are so impressive

2824
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:22,030
and seem like Jesus Christ.
Imagine if it was white.

2825
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:27,200
Imagine if you had a white Dick was all 
white and it was giant.

2826
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:31,040
A big fucking albino.
Brock lesnar styled Dick.

2827
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:35,390
Do you think that would be fantastic?
I don't think it has little anything.

2828
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:39,230
Who giant shits please.
The giant human.

2829
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:45,100
What's going to have this little?
His little pinky shack has a small Dick.

2830
02:06:45,410 --> 02:06:50,410
I don't buy that for a second.
I lack shack has probably got an 

2831
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:54,641
enormous Dick.
He's just so big that it probably looks 

2832
02:06:54,641 --> 02:06:55,670
normal sized on him.
He's seven foot tall.

2833
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:56,860
It's huge.
That guy.

2834
02:06:56,861 --> 02:06:58,030
So big man.
I,

2835
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:00,110
I've stood next to him on a bunch of 
occasions,

2836
02:07:00,111 --> 02:07:00,950
shook his hand.
Shit.

2837
02:07:00,951 --> 02:07:04,040
He always comes by and says hi.
He's a big UFC fan and when you put your

2838
02:07:04,041 --> 02:07:07,350
hand in his to do that,
that bro handshake and you know this,

2839
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:10,560
this one who do like that on my hand 
just disappears.

2840
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:13,580
Like I'm shutting my hand on a like a 
refrigerator.

2841
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:16,550
It's a giant hand.
He's an enormous man.

2842
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:19,370
Sticks probably probably fucking huge.

2843
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:24,630
Probably exactly what it is.
It's probably so big that it just 

2844
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:24,630
probably just looks normal compared to 
him.

2845
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:24,940
I mean,
look at that.

2846
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:30,090
Let's get the fuck Outta here.
You're telling me that guy's got a 

2847
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:30,090
little dick.
I think he's walking next to his dick.

2848
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:32,380
Just stick.
Please stop it.

2849
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:34,930
How is it possible that God has a little
Dick?

2850
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:35,980
God,
can you

2851
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,320
imagine him?
Even though it was small for his size,

2852
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:40,690
it's 10 inches.
Can I imagine him?

2853
02:07:40,691 --> 02:07:41,330
Fuck that.
Brian,

2854
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:42,460
you just crossed the line?
No,

2855
02:07:42,461 --> 02:07:45,640
I mean like the size difference.
It's just ridiculous.

2856
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:48,490
Just murder her baby.
Take it.

2857
02:07:48,491 --> 02:07:50,800
Some girls just so he ain't working out 
no more.

2858
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:53,380
Huh?
Is that what that picture is all about?

2859
02:07:53,381 --> 02:07:55,750
Is that looks checkup that.
Well,

2860
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:57,940
big dudes like that.
That is a reality of life.

2861
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:01,470
I don't live that long.
They all.

2862
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:03,220
We're saying,
okay,

2863
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:08,350
so tall guys want to.
Someone were saying that backwards and 

2864
02:08:09,941 --> 02:08:13,840
that still makes me freak out.
Imagine if a girl had a guy like that.

2865
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:16,510
You would imagine the girls just 
stuffing that guy in her pussy.

2866
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,570
Just making them Peter out from the g 
spot,

2867
02:08:19,571 --> 02:08:22,480
just a shack she like only goes out with
guys who can hold their breath.

2868
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:23,650
How long can you hold your breath?

2869
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:26,140
Could hold my breath for like three 
minutes.

2870
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:30,610
Show me okay on Ge.
The inside of my pussy for three minutes

2871
02:08:32,490 --> 02:08:33,460
each.
The g spot?

2872
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:39,030
Well there's certain animals that have 
absorbed the mail after they breed a 

2873
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,130
black widow.
Yeah.

2874
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:45,430
There's a bunch of a bunch of bugs that 
kill the male after.

2875
02:08:45,431 --> 02:08:47,500
After they breed.
I think females do too.

2876
02:08:47,501 --> 02:08:48,970
I think praying mantis do,
don't they?

2877
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:51,280
Yeah.
I think there's a bunch of.

2878
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:54,400
A bunch of bugs that do that.
Black widows do the.

2879
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:59,430
There's quite a few.
There's one aunt where they take the 

2880
02:08:59,430 --> 02:09:00,940
mail and they bite all of his fucking 
limbs off.

2881
02:09:00,941 --> 02:09:05,941
Like the male is like bigger and they 
take them and they bite all of his legs 

2882
02:09:05,941 --> 02:09:09,991
and wings off and then they bring them 
to the hive and then they make them 

2883
02:09:09,991 --> 02:09:13,011
breed.
That's weird that there's this society 

2884
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:13,011
where like that's all the males are good
for.

2885
02:09:13,011 --> 02:09:13,990
I don't think it's the society.
Well,

2886
02:09:13,991 --> 02:09:18,991
you know what I mean,
it's crazy little and it's a group 

2887
02:09:18,991 --> 02:09:21,370
that's the real danger about spaceman is
that like a starship trooper style.

2888
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:25,420
You could land somewhere and there's 
giant bugs like that.

2889
02:09:25,421 --> 02:09:26,930
That's,
that's the reality.

2890
02:09:27,210 --> 02:09:29,320
Like we're lucky to have plugs are 
fucking little man.

2891
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:30,790
No kidding.
They live with us.

2892
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:32,860
I mean they are in our world.
I,

2893
02:09:32,870 --> 02:09:35,620
I found a praying mantis the other day 
and I got a video of this.

2894
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:40,920
My daughter found it and I put it on her
hand and then she was holding it and 

2895
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,570
they try to get you and stuff,
but they can't get you there,

2896
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:45,640
you know,
they can get like a bug or a hummingbird

2897
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:50,641
or something like that,
but they really can't get a person and 

2898
02:09:50,641 --> 02:09:54,720
we put it on this,
this branch and just right where we put 

2899
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:54,720
it just by total luck.

2900
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:57,220
It was a bunch of ants crawling on the 
branch and just starts eating the ants.

2901
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:02,340
Wow.
Just picking him up and eating them 

2902
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:03,460
while sitting there and they were going,
oh my God,

2903
02:10:03,461 --> 02:10:04,420
he's eating.
The aunts were like,

2904
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:05,530
Whoa,
this is so cool.

2905
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,800
And I tried to video it,
but it's just hard to like get that in,

2906
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,480
you know,
but uh,

2907
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:13,540
that's going on right now.
You know what I'm saying?

2908
02:10:13,541 --> 02:10:15,130
Like that is a reality of life.
Now,

2909
02:10:15,131 --> 02:10:20,131
if that thing was as big as a giraffe 
and the answer to the size of pigs and 

2910
02:10:20,131 --> 02:10:24,541
you open your window,
you looked out there and you see this 

2911
02:10:24,541 --> 02:10:26,461
fucking eating paste the pigs can and 
try to get away.

2912
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,270
We would live in a horrific environment.
That's like starship troopers.

2913
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:34,540
Like the only difference between that 
and you know,

2914
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:39,610
and,
and our reality is that these bugs are 

2915
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:39,610
small,
right?

2916
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:39,610
But there bugs,
man bugs.

2917
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:41,780
They have a Dev,
no motions yet.

2918
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,150
As far as we know,
they,

2919
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:47,430
they lived this very alien,
almost mechanical life there.

2920
02:10:47,431 --> 02:10:52,431
They're like similar to like robots.
They're like a little weird robotic 

2921
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:56,060
alien creature that lives side by side 
with us.

2922
02:10:56,061 --> 02:10:59,170
It's just so small we don't think about.
It isn't a word.

2923
02:10:59,190 --> 02:10:59,530
The,
Oh,

2924
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:02,540
like the see all their friends getting 
eaten and they don't react to it,

2925
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:07,541
but they just walk right into the walk 
right into it because they're 

2926
02:11:07,541 --> 02:11:07,541
programmed.
They're not

2927
02:11:07,541 --> 02:11:08,680
like,
I almost think like in the future way,

2928
02:11:08,710 --> 02:11:13,710
thousands of years we're going to find 
out the bugs and stuff are actually 

2929
02:11:13,710 --> 02:11:14,630
completely way more advanced than us and
that,

2930
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:15,430
you know,
like,

2931
02:11:15,730 --> 02:11:18,280
look at hummingbirds that doesn't look 
like nature,

2932
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:20,560
that it looks like a fucking jet 
fighter.

2933
02:11:21,150 --> 02:11:26,150
It's,
that does not seem like the same thing 

2934
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:26,150
as a snail.

2935
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:30,450
Well,
can you imagine if someone could figure 

2936
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:30,450
out a way to make a military aircraft 
that can maneuver like a hummingbird,

2937
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,530
like a large military occur,
ethical,

2938
02:11:35,610 --> 02:11:39,280
like what they can do is incredible.
The ways that we can move back and forth

2939
02:11:39,281 --> 02:11:39,910
and all around,

2940
02:11:40,110 --> 02:11:45,110
Hey,
have a hummingbird feeder outside my 

2941
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:45,110
house and had tons of hummingbirds and 
if you have the new iphone,

2942
02:11:45,111 --> 02:11:50,111
it has that slow motion video thing.
It's really good.

2943
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:52,190
Cool.
That's dope.

2944
02:11:52,590 --> 02:11:53,720
Yeah,
they're beautiful,

2945
02:11:53,721 --> 02:11:54,080
man.

2946
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:55,910
That's funny.
That's one thing I noticed about,

2947
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:58,340
again,
I watched the CEO video again last night

2948
02:11:58,341 --> 02:12:02,150
and just how bad camera phones were for,
uh,

2949
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,660
for motion picture.
Oh yeah.

2950
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:05,780
Like at the end of the video it's like 
really,

2951
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:06,930
you know,
that's an e eight,

2952
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:09,110
15.
That's A.

2953
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:14,320
Yeah.
Lg or Motorola made have been right 

2954
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:14,320
before the razor,
I think it was,

2955
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:18,101
but it was that one that you flip open 
and it was like the first camera phone 

2956
02:12:18,101 --> 02:12:21,280
that did video and it was the ones that 
you flipped open and it was side.

2957
02:12:21,290 --> 02:12:22,010
Oh no,
it wasn't.

2958
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:24,470
It wasn't the envy.
It was way before the envy.

2959
02:12:24,471 --> 02:12:29,471
This was the first video phone which was
on verizon and my battery died when I 

2960
02:12:30,051 --> 02:12:35,051
did them and see if there's [inaudible] 
there's like an extra two hours that 

2961
02:12:35,051 --> 02:12:35,510
they've never been seen.
But then my,

2962
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,640
my,
it died and so then I was like,

2963
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:38,240
fuck,
what do I do?

2964
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:42,550
Oh my camera phone.
So the last part where Steve is easy and

2965
02:12:42,551 --> 02:12:43,250
all that.
Yeah,

2966
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:43,660
yeah,
yeah,

2967
02:12:43,670 --> 02:12:43,820
yeah.

2968
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:46,850
Wow.
That's crazy that,

2969
02:12:46,851 --> 02:12:48,350
that was just a short amount of time 
ago.

2970
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:52,670
But if we ever landed on another planet 
and found bugs,

2971
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:55,160
like big giant bugs like that,
you know,

2972
02:12:55,161 --> 02:12:57,830
what a mind fuck that would be.
Have you landed on some planet?

2973
02:12:57,831 --> 02:13:02,831
And it was enormous.
Dinosaur size praying mantises running 

2974
02:13:02,831 --> 02:13:03,170
around.
They attack the drone.

2975
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:08,340
Like we landed drone somewhere and it 
fucking picks up the drone and crushes 

2976
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:08,540
it,
starts sucking the batteries out of it,

2977
02:13:09,010 --> 02:13:11,530
or if it had all the same animals and 
people and stuff,

2978
02:13:11,531 --> 02:13:16,531
but mixed together weird like humans 
were like in love with ostriches or 

2979
02:13:16,531 --> 02:13:19,520
something like that.
This,

2980
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:24,610
what about a species specific meeting 
wasn't necessarily that everything 

2981
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:25,420
fucked everything.
Hybrids.

2982
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:27,980
Everywhere you looked like dog hybrids.
You can fucking.

2983
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,800
You can fucking anything you wanted and 
every.

2984
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:35,870
Whenever you fuck something,
it would make a combination like 

2985
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:35,870
everybody get everybody pregnant,
including animals.

2986
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:36,960
Get people pregnant.
That'd be so much fun.

2987
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,030
So cool.
We'd be in the old comedy.

2988
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:41,190
That little bear you get herpes out of 
it,

2989
02:13:41,191 --> 02:13:44,190
but it'd be worth it.
It would be figuring out a way to make a

2990
02:13:44,191 --> 02:13:46,390
weapon to protect your butthole 
everywhere you.

2991
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:48,720
Every time you left the house,
something will be trying to fuck you and

2992
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:53,721
get you pregnant and then you try to 
tell people about this planet and all 

2993
02:13:53,721 --> 02:13:54,190
they care about is your fucking tee 
shirt.

2994
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:55,200
Imagine how much.

2995
02:13:57,450 --> 02:14:00,210
Imagine how much more sensitive we would
all be to each other if we could.

2996
02:14:00,211 --> 02:14:03,990
All get pregnant if it was universal,
if everybody got pregnant,

2997
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:07,500
I wouldn't trust anybody.
Like if there was no disparity.

2998
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:13,840
Sleep.
Think about how much disparity there is 

2999
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:15,120
and like physical strength and ability.
Like we were looking at Shaquille o'neal

3000
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:20,121
and his wife.
Obviously he's just so much bigger and 

3001
02:14:20,121 --> 02:14:20,121
stronger than her.
Right,

3002
02:14:20,121 --> 02:14:20,760
but what if everybody was the exact same
size,

3003
02:14:20,761 --> 02:14:23,670
like all people are the exact same size 
and everybody could get everybody.

3004
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:25,260
Now you're talking.
What?

3005
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:27,390
What would the reality of this world 
bait?

3006
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:31,590
Would there be more people or less 
people will depend on our urges,

3007
02:14:31,591 --> 02:14:33,450
right?
We have the same urges.

3008
02:14:33,451 --> 02:14:38,451
It's probably the same amount of people.
We just figured out a way to deal with 

3009
02:14:38,451 --> 02:14:38,730
the fact that we're just going to fuck 
each other.

3010
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:39,810
Yeah.

3011
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:42,270
I think it would be relatively the same 
amount of people because most.

3012
02:14:42,271 --> 02:14:46,110
I'd say most children come from a a 
mutual relationship.

3013
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:49,440
We'll just think about how many people 
back in the Roman days,

3014
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:54,470
how many men went gay because they were 
just off on campaign together in there,

3015
02:14:55,080 --> 02:15:00,080
but fucking fees,
Musky unshaven shit.

3016
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:05,150
Smeared assholes have soared murderer.
No babies should be born that way.

3017
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:10,480
I mean this is not a love child.
The reason why they went case because 

3018
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:13,940
back then they didn't have anything to 
clean their pussies and then he just 

3019
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:16,491
smelled really,
really bad like pussy smell and dude's 

3020
02:15:16,491 --> 02:15:19,630
ass hole unless you're shooting out of 
your pussy because you can wipe the 

3021
02:15:19,630 --> 02:15:22,080
outside of your butthole out.
But like there's just like shit dying in

3022
02:15:22,081 --> 02:15:27,081
those pussies some.
I think some of it probably smelled 

3023
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:28,120
great.
I bet people you know,

3024
02:15:28,121 --> 02:15:30,810
like people are not supposed to be like 
washing with soap,

3025
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:35,870
you know,
they said that they say that like when 

3026
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:37,701
you wash with like one of the things a 
big mistake people make when they do 

3027
02:15:37,701 --> 02:15:40,521
Jujitsu,
don't take a shower right before you go 

3028
02:15:40,521 --> 02:15:40,521
to class.

3029
02:15:40,521 --> 02:15:40,521
Right.
You actually shouldn't.

3030
02:15:40,521 --> 02:15:45,050
You should like limit your showering to 
about two hours before class because 

3031
02:15:45,050 --> 02:15:46,500
when you shower it takes about a half an
hour.

3032
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:51,530
Supposedly from the stuff I've read,
obviously I'm no expert for your body's 

3033
02:15:51,530 --> 02:15:53,220
natural flora to start to replenish 
itself.

3034
02:15:53,610 --> 02:15:58,610
So if you go get scratched or you do 
something where you're going to be in 

3035
02:15:58,610 --> 02:16:00,730
physical contact with someone,
uh,

3036
02:16:01,210 --> 02:16:06,210
then you take a shower first,
you have a higher likelihood of you not 

3037
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:08,310
having the skin flora to fight off any 
potential.

3038
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:13,370
Weird Shit.
That's interesting because I always 

3039
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:13,370
shave after I shower.
We can do that.

3040
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:13,590
Oh,
okay.

3041
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:14,490
Yeah.
I mean it's different.

3042
02:16:14,491 --> 02:16:15,820
We're talking about Jujitsu.
No,

3043
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:18,180
that's not the same as shaving.
It's almost like an injury.

3044
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:22,530
What are you doing when you're shaving?
I always cut myself.

3045
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,590
I'm sorry.
I guess I missed,

3046
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:26,460
you know,
Jujitsu.

3047
02:16:26,461 --> 02:16:29,530
You get staph infections and funk.

3048
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:34,770
Gotcha to ground.
So I think the point being that a 

3049
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:36,370
woman's natural flora,
like the natural bacteria in her body,

3050
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:41,380
that's why one of the reasons why women 
supposedly are more susceptible to yeast

3051
02:16:41,381 --> 02:16:46,381
infections when they take antibiotics 
because antibiotics kills all the 

3052
02:16:46,381 --> 02:16:47,560
bacteria.
The good stuff too.

3053
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:52,920
And so they can get the poster form and 
there's a smell.

3054
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:59,620
And this is not any woman's fault.
Okay.

3055
02:16:59,621 --> 02:17:04,621
This is just unfortunate,
but there's a smell that is capable of 

3056
02:17:04,621 --> 02:17:06,460
coming out of a vagina that until you 
smell it,

3057
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,830
you can't believe it,
and when you do smell it and you go,

3058
02:17:08,831 --> 02:17:12,040
how is this possible?
How is it possible that the human body,

3059
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:13,630
what is,
what is the human body?

3060
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:17,460
St will warn you.
He's trying to say this is good,

3061
02:17:17,710 --> 02:17:19,090
right?
Don't go down there.

3062
02:17:20,170 --> 02:17:21,670
How come?
If that's the case,

3063
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:23,860
why doesn't hurt me smell?
I don't know.

3064
02:17:23,861 --> 02:17:25,120
It should.
How come?

3065
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:28,330
Yeast infection smell,
but why doesn't venereal disease isn't a

3066
02:17:28,331 --> 02:17:29,340
person smell again.

3067
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:36,640
And how can dog sometimes smell cancer?
That's what they train them to smell 

3068
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:40,861
cancer.
Did you hear about this guy that 

3069
02:17:40,861 --> 02:17:42,931
recently lost his hearing and he can now
only here like Wifi signals wherever he 

3070
02:17:43,121 --> 02:17:46,410
goes,
he's almost deaf,

3071
02:17:46,420 --> 02:17:49,870
but it's driving him crazy because he 
can only hear Wifi signals.

3072
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:52,030
Whoa.
That sounds like hell on her.

3073
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:53,350
Well,
you know,

3074
02:17:53,351 --> 02:17:56,320
they say that bees can hear cell phone 
signal's really.

3075
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:58,990
Is that where they're dying off?
There's that.

3076
02:17:58,991 --> 02:18:00,820
And there's also pesticides,
like,

3077
02:18:00,821 --> 02:18:03,880
um,
they have a bunch of bs,

3078
02:18:03,881 --> 02:18:08,881
died off really recently,
like millions of bees and it coincided 

3079
02:18:08,881 --> 02:18:13,261
with the production of some genetically 
modified crop that resist pesticides was

3080
02:18:13,871 --> 02:18:15,580
real recent story.
I'll pull it up.

3081
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:21,240
That's why these a big gossipy lately.
And bees bees going extinct as a way 

3082
02:18:21,431 --> 02:18:23,620
bigger problem than say Koala bears go 
extinct.

3083
02:18:23,621 --> 02:18:23,860
Right?

3084
02:18:23,930 --> 02:18:24,790
Yeah,
man.

3085
02:18:24,791 --> 02:18:25,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

3086
02:18:25,530 --> 02:18:27,880
These are really,
really a big issue.

3087
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:29,050
When,
when bees die,

3088
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:32,680
it's not good at all.
Trying to find the most recent shit.

3089
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:34,290
It's,

3090
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:39,160
it's a very recent story you've ever met
a guy that collected butterflies?

3091
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:43,300
No,
the pins in the box.

3092
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:45,250
I was just seeing that like in movies 
and shit,

3093
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:46,750
but I've never seen anyone actually do 
it.

3094
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:50,830
A man who can hear Wifi wherever you 
will.

3095
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:54,910
There's insecticides that they're 
blaming on killing off bs.

3096
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:58,630
I think apparently the Wifi signals and 
the,

3097
02:18:58,631 --> 02:19:03,631
um,
any like radio signals and cell phone 

3098
02:19:03,631 --> 02:19:06,541
signals,
they all have the potential to disrupt 

3099
02:19:06,541 --> 02:19:09,511
the natural communication methods that a
lot of insects use and beads especially 

3100
02:19:09,511 --> 02:19:13,000
are sort of susceptible to a cell phone 
signals the flux with them.

3101
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:16,600
Yeah,
millions of bees.

3102
02:19:16,601 --> 02:19:21,601
Did I to find this be used to because 
they were trying to figure out what it 

3103
02:19:23,861 --> 02:19:26,950
was.
Why did $37 million bees fall out of the

3104
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:28,880
air?
Thirty 7 million.

3105
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:31,070
Man,
that's pretty crazy.

3106
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:33,740
And they're,
they're trying to put it together.

3107
02:19:33,741 --> 02:19:36,950
But some people of course are connecting
it with genetically modified corn.

3108
02:19:36,951 --> 02:19:41,951
So as the shock incident came just weeks
after genetically modified corn was 

3109
02:19:41,951 --> 02:19:45,761
planted in Ontario,
according to the local honey gatherers 

3110
02:19:45,761 --> 02:19:49,750
beekeeper,
Dave Schultz lost about $37 million 

3111
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:50,990
bees,
which is around 600 hives.

3112
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:53,990
Whoa.
Urban homestead,

3113
02:19:53,991 --> 02:19:55,850
honey.com
is where he,

3114
02:19:55,851 --> 02:19:57,530
uh,
he did this interview.

3115
02:19:57,531 --> 02:19:59,780
He said once the corn started to get 
planted,

3116
02:19:59,781 --> 02:20:04,781
our bees died by the millions that 
collapsed in the local honeybee 

3117
02:20:04,781 --> 02:20:07,520
population is called why caused 
widespread concern with many pointing to

3118
02:20:07,521 --> 02:20:11,360
pesticides as the cause in the decline 
of colonies.

3119
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:13,360
Yet supposedly they were making a 
comeback though.

3120
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:16,310
Some recent reports like this one says,
after decline,

3121
02:20:16,311 --> 02:20:18,570
honey bears are appear to making honey 
bees.

3122
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:19,290
Honey bees.

3123
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:26,960
Bigger bus kids need.
Um,

3124
02:20:27,530 --> 02:20:29,140
yeah man,
I don't know.

3125
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:34,290
You know,
it's like when people fuck with nature 

3126
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:37,961
like that and you start messing around 
adding pesticides and pesticide 

3127
02:20:37,961 --> 02:20:41,970
resistant plants and you start fucking 
with what that plan is and then these be

3128
02:20:41,971 --> 02:20:44,760
started dying.
You know,

3129
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:46,000
I'm,
I mean I'm all for.

3130
02:20:48,170 --> 02:20:49,910
I'm all for people trying to improve 
things,

3131
02:20:49,911 --> 02:20:50,610
but the,
this,

3132
02:20:50,611 --> 02:20:55,611
this seems like a complete disaster if 
that's what it actually turns out to be 

3133
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:56,150
doing it.
That's scary shit too man.

3134
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:58,100
That someone could just invent something
like that.

3135
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:00,800
Thirty 7 million bees can die.
Like instantly.

3136
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:02,720
Yeah.
That we're capable of doing that.

3137
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:07,830
It was just total unintended consequence
of creating this pesticide resistant 

3138
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:13,030
plant.
You plant it and then just everything 

3139
02:21:13,030 --> 02:21:15,101
dies dear start fucking stiff leg and in
the middle of the street and you don't 

3140
02:21:15,111 --> 02:21:17,900
even fall from the sky.
You don't really know how it happened.

3141
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:23,320
Yeah,
because birds eat the insects and 

3142
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:25,331
insects eat the pesticides and all the 
shit just comes together and then you 

3143
02:21:25,331 --> 02:21:29,621
get cancer from eating the birds and 
you're promoting pseudoscience.

3144
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:35,440
Man.
Why don't you just stand those 

3145
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:38,120
anti-vaccine man?
You're anti science.

3146
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:43,300
I think it's actually,
there's science in $37 million bees 

3147
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:47,260
dying right after genetically modified 
corn is being planted.

3148
02:21:47,661 --> 02:21:51,200
I think there's probably like science to
be had there.

3149
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:56,260
I think so.
I feel like if you studied it and you 

3150
02:21:56,260 --> 02:21:56,630
analyze the data,

3151
02:21:58,140 --> 02:22:00,400
just the idea of being a b is pretty 
fucking trippy.

3152
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:04,270
Living with a bunch of other assholes.
Yeah.

3153
02:22:04,271 --> 02:22:09,271
Making this weird fucking geometric 
pattern with little cubicles and 

3154
02:22:09,271 --> 02:22:10,870
everybody lives in these cubicles and 
they all know how to do it.

3155
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:16,140
They all know no bees come along with.
They forget the old ways and I had to 

3156
02:22:16,140 --> 02:22:19,790
make hives every year.
They figured out how to make homes and 

3157
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:22,650
then that queen can't.
She goes around stabbing all the female 

3158
02:22:22,650 --> 02:22:25,561
babies.
The Queen Bee is the only one that 

3159
02:22:25,561 --> 02:22:26,660
doesn't have a retractable removable 
her.

3160
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:28,500
Her little pincher,
her little,

3161
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:30,980
her little pussy nail that she has down 
there.

3162
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:34,860
Her Stinger doesn't go out.
She can stinky all day.

3163
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:39,960
Right.
And the reason why so that she can 

3164
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:39,960
murder female babies.
So she goes near the hive,

3165
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:43,610
sniffs out when she smells a female one 
in the actual steps.

3166
02:22:43,770 --> 02:22:44,850
That shit out of it.

3167
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:48,560
She's stabbing babies so she doesn't get
it.

3168
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:50,880
It can be born so she doesn't get 
overthrown by a female.

3169
02:22:50,881 --> 02:22:52,650
Exactly.
Because there can be only one.

3170
02:22:52,651 --> 02:22:57,651
It's like highlander which goes around 
with their sword pussy and just starts 

3171
02:22:57,651 --> 02:23:01,371
stabbing little little baby females in 
their box before they even get hatched 

3172
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:03,360
and they spend their whole lives just 
making honey.

3173
02:23:03,361 --> 02:23:05,670
Huh?
And they could be the size of horses.

3174
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:07,590
It's more humane way.
Imagine.

3175
02:23:07,950 --> 02:23:10,200
Oh fuck that match.
If they were like elephants,

3176
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:17,280
big conti flying elephants.
That stang babies would be.

3177
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:20,530
Would we still be so kind?
If they gave us honey now.

3178
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:25,580
Fuck honey.
At that point in fighter jets after 

3179
02:23:25,580 --> 02:23:27,480
those bitches,
you hae a batch.

3180
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:29,070
Would have been due to a fighter jet 
though.

3181
02:23:29,071 --> 02:23:31,590
Probably just grab it and rip it apart 
for b.

3182
02:23:31,591 --> 02:23:36,591
was the size of an elephant.
It probably just throw jets out of the 

3183
02:23:36,591 --> 02:23:36,591
sky.
Just grab bitch.

3184
02:23:36,591 --> 02:23:38,970
Stick a Stinger right through it.
Take you to a volcano.

3185
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:42,660
We see fucking live video.
The pilot screaming is the bees flew him

3186
02:23:42,661 --> 02:23:44,100
over the volcano and drop them in.

3187
02:23:49,210 --> 02:23:52,800
I hope we never get to this point.
I really do.

3188
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:55,890
What do you think we would do if if 
insects started getting bigger?

3189
02:23:56,530 --> 02:24:01,530
They just kept getting bigger and you 
know how like every year it gets a 

3190
02:24:01,530 --> 02:24:04,371
little warmer as well.
First I'd panic and not know what the 

3191
02:24:04,371 --> 02:24:08,721
fuck did though.
How long would it take before we would 

3192
02:24:08,721 --> 02:24:10,860
act if bees started getting like that 
big of bees started getting that big and

3193
02:24:10,861 --> 02:24:15,861
if kids kids,
what I'm holding up is a coffee stirrer 

3194
02:24:15,861 --> 02:24:16,980
that's probably about.
Was at about four inches.

3195
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:17,730
Five inches.
Yeah.

3196
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:19,590
Four or five inches.
Imagine the.

3197
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,100
Okay,
let's go.

3198
02:24:20,101 --> 02:24:22,260
Six managers.
Six inch bees.

3199
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,400
Would we still tolerate that?
No.

3200
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:26,670
No,
no fucking way.

3201
02:24:26,690 --> 02:24:29,250
I would find a way to cook them.
They'll be like little lobsters.

3202
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:31,410
Vicious,
but they're great.

3203
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:32,850
What if they look soft?
Shell crabs.

3204
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:34,840
Then I'm eating them.
Problem solve.

3205
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:37,290
Well,
they're edible.

3206
02:24:37,291 --> 02:24:39,660
I know that puts some old bay on that 
shit.

3207
02:24:39,661 --> 02:24:42,750
I'm pretty sure we made me bleed bees.
I know we did actually.

3208
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:43,620
Yeah,
that will.

3209
02:24:43,621 --> 02:24:45,000
That's A.
I'm Asian Hornet.

3210
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:47,550
That's a hornet.
They kill bees.

3211
02:24:47,580 --> 02:24:50,880
We've actually showed that video before 
and it also got us pulled from youtube.

3212
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:53,340
When did you start getting pulled from 
youtube?

3213
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:58,400
Like crazy man.
People have copyrights on all these 

3214
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:58,400
videos,
especially nature videos,

3215
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:02,210
which we being the retards that we are 
watching and whether they have those and

3216
02:25:03,571 --> 02:25:06,450
they put those on youtube,
they own the video.

3217
02:25:06,451 --> 02:25:11,451
So if you play it in,
even if it's fair use you play and do 

3218
02:25:11,451 --> 02:25:12,930
commentary on it and even tell people to
go to see it on youtube.

3219
02:25:12,931 --> 02:25:16,830
Big still have a copyright call on you 
and they pull your video down,

3220
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:22,640
but it's not.
It's not like you're doing anything 

3221
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:22,640
illegal.

3222
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:23,040
It is actually fair use.
Look at the image of that thing.

3223
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:25,030
Jesus Christ.
Okay.

3224
02:25:25,031 --> 02:25:26,980
That's probably like three inches long,
right?

3225
02:25:27,070 --> 02:25:30,220
That's a God damn bug to three at about 
three inches long.

3226
02:25:30,470 --> 02:25:31,960
Half that guy's hand,
right?

3227
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:36,130
About three inches too.
So I know what size my Dick is guys.

3228
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:38,020
Guys,
Hey,

3229
02:25:38,021 --> 02:25:41,230
now that's about three inches.
That's a fucked up bug.

3230
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:44,320
But if they were like a foot long,
we'd have to start taking them out.

3231
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:47,080
We wouldn't tolerate it if they were 
killing babies and shit.

3232
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:49,030
If they were bird size,
pigeon size,

3233
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:51,370
it'd be war against the bees.
Fuck honey.

3234
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:53,560
Fuck.
Any repercussions of those fucks.

3235
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:54,770
Oh,
we're already there.

3236
02:25:54,830 --> 02:25:56,770
One of those things.
What are they called?

3237
02:25:56,870 --> 02:26:01,690
Uh Oh.
We're looking at bees that are like cell

3238
02:26:01,691 --> 02:26:06,691
phones.
Those are like cell phone size piece 

3239
02:26:06,691 --> 02:26:06,691
already.
That's a STARTAC.

3240
02:26:06,691 --> 02:26:07,450
Motorola STARTAC.

3241
02:26:07,790 --> 02:26:08,550
A

3242
02:26:11,790 --> 02:26:15,280
Asian giant Hornet Asian giant Hornet.
Fuck that.

3243
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:18,000
No wonder the jumping off buildings in 
Asia.

3244
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,290
That's bullshit.
Jesus Christ,

3245
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:25,300
his horn.
Hornet will be the last day before he 

3246
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:27,060
died.
Oh my God.

3247
02:26:27,150 --> 02:26:28,710
And that easily could,
you know,

3248
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:30,960
staying the shit out of you and ruin 
your week.

3249
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,560
Yeah.
Sting.

3250
02:26:32,570 --> 02:26:36,780
You're writing your dick hole climbs on 
your and you were inside your whole.

3251
02:26:37,050 --> 02:26:41,730
You wake up screaming in the.
You can't get the Stinger out because as

3252
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:45,330
the Hornet dies,
it pulls out and you'll see the Stinger.

3253
02:26:45,331 --> 02:26:49,330
It's in there with the tweezers are too 
big and you can't get it,

3254
02:26:50,130 --> 02:26:55,130
but you still take a picture of it 
because your Dick is swollen because it 

3255
02:26:55,130 --> 02:26:58,401
makes it look better.
It makes it look bigger tech by giant 

3256
02:26:58,401 --> 02:26:58,440
Hornets,
the eight holes through his arm.

3257
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:00,690
What?
I'm never going outside.

3258
02:27:00,691 --> 02:27:03,900
But is that from the venom?
From being stung?

3259
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:06,540
Yeah,
but go to the actual page itself and see

3260
02:27:06,541 --> 02:27:11,541
if that's like if the venom erodes your 
skin tissue or something like bullet 

3261
02:27:11,821 --> 02:27:12,300
holes.

3262
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:13,870
Nature.
Scariest.

3263
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:16,740
Fuck Dude.
When I was up in Canada this week,

3264
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:19,890
is that what it is in the stink and 
dissolve human tissue,

3265
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:24,840
so not cool.
The more we learn,

3266
02:27:24,841 --> 02:27:26,190
the more scared I am.
Dude,

3267
02:27:26,191 --> 02:27:31,191
go to the outside world,
go to my instagram and check out the 

3268
02:27:31,191 --> 02:27:35,061
picture of the cow,
the calf rather the moose calf that got 

3269
02:27:36,241 --> 02:27:40,920
torn apart by wolves that we found when 
we were in British Columbia.

3270
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:45,280
We're up in British Columbia and there's
a lot of wolves up there a lot.

3271
02:27:45,430 --> 02:27:47,310
Look at this.
Holy Shit.

3272
02:27:47,550 --> 02:27:50,910
We came upon that.
It was only like a day or so old because

3273
02:27:50,911 --> 02:27:52,900
there was still meat on the bones and 
they're still like,

3274
02:27:53,490 --> 02:27:57,300
like the tissue,
like the meat tissue around the legs.

3275
02:27:57,301 --> 02:27:59,220
That was still there,
like wasn't rotten at all.

3276
02:27:59,430 --> 02:28:02,970
So it was a pretty,
pretty recent kill and there was hair,

3277
02:28:02,971 --> 02:28:04,980
all that white stuff that you see on the
ground,

3278
02:28:04,981 --> 02:28:05,730
that's all hair.

3279
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,380
Geez.
All that stuff that you see,

3280
02:28:07,410 --> 02:28:09,570
it looks like feathers.
That's all moose hair.

3281
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:15,200
And they uh,
the wolves had drawn a calf and calves 

3282
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:15,740
are huge.
A wall,

3283
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:19,110
like I'm a moose calf is like the size 
of a big deer,

3284
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:24,330
like they're really big and just tore 
this thing apart and we came upon it 

3285
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:28,830
whatever a day,
two days after they did it and we came 

3286
02:28:28,830 --> 02:28:30,800
upon it because the Guy Mike,
that was the guy that we were with,

3287
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:33,200
he saw crows flying overhead.
So it's like,

3288
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:35,650
let's go find out what these guys are 
eating right.

3289
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:40,790
And we could smell it as we got closer,
but it's just so eerie to be right there

3290
02:28:40,791 --> 02:28:45,791
where you know,
that some wolves were like howling and 

3291
02:28:45,791 --> 02:28:46,040
ripping apart this thing and he was 
still alive.

3292
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:47,630
The.
Oh yeah.

3293
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:50,660
Oh yeah.
Well the horror of all that shit.

3294
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:56,020
This guy who was there said that this 
Guy Mike said that his friend had found 

3295
02:28:56,721 --> 02:29:01,721
a moose that had lived for three days,
why wolves were eating it's ass and 

3296
02:29:01,721 --> 02:29:05,450
somehow stayed alive and in shock,
and when they came upon the happened,

3297
02:29:05,451 --> 02:29:10,451
it took three days and they were there 
when it first started and they didn't 

3298
02:29:10,451 --> 02:29:13,991
step in.
They didn't intervene and the wolves I 

3299
02:29:13,991 --> 02:29:13,991
can and they came back two and a half 
days later.

3300
02:29:13,991 --> 02:29:18,731
That's fucking Moose was still alive.
Then shock while the wolves were like 

3301
02:29:18,731 --> 02:29:22,370
eating its legs and its asset end 
because if they eat it slowly,

3302
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:27,520
like it just goes into shock and it 
didn't die like he has no idea how it 

3303
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,811
stayed alive,
but it was alive for three fucking days 

3304
02:29:31,811 --> 02:29:34,510
before they finally killed it.
So they were just feeding off of it 

3305
02:29:34,510 --> 02:29:37,900
while it was still alive.
And oftentimes they eat it from the ass 

3306
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:37,900
first.

3307
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:40,490
For whatever reason,
they have a natural instinct to take out

3308
02:29:40,491 --> 02:29:43,580
the back legs because the hamstring you,
when they take out the back legs,

3309
02:29:43,581 --> 02:29:45,530
you can't run away and then just start 
eating you.

3310
02:29:46,010 --> 02:29:51,010
And so there's this,
there's this crazy video of these two 

3311
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:55,420
deer that had gotten into a fight.
They were like clashing antlers 

3312
02:29:55,420 --> 02:29:56,660
together.
And when they clashed antlers together,

3313
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:59,060
they got stuck.
Sometimes this happens,

3314
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:01,640
deer get stuck and they can't.
They can't get away and they're like,

3315
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:04,340
they're moving around,
their antlers are so interlocked,

3316
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:06,140
they literally pulling apart and they 
can't.

3317
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:10,760
So the coyotes ate one of them while the
other one was still alive.

3318
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:16,350
And so there's this video of these two 
deer stuck together and one of the deer 

3319
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:19,700
is dead and these hunters had found it 
and it had asshole first.

3320
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:24,790
So these,
this pack of coyotes got ahold of the 

3321
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:26,120
one deer was eating it asshole first,
while the other deer was like,

3322
02:30:26,300 --> 02:30:31,100
move in and flip and attached to the 
rest of the carcass is this deer.

3323
02:30:31,730 --> 02:30:34,400
So they finally went over and they 
separated the two of them.

3324
02:30:34,401 --> 02:30:39,401
And then the one deer,
they let them go and then they took 

3325
02:30:39,401 --> 02:30:39,530
photos and videos,
the deer that it was all fucked up,

3326
02:30:39,531 --> 02:30:42,320
but it had literally eating it.
Asshole first.

3327
02:30:42,380 --> 02:30:43,380
Jesus Christ.
Man.

3328
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:45,830
I can't imagine.
I mean the other deer is alive.

3329
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:47,330
Yeah.
Well this is happening.

3330
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:49,220
Yeah.
Fuck man.

3331
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:54,610
Nature is a scary.
So there's a bunch of coyotes in 

3332
02:30:54,610 --> 02:30:54,610
Griffith Park.
Fuck yeah,

3333
02:30:54,610 --> 02:30:55,400
there are.
I see them running around all the time.

3334
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:57,380
Be like they go into the neighborhoods 
and stuff.

3335
02:30:57,410 --> 02:30:58,190
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3336
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,630
Yeah.
As long as they have food,

3337
02:30:59,631 --> 02:31:00,780
you're okay.
Right.

3338
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:04,490
But as soon as they run out of rabbits 
and squirrels and shoot to kill and cats

3339
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:07,220
and dogs and they start going into the 
suburbs,

3340
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,940
they start looking around for other shit
he buries too.

3341
02:31:10,941 --> 02:31:14,570
Sometimes he'll come across like coyote 
shit that's filled with berries,

3342
02:31:15,110 --> 02:31:15,500
which I was.

3343
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:20,550
I thought it was weird.
I didn't know that coyotes weren't 

3344
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,550
totally carnivores and I'd never heard 
that.

3345
02:31:21,090 --> 02:31:26,090
So just now.
Do you think you could eat a coyote if 

3346
02:31:26,090 --> 02:31:26,090
you had to stay alive?
If I had to.

3347
02:31:26,090 --> 02:31:30,530
It sounds like a lot of work though and 
I don't know if I really know how to do 

3348
02:31:30,530 --> 02:31:30,530
it.
Do I have a knife?

3349
02:31:30,620 --> 02:31:35,620
How to kill it?
You mean I have a knife and do I have 

3350
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:35,620
fire one thing?
Yeah,

3351
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:37,650
you have fire and yes.
You have a knife because you have to gut

3352
02:31:37,651 --> 02:31:38,320
it.
Okay.

3353
02:31:38,470 --> 02:31:38,940
Then.
Yeah,

3354
02:31:38,941 --> 02:31:43,941
I could do it.
You don't want to cook it with the guts 

3355
02:31:43,941 --> 02:31:43,941
in tact.

3356
02:31:43,941 --> 02:31:44,100
Hmm.

3357
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:45,810
Right.
Yeah.

3358
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:46,760
No,
I mean you got to take,

3359
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:48,650
you got gut.
You got to skin it,

3360
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:51,770
you got to cook it.
That's the world of nature,

3361
02:31:51,771 --> 02:31:56,771
man.
And you've got to eat it and then 

3362
02:31:56,771 --> 02:31:56,771
you're,
you know.

3363
02:31:56,771 --> 02:31:56,771
Then you got to do it again tomorrow.
The full charge.

3364
02:31:56,771 --> 02:31:56,771
Have you ever thought about going 
hunting?

3365
02:31:57,420 --> 02:31:59,330
Um,
I went hunting one time.

3366
02:31:59,331 --> 02:32:01,350
I shot a bird.
What kind of,

3367
02:32:01,950 --> 02:32:03,770
I don't know.
Did you eat it?

3368
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:05,150
No,
it was terrible.

3369
02:32:05,151 --> 02:32:09,170
It was a terrible thing to do and I felt
horrible and I moved on with my life.

3370
02:32:09,171 --> 02:32:11,600
It was a shotgun.
The bird had no chance whatsoever.

3371
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:15,080
That's a weird thing.
People say,

3372
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:18,530
why don't you make it fair?
You can't.

3373
02:32:18,531 --> 02:32:19,550
We can't make it fair.
Dude.

3374
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:22,220
A beaver will kill you if you try to 
make it fair.

3375
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:24,140
Right?
Beaver will fuck you up.

3376
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:26,780
Like you can't use your hands and you 
have to like get on the ground trying to

3377
02:32:26,781 --> 02:32:27,110
bite it.

3378
02:32:27,150 --> 02:32:29,780
I think that the beaver will,
when they eat trees with their face,

3379
02:32:30,310 --> 02:32:32,540
how are you going to kick a beaver's 
asked now you got to use a weapon.

3380
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:34,020
Yeah.
You're not going to win.

3381
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:36,800
There's no fair.
Nothing's fair.

3382
02:32:36,830 --> 02:32:38,600
We should have fucking shotguns for this
shit.

3383
02:32:38,750 --> 02:32:43,750
People want to like that.
This one thing that people want to say 

3384
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:43,750
like,
why don't you make it fair?

3385
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:47,440
To make it fair,
we would have to be like a 50 slash 50 

3386
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:48,470
proposition that you would die and that 
the animal would kill you.

3387
02:32:48,650 --> 02:32:50,090
Yeah.
Fifty slash 50.

3388
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:51,470
The animal will die.
50 slash 50.

3389
02:32:51,471 --> 02:32:53,960
You would die.
It's not going to happen.

3390
02:32:53,961 --> 02:32:56,210
Why would an animal is going to win?
Why would you do that?

3391
02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:59,560
That seems so stupid.
It seems like such.

3392
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:04,600
That's distorting what's going on 
because we ultimate fighting with 

3393
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:04,600
animals.
Are we eating them?

3394
02:33:04,750 --> 02:33:05,630
Like what's going on?

3395
02:33:06,630 --> 02:33:09,260
We're eating though.
I mean do we have animal weight classes?

3396
02:33:09,290 --> 02:33:14,290
Like you know,
like we have to find out like what was 

3397
02:33:14,290 --> 02:33:15,470
our will fuck up a 20 pound house cat?
If I get ahold of it,

3398
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:20,860
it'll probably scratch me up.
But the bottom line is if I can get 

3399
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:22,250
ahold of it and get its back legs just 
bashed his head on the ground,

3400
02:33:22,580 --> 02:33:24,890
I'm going to kill that cat most likely 
with my hands.

3401
02:33:25,130 --> 02:33:29,540
But a 30 pound cat,
he might fuck me up a 40 pound cat.

3402
02:33:30,110 --> 02:33:32,960
I'm going to be really scared of 50 
pound cat will probably kill me.

3403
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:37,990
Yeah.
Fifty pound cat will most likely kill 

3404
02:33:37,990 --> 02:33:37,990
me.
So you'd have to like for,

3405
02:33:37,990 --> 02:33:41,670
for fairness sake,
you'd have to have like a 35 pound cat 

3406
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:41,670
fight.
Right?

3407
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:45,980
Or normal person do trust me.
But I tell you that I was scared of this

3408
02:33:45,981 --> 02:33:49,220
kitten that I had.
Feral kitten.

3409
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:55,720
I'm telling you man,
when when the shit goes down and cats 

3410
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:55,720
are fighting for their lives,
a 30 pound,

3411
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,560
35 pound cat will give you a beating.
We'll look at that report or that video.

3412
02:34:00,561 --> 02:34:02,940
The reporter then they kept going up the
record,

3413
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:05,570
his leg and two,
they'll fuck you up man.

3414
02:34:05,960 --> 02:34:07,760
They live in a totally different world 
of movement.

3415
02:34:07,790 --> 02:34:09,980
They live in a world of superhuman 
athleticism.

3416
02:34:09,981 --> 02:34:10,940
Yeah.
You know,

3417
02:34:10,941 --> 02:34:15,941
a 35 pound cat as a formidable foe.
30 five pound pit bull is a dangerous 

3418
02:34:15,941 --> 02:34:17,410
little dog.
You versus a kangaroo fighting.

3419
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,070
Trying to kick my ass.
Kangaroo would kick my ass.

3420
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:26,640
The only way I'd be able to beat a 
kangaroo is if it didn't understand not 

3421
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:26,640
to give up.
It's back.

3422
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:30,490
I mean if there's somehow or another 
that I could scramble with the kangaroo,

3423
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:35,610
like you would try to kick me and I 
would know it's going to try to kick me 

3424
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:36,970
so I get out of the way an arm drag it.
I'd have to arm drag it and have to take

3425
02:34:36,971 --> 02:34:37,600
it's back.
Okay.

3426
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:40,510
No Jujitsu.
Only a kickboxing I would lose.

3427
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,660
Most likely.
Didn't Woody Allen box a kangaroo?

3428
02:34:43,750 --> 02:34:45,880
No.
Tiny man.

3429
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:48,560
He did.
And digital's children?

3430
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:53,580
No,
he blocks the kangaroo in like the 

3431
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:53,580
sixties on the tonight show or 
something.

3432
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:53,580
Come on.
I'm serious.

3433
02:34:53,580 --> 02:34:53,800
Brian,
can I get some help?

3434
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:56,170
I'll look it up real quick.
Um,

3435
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:59,530
you remember the old looney tune 
kangaroo?

3436
02:34:59,531 --> 02:35:02,140
It was always a boxer.
The boxing gloves.

3437
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,270
Well they definitely have kangaroo 
boxing.

3438
02:35:04,310 --> 02:35:05,230
Yeah.
I mean I've seen that.

3439
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:06,220
I've seen videos of that.
Oh,

3440
02:35:06,221 --> 02:35:08,660
what are y'all in boxing a kangaroo.
God,

3441
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:11,160
how do you not get hurt but you don't 
play.

3442
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:12,720
This is going to get us pulled.
I don't know.

3443
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:15,310
Can you think?
60 six.

3444
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:16,390
Let's find out

3445
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:21,020
tonight on hippodrome.
You're gonna.

3446
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:24,280
Watch me fight the Australian light.
Heavyweight champion.

3447
02:35:27,270 --> 02:35:28,620
Boxed warning.
Oh my God.

3448
02:35:28,621 --> 02:35:32,460
It really is a cane.
This is so funny.

3449
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:36,030
If you tried to do this today,
if you tried to do this today,

3450
02:35:37,260 --> 02:35:39,840
people would say that.
This is like animal cruelty.

3451
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:42,780
I'm going to blog about this right now.
Look at him moving around.

3452
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:44,100
Wow.
I can't believe this is real.

3453
02:35:45,650 --> 02:35:48,120
That that fucking kangaroos going to 
Jack Him.

3454
02:35:50,190 --> 02:35:52,320
He actually moves pretty God damn good.
Yeah,

3455
02:35:52,321 --> 02:35:57,321
he does that.
And Woody Allen box before they say it 

3456
02:35:57,321 --> 02:35:57,321
was a good athlete.
I'm telling you,

3457
02:35:57,321 --> 02:35:58,830
man,
he's moving pretty good.

3458
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:04,670
That's not a guy kicked him.
Wow.

3459
02:36:05,010 --> 02:36:08,460
The guys pushing them into it.
That's just fucking fucked up.

3460
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:09,610
This is good writing,
right?

3461
02:36:09,890 --> 02:36:14,890
Punch that guy behind him here.
That kangaroos dead.

3462
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:18,540
Because if he does that shit to me,
I'm taking this back.

3463
02:36:19,150 --> 02:36:22,590
I guarantee you that kangaroo has zero 
choke defense.

3464
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:24,000
You need to update this bit,
Joe.

3465
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:25,280
Dude,
he's moving well.

3466
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:26,300
Yeah.
Just to kick it,

3467
02:36:26,301 --> 02:36:31,301
you're not allowed to kick and box a 
kangaroo because that made me start 

3468
02:36:31,301 --> 02:36:31,301
kicking.
I don't want to take them.

3469
02:36:31,301 --> 02:36:32,810
You don't want to take them.
See that?

3470
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:34,870
That's what I'm saying.
He can hurt you,

3471
02:36:34,871 --> 02:36:36,400
man.
They hurt you.

3472
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,770
Oh God,
baby.

3473
02:36:38,771 --> 02:36:43,771
Jesus,
believe that they grab you and kick you 

3474
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:46,540
spit on the ground.
Whoa.

3475
02:36:46,541 --> 02:36:51,541
Keep it going man.
I want to say fuck that kangaroo up 

3476
02:36:51,541 --> 02:36:51,541
right there.
That's good.

3477
02:36:51,541 --> 02:36:52,530
Dead Kangaroo right there.
If I get that position,

3478
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,710
I'm throwing the hooks in.
I'm riding his back.

3479
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:58,070
He's not going to know what's up.
I'll choke the shit out of a kangaroo.

3480
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:00,800
Yeah,
I changed the position.

3481
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:03,470
If I was that guy in the suit,
I'm killing that kangaroo with my hands.

3482
02:37:06,510 --> 02:37:08,150
That's just how it's gone down.
What can you do?

3483
02:37:08,190 --> 02:37:10,430
I would never be in that position.
I would never fucking buck.

3484
02:37:10,431 --> 02:37:11,630
I think it's cool as shit,
man.

3485
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:16,670
Isn't that funny?
He such like known as such an 

3486
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:16,670
intellectual comedian that woody.
Yeah.

3487
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:20,561
And then he just,
and then he just fights a kangaroo is a 

3488
02:37:20,561 --> 02:37:20,561
bit.
It's not his idea.

3489
02:37:20,561 --> 02:37:20,810
Obviously.
It might've been.

3490
02:37:21,130 --> 02:37:22,300
He was young.
I seems fake.

3491
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:24,410
Piss and vinegar.
It seems like fun.

3492
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:26,060
Dude.
Seems terrifying.

3493
02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:30,050
You Woody Allen moves pretty good.
I'm pretty impressed.

3494
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:31,730
I bet he boxed.
I really do.

3495
02:37:31,790 --> 02:37:33,530
I,
he's definitely into something.

3496
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:38,530
The way he moved.
He's always talking about fights and 

3497
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:38,660
going to fights.
He didn't move like a,

3498
02:37:38,661 --> 02:37:43,661
uh,
like there's some guys that go to 

3499
02:37:43,661 --> 02:37:43,661
boxercise,
like Bryan county goes to this place box

3500
02:37:43,661 --> 02:37:47,951
and burn going.
You get a lot of these executives that 

3501
02:37:47,951 --> 02:37:50,201
have never barks a day in their life and
they're in there at like drawing these 

3502
02:37:50,201 --> 02:37:52,250
ridiculously uncoordinated punches and 
it's comical to watch.

3503
02:37:53,090 --> 02:37:54,560
But that,
that was not that.

3504
02:37:54,590 --> 02:37:55,790
Like the way he was moving.
Yeah.

3505
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:56,990
He looked like he knew what he was 
doing.

3506
02:37:57,140 --> 02:38:01,130
Would you fight Woody Allen today?
A Yes for a lot of money or whatever.

3507
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:06,490
How much?
How much publicity stunt to fight woody 

3508
02:38:06,490 --> 02:38:06,740
Allen.
But if you fucked him up,

3509
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,150
I,
I'd back off.

3510
02:38:08,151 --> 02:38:10,280
There'd be a ref you back off if you had
them.

3511
02:38:10,290 --> 02:38:15,290
Right.
If I were talking about like a boxing 

3512
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:15,290
match,
right,

3513
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:15,290
whatever you want to do,
how do you want to do it?

3514
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:15,530
You could do it.
Tom.

3515
02:38:15,531 --> 02:38:17,180
Post little funny looking glass and 
rope.

3516
02:38:18,810 --> 02:38:21,290
Claude van Damme.
I wouldn't want referees.

3517
02:38:21,291 --> 02:38:26,291
I wanted to be like a civil fight.
I wouldn't wanna I wouldn't wanna beat 

3518
02:38:26,291 --> 02:38:28,070
up with woody allen too bad.
But like you're saying,

3519
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:33,100
he looked like he knew what he was doing
and I don't know what I'm doing so who 

3520
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:33,100
knows?
But I think I could take them,

3521
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:34,030
but he's older now and I think we can 
take them.

3522
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:36,070
Yeah.
And pushed both the public shame.

3523
02:38:36,071 --> 02:38:37,820
There's experience.
Probably fuck with the psyche.

3524
02:38:38,430 --> 02:38:41,750
Like he doesn't deserve to win.
I would fight him for money,

3525
02:38:41,751 --> 02:38:43,400
but I wouldn't want to hurt him.
I like him.

3526
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:44,630
Oh,
that's sweet.

3527
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:46,100
Do you still like them even though,
you know,

3528
02:38:46,101 --> 02:38:47,300
he's kind of a creeper.
Uh,

3529
02:38:47,301 --> 02:38:50,570
that really creeps me out actually.
But I still kinda like his,

3530
02:38:50,571 --> 02:38:51,980
uh,
his movies and stuff.

3531
02:38:52,190 --> 02:38:53,450
Yeah.
It's not a weird thing with the guy like

3532
02:38:53,451 --> 02:38:54,820
woody Allen.
It's like,

3533
02:38:54,830 --> 02:38:57,140
you know,
you gotta you still like Roman Polanski.

3534
02:38:57,141 --> 02:39:02,141
People still support him as an artist,
but then you find out he drugged and 

3535
02:39:02,141 --> 02:39:02,300
fucked a 13 year old.
No,

3536
02:39:02,310 --> 02:39:07,310
it's horrible.
What Rosemary's baby wasn't that good 

3537
02:39:07,310 --> 02:39:08,150
that I'm fucking sticking up for Roman 
Polanski,

3538
02:39:08,151 --> 02:39:09,170
but.
But woody,

3539
02:39:09,171 --> 02:39:10,990
I don't know.
I have a greater connection to,

3540
02:39:11,010 --> 02:39:13,670
but I'm also completely grossed out by 
the idea.

3541
02:39:13,700 --> 02:39:18,700
It's basically a step kid that he raised
and I think that's very strange where 

3542
02:39:18,700 --> 02:39:22,901
there's an image of her sitting on his 
lap as like a father figure or going to 

3543
02:39:22,901 --> 02:39:23,600
a basketball game and then an image 
later,

3544
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:25,790
many years later was holding her hand as
a boyfriend,

3545
02:39:25,791 --> 02:39:29,270
girlfriend at a basketball.
I think that's really manipulative.

3546
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:30,230
Oh,
100 percent.

3547
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:34,610
But that's why I want to fight him.
He's got it.

3548
02:39:34,610 --> 02:39:39,610
There's a great comedy album that are 
downloaded accidentally that I thought 

3549
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:42,740
was a.
I don't have that phone anymore,

3550
02:39:42,770 --> 02:39:47,770
so I don't have it on me here,
but there's a great comedy album that I 

3551
02:39:47,770 --> 02:39:49,780
downloaded that I thought was woody 
Allen doing stand up.

3552
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:54,820
Yeah,
but it turned out to be woody Allen 

3553
02:39:54,820 --> 02:39:56,280
giving an interview about standup,
so it was like woody Allen on Standup,

3554
02:39:56,300 --> 02:39:59,240
I think it's called and it's really 
interesting man,

3555
02:39:59,241 --> 02:40:01,640
because it sort of applies to stand up 
today,

3556
02:40:02,070 --> 02:40:07,070
a lot of the ideas and the principles 
and leverage these talking about 

3557
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:08,240
performers versus writers and what's 
good and what's not good.

3558
02:40:08,241 --> 02:40:10,220
And it was really interesting man.
He was good man.

3559
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:15,560
When I first started doing standup,
somebody had like an open mic at the 

3560
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:15,560
coconut

3561
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:15,560
teaser,
handed me a tape.

3562
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:18,450
I had one side was bill Hicks dangerous 
and the other side with some woody Allen

3563
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:22,150
Stanhope record and it was a pretty good
fucking tape that somebody handed him.

3564
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:22,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

3565
02:40:22,831 --> 02:40:23,850
It was not bad,
man.

3566
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:26,370
I think this one,
this one audio thing,

3567
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:31,400
woody Allen on standup a,
this one audio thing really should be 

3568
02:40:31,801 --> 02:40:33,380
something that people should,
uh,

3569
02:40:34,710 --> 02:40:39,710
should play,
like a comics should play and listen to 

3570
02:40:39,710 --> 02:40:42,721
it because just to get a historical 
perspective of what it was like to be 

3571
02:40:42,721 --> 02:40:44,070
kind of at the forefront.
I mean,

3572
02:40:44,071 --> 02:40:47,970
if you think about like you're talking 
about the early sixties.

3573
02:40:48,110 --> 02:40:48,540
Yeah,
no,

3574
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:50,880
it was before it was the,
you know,

3575
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:56,040
the people talk about stand up in the 
seventies and was like when,

3576
02:40:56,041 --> 02:40:59,040
when it got crystallized as what standup
is today,

3577
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:01,080
but,
but those guys in the sixties,

3578
02:41:01,081 --> 02:41:03,000
like Woody Allen,
he tells jokes,

3579
02:41:03,001 --> 02:41:05,310
man,
it's pretty similar to what happens now.

3580
02:41:05,670 --> 02:41:09,660
Go to woody Allen.
Stand up 65 rare.

3581
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,520
It's on youtube.
It's a.

3582
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:15,090
He was in England filming.
What'd you go for?

3583
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:17,340
Kangaroo.
Kangaroo may fight.

3584
02:41:17,730 --> 02:41:20,300
There was movies that.
Can we scratch that guy up?

3585
02:41:20,310 --> 02:41:20,970
Man.
There was.

3586
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:22,170
Oh,
this is real.

3587
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:29,150
Is this real?
It's like a movie about a guy for a 

3588
02:41:29,150 --> 02:41:31,050
movie that's definitely breaks the legs.
Oh Jesus.

3589
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:33,600
This is a terrible movie.
Kick him in the chest.

3590
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:37,440
There was a lot of kangaroo boxing 
movies,

3591
02:41:37,441 --> 02:41:38,810
I feel like.
Came out in the eighties.

3592
02:41:39,260 --> 02:41:44,260
Was big in the eighties that Cain rose 
mean you just can't reason with the 

3593
02:41:47,850 --> 02:41:49,230
kangaroo.
Terrible,

3594
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:52,830
terrible fucking screen.
If that gets kicked off Youtube,

3595
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:55,490
I'm going to be so pissed at you.
What's the video be like?

3596
02:41:55,630 --> 02:41:56,820
Oh,
a woody allen.

3597
02:41:56,821 --> 02:41:58,860
Stand up.
Sixty five rare.

3598
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:01,860
It's a more subtle form of comedy.
This woody Allen,

3599
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:06,840
but it'll do.
It's really good though.

3600
02:42:06,990 --> 02:42:11,070
It's really good to see like what comedy
was in 1965,

3601
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:16,130
you know,
to see like this guy who is known more 

3602
02:42:16,130 --> 02:42:16,470
of like as a film maker and play it a 
little bit

3603
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:21,940
and when I was younger I used to hang 
out a lot the museum in search of a 

3604
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:26,861
meaningful social relationships.
So I used to look for girls.

3605
02:42:29,170 --> 02:42:34,010
We played this before the world was a 
new group,

3606
02:42:34,310 --> 02:42:39,310
but our real succulent nude,
naked huntress stabbing to death,

3607
02:42:41,541 --> 02:42:46,180
a warthog and I got very emotionally 
involved with the painting,

3608
02:42:46,190 --> 02:42:49,040
you know,
to God had to restrain me,

3609
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:52,100
write the lyrics over the oil,
off the camera.

3610
02:42:53,730 --> 02:42:58,730
It's one of those things where like when
you know his history now it's kind of 

3611
02:42:58,730 --> 02:42:59,100
weird.
Washington talk about sex and perversion

3612
02:42:59,101 --> 02:43:01,610
and giving into indulgence and idea.
Yeah,

3613
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:01,970
yeah,
yeah,

3614
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:02,340
yeah.
No,

3615
02:43:02,341 --> 02:43:05,230
he seems obsessed with sex.
But yeah.

3616
02:43:06,510 --> 02:43:09,630
It's also interesting though to see like
just how physically was.

3617
02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:11,070
Yeah,
it's not over the top,

3618
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:11,800
but he's doing like

3619
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:15,490
his tricks that he's obviously learned 
to make people pay attention.

3620
02:43:15,550 --> 02:43:16,870
Yeah.
He's moving around a lot.

3621
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:18,330
That's a good way to put.
Yeah,

3622
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:23,580
dance moves because some dance moves and
he used to do like cafe wha and that he 

3623
02:43:24,821 --> 02:43:27,730
used to do like those folk scene.
Mike's really?

3624
02:43:27,790 --> 02:43:28,440
Yeah,
yeah,

3625
02:43:28,441 --> 02:43:29,020
yeah,
yeah.

3626
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:30,490
They'd be like,
what does cafe wall.

3627
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:34,030
It's like we're a Hendrix and dylan and 
everybody played in the village.

3628
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:36,970
Really share the stage.
Joan rivers was there.

3629
02:43:36,971 --> 02:43:38,670
Bob Dylan was there.
It was nuts,

3630
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:43,700
man.
It was this one venue where like people 

3631
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:45,300
tried out more artistic things.
Wow.

3632
02:43:45,490 --> 02:43:48,730
Yeah.
That's got to be really bizarre,

3633
02:43:48,731 --> 02:43:49,740
man.
And do standup.

3634
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:52,600
The intermixed with all these other.
Yeah,

3635
02:43:52,770 --> 02:43:54,190
because yeah,
standup wasn't.

3636
02:43:54,670 --> 02:43:59,670
I don't think there used to be shows 
where you go see a whole standup show 

3637
02:43:59,670 --> 02:43:59,670
back in the day.
It was just part of the show.

3638
02:43:59,830 --> 02:44:01,840
That's why in Annie Hall,
Woody Allen Goes,

3639
02:44:02,110 --> 02:44:03,700
well,
I don't want to go on after a comedian.

3640
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,750
You know why you have to be going on 
after comedian.

3641
02:44:05,980 --> 02:44:10,150
Like that wasn't done back in the day.
It was more of a variety show thing.

3642
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:14,050
Magicians jugglers,
hat tricks and yeah,

3643
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:19,260
in musicians and makes you realize like 
how young stand up comedy really is all 

3644
02:44:20,460 --> 02:44:22,420
our,
all our forms of human expression.

3645
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:27,660
Think about like films,
films only been around for 100 or so 

3646
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:27,660
years,
you know,

3647
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:27,970
books,
books,

3648
02:44:27,971 --> 02:44:32,971
literature has only been around for 100 
years or something like that to people 

3649
02:44:32,971 --> 02:44:35,761
and writing things down.
I mean there's obviously written 

3650
02:44:35,761 --> 02:44:35,761
language from way,
way,

3651
02:44:35,761 --> 02:44:39,421
way back in the day,
like the cuneiform tablets and shit for 

3652
02:44:39,421 --> 02:44:39,421
like 6,000
years ago.

3653
02:44:39,421 --> 02:44:43,051
But like how long has it been where 
people have like acknowledged that with 

3654
02:44:43,051 --> 02:44:45,100
their writing is bullshit.
Like this is fiction.

3655
02:44:45,190 --> 02:44:50,190
I'm making this up.
I want you to like I'm telling you a 

3656
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:50,190
story that I totally made up.
How long has that been?

3657
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:50,380
Not that long,
right?

3658
02:44:50,381 --> 02:44:51,790
Not Long.
I don't know.

3659
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:54,480
Obviously long time for like human life.
Sure.

3660
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:59,520
But not that long in terms of 
perspective of the age of the human 

3661
02:44:59,590 --> 02:45:01,690
being or the age of the earth.
So all this is like super new,

3662
02:45:01,930 --> 02:45:04,840
super new,
and one of the newest is standup and one

3663
02:45:04,841 --> 02:45:08,410
of the newest of the newest is mediums.
Yeah.

3664
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:12,850
Like jokes and form jokes in meme form 
or less than a decade old,

3665
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:14,590
right.
Cosby mean.

3666
02:45:14,740 --> 02:45:15,910
Yeah.
Right.

3667
02:45:17,070 --> 02:45:19,030
Like you just saw the bill cosby thing,
right?

3668
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:19,770
Uh,
the,

3669
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:20,650
the story.
Yeah.

3670
02:45:20,710 --> 02:45:21,870
The bill cosby meme.
No,

3671
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:22,780
I haven't seen it.
Oh,

3672
02:45:22,781 --> 02:45:23,770
you don't know what happened?
No.

3673
02:45:24,970 --> 02:45:28,060
One of the greatest moments in internet 
history happened.

3674
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:30,040
Bill cosby.
Okay.

3675
02:45:30,041 --> 02:45:35,041
Yeah.
A little story about bill cosby and 

3676
02:45:35,041 --> 02:45:35,041
accused of sexual assault and rape and 
all this jazz.

3677
02:45:35,041 --> 02:45:38,170
He put a meme generator on his own 
website that said,

3678
02:45:38,171 --> 02:45:39,730
go ahead,
meme me.

3679
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:42,490
And the first picture is him saying 
happy Monday,

3680
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:43,150
you know,
like this.

3681
02:45:43,151 --> 02:45:45,100
And then just,
it was a rape fest,

3682
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:49,810
like everything was raped this and 
brophy's that and you know,

3683
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:54,870
Jello pudding and roof fees and gel 
putting in rape and fucking crazy idea.

3684
02:45:57,470 --> 02:45:59,440
They examples were my favorite because 
they're like,

3685
02:45:59,470 --> 02:46:00,790
look,
you could make memes like this,

3686
02:46:00,791 --> 02:46:01,360
like,
hey,

3687
02:46:01,361 --> 02:46:06,361
nice hat.
And it just seems like a bill cosby 

3688
02:46:06,361 --> 02:46:06,361
holding his hat when you see like the 
ones that the people made was like,

3689
02:46:06,361 --> 02:46:08,920
Hey,
this is your dad or your mom,

3690
02:46:08,921 --> 02:46:12,560
or something like that.
It went from zero to rape in about eight

3691
02:46:12,561 --> 02:46:13,160
seconds.
Well,

3692
02:46:13,161 --> 02:46:18,161
what's interesting is there's the 
conspiracy is that anybody who's smart 

3693
02:46:18,161 --> 02:46:22,040
enough to construct a website is going 
to be like in tune with the Internet.

3694
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:27,260
Yeah.
Anybody who's working for him and he's 

3695
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:27,260
making websites,
that fucking person.

3696
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:27,620
I don't want to throw this person under 
the bus,

3697
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:31,260
but that person has to know what the 
fuck is going to happen.

3698
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:36,340
Very attuned to the Internet.
You put a meme generator up after the 

3699
02:46:36,340 --> 02:46:38,660
Hannibal burress video comes out and 
after all these people are talking about

3700
02:46:38,661 --> 02:46:43,661
it,
you got to know that they're going to 

3701
02:46:43,661 --> 02:46:43,661
meet him some awful shit.
Yeah.

3702
02:46:43,661 --> 02:46:46,070
This is the Internet.
People do all kinds of vicious things.

3703
02:46:46,170 --> 02:46:51,170
Spatially.
Anything's too funny and vicious at the 

3704
02:46:51,170 --> 02:46:54,131
same.
Especially when they get the green 

3705
02:46:54,131 --> 02:46:54,131
light.
Oh yeah.

3706
02:46:54,131 --> 02:46:54,131
If you're a drugging rapist,
all bets are off,

3707
02:46:54,131 --> 02:46:55,070
right?
Yeah.

3708
02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:59,780
But it's Cosby cosby.
It's crazy.

3709
02:46:59,781 --> 02:47:02,780
Yeah.
This is a weird almost epilogue.

3710
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:05,930
I don't want to say his career's over,
but it's a weird,

3711
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:09,890
he said such a long career.
This is a weird thing to be happening at

3712
02:47:09,891 --> 02:47:10,550
the last minute.

3713
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:16,000
It's not just the last minute.
It was clear the last minute of his 

3714
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:16,000
life.
Yeah.

3715
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,551
And if it was only like dementia and he 
was doing things recently and you get 

3716
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:19,640
attributed to like,
well there's something wrong with them,

3717
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:24,880
but then these people coming out with 
the stories that he's been doing this 

3718
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:24,880
since the seventies.
Yeah.

3719
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:26,390
And as late as 2004.
So after the cosby show.

3720
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:31,160
Damn Damn.
What is it,

3721
02:47:31,161 --> 02:47:36,161
man?
That goes on in a person's brain that 

3722
02:47:36,161 --> 02:47:39,881
makes them completely disconnect from 
humanity that makes them just be able 

3723
02:47:39,881 --> 02:47:43,931
to.
Fame can get you their candidate fame 

3724
02:47:43,931 --> 02:47:43,931
and money.
Can you think that's it?

3725
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,330
That's all it takes.
No.

3726
02:47:45,370 --> 02:47:48,140
Drugging women and raping them.
No,

3727
02:47:48,141 --> 02:47:53,060
but I think it can help you feel like 
you're above the law or you're entitled.

3728
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:54,500
Yeah,
I think it can,

3729
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:56,840
but I don't know for sure.
Rich privilege.

3730
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:59,470
Yeah.
Black privilege.

3731
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:02,500
Now I can't say that Black Gypsy 
privilege.

3732
02:48:02,501 --> 02:48:03,380
No,
you can't say that.

3733
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:05,480
Can't say any of those things you just 
said.

3734
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:09,590
Giving famous.
Kind of make you go a little crazy.

3735
02:48:09,591 --> 02:48:14,591
Too famous too.
Definitely can make you go crazy and 

3736
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:14,660
famous can definitely make you think 
you're different from other people.

3737
02:48:14,690 --> 02:48:16,670
Especially if you get fame when you're 
young.

3738
02:48:16,671 --> 02:48:21,671
I think when you live like all 
throughout your puberty and adulthood,

3739
02:48:21,970 --> 02:48:22,580
you're,
you're,

3740
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:24,260
everywhere you go.
People Kissing your ass.

3741
02:48:24,410 --> 02:48:29,410
Your idea of how you interact with 
people is you will literally think of 

3742
02:48:29,410 --> 02:48:29,850
yourself as being like royalty or 
something.

3743
02:48:29,890 --> 02:48:31,820
Right?
Can't there be a lot of suppressed anger

3744
02:48:31,850 --> 02:48:34,700
with someone like bill cosby too.
I mean he,

3745
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:37,850
he had to um,
be a very like,

3746
02:48:37,851 --> 02:48:42,851
friendly black entertainer for like a 
lot of white audiences even though 

3747
02:48:42,851 --> 02:48:43,520
probably a lot of the venues he was 
playing,

3748
02:48:43,521 --> 02:48:45,620
they wouldn't even let him go in the 
dressing room and shit.

3749
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:50,890
Like there could be a lot of suppressed 
anger from someone that had to go 

3750
02:48:50,890 --> 02:48:51,530
through something like that.
That's possible.

3751
02:48:51,590 --> 02:48:54,080
But I mean,
since the 19 eighties,

3752
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:55,790
yeah,
yeah.

3753
02:48:55,820 --> 02:48:59,030
It's like you've got to feel like that's
a long time to harbor a grudge.

3754
02:48:59,150 --> 02:49:00,800
Yeah.
But 34,

3755
02:49:00,830 --> 02:49:05,140
35 years of like undeniable success.
Yeah.

3756
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:10,540
I mean,
how many years has he been super 

3757
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:10,540
successful for?

3758
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:10,890
Oh,
I'd say since at least the seventies.

3759
02:49:10,891 --> 02:49:14,010
Probably the sixties and all throughout 
the eighties.

3760
02:49:14,011 --> 02:49:19,011
When I was a kid,
we played that Noah's ark thing like 

3761
02:49:19,011 --> 02:49:20,100
Noah and talking to God.
We played that when I was a little kid.

3762
02:49:20,101 --> 02:49:21,820
Yeah.
You know Noah,

3763
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:27,940
what God right.
That was.

3764
02:49:28,670 --> 02:49:33,670
That was a great bit.
That was a great bit and we played that 

3765
02:49:33,670 --> 02:49:34,410
on a record.
You're like a fucking album.

3766
02:49:36,410 --> 02:49:38,340
We'd sit there with the headphones on 
and listen to that.

3767
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:43,490
Yeah.
That guy just doesn't seem right that 

3768
02:49:43,490 --> 02:49:46,971
that guy was the rapist.
That's like the sweaters alone are 

3769
02:49:46,971 --> 02:49:48,300
enough to make you think that's not a 
rapist.

3770
02:49:48,330 --> 02:49:53,330
You know?
One thing that kind of leads me in that 

3771
02:49:53,330 --> 02:49:56,061
direction besides all the obvious,
is that he always into like people being

3772
02:49:56,701 --> 02:50:01,701
clean and always into like yelling at 
comics for using dirty word pressing.

3773
02:50:02,670 --> 02:50:04,740
Do you remember like the whole Eddie 
Murphy thing?

3774
02:50:04,830 --> 02:50:05,820
Yeah.
I called up,

3775
02:50:05,821 --> 02:50:08,730
Richard just said I have a coconut smile
and shut the fuck up.

3776
02:50:09,030 --> 02:50:10,230
You know.
Did,

3777
02:50:10,410 --> 02:50:15,410
did the audience laugh?
Did you get paid to have a coconut smile

3778
02:50:16,561 --> 02:50:21,561
and shut the fuck up?
You mean that was Richard Pryor given 

3779
02:50:21,561 --> 02:50:23,100
Eddie Murphy advice in which apparently 
was a real conversation.

3780
02:50:23,110 --> 02:50:24,720
The next time he calls,
tell him I said,

3781
02:50:24,721 --> 02:50:25,040
suck

3782
02:50:31,780 --> 02:50:34,000
you gotta think like if a comic called 
you,

3783
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:39,260
you know,
like say if like Jerry Seinfeld called 

3784
02:50:39,260 --> 02:50:40,090
you up and said,
listen,

3785
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:41,950
you're very funny.
Yeah.

3786
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:44,140
All you're doing is wrong.
You know,

3787
02:50:44,141 --> 02:50:47,800
you're always seeing you out there on 
stage and talking about your Dick.

3788
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:48,910
Right.
Stopped doing it.

3789
02:50:49,270 --> 02:50:51,370
You're making white America look bad.
Right?

3790
02:50:51,790 --> 02:50:54,100
Can you imagine if someone came up to 
you and was like,

3791
02:50:54,250 --> 02:50:56,170
I can't imagine.
And I think,

3792
02:50:56,171 --> 02:51:00,040
I think Eddie was like kind of confused 
now that you're doing this to me.

3793
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:01,440
He was like,
his,

3794
02:51:01,640 --> 02:51:03,640
is he right?
I don't know if he's right or not.

3795
02:51:03,641 --> 02:51:06,160
Let me call Richard Skinner you to stop 
swearing.

3796
02:51:06,170 --> 02:51:11,170
Mediamath Eddie Murphy back then was um,
so far like during delirious when he 

3797
02:51:12,011 --> 02:51:15,040
would go on stage with that fucking 
leather suit on and shit.

3798
02:51:15,041 --> 02:51:16,870
And Oh my God,
so funny man.

3799
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:20,200
He was like the original arena comic,
you know,

3800
02:51:20,201 --> 02:51:25,201
he was doing back then and to get a call
from bill cosby telling you to stop 

3801
02:51:27,161 --> 02:51:27,820
being dirty.

3802
02:51:28,060 --> 02:51:33,060
I think there's a little jealousy in 
there and I think there's a little bit 

3803
02:51:33,060 --> 02:51:33,060
of,
oh,

3804
02:51:33,060 --> 02:51:34,210
things are changing.
I better try to slow them down part.

3805
02:51:34,990 --> 02:51:39,150
Or he had this idea in his head that was
just immobile.

3806
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:41,560
She's like,
dirty is bad and eat.

3807
02:51:42,020 --> 02:51:47,020
There's so many people that still think 
that like that's an easy way out or 

3808
02:51:47,020 --> 02:51:47,020
something.
It's like,

3809
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:50,140
it's like saying rock and rock and roll 
music is not,

3810
02:51:50,350 --> 02:51:55,350
it's not the way to go in all the drums 
and heavy bass and classical music is 

3811
02:51:55,350 --> 02:51:57,400
where it's at now.
Classical music,

3812
02:51:57,730 --> 02:52:00,430
classical music,
dirty comedy is comedy.

3813
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:02,880
So it's like there's this kind of comedy
and those,

3814
02:52:02,890 --> 02:52:07,890
that kind of comedy.
This is comedy that's clean but fucking 

3815
02:52:07,890 --> 02:52:07,960
hilarious.
Like Hedberg,

3816
02:52:08,110 --> 02:52:09,670
Mitch Hedberg,
squeaky clean.

3817
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:14,560
Almost all of his jokes were clean,
still unbelievably fucking hilarious.

3818
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:20,370
So funny.
And then there's Joey Diaz who's never 

3819
02:52:20,370 --> 02:52:23,461
done a clean set ever in his life and he
makes me laugh harder than any person 

3820
02:52:23,461 --> 02:52:24,460
that's ever walked the face of the 
world.

3821
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:26,740
I know.
It's just comedy,

3822
02:52:26,741 --> 02:52:27,530
man.
Yeah.

3823
02:52:28,510 --> 02:52:30,310
So if a guy like bill crosby calls you 
up,

3824
02:52:31,300 --> 02:52:32,700
fucks with you like that.
Yeah.

3825
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,360
I don't know.
Meanwhile it was a chick tied to his bed

3826
02:52:37,640 --> 02:52:42,640
and he's talking to Eddie Murphy.
You hear in the background mark,

3827
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:45,820
good to you later.
Deb.

3828
02:52:45,821 --> 02:52:48,650
Barb it up.
Jello pudding.

3829
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:52,390
Well,
didn't he?

3830
02:52:52,391 --> 02:52:56,380
By the little rascals.
He bought the little rascals and stopped

3831
02:52:56,381 --> 02:52:58,840
it from ever being distributed because 
it was so racist.

3832
02:52:59,570 --> 02:53:01,430
That's cool.
Didn't Michael Jackson do something like

3833
02:53:01,431 --> 02:53:03,530
that?
Also wasn't little rascals,

3834
02:53:03,531 --> 02:53:07,370
but Michael Jackson did something very 
similar where he bought good times,

3835
02:53:07,371 --> 02:53:08,630
right?
Was it good times?

3836
02:53:08,690 --> 02:53:09,560
No,
I don't think so.

3837
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:15,010
I think you're thinking of the Beatles.
He bought the Beatles music,

3838
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:20,300
the Beatles music.
You're just butchering history and then 

3839
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:20,300
you put it in a nike commercial.
Do you remember that?

3840
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:21,220
Okay.
Snipes.

3841
02:53:21,250 --> 02:53:23,920
It might be a snopes,
rather it says it might not be true.

3842
02:53:23,921 --> 02:53:25,530
It's false.
Oh,

3843
02:53:25,531 --> 02:53:28,450
okay.
The bill cosby bought the rights,

3844
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:33,460
the little,
the little rascals or our gang comedies 

3845
02:53:33,460 --> 02:53:35,770
or to keep them off television because 
they depict racial stereotypes,

3846
02:53:35,771 --> 02:53:37,660
false spanky,
Alfalfa,

3847
02:53:37,661 --> 02:53:38,620
buckwheat,
Darla,

3848
02:53:38,621 --> 02:53:43,621
just a few of the easily recognizable 
names that were found were fond part of 

3849
02:53:43,621 --> 02:53:45,460
the childhoods of generations of kids.
What the fuck?

3850
02:53:45,461 --> 02:53:47,800
Why aren't they on TV?
In 1989,

3851
02:53:47,810 --> 02:53:52,810
the began circulating the entertainer.
Bill cosby had bought up the rights a 

3852
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:54,340
little rascals,
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.

3853
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:56,350
Nothing to do with it.
Of course,

3854
02:53:56,351 --> 02:54:01,351
king world productions has owned and 
licensed the rights to little rascals 

3855
02:54:01,351 --> 02:54:04,921
for over 30 years.
This series has been syndicated 

3856
02:54:04,921 --> 02:54:06,970
television many times in the video 
rights to some episodes were licensed to

3857
02:54:06,971 --> 02:54:08,950
cabin fever entertainment.
Nineteen 97.

3858
02:54:08,951 --> 02:54:12,580
So bill cosby has never owned any part 
of the right to little rascals.

3859
02:54:14,660 --> 02:54:16,630
Yeah.
So who the fuck owns that shit?

3860
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:20,680
Cosby was one of the prominent names who
campaign to pressure CBS,

3861
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:25,540
do withdrawing Amos and andy from 
syndication back in the 19 sixties.

3862
02:54:25,570 --> 02:54:27,430
My mom loved that show.
Amos and Andy,

3863
02:54:28,780 --> 02:54:29,560
did she,
uh,

3864
02:54:29,690 --> 02:54:31,110
did she yell racial?

3865
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:32,410
No,
no,

3866
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:37,460
there was,
there wasn't a lot of racism in the 

3867
02:54:37,460 --> 02:54:37,460
house,
but to facts name the cat,

3868
02:54:37,460 --> 02:54:40,881
sambo and uh,
said she liked Amos and Andy and even 

3869
02:54:40,881 --> 02:54:41,780
used to do the voice.
Where'd you grow up?

3870
02:54:42,170 --> 02:54:45,060
And I,
I grew up in southern Maryland but she's

3871
02:54:45,061 --> 02:54:47,010
from New Jersey and that was like,
I swear to God,

3872
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:49,080
these things I'm bringing it up,
make it sound crazy.

3873
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:54,150
But these are like two isolated 
incidences that never really added up to

3874
02:54:54,151 --> 02:54:56,220
much.
But I remember them because there was so

3875
02:54:56,221 --> 02:54:59,430
weird and out of place in my household.
What made you become a comic?

3876
02:54:59,580 --> 02:55:01,250
What went wrong?
Uh,

3877
02:55:01,251 --> 02:55:02,160
I dunno,
I just,

3878
02:55:02,161 --> 02:55:07,000
whenever I was school I always had smart
shit to say.

3879
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:09,460
Just popped into my head and I had to 
say it like smart.

3880
02:55:09,470 --> 02:55:10,830
I wanted the attention,
yes.

3881
02:55:10,831 --> 02:55:15,831
Smart as shit.
And I liked the attention and it seemed 

3882
02:55:15,831 --> 02:55:18,971
like the easiest way to get attention 
and it seemed like something that was 

3883
02:55:18,971 --> 02:55:19,510
good at.
And listen,

3884
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:22,400
I had an instinct not to be a part of 
the group for some reason.

3885
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:25,460
I don't know why,
but it wasn't about my mom like Amos and

3886
02:55:25,461 --> 02:55:28,600
Andy.
I don't think you're funny motherfucker,

3887
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:29,680
