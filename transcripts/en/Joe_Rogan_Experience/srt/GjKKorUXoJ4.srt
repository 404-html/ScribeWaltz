1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,150
People steal everything.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,041
Yeah.

4
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,250
This is Duncan Trussell.

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,431
Yeah,

6
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,220
I saw that on fucking unbelievable.

7
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,450
Joey's on the far right.

8
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,620
That's insane that we were so cute.

9
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,440
I got the sexy lucky seven.

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,381
Can you get it?

11
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,550
So just as whole body feels,

12
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,040
the chrome was 44 I was 44 was my uncle.

13
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,470
Lucky seven cause like that.

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,513
Wow.

15
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,563
That's so crazy.

16
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,580
Wow.

17
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,660
Look at you dude.

18
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,250
So how old are you in this picture?

19
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,270
1414 God damn Joe.

20
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:33,810
You cute.

21
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,770
You're cute as a button.

22
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,910
Look at David Ruiz.

23
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,350
Turn around and talking
to the microphones.

24
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,643
Can hear this too.

25
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,260
That kid right there on this screen
to that kid with the Afro was a very

26
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,130
interesting story.

27
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,290
This guy right here because we will,

28
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,490
we were horrible basketball
team at Mckinley.

29
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,353
Can you go full screen?

30
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,880
Moved in covers on the neighborhood.

31
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,660
Does it do the,

32
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,410
he could jump.

33
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,550
He was five foot eight but this kid
could fucking chump like Julia survey.

34
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,810
So he was Dominican.

35
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,070
His name was Louis Hernandez.

36
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,990
I'm from Jersey just playing that.

37
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,880
They just cut it short and
called him Louie the Nigga.

38
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,631
They said,

39
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,051
fuck it,

40
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,250
we don't care if he's Dominican.

41
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,570
We're not gonna even think about that.

42
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,530
We're just going,

43
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,890
this is David rule as they
called him that to his face too,

44
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,590
like Louise and did he get pissed?

45
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,230
Fuck you bitch.

46
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,064
And he was a tough kid.

47
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,620
He got manager when you
can tell it was like he,

48
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:21,510
I think he bit slap two or three people
that the best thing he did was we used

49
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,344
to do acid.

50
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,320
When we first started smoking
weed in the eighth grade,

51
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,730
we go behind the soccer field and north
Bergen and he let us blow smoke into his

52
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,420
afro and see the smoke come out of you.

53
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,333
How cool.

54
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
This was the crew.

55
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,880
So I know your mother
fuckers scroll down to the,

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,241
all right.

57
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:42,631
This kid,

58
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:42,980
he that,

59
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,813
no,

60
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,300
that kid dad was David Black.

61
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,770
We graduated together and I knew him
after the fact that one night he came into

62
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:49,201
Jo married,

63
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,034
it's like dog,

64
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,600
you gotta call you gotta give me a ride.

65
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,591
If he give me a ride,

66
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,490
I'll give you a rock guy.

67
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,333
We gave him a ride.

68
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,400
He gets out of the corner of Western Yoga.

69
00:01:56,401 --> 00:02:00,540
My three minutes later he comes running
back bleeding with his hair pulled and I

70
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:00,691
go,

71
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,460
what happened was I went to rob my sister.

72
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,900
I mean he was serious.

73
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:04,650
He had coke rocks,

74
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,483
but everybody,

75
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,270
I stunk of his fucking hat.

76
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:11,100
She caught him on the way out as he was
pulling out of the window and she just

77
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,311
took,

78
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,144
he was bleeding.

79
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
He rob is his sister

80
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,580
is 83 dog at three in the morning.

81
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,020
You asked me for a ride.

82
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,140
I got to do what I gotta
do you know how crazy.

83
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,490
That's fucking crazy show.

84
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,530
I wish you could do your own.

85
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,490
Stand by me.

86
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,080
My fucking God.

87
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,600
This is who is this?

88
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,660
Why is this headset small?

89
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,890
When I got this picture,

90
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,391
which one?

91
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,230
The Filipino kit.

92
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:41,310
Now this kind of left

93
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,970
a zillion and now his family owns a tow
truck company in northern New Jersey and

94
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:47,804
New York City.

95
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,410
If you get told his family
is the one that owns it,

96
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,293
I swear to God.

97
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,910
This is fucking crazy shit,

98
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,561
I believe.

99
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,040
Yeah,

100
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,880
it's fucking crazy,

101
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,843
man.

102
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,640
Somebody sent me this yesterday while
I was eating dinner and I almost had a

103
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,260
fucking heart attack of
friends and goes out.

104
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,810
What I found looking through yearbooks
and that's what I was noticing.

105
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,350
I was smoking dope then I was no innocent.

106
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,400
Then I was smoking dope.

107
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,230
I was finger bang and people,

108
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,140
you could still be
innocent and finger back.

109
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,530
Me and my mom at the house.

110
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:23,771
Yeah.

111
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:23,921
Yeah.

112
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,640
I was okay.

113
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,180
I was okay.

114
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,050
I wasn't crazy.

115
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,590
Then I smoked my first
refer when I was 15.

116
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,330
I banked it from my dad and uh,

117
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
I had no idea how strong it was and we
rolled a joint and me and my friend Josh

118
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,510
and this girl that I was dating,

119
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,340
we smoke this shit and we smoked
way too much for 15 year olds,

120
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:46,174
whatever we were.

121
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,490
And we wound up waking up in
various parts of the house,

122
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,480
like blank,

123
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,673
like blink.

124
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,210
It's never happened to me before,

125
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,051
but like blank.

126
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,400
All of a sudden I'd be on the couch,

127
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,000
blink.

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,180
All of a sudden I'd be in front of the
frigerator like blink all the time in

129
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,710
between the blanks missing.

130
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,490
Wow.

131
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,470
Just arriving places like waking up
in a bedroom with short term memory,

132
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,020
not just no short term memory.

133
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,050
It's like my tape gets cut like the,

134
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,321
the,

135
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,200
the events between
those two did not exist.

136
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,011
I get so high,

137
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,860
I had zero memory so I would,

138
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,743
what I would think it was,

139
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,001
it was,

140
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,650
I got so high that I would say,

141
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,071
you know what,

142
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,370
I need to just get into the kitchen and
maybe get something to eat and maybe

143
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:32,371
it'll calm this down so my brain's
spools up that it's got to figure out to

144
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,330
remember to get to the kitchen to eat.

145
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,200
Cause I'm that high.

146
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,820
And then in between,

147
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,601
during the walking,

148
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:38,590
I forget everything.

149
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,641
So then boom,

150
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,590
all of a sudden I wake up and I'm
in front of the fridge or I go,

151
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,490
what the fuck?

152
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,240
And she was doing it to my girlfriend
at the time and my friend was doing it.

153
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,170
My friend Josh was doing it too.

154
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,890
We were all fucking,

155
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,601
it was,

156
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,090
it scared me off of weed for a long time.

157
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,610
Scared me off of weed for a long time.

158
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,280
I didn't smoke weed again
for several years after that.

159
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,920
The first time the hydro
brother don't get that design.

160
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,350
It's the second or third time
and then you like you're outside.

161
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,800
You really start to understand it.

162
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,900
You ended up at a bowling
alley by the chocolate milk.

163
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,210
That's why I went and ate.

164
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,670
We had French fries and chocolate milk.

165
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,480
Have you ever had that happen where you
felt like you woke up and replaces the

166
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:16,790
third?

167
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,690
I remember the first two or
three years I just smoked,

168
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,170
you know like don't get,

169
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,180
what are you doing on Friday night?

170
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:22,841
Nothing.

171
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:23,680
My Mom's leaving.

172
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,161
Perfect.

173
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,030
I'm going to call Joe.

174
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,010
Welcome over some weed on it all,

175
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:27,191
bro.

176
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,300
My brother found that last time
he was going to rat me out.

177
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:29,371
Oh,

178
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,560
I fucking with smoking me guard and
we'll go in and listen to pink Floyd the

179
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:32,830
wall.

180
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,080
I mean that's not even though
the wall wasn't even out yet.

181
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,190
We listen to the Beatles,

182
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,024
sergeant pepper,

183
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,021
but that's it.

184
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,000
Like we get together and rolled a joint.

185
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,661
In those days.

186
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,980
I used to have a glass.

187
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,530
You went to East West,

188
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,890
his head shop and there was a tube and
the head was like a flute with this open,

189
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,760
but it had a hole and you're putting a
joint in it and you put your finger at

190
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,360
the end.

191
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,260
Joe Light it and you'd like to join
and I stuck it in and I'd hold it back.

192
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,153
Then it was like that's,

193
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,020
that was your carburetor when
you smoked one of those you got,

194
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,800
sorry.

195
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,550
That's it.

196
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,950
And then we'd sit around
and we'd all have money,

197
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:04,281
you know,

198
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:04,971
like what do you want to do?

199
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,791
How much you got Donald?

200
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,111
A quarter.

201
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:06,531
What do you got?

202
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
Three daughters.

203
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,001
I got full.

204
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:08,834
Let's go to the mix.

205
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,820
And you walk to the pizza place member.

206
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,181
You know what?

207
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,011
You just talked.

208
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:12,844
Stupidity.

209
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,400
You look at each other.

210
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,801
Do I look,

211
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,960
I know you think nick
will say I'm high now.

212
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,681
He's on on my,

213
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,780
I come on by the guy and
I know bill [inaudible].

214
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,070
It was a fucking,

215
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,061
it was tremendous.

216
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,160
They know how to get in the house
and walked past your mother.

217
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,090
Yes.

218
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,190
And that was the night your mother
decided to make cookies so that you had to

219
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,100
look and talk to her,

220
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,973
whatever.

221
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,080
That's why you smoke pot dog,

222
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,300
because it brought
something different to you.

223
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:38,300
Life has 13 it made
you feel fucking alive.

224
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,480
[inaudible]

225
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,510
you're a fucking human being.
