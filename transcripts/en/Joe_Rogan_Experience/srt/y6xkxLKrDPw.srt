00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,770
Hello Freak pitches of
the Internet of the world.

Who chose cross?
Yes.

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,650
Okay.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,980
It's trying to get used to speak in
Mexican. Might have to go there soon.

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,980
David Seaman. I'm going to have
to evacuate to safer plasters.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,920
I'd have to like where the drug wars,
it's hottest.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,930
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

8
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:32,931
squarespace.com if you go to
squarespace.com forward slash Joe,

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,510
you could try Squarespace
with no credit card needed.

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,720
Just try it out and start
building a website. Oh, website's.

11
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:44,010
So that's what's based basis about yes,
he had fucks you listening.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,030
If you've never built a website before,
it can be a daunting task.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,060
Looking at various pieces of software
that allow you to create your own websites

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,190
like [inaudible] or, I don't know,
I, it's, it's intimidating shit,

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,380
but the way Squarespace has it set up,

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,120
even a Mo Ron like me could
make a website very easily.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,650
Brian is made about 60 of them
while the shows have been going on.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,420
It's um, it's super sweet,
super sweet and easy to do.

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,610
Easy to set up an online store as well.
So you can, if you want to sell some shit,

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:22,050
you can be up and running like literally
in moments. It's, it's excellent.

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,610
You can choose your own custom images and
content and they uh, if you need help,

22
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,960
they have 24,
seven support,

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,520
super fast email support and
live online chat support. Um,

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,120
if you've never been there before and
thinking about hiring someone to check out

25
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,880
a website or to make you a bet website,

26
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:42,510
rather go check it out because you could
probably make one yourself that you

27
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,470
would really enjoy and give you
a little sense of satisfaction.

28
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:51,260
It's not hard to do anymore. It's
very intuitive. Um, uh, it's, it's uh,

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,000
like you can get a professional looking
website. They're not clunky though.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,890
Never those Geo cities sites, you make
your own site and looked like dog shit.

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,723
No matter what you did.

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,180
This looks like a fucking awesome website
that someone would pay an ass load of

33
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,014
money to make.

34
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,310
So if you go use the code
name Joe and the number six,

35
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,500
all one word Joe,
number six,

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,850
and you will save 10% off your
first purchases on new accounts,

37
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,070
including monthly and annual plans.

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,540
So that's squarespace.com forward slash
Joe and again you can just try it out.

39
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,231
You don't have to,

40
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,410
you don't have to enter in your
credit card information to to use it.

41
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,250
You could just try it out for free and
then if you choose to use it, all right,

42
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,650
you know what I'm going to,
this is a fucking bad ass website.

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,970
Then you can go live with it. Use
a code. Joe Six save some cash.

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,550
Friend has a tanning company and she
just used it the other day and it was

45
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:43,360
literally like 10 minutes. She just had
all, all she wanted was her phone number,

46
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,690
her address where the people can contact
her and her services and she just like

47
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,120
typed it out and watched her do it
and it was like Bam chatted. I know.

48
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,020
It's amazing.
So ridiculous.

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,620
Well, we're happy that their sponsors
were also brought to you by legal zoom.

50
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,460
That's one of the newer sponsors and a
what I like about legal zoom besides what

51
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:59,620
David just told me,

52
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,080
that scared the shit out of me.
But uh,

53
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,520
what I really like about legal zoom
is that it's, it's really like,

54
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,640
it's expensive to go to a fucking lawyer
if you have a real problem you need to

55
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,070
deal with. If you have, um, you know,
anything business that you need to do,

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,990
you can start an LLC.
You could do it on legal zoom.

57
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,270
You can incorporate or
form an LLC for 99 bucks.

58
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,230
Researched that before you do it.
Yeah. Research. Oh, well, first of all,

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,740
legal zoom wants to state very
clearly that they're not a law firm.

60
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,770
They provide self help services at your
specific direction and they can also

61
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,820
connect you with an independent attorney
if you need additional guidance.

62
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,020
So check out legal zoom.com
and see what that's all about.

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,280
And use the code name,

64
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:50,281
Rogan in the referral box at checkout
and save yourself some cash if you have

65
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,920
any legal issues, whether
you want to, you know,

66
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,050
make a will for yourself or whether you,
uh, you know, when you want to form a, an,

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,620
an LLC or anything along those lines,
they check it out. They can do a lot,

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,560
a lot of stuff that you would normally
think that you would have to go to an

69
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,360
attorney for.
A,

70
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:11,620
they've helped over 2 million
Americans in the past 12 years.

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
So 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom. That's America. Fuck yeah. Use Them.

72
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:20,350
And they, you know, they send you like
a, uh, a big book and like if they,

73
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,850
I got a stamp with my corporation
on it and it's really cool.

74
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,350
That's bad ass using it.

75
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,430
What does it do they ask you what you
planning on doing with death squad as an

76
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,400
incorporation? How I think just, you know,

77
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,530
they make it go really crazy
straight to home that yeah.

78
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,150
That it goes straight
to homeland security.

79
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,050
They're looking right up your
ass son. It's really easy.
Yeah. So go check it out.

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,170
Legal zoom.com and use
the code name Brogan.

81
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,190
We're also brought to you by on
and.com. That's o, n n. I. T.

82
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,830
If you have never been and
you don't know what it is,

83
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,950
the way to describe it best,

84
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:56,380
it's probably a human
optimization site that's a,

85
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,860
that's how we like to think of it.
We tried to sell you shit that is uh,

86
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,310
the best available as far as strength
and conditioning equipment as far as

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,620
nutritional supplements,
like hemp protein powder,

88
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:13,480
like we sell Blendtec blenders and
kettle bells and all the different things

89
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:17,800
that, uh, I think are really beneficial
for health, for physical fitness.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,550
And uh, we have, uh,

91
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:23,290
a lot of great endorsements are people
who try the stuff and really enjoy it.

92
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,830
What's going on in their
masturbating? I Dunno, it says MMA,

93
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:29,570
but that doesn't look like
masturbation associated.

94
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,900
So he's doing something really wrong.
Yeah,

95
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,520
it was like a metal that piece in there
and he doesn't seem like it's working

96
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:34,630
out.

97
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,510
We're doing the fusing choice out of
all the pictures that someone could have

98
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,530
put there. Maybe that's an
accident. Maybe the webmasters,

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,850
it'd be in a silly bitch cause that looks
like a screaming all he's coming. Yeah,

100
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,220
exactly. There's another man's holding
his hand. It looks like what is,

101
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,170
look that that's supposed to be an
arm bar. That's just ridiculous.

102
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,670
Why is it so subtly?

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,030
Like all the shadows around the
cock and balls and all those spots.

104
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,310
It's like to give you a sense of mystery.
What's he in a basement also? Yeah.

105
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:02,630
Why is he in the base? Mary homoerotic
with a rusty pipe behind them. Get it. Oh,

106
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,490
how dare they. How dare they. But other
than that on, it's got a lot of cool shit.

107
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,200
If you, uh, use a code name Brogan, you
will save 10% off any and all supplements.

108
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,790
Go, uh, buy some shit. Check
it out or not. Whatever.

109
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,610
You're a grown person.
Hopefully if you're not a grown person,

110
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,460
someone needs to get you the fuck
away from this recording right now.

111
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,130
Cause you're not ready for this.
But if you are a grown person,

112
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,410
do whatever you want to
do. Bitch, you got it.

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,490
But if you look at for medicine balls
are looking to buy some battle ropes.

114
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,680
Go get that shit.
It's holding greats greening.

115
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,520
And what does that, what does it like
a great, no, I think that's a barbell.

116
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,070
It's like she ain't really fast.

117
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:45,680
It's a glory hole and he's sticking his
hand through it and it's like sparks

118
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,690
rainbows coming in his hands.
Okay, that's it. Good night.

119
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,190
Go to [inaudible] dot com use the code
name Rogan and save 10% off any and all

120
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:59,180
supplements. Brian, it's good
to see you again buddy. Lost,

121
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,670
lost out in the woods. Hit
the hit the music, my friend.

122
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,180
Well good experience

123
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,770
Joe Rogan podcast.

124
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,900
I've been working like
seven days in a row. Really?
Totally bewildered. Excuse me.

125
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,440
Cause you said like, like, Hey, I'm in New
York. Hey, I'm in Vegas. I'm like, what?

126
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,150
Wait, what's going on here? Working
like a motherfucker. Dude, that's crazy.

127
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:35,700
I'm trying to get this show done by, uh,
which we, we started here in July 16th.

128
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,360
How many episodes? Everything we have.
Well, is there a conglomeration of him?

129
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,510
You know, so like we'll do
a one part of one episode,

130
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:45,300
one part of the day and then
another part of another episode,

131
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,450
another part of the day, it's, they're
not necessarily like we do one episode,

132
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:50,280
then we're done and then
we move onto another one.

133
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,560
We're filming like all six
of them at the same time.

134
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:55,560
So we're trying to smush everything
together. It's been very interesting.

135
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,290
But I just got back from the global
future 2045 conference in New York where I

136
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:05,820
got to meet a Aubrey de Grey and all
these life extension people in Doctor Amit

137
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,930
Goswami that had been on our podcast.

138
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,350
He was there as well and a
fascinating fucking shit.

139
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:15,351
So you got that where you look at
something like global future 2045 where

140
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:20,550
there's all these super geniuses trying
to figure out what the future of human

141
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:23,310
life is going to be like and whether
or not we'll be able to extend life,

142
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,580
download consciousness into
computers and all this crazy shit.

143
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,030
And then at the same time,
David Seaman,

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,640
he got a lot of fuckery going on,
man.

145
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:36,750
We're starting to learn how
much surveillance is being,

146
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,040
what's the word launched on the
American public on a daily basis.

147
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,580
I just want to use the end of this one.
I feel like every time I come here,

148
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:48,060
I have this hardcore doom and
gloom and Glen stuff to share.

149
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,080
And you guys are such a positive group
in general. So yeah, it's, it's a,

150
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:56,780
it's fucking scary what's going on. It's
hard not to take, well, I think it's,

151
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,400
it seems to have woken a lot of people up.

152
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,850
This is all kind of share that Alex
Jones would tell people about in like,

153
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,880
you know, 1990 [inaudible] Alex is
running around screaming all this shit.

154
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,710
And everybody was like, what? No one's
checking your email. But you know,

155
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,250
no one's done.
But it's slowly but surely.

156
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,860
It seems to be almost,

157
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,750
it seems to be almost inevitable that
you're going to get your email look that

158
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,953
scary.

159
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,560
Obama's over in Europe
right now and in Germany,

160
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,230
they were really upset about
these recent revelations.

161
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,690
And in Berlin he gives a speech saying,
uh, you know, now let me be clear.

162
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,750
No one's reading through
ordinary citizens emails.

163
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,690
We're not rifling through ordinary
people's emails. And you know,

164
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:47,490
he says this on international TV and
either doesn't read the news or like does

165
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:51,390
not understand what his own administration
is doing because that is what that

166
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,470
program does, which is why it caused
such an uproar. And similarly,

167
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,610
a 12 days ago, he said on national
TV in the u s when this first broke,

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,480
he said, uh, no one's
listening to your phone calls.

169
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,340
That's not what this program is about.

170
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,690
And that's the exact quote that people
can look up. And the, uh, you know,

171
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:14,691
that leaked court order from Verizon
business services is proof that actually,

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,870
uh, all of our phone calls are being
looked at and they say, just the Metadata,

173
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,740
which means who you're calling,
who's calling you those phone numbers.

174
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,040
Also the duration of the
call and your location.

175
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,690
Like not even just what
building we're in right now,

176
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,990
but what floor of the building we're on.
That's how accurate this shit is.

177
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,620
And they have this on everybody.
And just based on that metadata alone,

178
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,950
I could tell, you know, maybe not me,

179
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,810
but an actual trained analyst
could immediately tell if
you're having an affair,

180
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,130
if you sought help for
depression or anxiety by
calling a psychiatrist's office,

181
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,410
uh,
if you're having financial problems,

182
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,630
you're contacting tax
consultants and all this shit.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,790
So within a few minutes
from your metadata,

184
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,410
they know far more about your life then
the government possibly should know,

185
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,680
especially if you have nothing to hide,
then you're not doing anything wrong.

186
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,360
It's just shocking that it was all going
on and no one was speaking out about it

187
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,130
until this one dude.

188
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,570
And he comes out with it
and now he's on the run.

189
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,810
He's hiding. I was looking on the, the
front of a USA Today and it was in my, uh,

190
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,250
hotel and it said like some,
you know,

191
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:24,080
65% of Americans think Edward
Snowden should be put on trial.

192
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,391
Actually,

193
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:28,570
the American people I think had been
pretty good about knowing that they're

194
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:29,950
being bullshitted right now.

195
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,130
Like it's something like two thirds want
to see a congressional investigation

196
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,690
not into stolen, but into these programs.
And if they're targeting Americans.

197
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,980
And, uh, one, uh,

198
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,520
one thing I want to put out here before
I forgot about it is we keep the debate

199
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,380
is like, well, should
we do this to Americans?

200
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,370
And it's a given at this point
that we are absolutely 100%,

201
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:50,500
no doubt about it doing
this to people in Europe.

202
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,370
People in Asia are supposed to
trading, responding, spying on them.

203
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,850
And these are still human beings
too. I mean, they're not US citizens,

204
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,570
but should ordinary people who have
no links to radicalism or terrorism,

205
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,270
should they have their personal stuff
rifled through by somebody who is, uh,

206
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,800
an analyst at the NSA,
basically a government employee.

207
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,430
These aren't people who have taken years
of training and they've lost their ego

208
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,600
and some kind of like a razzle ghoul
ceremony, like in a dark night, you know,

209
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:21,100
they don't train on the ice and, uh,
lose themselves and some greater cause.

210
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:24,070
They're just people who saw a fucking
newspaper advertisement and applied for

211
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:27,640
this job at Fort Meade and now they
have access to an unbelievable amount of

212
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:32,410
information about ordinary people
all over the world. That's crazy.

213
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,160
So it's not just metadata.
The are absolute emails.

214
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,490
There's two theories and I'll share both
of them and you can decide which one's

215
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,090
true.

216
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,290
So we know with 100% certainty that
they are looking at metadata of innocent

217
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,380
people. It appears to be all phone
records within the United States.

218
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,580
And if they're doing that here,

219
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,490
you can assume that they're pretty much
doing it everywhere because that's what

220
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,090
the NSA does. They're not even supposed
to be doing this stuff on us soil, but uh,

221
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,630
are not supposed to be doing it unless
they have a specific foreign target

222
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,670
within the United States.
All of this stuff,

223
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,850
the NSA does made sense
back during the Cold War.

224
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,560
So if you'd have like a Soviet agent
come to the u s and you suspect them of

225
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:10,760
doing spy shit,
you want to wait in,

226
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,450
you wouldn't have a way to tap into
their phone calls while they're in the

227
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,750
United States. So it made sense to
do this kind of stuff back then.

228
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,900
It never made sense to turn
it in on American citizens.

229
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,170
And that's where seeing whistleblowers
now come out and say, this is wrong,

230
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,490
this is not the way this program
was set up, et cetera. And uh,

231
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,680
yeah,
so the two,

232
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,880
the two theories are definitely made a
data and then the actual contents of your

233
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,840
phone calls and emails
according to some people, uh,

234
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,270
is being logged and NSA servers,
no matter who you are,

235
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,090
you could be the most innocent
person out there who's never, uh,

236
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,840
never even smoked a joint or looked
at any kind of Alex Jones website.

237
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,530
And you're still having your emails and
phone calls logged on a server somewhere

238
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,910
and they're not accessed unless they
have reason to suspect you of a crime and

239
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:58,060
they get some kind of court approval
and then they access all your phone

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,910
conversations.
That's theory one and theory too,

241
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,890
is that they're actually
not recording everything.

242
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:05,170
They're just recording the
recording the metadata.

243
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,480
And if you're on their target list,

244
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,870
then they're recording all of your
phone calls and emails. But if not,

245
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,170
they're only looking at the metadata.
And what's so scary about theory too,

246
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:18,280
which is, you know, the more
conservative theory, it's not as uh,

247
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,170
not as frightening as the other theory.

248
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,750
What's fucked up about it is
that according to William Binney,

249
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,120
the other NSA whistleblower,
there are several of them.

250
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,560
The way that you get targeted is once
you're introduced to somebody else's

251
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:33,880
community, you're now added to the target
list. So I'll just give you an example.

252
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:37,480
In the past stuff had conversations with
journalists who am almost certain or

253
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:41,320
being uh, or on the NSA target list just
cause they cover really sensitive stuff.

254
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,700
So since I've had conversations
with them by email and by phone,

255
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,870
I'm now a part of their community
and I'm added to the target list,

256
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,610
which means that all my phone calls
being logged in a server somewhere,

257
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,850
the actual content. So if they need to,
they can listen to them in the future.

258
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,680
And by you talking to me right now,
that makes you a part of my community.

259
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,220
And now you're on the target list and
if you talk to somebody next week,

260
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,800
they're on the target list and
it just keeps going. And going.

261
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,460
And so there are millions of people
on this list. The whole world. Yeah.

262
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,060
I mean that becomes the whole world.
Well you look at the justifications,

263
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:15,260
they're using a completely absurd,

264
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,530
they say if your communications
are only us communications,

265
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,530
we are definitely not intercepting them.
But you know,

266
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,270
if you have a lot of followers on Twitter,

267
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,260
it's a hundred percent certain that you've
interacted with Twitter followers who

268
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,820
are not living in the United States.

269
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,520
If you've ever received an
email that's like a spam email,

270
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,910
it's almost certain that that did not
originate on a US server at originated

271
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,110
somewhere in Europe or Russia. Uh,
and you know, when you visit websites,

272
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,310
most of the shit you look at is not
based in the u s so whenever you do those

273
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,280
shit, you look at Boston
Baba, come on sign,

274
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,170
I'm on American websites all day.

275
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,570
Pornhub is American
from what I understand.

276
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:55,230
So can you like just forward your phone
number to like a home phone number and

277
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:58,440
then like direct your text messages
through a website that you know,

278
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,030
isn't recording or information.
Like,

279
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:04,680
is there some kind of hack that you can
hack yourself? Well, what tank phone,

280
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,000
what's so bad about this from
an economic perspective is, uh,

281
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,610
there are already companies that are
positioning themselves is where us free.

282
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:11,791
You know,

283
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,600
your data won't be stored in the U S it's
like we're infected now with this out

284
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,640
of control,
corrupt government and people.

285
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:20,370
And what sucks about that is we're
the ones who make this shit happen.

286
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:24,770
Like cloud storage, innovative stuff
like Facebook and Google, you know,

287
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,470
content companies like, uh, like
youtube and stitcher and all this stuff.

288
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:32,430
This is what we're good at as a country
and we export all around the world and

289
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:35,640
now we're like tainted goods
because you can't trust us anymore.

290
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,100
I've government is too crazy just for
the same reason that a lot of companies

291
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:40,740
don't want to do business in China
because it would mean, you know,

292
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:43,260
like buying off a lot of people
and dealing with a lot of bullshit.

293
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,760
Now the US is becoming a place where,
you know, great people, great innovation,

294
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,280
but the government is too
volatile and you can't trust it.

295
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,190
And that that's terrible because that
means that we're not going to be the ones

296
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,870
who pull ahead over the next 50 years.

297
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,400
It's so fucked up because if you
talk to people, uh, that, you know,

298
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:03,660
normal folks in America that will
exhibit some sort of patriotism,

299
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,410
they have an idea of what America
is like everyone's idea of America.

300
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:08,670
This is America's, you know, hey,

301
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,590
this is a truly free crunch country
where a person is not tied down by their

302
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:17,310
lineage. They can make something out of
themselves. A lot of success stories,

303
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,260
a nation of free thinking individuals.

304
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,340
We have all of these like positive things
that we attached to it. But God damn,

305
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:26,670
if we're not governed by a bunch
of paranoid fucking Weirdos

306
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,380
yeah.
And they wrap themselves in the flag.

307
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,550
I think most Americans are good people,
obviously, or I wouldn't be here.

308
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,240
And uh, it's not the people and
it's not the companies here.

309
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:41,040
It's the government has gone
beyond the bounds that were set up.

310
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,540
Isn't that what happens when,
like if you have a,

311
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,480
a paradigm that you've been operating
under and then all of a sudden that

312
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,600
paradigm just dissolving under you,
like,

313
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:55,380
like rising tide and you know
what's happening. So what do you do?

314
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,680
You tried to put a bunch of crazy
laws in place to try to stop it.

315
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,580
He tried to be able to check out and
you fucking put the fear of God and

316
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,190
everybody check out all their emails.
Look at all the Dick Pics,

317
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,540
look at all their phone calls.

318
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,280
They're making a three o'clock in
the morning when they're drunk.

319
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,340
Look at everything. Look at
everything. I got you bitch.

320
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:12,900
You better keep your fucking mouth shut.
We're going to keep running it this way.

321
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,420
Well, it's uh, what's crazy is the
director of the NSA, Keith Alexander,

322
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,520
a General Keith Alexander,
uh,

323
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,610
he was giving testimony before Congress
and I think this was either earlier

324
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,040
today or yesterday.
And at the end of his testimony,

325
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,470
he didn't realize that the
mic was still hot next to him.

326
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,260
And he leans over to one
of his aides and says,

327
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:31,120
I need to buy your boss a freaking beer,

328
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,470
talking about the FBI guys who were
testifying in support of this program.

329
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,460
And so, you know, at the end of the
day what he said, that's nothing wrong.

330
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:43,300
Of course, the FBI and the NSA collaborate
there. You know, that's what they do.

331
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:46,780
Their intelligence agencies and law
enforcement agents or the case, the FBI,

332
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:50,500
you know what I'm saying, or did
the same shit. And uh, so nothing,

333
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:52,240
he said there was wrong.
These,

334
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,840
that's actually shows that he's a human
being and it goes out to drink beer

335
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:59,280
every now and then. It isn't
this, you know, a computer. Uh,

336
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,580
so nothing you said was wrong,
but just that single line, uh,

337
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,920
that he didn't want the world
to hear in the world heard, uh,

338
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,910
has been analyzed to death online. It
hit the front page of Reddit. People are,

339
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,590
you know, in conspiracy land now. And
if you think like, you know, this guy,

340
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,340
he didn't want that line of
conversation to hit the wrong people.

341
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,800
What about every single text
message you've ever sent?

342
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,630
Every single website you've ever sent?
It's kind of, it's richly ironic, right?

343
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,100
It's showing that this is
not a good system. Even if
you have nothing to hide, uh,

344
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,650
maybe you don't want your future employer
to see every porn website you've been

345
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:33,310
to,

346
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,900
every medical condition you've looked up
and every deleted text message from the,

347
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,280
uh, you know, the woman you're seeing,

348
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,950
it's just not their fucking place
to see that in the first place.

349
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,580
And then why extend that power to a
government agent who is just somebody who

350
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:48,340
applied for a job and happens
to have a clean record?

351
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,540
That's all an NSA analyst is. Again,
they're not people who have, you know,

352
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,970
detached themselves from the ego and
they're driven only by love of country.

353
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,100
I would hope that's what
most of them are there for.

354
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,220
But we don't know that people are people.
And that's why we have a constitution.

355
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:03,040
That's why we have the bill of rights
is to prevent this from happening in the

356
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:03,820
first place.

357
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,860
This is very well put and um,

358
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,220
I think unfortunately the reality of our
times is that things are moving in the

359
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:16,930
direction of a complete elimination
of all boundaries between people and

360
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,930
information. I just don't know
if there's any way to stop it.

361
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:22,330
And when you find out
that the people with the,

362
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,420
you can't say like the
ability to like what,

363
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:28,780
what the government is doing,

364
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,400
they have to do and secretly in secrecy
because no one is going to allow it.

365
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,050
No one is going to say like,
yeah,

366
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:39,700
I fully support you listening to every
fucking email to stop the occasion.

367
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,280
Are you chewing ice? You motherfucker
stop the occasional tea. I mean,

368
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,050
think about how many terrorism,
how many terrorist,

369
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,370
how many people die of terrorism as
opposed to how many people died just from

370
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:53,320
drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.
Right?

371
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,750
The government doesn't try to ever
get you to stop doing those things,

372
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,930
but way more people die from them than
are ever going to probably got die from

373
00:20:58,931 --> 00:20:59,764
terrorism.

374
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,370
I mean 400,000 people every year die
from cigarettes and you never hear the

375
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,320
government talking about how
cigarettes are the enemy.

376
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,540
What they're doing is they're,

377
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,230
they're trying to keep people scared
and by trying to keep people scared,

378
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,790
they can continue to govern things
the way they're doing it. And the way.

379
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,860
So the way to be able to check out all
your email and keep everybody back on

380
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,220
their heels is to say,
we have to protect you from terrorism.

381
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,310
We're trying to stop terrorism
and the way to stop terrorism,

382
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:25,330
we just got to check everything.

383
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,520
You gotta you gotta look
at everybody's Dick Pic.

384
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,950
Yeah.
You got to look at it.

385
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:32,610
And then if we happen to find out along
the way that you're gay, you're gay,

386
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:33,510
and you're going to be,
oh,

387
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,110
you're going to be running for some office
in the future or that you have cancer

388
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,770
or that you spoke marijuana and you
happen to live in a conservative state and

389
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,790
you're a congressman who plans
on investigating the NSA,

390
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,030
they can just give you a little heads up,
you know,

391
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,800
maybe think twice before you say anything
on that oversight committee. And uh,

392
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,850
I'm not saying this stuff is happening,
but like my,

393
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,550
I guess my whole issue is why wouldn't
it happen if they'd been this dishonest

394
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:59,490
about the extent to which they're spying
on people and now they're like, oh,

395
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:00,720
we're transparent.
Yeah.

396
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:05,220
After a whistle blower goes to Hong
Kong at the risk of his life and reveals

397
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,710
these documents,
then you're transparent and then,

398
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,850
then there's a credibility problem.

399
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,940
It's the difference between you
calling the IRS. I mean like, look,

400
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:15,150
I'm a little bit behind on
my taxes difference between
that and them being like,

401
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:18,360
what does this account in the Caymans,
you know, what is this all about?

402
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:20,610
It's still, it's a huge
difference. Same with anything.

403
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:23,280
It's like going to your girlfriend and
saying you fucked up about something

404
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,870
versus her finding out.

405
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,530
And then you have to explain yourself
and that's what the government is doing

406
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:29,160
now.

407
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,300
And the two arguments they're making or
to anyone who's reasonably intelligent

408
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,960
or not acceptable, they say, this
is nothing new. This is all routine.

409
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,490
This is no big deal.

410
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,940
Well then why are you treating the sky
as if he's blown the cover off something

411
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,650
huge.
If this is no big deal.

412
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:47,520
Why did Senator Lindsey Graham said that
he will go to the ends of the earth to

413
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,230
track this guy down?
You know,

414
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:51,810
why are they treating him as if he's
such a threat to national security?

415
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:54,060
If we all knew that all of our
shit was being looked at anyway?

416
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,780
Well, we definitely did all know that.
Right? There's no doubt about that.

417
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:00,730
But there was some concern about the,

418
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,790
the facility that we're building in Utah.
I had heard about that online. Uh, you,

419
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:09,300
you had spoken about it. Um, uh,
Michael Rupert spoken about it,

420
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,420
that they're building a
facility that stores everything.

421
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,800
It's going to be a massive, gigantic
data center. And the idea is, look,

422
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,780
if you don't do anything wrong,
they never going to look into it.

423
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,170
But the reality is who are they
and how did they get that position?

424
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,250
They're just human beings.

425
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,230
The laws change over time. Like just to
give you a, a nightmare scenario 2016,

426
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:34,650
let's say we get a president,
uh, what's his fucking name?

427
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:37,680
President Santorum or President
Rick Perry is somebody like that.

428
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,650
And because they feel like this is
a good way to gain support from the

429
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,350
conservative base,
they go on a morality platform,

430
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:45,920
which has happened before in the
United States. Look, prohibition,

431
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,780
they go on a morality
platform. They say, look,

432
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,360
the the U s is falling behind
shine on the countries.

433
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,370
The reason why is that were soft,
you know,

434
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:56,060
or a bunch of druggies and a bunch
of alcoholics. So from here on out,

435
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,480
we're not just going to continue
to keep marijuana criminalized.

436
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:03,380
We're going to super criminalize it and
just eradicated from the United States.

437
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,540
And so what they do in that case,
it's,

438
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,080
even though you know it wasn't illegal
four years ago to send emails to your

439
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:13,460
friends talking about the
medical marijuana clinic
that you go to in California,

440
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,500
even though that's totally fine in 2013
and 2016 it's no longer legal to talk

441
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,980
about those things and to promote that
ideology and all you have to do is do a

442
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:25,880
keyword search in their database and
find everybody who is sympathetic to

443
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,910
marijuana reform, it make their lives
a little bit more difficult. You know,

444
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,820
maybe hit them with audits are
trumped up charges or anything.

445
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,010
When that happens, you're not living
in a representative democracy. You're,

446
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,650
you're looking at,

447
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,830
you're living in a place for unelected
people or people who you know,

448
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:43,920
have been elected in and corrupted or
making decisions for you and there's

449
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,770
nothing you can do about it and you don't
even know the decisions are being made

450
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,510
until it impacts you personally.

451
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,140
Yeah, and this is really a pattern that
has repeated itself over and over again

452
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,940
throughout human history.
And it was,

453
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,840
it's really exactly what the founding
fathers of this country we're trying to

454
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:02,210
prevent.
When they crafted the constitution,

455
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,240
they were trying to protect against this
continual cycle of people getting to

456
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:11,990
power and then abusing that power. It
just, it happens. It's always happened.

457
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,400
It's the way humans do it and slowly but
surely they've chipped away at it with

458
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:21,401
things like Nda or the Patriot Act and
they do it and they do it while nothing's

459
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:22,260
happening.

460
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,430
They're not like they're doing it and why
bombs are blowing up over the overhead

461
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:28,520
and we need to declare martial law and
figure out what's going on. A lock,

462
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,170
everything down.
It's not like that at all.

463
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,460
They're just recognizing the tide coming
in and they're scrambling and they're

464
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:39,410
trying to find all sorts of new ways to
get at data, but in the meantime though,

465
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,000
their data is being captured.

466
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,770
It's funny you said the tide's coming
in because one of the best theories I've

467
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:47,710
seen so far and why they're
doing all this stuff.

468
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,580
I was published in the Guardian newspaper
the other day and the theory that this

469
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:56,581
one guy proposed is that the government
strongly believes that economic and

470
00:25:56,861 --> 00:26:01,180
possibly energy, uh, unrest. So the
price of fuel as well as you know,

471
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,710
people's wages and their savings,

472
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,070
all of that stuff is going to be
an upheaval in the near future.

473
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,370
And the reason why is climate change.
If you think about New York City,

474
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:12,960
if just the tide levels rise by a couple
of feet, you're talking about, you know,

475
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,780
the New York Stock Exchange flooding
out and that market being closed for a

476
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,170
couple of weeks at the minimum and
you know, total financial chaos,

477
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,350
not to mention all the people who lose
their lives and the flooding. So you,

478
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,550
if you realize how serious climate changes
and that half the country, you know,

479
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:30,850
that sort of Fox News view is just a
market and pretend like it's bullshit.

480
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,081
This is happening.

481
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:35,680
And apparently the government is concerned
about the unrest that will come from

482
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:39,820
just one major catastrophe, that people
will start to protest the government the,

483
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:40,720
so you didn't do your job,

484
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:44,670
you should have known about
this beforehand and there
will be just upheaval.

485
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,300
So what pisses me off about this is if
that's the reason why the government is

486
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:52,890
storing all of our emails is so they
can pick out all the influencers within

487
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:55,620
protest groups in the future,
if that's what this is all about,

488
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,610
it's fucking absolutely disgusting
that they're using their considerable

489
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,460
resources and technology to,
uh,

490
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,450
make sure that protests don't take off
in the u s instead of using that talent

491
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,690
and technology to prevent these things
from happening in the first place.

492
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,400
You know,
let's tackle climate change.

493
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,010
Let's figure out how we don't have
a drought in the future. Right?

494
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,420
But the, but what you're
saying is very general. The,

495
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:19,790
you're dealing with a bunch
of compartmentalize people.

496
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,970
And so if you're attacking
their specific thing,

497
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,120
the thing with whether it's the
IRS or whether it's the NSA,

498
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:30,110
if you're going after their specific
department, they're not going to thank,

499
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,530
you know what? We need to just put a
man on the moon. You know, they're,

500
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:33,710
they're not thinking like that.

501
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,750
They're thinking we have to
protect our organization. Right.

502
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,430
It's toxic because it's
corporation thinking. It's
corporate thinking with guns.

503
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,470
You said, man, on the moon,

504
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:48,880
our grandparents put humans on the moon
and now we're just trying to fight.

505
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:52,000
The government's not read our emails.
It's like we're moving backwards in time.

506
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,740
Well, it's, um, there's,

507
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,770
there's a lack of privacy that is just
overwhelmingly apparent when you look at

508
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:04,430
the future. If you
extrapolate the future, the,

509
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,470
the lack of privacy is the thing that
people dread the most over the last few

510
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,100
years. Whether it's someone hacking
into your email or someone you know,

511
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,960
spying on your phone calls or there
the fact that it now is completely a

512
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:18,794
reality.

513
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,860
That was like something that people were
really worried about for a long time.

514
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:25,070
As it,
as it gets more and more invasive,

515
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:29,120
as technology permeates your life
more and more, it's going to,

516
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,180
it's going to reach some point
where we have neural chips. Well,

517
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:34,960
we have a headpiece that we,
where we have something

518
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,220
that's not so bad. If it's
open to everyone, it will
be, you know, the bidding.

519
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:41,280
Right now it's only the government
looking at it, so it's a one way mirror.

520
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,530
I really believe,

521
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,670
I know people give me shit about this
and they think it's a very utopian way of

522
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:47,960
looking at the world,
but I,

523
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,920
I truly believe that this,

524
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,520
this new age that we're entering into
this age of complete openness is going to

525
00:28:58,281 --> 00:28:59,720
force people to be accountable.

526
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,920
It's going to change behavior
and even the people that govern,

527
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,280
they're going to govern differently.
It's kind of, they're going to have to,

528
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,660
they're going to want to,

529
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,950
you're not going to want to feel the
repercussions from all these people that

530
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,560
you're doing something wrong. You're
going to feel bad, you're going to change.

531
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,530
It's not a good life to be

532
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,840
suppressing and bullying and dominating
people and and using dirty tactics like

533
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:33,080
reading their emails to control your
political agenda and to contaminate your

534
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:37,820
opponents. It's evil and it's not good
for you either. The person who does it,

535
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,740
it's shit for you. You're going to
get cancer. You're going freak out.

536
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,800
You're going to the negative energy that
you're putting out there in the world.

537
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:45,910
That's not a free ride.

538
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,410
You can't be some global fucking asshole,
you know,

539
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,860
that's poisoning third
world countries for profit.

540
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:58,240
You can't be that guy and sleep like a
baby and wake up with a smile. You're,

541
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,770
you're a flawed human being.

542
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,210
It's unconsciousness.
I've thought a lot about this,

543
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:06,350
about why these consultant companies are
working with the government to spy on

544
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:09,620
American citizens and
they're even building similar
systems for Middle Eastern

545
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,060
countries where you know,

546
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:15,110
at least here we can tell ourselves that
Obama will never use this against us

547
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,360
and that there are these
posted safeguards in place,

548
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:20,630
which really why would we tell ourselves
that though that's what people do.

549
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,210
We don't like to think that
it could happen here, but,

550
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
but let me just play this out.

551
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,110
The same companies that built that shit
over here and maintain it are building

552
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:28,730
similar systems in the Middle East.

553
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,770
And those countries are corrupt monarchies
that have no qualms about using it to

554
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:36,290
do exactly what I said,
to figure out who the protesters are,

555
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,980
to pull them out of their
homes and torture them until
they stopped protesting.

556
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,940
And it's, it's appalling to me that
American companies are involved in this.

557
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,520
And I kept thinking, how is this
possible? You know, cause I know some,

558
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,990
I know some people who work in the
defense field and stuff of that nature,

559
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,290
those kinds of companies, and
they're like, they're not bad people.

560
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,810
And I think what it is
is this unconsciousness.

561
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:00,860
You have people who were around that Guy
Edward Snowden's age around my age who

562
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,970
are making more money than they
should be making, you know,

563
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:07,850
$200,000 a year and just these assholes
wearing khakis flying all over the

564
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:11,960
world. And they're in a position of
privilege, you know, airport lounges, uh,

565
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,070
you know,
attractive women.

566
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,550
They make more than most people that
age make and they have access to

567
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,450
extraordinary power and they're doing
this because they've been told that that's

568
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:23,090
what you're supposed to do after college,
you should be successful.

569
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,550
You want to make a lot of money,
have a nice girlfriend,

570
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,310
do these things and so you're
just in this little pool,

571
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,060
this isolated pool of other people who
are doing the same thing as you and so

572
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:33,260
you're like,
well my friend Tom,

573
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,120
he's making $215,000 a year so I have
to do a good job on this NSA project to

574
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:41,510
make sure I'm like two 40 next year
and can take my girlfriend is some nice

575
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:45,680
place in the Hamptons for a week and
these people are not the ones ruling the

576
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:46,370
world.

577
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:51,370
They're just the pawns for the 65 year
old 70 year old dudes who actually run

578
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:55,130
these defense companies and
why are they doing this stuff?

579
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:56,300
They have more money than God.

580
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,880
They don't need to continue doing
the same things over and over again.

581
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,880
I think they're doing it because it
becomes competitive at that point.

582
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:05,090
They want to get invited to next year's
Bilderberg and jerk each other off or

583
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,790
whatever it is they do at these things.
They want to be in the club.

584
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,850
And if you stop a,
if you're no longer a part of the process,

585
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:13,400
you kind of fall out of the club.
And that's what it's about.

586
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,480
It's unconsciousness.
People feel like there's no other way.

587
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:18,320
Like that's the way you should live your
life is to gain more and more influence

588
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:20,960
until you die.
And maybe that's not the right approach.

589
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,590
Well,
human beings are incredibly malleable,

590
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,430
mean we're able to adapt to
strange situations and we're,

591
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:32,230
we're able to rise and fall to incredible
heights and depths. I mean, we're,

592
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,620
we're fucking weird man. We don't,
we're not standard. You know,

593
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,710
there's not like a normal human,
like the way humans,

594
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,960
very luck in behavior and
personality and capabilities.

595
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,520
It's not like anything
in the animal kingdom.

596
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,070
A tiger is a fucking tiger
is a fucking tiger. You know,

597
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,630
you could feed one and if you're lucky,

598
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,750
associates you with being a good
thing because you feed them.

599
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,110
But if one day he decides to go
Siegfried and Roy on you, that's,

600
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,080
that's his choice. Okay. There's
nothing you can do about that.

601
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,530
Humans are so different.
There's,

602
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,330
there's so much variability and it's,
it's weird. There's so many variables.

603
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,410
It's the the,

604
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,090
to make a good human is
incredibly difficult and
until we concentrate on making

605
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:14,780
good people, until we concentrate on
the impoverished people in this country,

606
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,800
this world even, I mean, until we
look at the weakest link of humanity,

607
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:22,100
if we really do look at humanity,
we want to pretend we're humane.

608
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,900
We really do look at it collectively.

609
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,720
The thing you have to do is you've
got to stop all these bad spots.

610
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,690
If you have a foundation
and the foundation is all
fucked up with worms and and

611
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,380
termites and shit,
you've got to cut that out and rebuild it.

612
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,680
If you don't have a good foundation,
you're fucked. If you look at any society,

613
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,790
look at the weakest link.

614
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,960
The weakest link is its biggest problem
and the weakest link of his country's

615
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,080
completely ignored. Poor people
like, fuck you. Get your own.

616
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:49,460
Figure it out. Fuck yourself. There's
so little money being put into it.

617
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,590
You have to pay for school.
You know when,

618
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:53,720
when it comes to colleges and
always going to pay for it. I mean,

619
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:56,240
maybe I can get a grant if you're
lucky. Try getting the grant. Okay,

620
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,740
you got to Gregg.
Congratulations.

621
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,580
Not trying to get an a job
once you get out of there. Oh,

622
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,740
back to the back to the situation,
right.

623
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,180
Oh dollars an hour or unemployed.

624
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,250
Massive struggle to try to get out of
that situation and no resources put to try

625
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:11,830
to solve it.
Like social engineering as a culture.

626
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,400
Like let's look at our
brothers and sisters and say,
well how can we help them?

627
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:19,450
How can we make sure that these babies
aren't growing and he's incredibly toxic

628
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:20,051
environments?

629
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:23,710
They're going to be damaged human beings
that go out to inflict more bullshit on

630
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:27,010
society. All of that can be avoided
if you cut it off at the path.

631
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:31,030
All that can be avoided. It sounds so
cliche, but with love and understanding,

632
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,990
and if you treated it that way and realize
that we're not going to fucking be in

633
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:39,991
this thing forever and we now for the
first time ever all have access to the

634
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:43,840
right amount of information where
we should be able to sort this out.

635
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,110
We should all be able to understand like
what the fuck is really going on with

636
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:49,820
human behavior, what's really
going on with the, the,

637
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,290
the way corporations can
act as an individual.

638
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:57,850
But yet no one inside the corporation
feels anything that the individuals doing

639
00:34:57,851 --> 00:34:58,684
that's horrible

640
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
when everyone wants to fuel and they
feel that way to become a whistle blower.

641
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,780
And then the media says that there are
a trader and you know, a, a narcissist.

642
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,200
The Sky has turned down.
By the way,

643
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:11,680
the Guy Snowden is turned down every
single major TV interview that has been

644
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:14,980
thrown his way, which is pretty much
all of them. So if he's a narcissist,

645
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:16,450
why is he turning down all of the press?

646
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,960
He's clearly and why would he destroy
his life? That makes no sense.

647
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:21,040
Clearly that's bullshit.

648
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,420
But that's what happens is when you're
in a corporation or an organization,

649
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,250
you see that the stuff around you is
not functioning the way it should.

650
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,830
That person's a whistle blower
if they choose to step up.

651
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,160
And instead of us being as a society,
like Holy Shit,

652
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,710
that person did a heroic
thing there for sure.

653
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:39,090
Getting a big ass book deal and we're
gonna get laid for the rest of their lives

654
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,980
because of what they've
done for this country.

655
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,010
Instead of that being the paradigm
where we reward those people,

656
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,150
it's like trader,
you know

657
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,910
later and you want to step back
because you don't want to get caught,

658
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,000
right. You don't want to be
connected to that and uh,

659
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,580
they can never get a job again. Like
Thomas Drake, the other NSA whistleblower,

660
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:58,340
they're actually several
of them. Thomas Drake, his,

661
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,180
his life over the past few years sounds
like a movie and it probably will be a

662
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:03,110
movie someday soon.

663
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:08,350
He was a senior executive at the NSA or
a senior official there and saw what was

664
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:12,140
going on and saw there
was deeply unamerican and
unconstitutional and became a

665
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,993
whistleblower.

666
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,520
And they went after him with everything
they had charged them under the

667
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:19,300
espionage act.
And uh,

668
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,120
now he ended up not going to prison.
He was very fortunate in that respect,

669
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:27,740
not to go to prison, but now he works
at an apple store as an hourly retail,

670
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,790
a rep, just that fucking apple store
telling people about the new iPhone.

671
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,440
And this was a guy who was privy to
the government's most sophisticated

672
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:40,520
technological secrets. And now he's
telling people how to refresh their mail,

673
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,380
maybe likes it. And that's a good
gig. That's a relaxing no technology.

674
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,820
And I'm saying it's a great Gig,

675
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:49,190
but if you're one of the
smartest people in the country,

676
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:51,710
to the point where the NSA recruits you,
these are not stupid.

677
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,880
So you're saying that he
can't get a job anywhere else.

678
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,070
Same reason why he's there,
but he's blackballed

679
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,220
is other intelligent. Other intelligence
agencies don't want that person around.

680
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,550
When really if you're not doing anything
wrong and you're a big company or a big

681
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:07,630
government agency, you should want to
recruit people like that to show them off.

682
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,300
You know, look, we hired this
guy, so we're above board.

683
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,790
We're not doing anything illegal,
but they don't do that.

684
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:16,820
Those people are kind of fucked for life.
Maybe get the fuck this guy.

685
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,490
Maybe it wasn't that smart to begin with.

686
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:21,560
It was just whoever hired him was
his dumb. Maybe he's a trader,

687
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,050
he could be a trader. I look, you know,

688
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:28,650
and I don't mean to demean
his accomplishments or what
he did or his courage in

689
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:32,040
any way in real life.
We're joking around the the re.

690
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,370
The reality though is you're
absolutely right. Brave man. Yeah,

691
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:39,960
you're absolutely right. And you're
absolutely right that it's, it's, it's,

692
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,490
it's real travesty and it's,

693
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:45,000
it's sad that we all look at
America as like one thing,

694
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:49,550
but if you see at the root of it, like
the people that are running it, what they,

695
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,460
the disdain that they have for the
privacy of the American people,

696
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,290
it's the rights.

697
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,910
Horrendous rights are the rights
and they want to chip away at them.

698
00:37:56,911 --> 00:38:01,590
And even a guy like Obama, which
is, I was, man, when Obama won,

699
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,450
I was so fucking happy when he
first became president. I was like,

700
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,870
oh my God. Like we really have
like broken through the cloud.

701
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:10,560
I was,

702
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,340
I was in union square at the time with
my girlfriend in New York and there was

703
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,160
like mist in the air. I'm not making this
up. There was actually mist in the air.

704
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,270
There's just a sea of people like
cheering him on with this big TV screen.

705
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,630
And I voted for him in 2008. And I was
definitely a part of that. You know,

706
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,350
the Koolaide drinking club of hope
and change. And yes, we can, you know,

707
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:31,950
he said yes, we can. It doesn't mean
that he actually would. And uh, you know,

708
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:34,200
like I bought it,
I bought into it completely.

709
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,270
And that's part of the reason why I've
becomes such a critic is covering these

710
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,950
stories over the past year and a half.

711
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,390
You see that his great speeches have
almost no correlation to what he is

712
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,210
actually doing.
After the TV turns off.

713
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,330
And he goes back to running his
administration and that's what,

714
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,940
that's what really like,
uh, it makes my blood boil.

715
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,300
Like you just were talking about
Obama before my phone dies.

716
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:58,450
I really want to read,
this is from MSN news.

717
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,060
It's not from like some right wing site,

718
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,700
like a Glenn Beck or something like that.

719
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,960
So he's planning a trip to Africa and
they're saying it might be the most

720
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:12,550
expensive presidential trip ever. This
is a quote from MSN news. The trip,

721
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:17,551
which begins June 26th could
cost 60 million to $100
million and could be one of

722
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,220
the most expensive presidential
trips in United States history.

723
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,210
One unnamed source told The Washington
Post the higher estimate cost of this

724
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:28,720
month's trip is partially due to
elaborate security provisions. Uh,

725
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,220
let me just read the actual stats.

726
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,110
Resources will reportedly include
hundreds of us secret service agents and a

727
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:38,740
Navy aircraft carrier with a fully
staffed medical trauma center.

728
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,370
Military cargo planes
will transport 56 support,

729
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:47,371
vital support vehicles including 14
limousines and three trucks loaded with

730
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:51,100
sheets of bulletproof glass to cover
the windows of the hotels were the first

731
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:55,720
family will stay. And my question is,
is that a reasonable use of money?

732
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:56,770
14 limousines.

733
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:00,070
Why can't we just have two or three
and this guy's a president of a

734
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,940
constitutional republic or is he
the emperor of some high tech,

735
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,400
a dystopian society that spies on
the whole world and deploys drones to

736
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:12,940
countries that we don't like to kill
people on the basis of this secret

737
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:16,420
information we're obtaining through
their email and you start to wonder like

738
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:20,380
we've strayed pretty far from the the
farmers and the 13 colonies who were like,

739
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:24,010
we need to, you know, a form of
government that is going to resist future,

740
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:25,420
you know,
power grabs.

741
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,860
We're in a totally different world
from what they envisioned. Yeah.

742
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,190
We're like super techno gangster.
That's really what it is.

743
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:38,100
Vertech techno gangster society that's
controlling resources everywhere.

744
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,020
We're like Rome times a million.

745
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:44,460
Yeah. I think if you were to beam Julius
Caesar to the present day, who'd be like,

746
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:47,580
God Damn Obama. Yeah, he, he
would, he would be impressed.

747
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,760
It would take about an afternoon or
two to bring them up to speed on the

748
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:55,560
internet, podcasts, satellites. Once you
do that though, they're exactly the same.

749
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,560
I guess I'm being kind of harsh enough.
I don't,

750
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,650
but I think ideologically they're
exactly the same. Kind of, yeah.

751
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,820
Well they're not the.live in
the same time. If they were
living in the same time,

752
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:04,730
they'd have probably similar behavior.
Yeah.

753
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,460
That's the thing that people have to
realize is that there's so many steps

754
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:12,720
removed from the person in charge of the
country or the person in charge of the

755
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:16,070
army, even in the brutalization that
happens on the ground, you know,

756
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:20,370
and Obama is very, very far removed from
the brutalization that happens. In fact,

757
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
the weird new kind of brutalization that
happens where everyone's removed except

758
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,670
the people that get hit.
That's what's so strange about drones.

759
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,800
The idea that someone could be no where
near where this is happening and do

760
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:37,370
something that causes someone to stop
living and that it happens on a regular

761
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:42,020
basis. Yeah. It's the ultimate detachment
from reality. I mean, and it's,

762
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,470
it's an excellent technological solution
as far as like saving troops and all

763
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:47,330
that stuff.
If you looked at it that way,

764
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:49,400
if you want it to be pragmatic
on the side of Americans,

765
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,260
but it's not that effective,

766
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,890
it kills a lot of people that it's not
supposed to kill. It kills a lot of kids.

767
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,360
It's killed many kids and it's, it's
creepy. Something creepy about it.

768
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,840
Yeah.
It's uh,

769
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,570
it's too much disconnection between
people you're killing and it's too easy.

770
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,860
It's too easy to do it to Americans
where you don't even have to go to trial.

771
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:12,330
Speaking of too easy, uh, this'll
freak freak everybody out a little bit,

772
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:14,880
but oh Geez. I'm so the, the list,

773
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,690
we've already broken the precedent of
targeting and killing American citizens

774
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:22,200
without a trial using drones for us
citizens have been killed that way,

775
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:25,380
that we know of. And granted the one guy
was an asshole and probably deserved it.

776
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,300
But the other three,
we don't really know.

777
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:31,760
The one guy was the guy who turned out
tell about some Muslim propagandist.

778
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:35,840
If you're actually proper guy
propagandizing people and you know,

779
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,050
inciting them to violence,

780
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:39,660
then you're an asshole and you
really kind of get what you deserve.

781
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,950
But we've now created that slippery
slope and I give it a slippery slope.

782
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,980
We've gone down the slope now we've
actually killed American citizens with

783
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,130
drones. So in the future court
cases, we'll look back to that.

784
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,010
That's the precedent that we'd
done it. You know, President Obama,

785
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:57,690
the thoughtful liberal constitutional
law scholar thinks that it's okay.

786
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,020
So it's certainly okay for a president,
Rick Perry to do that.

787
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,200
And he keeps saying that cause that's
the scariest outcomes saying that.

788
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,780
I think he just recently, uh, I
think either in Texas or in Florida,

789
00:43:09,781 --> 00:43:14,781
they're trying to make it a felony to
even flown to Florida two pipes if you get

790
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,010
caught twice. So that's why I keep saying
that cause that's a real possibilities.

791
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,460
You get somebody like that in the Oval
Office and they have all these toys and

792
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:27,150
they use it in the worst way as possible.
And all you'll hear about it is,

793
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,130
you know,
Erin Burnett on CNN saying some,

794
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,360
some radical terrorists were killed
last night and they happen to be in the

795
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:37,260
United States. And most Americans will
go, well, good. I want to be safe.

796
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:40,290
I don't want those people here anyways.
And you don't look into the fact that,

797
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,730
well, what did they actually
done? They did nothing.

798
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,570
They were just on the wrong list and they
planned on attending some protest and

799
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:48,060
now they're vaporized. I'm not saying
that's going to happen tomorrow,

800
00:43:48,061 --> 00:43:51,620
but I'm saying we've 100% laid the
legal groundwork for that to happen.

801
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:55,530
That's essentially Kent
State, 2013 style. Right.

802
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,030
So essentially what the or Ruby Ridge
or any of that stuff? Well, yeah, well,

803
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:02,760
Ken state especially, I don't know
what really happened on Ruby Ridge.

804
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,230
I don't know, uh, how Kooky that dude was
when they were shooting at people. Yeah.

805
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:11,870
Do you know? No, I, I don't know. I
wasn't there obviously. So Kent State,

806
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:13,580
it was just students.
Just Moa.

807
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,700
Yes. I mean the, the whole
us versus them. Shit,

808
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:21,360
I think is way harder to pull off today
though because the cops realize that

809
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:25,080
they're not the Bilderberg group. They're
not, they're not chilling with Obama,

810
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,580
you know,
eating caviar on a nuclear submarine,

811
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,020
right? Yeah. They're not
spending $100 million.

812
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,500
Their vacation and their kids are
not going to these elite schools.

813
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,570
Well,
it's not only that they,

814
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,640
they have to know at this point in
time that they are the, exactly,

815
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,710
the cops are exactly the same as
the people that are arresting. Okay.

816
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,530
They're just regular citizens.
No. A cop is just like you.

817
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:50,700
He just has a different job in a different
loyalty and then he becomes a part of

818
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,590
a team and then he has
loyalty to that team.

819
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,470
They cover up for each other and
then you might never dirty boss.

820
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:57,450
He might have a boss.
It's good, but it's like,

821
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,730
that's exactly what it becomes
is it becomes a person,

822
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:04,030
just a person who becomes a part
of a community and then assimilate.

823
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,120
And when the community's rotten,
it's very difficult to, to be clean.

824
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,040
It's very difficult.
Look at,

825
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,180
I mean we all assumed that Obama was
this like super awesome guy and we all

826
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:17,760
assumed that he was going to go
in there and switch things up.

827
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,830
Let's assume that he actually was,
look,

828
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,790
let's assume that he actually was who
he seemed to be his entire life up until

829
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,660
he became president.

830
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,910
That just goes to show you how rotten
the community that he got. Yeah.

831
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,660
Inserted into, he got inserted into
some shit. It's just completely fucked

832
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,540
and it's not too late for
him to do the right thing.

833
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,500
He's a second term president. Well, if he
were to go through with just, you know,

834
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,610
I don't think you're on a 10% of the
stuff he promised in the campaign trail.

835
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,600
You start to reign in these things that
he was supposed to have done. Yeah.

836
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,640
Then it's not too late to change things,
but I,

837
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,160
I'm not saying that's gonna happen.
I think he is already,

838
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:57,200
he has shown us his cards and whatever
remaining shred of respect I had for the

839
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,034
guy.

840
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,240
I lost it after watching that press
conference on June 7th June 7th or eighth

841
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,270
where he lied to the American people.
He said,

842
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:09,020
we're not listening to your phone calls.
That's not what this program is about. A,

843
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,040
that's, that's lawyer speak. Cause the
metadata tells you so much about people.

844
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:13,850
And B,

845
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,030
it appears that you actually are listening
to phone calls and a lot of cases.

846
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,330
So either you don't know what
your own administration is doing,

847
00:46:20,331 --> 00:46:21,290
which is possible,

848
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,200
in which case you need to fucking fire
those people and have an independent

849
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:27,260
investigation and to why they're
doing something against your wishes.

850
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:31,550
Or you do know about this and it's a
total one 80 from everything you said on

851
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:34,490
the campaign trail. Like people
always say to me, they're like, well,

852
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,750
Bush started these programs.

853
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:39,200
I don't see why you're giving Obama such
a hard time. And I go, that's right.

854
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:41,840
But Obama didn't say, I'm
going to be, you know,

855
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,210
aggressively continuing
the same path as Bush.

856
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,780
Young people got out to vote
because he said enough. You know,

857
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:49,040
American needs a clean slate.

858
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,560
We're not doing this post
nine 11 craziness anymore.

859
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,800
We're going to have the rule of law,
I'm a constitutional law scholar,

860
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,270
all that stuff.

861
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,530
And then we find out that secretly the
program has actually been expanding and

862
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,380
bringing all these new companies
on board to harvest our data.

863
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,630
And I think that's when I lost that,

864
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,110
that final shred of respect cause I'd
already been covering like Nda and the

865
00:47:09,111 --> 00:47:12,260
growth, the Tsa and all these things that
I disagree with. And then you're like,

866
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:15,740
wait a second, why are you doing this? You
know, now there's no shadow of a doubt.

867
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:17,690
Like you either don't know what
you're on government is doing,

868
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:21,320
in which case you're bad at your job or
you do know and you're being dishonest

869
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:23,780
with Americans.
How much power do you think he has?

870
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,840
He's the most powerful person in
the world. Do you think that's real?

871
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:30,220
I think that's real. Or else why? Why
would it matter much who we choose?

872
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,050
I think he's the so, but does it, I mean
it does, doesn't it get boiled down?

873
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:38,380
First of all, the two parties,
which is bullshit. Second of all to,

874
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:42,370
to people that are absolutely
supported by gigantic corporations.

875
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:46,000
It's not like there's any rogue
independence that sneak through. He went,

876
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,080
he went to war with Libya
basically unilaterally, right?

877
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,960
I mean you're,
you're an influential guy.

878
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,540
You can't go on Twitter and decided to
start a war with Libya. This guy, he,

879
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,120
you keep saying he because we don't,
but this is where my dispute it.

880
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,290
Am I not be Obama who we don't, I don't
know. I don't necessarily not leave that.

881
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:10,150
They would allow a new person to come
in every four years and just run shit.

882
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,600
And that's possible also because if
the NSA is doing with what we now know

883
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,670
they're doing, what if they're like, look,

884
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,450
we know you have all these plans
to do a, B, and c for the country,

885
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:24,370
but we have these really kind of
embarrassing phone calls between you and

886
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,450
whoever.
His doesn't even have to do that.

887
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,850
Does anyone have anything but enough to
compromise him and or just maybe just

888
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,310
seduce them with that level of power?

889
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,740
Have you ever tried to do anything where
you have to involve a bunch of people

890
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:37,870
that also get to make decisions?
Yeah,

891
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:42,871
it becomes a Dick Swing and contrast
that to but trying to get to hang around

892
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:46,210
with a rubber band more often. I
feel you definitely do. I benefit.

893
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,520
You definitely wear a condom.
The um, like it's, it's,

894
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:54,200
it's real easy to get caught up
in the, you know, the, the whole,

895
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:59,050
the hustle of how you're living
and to, to not have, uh, the, the,

896
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,610
the ability to step back and take a
deep breath and look at the whole thing

897
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:08,611
collectively and what Obama and all these
other guys are doing is just playing

898
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:12,550
into the direction that it's been
going and been going forever,

899
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:17,551
but only going right now at least on
the level that they can achieve the,

900
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,180
it has to be someone at the highest levels
of government that can store all the

901
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:26,530
data of all the phone calls all
over the world. But that's just now.

902
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,280
I feel like what they can do now by
listening to every phone call and reading

903
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:35,770
every text you're going to be able
to do in a hundred years from now,

904
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,550
five years from now, whatever
it is, 10 years from now.

905
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,120
I don't think there's any room
in this world for secrets,

906
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,420
but what about it gets a left
over thing that we cherish?

907
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,850
The financial aspect of being able to
spy on people around the world. Well,

908
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,370
in here it gets even deeper.

909
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:56,910
What about the financial aspect of
resources being broken down to a digital

910
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:02,320
thing? Look at what money used
to be. Money was a gold standard.

911
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:03,011
It was set on goal.

912
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,470
There was $100 worth of gold or something
that represented a hundred dollars

913
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:07,300
with a goal.
It doesn't mean shit anymore.

914
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,170
It means ones and Zeros that are
written down on paper somewhere or on a

915
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:14,890
computer. That's it. That's what it
means is based entirely on confidence.

916
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,540
You know, and that's obviously a gross
simplification of the financial system,

917
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,130
but that's just because
that's all I can do.

918
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,890
I don't really understand
how it actually works.

919
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,980
It is a total confidence game from what
I understand. But the bottom line is it,

920
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,370
it doesn't represent

921
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,540
anything anymore. It's becoming, computers
can become in ones and Zeros. Well,

922
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,470
when we get to that point,
which is fucking calming, okay,

923
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,340
we want to pretend that we,
everyone hates the idea of socialism.

924
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,310
Everyone hates the idea of
communism, me included. You know why?

925
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,760
Because people are fucking shady
and they don't do their part.

926
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:50,000
And it would be great if we all made the
exact same amount of money if we're all

927
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,970
worked hard. But that's not where
people's motivation come from.

928
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,180
People's motivations come from you work,
you achieve something,

929
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,520
and then you feel how good that feels.
Then you want to continue doing that.

930
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,010
But if you give someone
something really easily,

931
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,710
they become spoiled and we can lazy.
That's the problem with,

932
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,850
that's a problem with rich kids.
That's the problem with celebrities.

933
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,640
Well, that's how we're
programmed. Our biology, I forget
where I heard this, but, uh,

934
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,580
our whole evolutionary process
is about picking the, uh,

935
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,420
the easiest lane and
staying in that lane course.

936
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,040
Once we find something that works for us.

937
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,580
You keep doing it until it's been totally
exploited and no longer works for you.

938
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,660
And then you move onto the next thing.

939
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,350
And for, from a survival standpoint, I do,

940
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,800
I'm thinking about what it
used to be like to be a human

941
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,450
great. When we're all, you know,

942
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,840
hunter gatherer is not so great when
there's 7 billion of us and all of our

943
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:39,460
decisions are so interconnected that
me deciding to be a a, you know,

944
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,850
a selfish asshole actually
does impact other people.

945
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,600
Whereas a hundred thousand years ago I
could probably plug as many apples from

946
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:48,790
the trees I wanted.
It would have no impact.

947
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,340
Yeah, it's, it's definitely
getting stranger and stranger.

948
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,570
And we're also eliminating
by use of technology.

949
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,160
We're eliminating a lot of work.

950
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,630
There's a lot of things that you don't
have to do physically that are done for

951
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:07,250
you acquiring food. Your water comes
at the turn of a nozzle, you know,

952
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:09,020
your heat is just a button away.

953
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,450
I'll go, I'll go even further than
that on you. Uh, the number of you,

954
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,850
the number of things that we need money
to acquire is actually decreasing every

955
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,450
year.

956
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,380
So I think a lot of people in this kind
of like post recession America feel like

957
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:24,680
they don't have as much as they
should have, which is 100% justified.

958
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:27,280
People got fucked.
But uh,

959
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,780
the fact of the matter
is to go on Youtube,

960
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:34,340
on your iPad and instantly view the
best cooking instructional videos in the

961
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:37,340
world or the best yoga videos,
any topic you want to about the,

962
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:40,910
probably the best brain surgery videos,
all those topics are free.

963
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,720
Whereas 10 or 15 years ago it would
cost you thousands of dollars for an

964
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:48,530
encyclopedia Britannica subscription and
that would only contain a fraction of

965
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:51,410
the information on Youtube,
the best podcasts in the world,

966
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:53,690
like years of free people
are accessing them,

967
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:58,040
paying nothing for this content
that to get it. And you know,

968
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:58,821
15 years ago,

969
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:01,940
this kind of content would probably be
a premium cable channel and you'd pay 15

970
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:04,550
or $20 a month for it. So all these
things are just becoming free.

971
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:08,390
That's the whole Internet business
model and it's going to get to the point

972
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:11,990
where you just don't need to pay
for most of the things in your life.

973
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,640
So college will fade away.

974
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,690
You'll just self-educate online and meet
up once a week with other likeminded

975
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,090
people. How we get lid, how you get laid.

976
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,080
It's very hard to get laid
when you're 18 and 19.

977
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,220
You got to be holed up in a house with
people and start dorm rooms. Yeah,

978
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:30,510
he got to get people confused.
Including yourself. Yeah,

979
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,710
I think you're right. I think you're
absolutely right and I think, um, we are,

980
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,711
we are entering into a new era and it's
a new era of convergence and this new

981
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,250
era, what the government can
do now with this NSA shit,

982
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,400
we're all going to be able to do to each
other and we have to realize that that

983
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:48,420
is coming.
God dammit,

984
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,820
you're not going to have any secrets
from me and I'm not going to have any

985
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:55,770
secrets from you. And ultimately
I think it is a beautiful thing.

986
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,080
It sounds fucked up,
but I think it's a beautiful,

987
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,200
that's called radical.

988
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,410
I think it's called radical
transparency of this dude David Brin.

989
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,050
I had him on my show and
he wrote the post man,

990
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:09,130
which is that book that Kevin Costner
turned into a movie, which was awesome.

991
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,710
I thought it was good. A lot of
people didn't like it was horrible.

992
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,400
I thought it was cool. Oh my god, it
was apocalyptic. Really. It was so bad.

993
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:19,690
It was great. It's like waterworld on
waterworld on the land. Yeah, I liked it.

994
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,390
Well, you must have had a really
good experience when you watch it,

995
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,170
watch it with a really pretty girl who
was smelled good. Two fingers deep.

996
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,850
Easy man. Easy. We're talking
about love over here. Yeah,

997
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,820
so this Guy Brin talks
about radical transparency,

998
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:36,320
which is eventually everything will
be known by everyone like this.

999
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,430
That's what I think it means and
that's, that's, that's real man.

1000
00:54:39,431 --> 00:54:43,600
You're talking about. I feel that.
I feel that when I get high, I do.

1001
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,420
Sometimes when I get high,
it sounds so stupid,

1002
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,230
but when I get really stupid
high and I'm just alone thinking,

1003
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,530
that's what I think of.
I think of the,

1004
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,360
I feel like we are just a few months away.
It seems like,

1005
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,600
I know maybe it's a years,

1006
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,960
but I feel like we are just a few months
away from everybody hitting some new

1007
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:07,290
level of understanding. Yeah. And each

1008
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,650
other. Have you noticed that everything
is speeding up and I feel like the,

1009
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:15,580
even the rate, why don't you get up
Brian? You panic. The rate of, uh,

1010
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,080
the rate of these disclosures about
what the government is doing now.

1011
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:22,140
It's like everyday there's
a new braking leak.

1012
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,360
It's not like it used to be where there's,
you know,

1013
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,360
every now and then some big story every
day there's something huge in the news.

1014
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:32,361
Look at Turkey where you have a young
tech savvy population getting sick of this

1015
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:36,150
guy who is trying to clamp down,
you know, he's saying, all right,

1016
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:41,151
we've got to ban alcohol and we have to
a limit and get rid of public affection

1017
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:45,450
in public places. No more holding hands
or kissing. And the young people who,

1018
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,060
who spent their whole life on the
internet, it's like, fuck this dude,

1019
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:51,420
let's all go out and protest. And that's
what you're seeing in Turkey right now.

1020
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,520
It's insane. Yeah. It's
uh, it's not just Turkey.

1021
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,860
Do you see Brazil? Yeah.
Brazil in Sao Paulo.

1022
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:03,120
Brazil is taking the Brazilian photos.
Look at those photos. Look up there,

1023
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,620
Jesus,
man.

1024
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,680
And why can't we get even get 20 people
out to an NDA protest in front of us

1025
00:56:09,981 --> 00:56:12,720
Federal Court House Week and we're soft.

1026
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,970
We're like those people that we
were talking about, we're like,

1027
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,230
we're like the spoiled kids,

1028
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,900
the kids in the Khakis and where
the people that didn't earn this,

1029
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,390
we're not the same people that
fought in World War II. Okay.

1030
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,070
It's a different group group of
humans. They, they, those were

1031
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,930
gritty survivors that just dug their
fucking heels in and got shit done.

1032
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,420
And they were scared. They had
just gotten off of the depression.

1033
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,960
They just gotten off of people waiting
in soup lines and people just got shit

1034
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:38,250
done. And there was a lot of bad
to that too though, man. That,

1035
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:43,180
that sort of like desperado
society creates a lot of assholes,

1036
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:43,841
you know,

1037
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:47,290
creates a lot of mean motherfuckers that
do whatever they gotta do to get by.

1038
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,960
I don't think that's
necessarily necessary either.

1039
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,890
There was a guy sitting next to me
earlier today at this restaurant bar.

1040
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:58,510
I was at getting lunch and he asked to
see like a menu and he asked for the

1041
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:01,480
price of like a sprite or coke.
He was for a sprite.

1042
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,730
I think I gave him the price and
you're like, side. He's like,

1043
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,530
and then he was asking if there's
anything cheaper on the menu. He was like,

1044
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,960
is there anything else? Is it,
uh, and I was thinking if you're,

1045
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:15,410
if you're in that kind of place, you
should try to find a job and like, ha ha,

1046
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,820
you know, at least $20 stored up before
you walk into a restaurant to get lunch.

1047
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,600
And I feel like there are a lot of
people who just are not putting in a full

1048
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:23,434
effort.

1049
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:28,440
Well, there's that and there's also that
the amount of jobs available today are

1050
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:31,940
shockingly low and they're not, they're
not good jobs. Our time bullshit.

1051
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,190
But I think that,
and this is very easy for me to say,

1052
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:39,120
obviously I recognize this
a hundred percent so I
apologize before I even say it,

1053
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:44,420
but I think that with
desperation comes innovation.

1054
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:47,760
And I think when you're in a situation
where you don't know what the fuck to do,

1055
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,960
your mind will scramble and you will try
to figure out a better way to live your

1056
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:54,750
life. Whether it's start your own
business, whether it's, you know,

1057
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,770
do something innovative, do
something, come up with an idea.

1058
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,190
But through desperation,
many incredible ideas have been started.

1059
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:05,490
And so many great people have stories
where they talk about rock bottom.

1060
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,020
They were fucking eating ketchup
sandwiches in their shitty one bedroom

1061
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,500
apartment and then they went fucking
crazy and created a business.

1062
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,800
Whatever it is that takes you to figure
out how to find your place in the world.

1063
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,060
Understand this, it's difficult. It's
going to be puzzling along the way.

1064
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:26,310
You gonna to not know
whether you go left or right,

1065
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,050
whether you should sacrifice your
morals for performance or for success.

1066
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,550
There's going to be moments where you,

1067
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:37,020
you don't know what to do and what
not to do, but you can get through it.

1068
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,210
Other people have, other people have
been poor and then not been poor anymore.

1069
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,390
Other people been miserable and
then figured out a way to be happy.

1070
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,140
Other people have been lonely and figured
out a way to be loved and to be worth

1071
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:53,070
being loved, you know, which is
like step one. It's possible,

1072
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,120
but it's not fucking easy.
And the government's not
helping. That's the problem.

1073
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:58,620
We don't have any real leaders.

1074
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:02,120
Well we have as a bunch of people
that decide what we can't do. Also

1075
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,930
venting innovation because you
talked about that desperation,

1076
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:09,490
how it breeds people that come with the
right solution that's actually happening.

1077
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:12,080
And you look at all the innovation
in terms of people are like,

1078
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,760
this Federal Reserve stuff is bullshit.

1079
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:18,250
Doesn't make sense anymore for us to do
things in this way. So you have bitcoin,

1080
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:23,540
uh, is created a few years ago and other
digital currencies and the government

1081
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:26,560
instead of stepping back, which is
what the Economist magazine, uh,

1082
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,210
and an editorial said that the government
should do is just leave this alone,

1083
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:32,870
let it grow for a little while. This
could be the next, uh, you know,

1084
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:36,260
in the same way that American made a lot
of money off the Internet in the 90s,

1085
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,200
digital currency could be the
next boom or at least one of them.

1086
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,290
And instead of allowing this thing
to grow and see what comes out of it,

1087
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,300
they're already cracking down big time.

1088
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,020
Now what did they cracking down on and
is there any justification for that

1089
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:50,810
cracking down? Like is it,
they're completely unregulated.

1090
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:53,300
So is it open for the scammers?

1091
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,990
There's so many laws on the books in terms
of financial stuff that if you're not

1092
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:58,160
one of the big three banks,

1093
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,950
they can throw anything at you
until you run out of money.

1094
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,760
So in the bit coin example,
they want after homeland security,

1095
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:08,030
which this is not a terrorist thing.
So I'm not really sure why it's there.

1096
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,890
You know,
concern anyway.

1097
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,970
But a bunch of nerds trading digital
currency is not a threat to the United

1098
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,880
States.
And Homeland Security froze the account.

1099
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,120
That was one of the big exchanges
accounts in the United States,

1100
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,800
their wells Fargo account,
they froze it,

1101
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:24,920
which is like just freezing part of
that network to get money in and out of

1102
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:25,640
bitcoin.

1103
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,180
So bitcoin is still fine because there
are other providers who don't have as

1104
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:30,350
much of a US footprint,

1105
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,220
but the fact that they're even doing
that shit means that they are concerned

1106
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:37,190
about it. And instead they should be
doing the opposite. She'd be like,

1107
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:38,120
we're going to give grants,

1108
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:42,380
government grants to startups that are
exploring digital currency cause this

1109
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,730
could be the future of the world.

1110
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,230
And I'd rather see America be the ones
to create it instead of it being created

1111
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:52,460
in Europe as the cases with
bitcoin being created in Japan, uh,

1112
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:56,180
we're losing out on this
one. We were losing out with
stem cells where, you know,

1113
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:00,500
under Bush we got all this retarded
stuff about not exploring stem cells.

1114
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,930
And so other countries just,
we're like, we'll do it.

1115
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,110
And now if you're a wealthy American and
you want to get some kind of stem cell

1116
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:06,944
operation,

1117
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,500
from what I understand that you have
to fly to one of these other countries.

1118
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,890
Germany. Yeah. Germany. Okay.
Cause we don't have a wife
just got back from Germany.

1119
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:15,240
He's telling me how awesome this
Koby Bryant went there and then

1120
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,550
money that the u s is losing
out on us jobs. You know,

1121
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:23,380
it's fucked up just because our government
is acting in this regressive way

1122
01:01:23,381 --> 01:01:24,214
instead of

1123
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,440
what we're supposed to be about,
which is entrepreneurship. And uh,

1124
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:33,170
that's where the big, the
big thing becomes like what
we're supposed to be about.

1125
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,130
Hey, be careful. Don't spill it on your
generic laptop. That's not an apple.

1126
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,350
What are you talking about?
This is an apple.

1127
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,120
It's a TV show that we duct taped it.

1128
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,850
Duct tape brand what's called Greeking
cause you make it so that it's

1129
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:45,860
indecipherable.
Is that because uh,

1130
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,970
apple will want money or
maybe the other way around.

1131
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:53,180
Like Sony won't want to give us
money. Right. Shows with the TV shows.

1132
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:57,500
I loop my brother. Yeah. For the, the
TV show. I have to do that. You, Oh,

1133
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,110
I'll ask you afterwards.
Official Shit.

1134
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:04,490
I almost forgot we were on TV or on the
internet or something. Whenever we are.

1135
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,110
Um, all this stuff that you, you say like,

1136
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,140
I know that you're not
like a cynical person,

1137
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:11,030
which is like really hard
for people to believe.

1138
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,280
If you listen to all the things you
say. I'm super optimistic. Yeah.

1139
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:16,190
Isn't that crazy?

1140
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,400
I wrote an ebook about,
uh,

1141
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:22,530
how our is like actually a really positive
one and even this stuff that I talk

1142
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:27,000
about now, they're just road bumps on
the way to what is going to be complete.

1143
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,740
I think probably complete abundance.

1144
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,010
We had to get through Nixon
to get to Clinton. Right?

1145
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,300
I think Clinton was a high point for
this country. I really do. You know,

1146
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,690
for theirs there was certainly a lot
of fuckery going on during the Clinton

1147
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:39,760
administration and there was some,
you know,

1148
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,420
it's not to say that
people didn't die or there,

1149
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:46,840
there weren't operations that
went on that I'm sure you were,

1150
01:02:46,841 --> 01:02:50,860
I wouldn't have approved of. But other
than that, it was a time of prosperity.

1151
01:02:50,861 --> 01:02:53,530
And it seemed like a time where everything
seemed like it was going to be okay.

1152
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,790
And something happened during the Bush
administration where everything went dark

1153
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,890
and it didn't feel like it
was going to be okay at all.

1154
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:05,100
And my perception of America and the
world itself changed radically from the

1155
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:10,201
1990s to the the two thousands it was
a totally different world when in the

1156
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:15,661
1990s the biggest dilemma was that they
wanted to impeach Clinton because he got

1157
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:16,130
hit

1158
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,360
right.
It was hilarious.

1159
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:20,180
And there were articles in Time magazine
about how people have too much money.

1160
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:23,960
We're creating too many.com millionaires.
What do we do with this is amazing.

1161
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,430
And that was our problem is that,
you know,

1162
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:27,620
real estate prices in
the valley are too high.

1163
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,270
What are we going to do as a country?

1164
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,540
And that people were buying a house and
then selling it six months later for

1165
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,780
twice what they bought it for. It
was just, it was Cuckoo, you know,

1166
01:03:35,781 --> 01:03:39,920
and Vladimir Putin, I remember this
quote that he said, he said, uh,

1167
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:41,960
I don't understand the American economy.

1168
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,110
They seem to just buy and
sell each other's houses.

1169
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,360
I mean it's true for what? A
shitty accent. That was nice.

1170
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,950
We're not calling me out.
I saw this on reddit and Soviet Russia,

1171
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,430
internet browsers.
You or no,

1172
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,440
it was in Soviet America cause
they're making fun of the NSA program.

1173
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,303
Oh that's funny.
Yeah

1174
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,780
and funnier because it's so true.
It is what it is.

1175
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:04,920
We become exactly what we thought
they were doing it spying on all their

1176
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:05,401
citizens,

1177
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:08,010
trying to prevent the scent because they
lived in a shit hole country and they

1178
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,830
didn't want freedom or they
didn't want them to get freedom.

1179
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:14,430
That's what we always felt about Russia.
That was always our jab about Russia.

1180
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:19,440
Fox. You seen the Steve Wasniak video? No,
you guys got to pull that up. What is it?

1181
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,280
Pull it up.

1182
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,780
He was in an airport and the
Spanish language reporters
came up to him for their

1183
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:27,540
blog or whatever, and they were
asking about the NSA program.

1184
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,260
And I think about just like the
future of America. And he talks about,

1185
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,450
I don't want to quote him exactly,

1186
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:36,600
but he talks about how America has kind
of lost its way and how we're becoming

1187
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:41,580
more like Soviet Russia. And for him to
say that because he's a super positive,

1188
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:45,810
like sweet dude, cofounder
of Apple, insanely rich,

1189
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:48,810
but still so down to earth that he'll
talk to anybody. That's just the video.

1190
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:49,650
Right.
And that's the video,

1191
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,030
like that kind of gray or there

1192
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:00,280
I think, I think I like all
the visuals work. Yup. Yeah,

1193
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,260
he's talking about a phone first.
It gets into

1194
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:09,480
party apps and things like
that. So really great to do

1195
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,850
other countries when they got
cruiser in a war, they culture,

1196
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,790
but we Americans did portrait, we're
good food and all the and everything.

1197
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:21,420
And I was so proud of my country,
you know?

1198
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:24,040
And now I find out it's just the opposite,
you know?

1199
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:28,510
And I just wished all these things I
talked about the constitution that made us

1200
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:30,820
so good as people.
They're kind of nothing.

1201
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:34,350
They all dissolve with the Patriot
Act, you know, and there's just laws,

1202
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,110
laws that say we can just sort of
secretly call anything terrorism and do

1203
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:42,510
anything but walk it out, all these
rights courts to get in and take care.

1204
01:05:42,511 --> 01:05:46,930
I'm doing the wrong things,
not even free open court anymore.

1205
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:50,170
And he read the Constitution.
I don't know all this stuff.

1206
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,830
So clear what the constitution says.

1207
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,940
Extremely clear in the bill of rights.
One thing after another,

1208
01:05:57,941 --> 01:06:02,050
after another that just that overturned
and that's what it came down.

1209
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,770
He just goes out. Has anyone rounded
up and killed, keep the prison.

1210
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,770
When I was brought up, we were
taught that communist Russia was the,

1211
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,200
the ones that were going
to kill us and Bob,

1212
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,310
mark country and all this and communist
Russia was so bad because they followed

1213
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:20,170
their people that they swooped on them.
So they, uh, they, they arrested them,

1214
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:22,240
they put them in secret prisons,
they disappeared them.

1215
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,250
These kinds of things were part of Russia.

1216
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:29,100
Yeah. Kind of breaks your heart, right?

1217
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:33,060
Cause this is the guy who made it in
America based on what we believe in.

1218
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:34,770
And now he's in an airport,

1219
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:38,790
he's middle aged and he's seeing that
this revolution that he was a part of the

1220
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:43,170
technology revolution is
being used against people
instead of being used to help

1221
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:43,990
people.

1222
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:47,530
We have a real problem with
the leadership of this world.

1223
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,600
And when I say this world that I don't
mean in any sort of new world order sense.

1224
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,200
I mean leadership across the board,
every single country,

1225
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,920
everywhere you go, every single
leader of every single nation,

1226
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:05,700
we don't have a leadership that fits in
with the psychedelic nature of 2013 and

1227
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,090
when I say psychedelic nature,
I don't even mean drugs.

1228
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,230
I mean the idea behind psychedelics,

1229
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,650
when someone talks about having a
psychedelic experience and oh my God,

1230
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:24,360
it was like a psychedelic trip.
What they mean besides the, uh,

1231
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,420
the hallucination aspect is that
this trip has transcended them,

1232
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:33,940
has moved them into this new place,
has made them step back and look at it.

1233
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:37,570
It could be a near death experience.
It could be the loss of a friend.

1234
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:41,020
It could be a pet dying,
it could be a new,

1235
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,790
you're getting fired
and getting a new job.

1236
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,510
There's many things in life you could see
a starlit night and it's a psychedelic

1237
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:47,344
experience

1238
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,730
that that is where we're going.

1239
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:56,110
Where we're going is newer booms,
newer woes,

1240
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:59,290
newer connections,
new understandings,

1241
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,580
newer uncoverings of hidden
truths and and, and we're,

1242
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:08,080
we're getting closer and closer to each
other and what the government is doing

1243
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:12,460
is the exact opposite of that.
What they're trying to do is control,

1244
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,310
get people scared.

1245
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:20,740
Control resources dictate their
rules on as many people as possible.

1246
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,620
Make it so they can't be prosecuted for
the same thing they actually prosecute

1247
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:27,860
people for but never be
called hypocritical control.

1248
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:32,060
All the resources control what they're
doing is non psychedelic with they're

1249
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:35,630
doing is what the ego does when
it's desperate, when it's sad,

1250
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:38,960
when you're trying to cover up for a lie,
when you're trying to,

1251
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,320
you're trying to attend, you're something,
you're not dealing with mortality.

1252
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,750
You know, if you think you need
complete control over other people,

1253
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,940
that's some kind of
weird foil to get around.

1254
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:48,560
The fact that you're
gonna be dead in 30 years.

1255
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,690
Our society needs to be psychedelic.

1256
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,110
And I don't say that in the
way that a lot of people think.

1257
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,620
A lot of people think when
you say something should be
psychedelic like a little

1258
01:08:57,621 --> 01:09:01,250
bit, you just want to escape reality.
Fucking hippie. That's not what I mean.

1259
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:05,690
I went, I mean embrace reality, embrace
reality in its broadest sense possible.

1260
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:09,770
And it's brought a sense possible.
We are all exactly the same.

1261
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,990
And that me, I don't mean that
in any hippie sort of a way.

1262
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,200
I mean that we are temporary beings
on this strange course that no one

1263
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:25,190
understands and we all have a certain
amount of years to recognize that we're on

1264
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:29,840
this thing and then this thing's going
to end and W it's going to end badly.

1265
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,500
The body's gonna stop working. There
was a sales will reproduce incorrectly.

1266
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:37,520
You're going to cheat. Your stature
changed your, your health fades,

1267
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,450
your energy wanes. Intellect goes away.
It goes away the child. And then you die.

1268
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,690
So during that time we have
to figure out what is this,

1269
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:47,510
what is this and what
are we trying to do here?

1270
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:52,220
And if what you're trying to do is control
resources and down AP people and make

1271
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,240
as much money as possible,

1272
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:58,510
you are just as sad as some kid is
born in Ethiopia where there's no food.

1273
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:03,380
You're just as sad as someone who is on
an island that doesn't have any books.

1274
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:06,830
It's all a mis.
It's all a mess.

1275
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,980
And the Psychedelic Society of 2013
that transcendent experience of the

1276
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:13,341
Internet,

1277
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:18,110
the ability to communicate with each
other from long distances instantaneously.

1278
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,640
That's very psychedelic

1279
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,400
interview with one of the engineers at
Google who a overseas youtube and just

1280
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:28,630
the process of a youtube video uploading
and then propagating on all their cache

1281
01:10:28,631 --> 01:10:30,220
servers is a,

1282
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:34,570
it's kind of psychedelic in the sense
that within seconds of your video being

1283
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,520
uploaded less than that,
like immediately,

1284
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:40,870
it's on servers all over the
planet because when you, uh,

1285
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:42,250
when you go to a youtube video,

1286
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,070
it's serving you the video from a
server that's relatively close to you.

1287
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,530
And maybe one in California or something.
Uh,

1288
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,640
somebody in South America is getting a
local version of their youtube video and

1289
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:55,810
then all the data on the hits from
each of those local servers is coming

1290
01:10:55,811 --> 01:11:00,280
together. And that's the youtube view
counter how many hits the video has.

1291
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,440
So it's actually coming from all
these different data centers.

1292
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:06,310
There's not one number, it's a bunch of
numbers that are being, uh, you know,

1293
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:10,150
put together. And just the
way he explained it as like,
this is fucking insane.

1294
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,060
You know, like that somebody in their,
in their basement like, uh, uh, you know,

1295
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:18,360
the big famous video bloggers out
there can put up their video and within

1296
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:20,190
seconds it's literally all over the world.

1297
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:24,810
And if that idea has any kind of value,
it propagates within hours like that.

1298
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:26,660
Edward Snowden video,
uh,

1299
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:30,330
was on the homepage of youtube because
so many people found it to be significant

1300
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,680
rose right to the top.

1301
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,980
I think we are going to have
to accept a new paradigm,

1302
01:11:34,981 --> 01:11:38,370
including the government
and the government's trying
to stave off that paradigm

1303
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:41,340
by creating a bunch of rules.
And by taking away people's rights,

1304
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,900
but they're not going to be able to,

1305
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,880
by having so many rules that you
can selectively enforce it. Yeah.

1306
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:50,440
Like I'm sure this stuff they're using
against Bitcoin, they're not using against

1307
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,200
Bank of America or
Citibank. Yeah. Well the,

1308
01:11:53,201 --> 01:11:56,430
the selective enforcement aspect of it is,
it's,

1309
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:00,080
it's funny because what they're trying to
do as I can trying to control judgment,

1310
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:02,580
they're kind of trying to control the,
the,

1311
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:05,480
the will of the people that
trying to control, you know,

1312
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,230
the popular opinion they're trying to,

1313
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,110
they're trying to control human beings
as a resource because all the power comes

1314
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:15,560
through the human beings. It all
flows from the money, from the taxes,

1315
01:12:15,561 --> 01:12:16,311
from the votes,

1316
01:12:16,311 --> 01:12:19,460
from the whatever that you get into a
position of power and you're the top of

1317
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:20,060
that pyramid.

1318
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,570
Then you can enforce regulations and
rules and change things and you could do

1319
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:26,780
things that people never want.
Like the NDA when you,

1320
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,890
all of a sudden you have
indefinite detention and
people don't even get lawyers

1321
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,970
and you're like, what? The Russian
doesn't even do that. I think, uh,

1322
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,180
one of my do they, they might, I
don't know enough about Russia.

1323
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:41,360
They probably would do that. I just know
that our t is filled with nice people.

1324
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,890
They are very nice.
Isn't that weird?

1325
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:47,030
It's like you would think Russia today
would be like the shittiest bunch of

1326
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:50,210
assholes and, but he could do,
they suck. They're all severe.

1327
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,550
Super Nice. Uh, yeah. I forgot what I was
gonna say. Let's think about Russia today,

1328
01:12:55,790 --> 01:13:00,020
but, uh, it, uh, where are
we talking about here? Um,

1329
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:04,400
we were talking about the
monarch. Oh yeah. I know that.
But um, it'll come to me.

1330
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:07,880
I had the specific idea about something.
Oh, okay. It's all this Jamison.

1331
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:08,410
It's kind of,

1332
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:11,650
yeah. Was going to my brand
whiskey is not good for the dome.

1333
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,920
The government lacks it.
Don't they tried to take that away.

1334
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:17,350
Then there'll be the real riots of me.
That's what it really,

1335
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:21,220
we really need to take away liquor, liquor
and cigarettes. Make it all illegal.

1336
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,200
Yeah.

1337
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,650
Hey, hey, calm down. Oh, I'm saying I
remember what, I have a real revolution.

1338
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,000
I remember I was going to
say, sorry about that. Uh,

1339
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,440
I have this kind of science
fiction dystopian view that
when the NDA was signed

1340
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,990
and you know, I was vocal about
this nonstop, when that was signed,

1341
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,220
that was one of these like branches or
forks in history where we should have all

1342
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:41,850
come out.

1343
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:46,200
We should have all came out and protested
and people who had positions of power,

1344
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:46,381
you know,

1345
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:51,150
TV anchors and senators who
are not compromised by their
own parties should have

1346
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:54,030
said, this is fucking bullshit.
Since when can you PR in prison,

1347
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:57,720
American citizens without a trial
on the basis of suspicion alone.

1348
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,700
That's fundamentally UNAMERICAN it,

1349
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:04,200
it makes North Korea look like on
the same level as us to do that shit.

1350
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,100
Why would we allow that? This needs
to be immediately fixed. You know,

1351
01:14:08,101 --> 01:14:12,190
like next week we need an amendment to
fix whatever the you did on New Year's

1352
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,460
Eve.

1353
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,810
But instead life just kind of went on as
normal and it was like a twilight zone

1354
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:17,471
episode.
You know,

1355
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:22,180
I noticed this group of activists and
journalists have raised money and they

1356
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:25,360
went to New York to fight this shit
in federal court and they could barely

1357
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:28,510
afford the legal and the travel costs
and they're fighting the most powerful

1358
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:32,140
government on earth in court, which can
keep throwing money at this forever.

1359
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:36,340
And that's when I started to lose
faith in the system. Cause I'm like,

1360
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,510
well why are they doing this?
You know,

1361
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:41,230
Obama had the signing statement
saying that he, he signed it into law,

1362
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,290
but he doesn't like this provision.
He doesn't trust that provision.

1363
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,720
Well then why do you keep
fighting for that right in court.

1364
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:50,080
If you don't want that and you signed
it away and you're signing statement,

1365
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,330
then why do you keep fighting
for it in federal court?

1366
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,850
And at that point I was like,
this is, this is fucked.

1367
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,650
I think it's again, what we keep saying.
Why do you, why does he, why do you,

1368
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,570
I don't, I don't think it's a
you. I don't think it's a, Hey,

1369
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,370
well then I don't think anybody,
but we have to.

1370
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,400
Anybody gets any of the real power him
somewhere. I mean, we certainly do.

1371
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,040
If you go to a wall,
it's like a corporation type blame.

1372
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,690
Well that's valid though.

1373
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:14,110
If you go to a Walmart and you slip on
the floor because the floor is dirty and

1374
01:15:14,111 --> 01:15:16,570
wet,
you write a letter to the CEO,

1375
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:19,210
even though he wasn't personally
there to mop that floor.

1376
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:23,410
And the same way Obama is the figurehead
for this federal government and its

1377
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,870
current form.
So if we can't place the blame there,

1378
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:29,320
if we can't petition him to make
things better, who can we petition?

1379
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,040
Well, that's a good question,
but I think that it's in,

1380
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:35,760
and it's impossible at this point in
the game to control the whole thing.

1381
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,500
There's no,
there's no way.

1382
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:40,650
There's no way he could have his
fingers in every hole in the dike.

1383
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:44,110
There's just too much going on.
That's not what I'm at

1384
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:50,550
right after I said it. I'm like,
fuck. Um, there's, there's,

1385
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:51,301
there's no way.

1386
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:55,200
And I think the idea that he's responsible
for everything the government does,

1387
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,290
it's preposterous, right? Because
there's no way you could be.

1388
01:15:58,291 --> 01:15:59,124
There's no way you could.

1389
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,050
There's no way you could have a handle
on all that shit. There's no way.

1390
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,130
There's too many things going on. You've
got the FBI, the NSA, the DEA, the FBI,

1391
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:12,270
the Coast Guard, the air force, the
army, the marines, the navy seals,

1392
01:16:12,271 --> 01:16:15,240
the green berets come on
the rangers. You, you,

1393
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:17,340
you don't know what the
fuck everybody's doing.

1394
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:20,460
You can know what the fuck
everybody's doing. It's ridiculous.

1395
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,970
The idea that we have an Obama in the
first place, that we have a president,

1396
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:28,920
that we have one dude. This is the
Alpha male chimpanzee bullshit.

1397
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,030
We have a human being that we spend
hundreds of millions of dollars of our

1398
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:36,980
collective taxpayer money to fly that
person somewhere else with 14 limousines

1399
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:40,070
and bulletproof glass everywhere.
It's like a,

1400
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:44,000
some kind of fetishization
of a personality. You know,

1401
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:46,250
it's one thing to have celebrities
because at the end of the day,

1402
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,210
at the end of the day, celebrities
are chosen by us. You know?

1403
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:54,140
That's what it comes down to is we
choose who we want to focus and unhealthy

1404
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:57,860
amount of attention on like the
Kardashians. Collectively we choose that.

1405
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,760
But how many people are actively choosing
to pay for somebody like Obama or by

1406
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:05,180
the way, President Bush took
expensive vacations also. Uh,

1407
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,260
who exactly decided that this kind of
imperial we have now where your vesting so

1408
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:15,740
much power in that one person and yet
like you said, this makes a lot of sense.

1409
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:19,760
That person doesn't have all that much
influence to actually change course.

1410
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,120
So then why are we treating them like
they're a god? Because it's a figurehead.

1411
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,470
It's a

1412
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,810
someone that you, you have with
the head of your organization.

1413
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:29,690
We still as chimpanzees,
you know,

1414
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:33,650
or as the descendants or the ancestors
or whatever the fuck we are, the, the,

1415
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:36,160
the new breed of how fucking ape,

1416
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:38,240
how do we get past the
chimpanzees and to that thing?

1417
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,040
I think we needed mushrooms.
I really do. It sounds like,

1418
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:48,050
you know, it sounds like hippie nonsense,
but I really think just logically,

1419
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,950
if it's not mushrooms, we need
something that brings us all together.

1420
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:52,880
It might be ecstasy.

1421
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:56,930
One of my most profound psychedelic
experiences I ever had was on ecstasy.

1422
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,390
And I only did it once because the,
uh,

1423
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:03,410
the rebound of it was way too
strong the next day. I can't,

1424
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:07,160
I can't refer a crash the next day.
It was horrible. It was horrible.

1425
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,220
And I don't know if it's just me or if
it was mixed with something or whatever

1426
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:10,810
it was.

1427
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:14,080
Do any PR like pills with it,
like five HTP or anything

1428
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,140
cause you won't have that.

1429
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,710
You just had a really bad
experience because you didn't creed,

1430
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,920
planet and Post Planet.

1431
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,180
Yeah,
I took two pills too.

1432
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:24,400
I think you're only supposed to take one
the first time you do it and whatever.

1433
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,350
What,
but whatever the point is,

1434
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:31,230
it was profound and it made
me understand a lot about, um,

1435
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,040
about insecurities,

1436
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:38,170
mine and other peoples about
love and about what's possible.

1437
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,280
If you're warm, you know, the, the,

1438
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:43,480
the warmth and friend
friendliness and happiness,

1439
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:48,220
that that shit is contagious
and it spreads and good,

1440
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:53,200
good energy spreads just as easily as
bad energy does. But good energy is,

1441
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,840
it's way better.
It's way better for you.

1442
01:18:55,841 --> 01:19:00,841
It feels better and it's possible
for anyone to change in midstream.

1443
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,360
It's possible for anyone to just start
slowly adjusting their life into a more

1444
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:11,860
harmonious path. And that includes
all the people that are running shit.

1445
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,390
And guess what?
Along the way,

1446
01:19:13,391 --> 01:19:16,060
a lot of you motherfuckers are probably
going to wind up getting busted doing

1447
01:19:16,061 --> 01:19:19,390
something stupid. You know,
there's probably a lot of
people right now that are,

1448
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:22,990
that have like gambling
problems or you know,

1449
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:27,940
prostitution problems or you know x fill
in the blank that it's all gonna come

1450
01:19:27,941 --> 01:19:31,120
to light. All of it's going to come
to light. There's no way to avoid it.

1451
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,830
But I think ultimately it's the,

1452
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,600
the best thing for everybody
that we are moving in a way,

1453
01:19:37,601 --> 01:19:39,880
and this is very science fiction utopian,

1454
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:43,960
but we're moving in a way where
we're going to merge consciousness.

1455
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:49,230
That seems to me to be the only
step that's at the end of this path.

1456
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:50,890
If you look at what's going on,

1457
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:55,940
the complete lack of privacy that we now
have in regards to the way we interface

1458
01:19:57,071 --> 01:19:59,470
with the government.
The government can check your emails,

1459
01:19:59,471 --> 01:20:02,260
the government can check, your tax,
government could check a Twitter,

1460
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:06,310
and I think eventually you and I
are going to have that same issue.

1461
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:09,480
We all going to be able to access
all of each other's emails.

1462
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:11,920
We're all going to be able to contact
each other. We're all going to be able to,

1463
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,160
what comes after that?
Well,

1464
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:16,440
the only thing that comes after that
is some sort of a convergence of

1465
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:17,274
consciousness.

1466
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:21,000
It's going to be whether it's
technologically created or whether it's

1467
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:25,590
biologically induced as the next step
in evolution. Whatever the fuck it is.

1468
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,260
It seems like that's where it's going.
I mean, otherwise what does it do?

1469
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:29,280
It just stops

1470
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,510
and let's be all in
plug. I mean, none of us.

1471
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:34,570
That's the one thing that we're not
the worst to have his cell phone.

1472
01:20:34,571 --> 01:20:36,160
We're not forced to do any of this.

1473
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:39,220
We could just like a seriously turn off
her phone and then we're off the map.

1474
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:39,810
I honestly,
yeah,

1475
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:43,890
I think the only thing that would get
more than a few random Weirdos to unplug

1476
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,990
is a cataclysmic disaster. Something
that wipes out cell phone signals,

1477
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:52,830
a massive solar flare that torches every
satellite makes a start from scratch,

1478
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:53,851
whatever it is,

1479
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:58,200
something that fries every fucking
electrical system all over the globe.

1480
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,610
I've had a Weirdos contact
me and they're like, uh,

1481
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,460
I would like to share your stuff,
but I don't use Facebook because of the,

1482
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,980
you know, they track you and I'm
like, oh well you can, you know,

1483
01:21:05,981 --> 01:21:07,990
you can post it on Twitter I
guess, or whatever. I was like,

1484
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:11,080
why don't use Twitter either.
Like you could post on message boards,

1485
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,660
like why use tor encryption
or I use the tor browser.

1486
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:17,620
I don't like to go to websites too
frequently. Then just don't fucking live.

1487
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:19,800
You know? Like if you're going
to be that paranoid. Yeah.

1488
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,600
You think that Twitter and Facebook
are concerned about everything you're

1489
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:24,760
posting? Well not only
that, you have no influence.

1490
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:29,470
Your just the nobody in the forest. And
Are you doing shady shit? 24, seven.

1491
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,240
You know the government,
if you want to beat off to,

1492
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,060
I'm going to offer the
government something.

1493
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:38,830
If you want to beat off the same websites,
I beat off to look at my history.

1494
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:42,700
Okay, go ahead. I'm not doing anything
negative. I'm not fighting the power.

1495
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,680
Hoo Hoo. I got, I do beat off a lot. Fed
is up a porn. You got to check out man,

1496
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:51,820
uh, getting Dick for their first
time. Oh my God, it's great.

1497
01:21:51,821 --> 01:21:54,340
And I was talking to this lesbian
the other day and she's like, yeah,

1498
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:57,780
I broke up with like this girl that was
in a relationship for a long time and I

1499
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:00,320
went right to having Dick,
you know, for like a month.

1500
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,180
[inaudible] mean like lesbian.
Do you mean a strap on or like a Dick?

1501
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:07,690
Like she decided to fuck a guy that
she was friends with. What happened?

1502
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,440
And she says it was great,
but you know,

1503
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:12,790
if she's back into lesbian now because
whatever for whatever reasons. But I've,

1504
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,530
so I've been looking at porn,
you know,

1505
01:22:14,531 --> 01:22:18,610
like lesbian gets first dick ever and
it's just like the butch dykes and they're

1506
01:22:18,611 --> 01:22:23,530
just like, what the fuck? This is amazing.
It's great. It's good. It's a good,

1507
01:22:23,531 --> 01:22:27,370
I knew a search for the
first time. Yeah. Yeah.

1508
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:28,570
I think they're all in denial.

1509
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:31,810
All you girls out there that say you
don't like Dick when I never had deck.

1510
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:35,650
And that's how they all are having
had the right one yet. I feel

1511
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,680
I have a joke in my act about that.

1512
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:41,880
About how no guy see two girls work
in that working out. Okay, stop.

1513
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:44,250
I quit jokes over.

1514
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:50,790
No Guy sees two girls making out and
says, aw, too bad they don't like dudes.

1515
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,140
Guys don't think like,
like

1516
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,560
that. You Go, I just gotta get in there.

1517
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:58,790
We just get closer while we're, uh,
while we're talking about Dicks,

1518
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,950
there is a funny story on reddit recently,
how,

1519
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:04,820
you know how you always say powerful and
now it's like everybody uses powerful.

1520
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,100
Yeah, it's like this. And he stole that

1521
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,210
from my friend Larry. By
the way. Everybody is,

1522
01:23:08,211 --> 01:23:11,200
I think Verizon uses powerful
now in their ad campaigns.

1523
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,620
They should send you a royalty
checks. But, uh, so people,

1524
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,480
people take up other people's phrases,

1525
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:20,620
people say powerful now because of
what you say. Right. And on Reddit,

1526
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,600
this guy was complaining
that his college roommate,

1527
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,160
I was one of those people who's like,

1528
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:28,150
just absorbs all this social stuff around
him and uses other people's phrases

1529
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:31,600
like immediately and just adopts
their personality. So as a prank,

1530
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,380
they play it on this guy. They started
off saying, Dick in my ass, whenever,

1531
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:38,020
whenever something bad would
happen or they would lose it halo.

1532
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,970
And within like within a week,

1533
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:43,150
this guy is showing up to this class
late and yelling like Dick in my ass.

1534
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,740
Like I knew I should have
showed up earlier. And I'm like,

1535
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:48,070
just saying it all the time.
Oh my God. That's hilarious.

1536
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:50,410
Then it was a plot.
Yeah.

1537
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:55,180
It was this carefully orchestrated
test that's so rude and mean.

1538
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,770
Oh, the poor guy. But he feels
devastated. That's great.

1539
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,680
And knowing that he was played like that.
That's so common though,

1540
01:24:01,681 --> 01:24:04,800
if you're insecure. Especially when
I was, uh, when I was really young,

1541
01:24:04,801 --> 01:24:07,920
I had a Boston accent and they
didn't live in Boston that long.

1542
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:11,400
I lived in Boston from the time
I was 13 till I was like 24.

1543
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:15,300
But I had a Boston accent and I didn't
realize it until I heard myself on TV.

1544
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:19,310
I was 19. I heard myself on TV
just getting interviewed. And, uh,

1545
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,970
it was like, God, we've been working
really had, I was like, oh no.

1546
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,970
I realized that I wanted to be
like everybody else so badly.

1547
01:24:26,971 --> 01:24:27,804
I started talking like,

1548
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,010
well, it's also very strong. It's like
shit in a pool on that. So, you know,

1549
01:24:31,011 --> 01:24:34,070
it's just going to stick really.
But I moved there when I was 13,

1550
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:37,640
so six years later I have a stupid
accent. That's ridiculous. No,

1551
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:41,870
it was a sheep man. I was scared. I
wanted to be like everybody around me.

1552
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,750
I wanted to fit right in, you know, uh,

1553
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,670
how they used to talk weird and
like the forties and 50s. Oh yeah.

1554
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:51,160
St The don draper of coping
really well. How'd they talk? Uh,

1555
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,170
give me an example. Like the
admin voice, like a, you know,

1556
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:57,410
like on the battle front tonight, like
Blah Blah Blah, you know, very official.

1557
01:24:57,411 --> 01:25:01,400
I mean in the media they did that like
anchors and actors and actresses to,

1558
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,470
I would like to know what you
talked like in real life though.

1559
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,980
I read this recently,
apparently that accent is called,

1560
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,600
it's either called the Trans Atlantic or
the trans continental accent and it was

1561
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:14,090
not actually used by Americans back then.
It was something,

1562
01:25:14,091 --> 01:25:17,930
it was taught in boarding school. It was
considered like the proper way to speak.

1563
01:25:17,931 --> 01:25:21,710
So if you were a TV anchor or a famous
actor, you would use that onset.

1564
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,220
But Americans back then spoke like us,
which blows my mind.

1565
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,380
What I thought that they
all talk, like, you know,

1566
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:29,960
like mad men or not mad at him
like the 20 years before that,

1567
01:25:29,961 --> 01:25:32,230
I thought that was real.
But that's just the way they,

1568
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,520
the way they talk on TV and on radio.
And then when they're offset,

1569
01:25:37,521 --> 01:25:41,590
they're talking like us.
Is there any documentaries or I want to,

1570
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:43,670
you don't want to fact check
this one to get more info,

1571
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:46,220
but I'm pretty certain I'm right on this.
Is there any

1572
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:51,080
be awesome if we saw a reality show from
the 30s like could you imagine jersey

1573
01:25:51,081 --> 01:25:52,220
shore from the 30s

1574
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:56,000
no, I can't actually ride
around a model t's right.

1575
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:57,790
Fucking,
you know,

1576
01:25:57,791 --> 01:26:01,720
I mean just to imagine what it would
have been like to be around some people

1577
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:02,620
that just survived.

1578
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,220
Let's the main question tonight.

1579
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,890
That's why I like to watch boardwalk
empire cause you're seeing a,

1580
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,530
I mean it's probably glamorized obviously,
but yeah,

1581
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:12,630
it's just entertaining as hell
to see people. Yeah. Period.

1582
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:15,330
That's a brilliant show.
But it is probably glamorized.

1583
01:26:15,331 --> 01:26:18,120
That's the problem with the,
anything in regards to the history,

1584
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,750
there's so much guesswork.
There's so much. Uh,

1585
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:24,360
it would be really cool to
watch a documentary about
some people that lived in

1586
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:28,410
the 1930s and just, just to follow
them around. But then again,

1587
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,500
how comfortable would they be on camera?
That's the real issue.

1588
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:33,380
You would have to experience it yourself.
Yeah.

1589
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,770
It's hard to reach back into your
memory and have an accurate account of

1590
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:40,530
anything more than five or
six years ago. Really. Right.

1591
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,840
Uh, yeah. I mean this
is all such new stuff.

1592
01:26:43,841 --> 01:26:48,841
Like I saw a black and white photo set
of these guys getting there after work

1593
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:51,940
drinks at some pub in, uh, in England.

1594
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:55,270
And so that to me was,

1595
01:26:55,271 --> 01:26:57,310
it seemed like an accurate picture
of what was happening then.

1596
01:26:57,311 --> 01:26:59,620
Cause you see that these dudes
are just drinking after work.

1597
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,960
No cell phones on the table.
No bullshit.

1598
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:05,950
Just like average w because you
don't have any technology back then.

1599
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,200
And you could see that
their clothes were not as,

1600
01:27:08,201 --> 01:27:11,290
like not as polished as you seen
all the movies from that era.

1601
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,450
You could see like, you know,
tatters and stuff. You're like, oh,

1602
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:16,450
they're actually living through
a pretty tough time. You know,

1603
01:27:16,451 --> 01:27:20,260
you can see that without the, the gloss
that's been applied to other shows.

1604
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:24,310
Yeah. Um, it's, it's
still, it's like if you,

1605
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:29,470
if you could go back and live in a time
like that, I would love to do that.

1606
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:31,630
What would you really,
especially if you can pick an era,

1607
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:35,680
especially knowing which companies we're
going to take off, but uh, oh no, no, no,

1608
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:37,810
you can't do that.
That's illegal.

1609
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:41,800
I would love to live in 1920s even
the 1930s as long as you're not.

1610
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,020
And one of the, you know, poor families,

1611
01:27:44,021 --> 01:27:46,060
if you're doing well in the 30s
they did better than anybody.

1612
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:49,640
Yeah. But you would be faced with
so much despair. You'd be sad.

1613
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,760
I think they looked around
and saw all the people

1614
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:54,440
they coordinate themselves off from that.

1615
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:57,260
And the same way that we would be cool
with that. Not saying I'd be cool with it,

1616
01:27:57,261 --> 01:28:00,470
but look at the fact that, you
know, when this iPhone dies,

1617
01:28:00,471 --> 01:28:04,010
it's going to be picked apart by some
child and you know, somewhere in India,

1618
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:06,260
some trash heap for the
precious metals inside it.

1619
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:09,770
We still have all that same shit.
It's just been distanced from us.

1620
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:14,210
And I think people back
then had an amazing life if
they are in a certain social

1621
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:16,880
strata.
This is 1939

1622
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,630
color footage, which is very rare
for that, for that year. Wow.

1623
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:21,890
That girl was hot.

1624
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:26,891
She was bawling and 39 isn't it funny
that like that is like someone who's

1625
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:31,910
probably like four feet tall now
arched over and it's almost over,

1626
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,090
but she's creeping, creeping around.
I don't know. It might not be,

1627
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:39,490
might be a crypt keeper now.
Five.

1628
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:43,910
It's unbelievable. It's like we just,
we have a short amount of time here.

1629
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:47,130
I think about how weird it is that
all those people smoked constantly.

1630
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,180
So even like the hottest girl you'd hook
up with somebody who's smoking a couple

1631
01:28:51,181 --> 01:28:56,181
packs a day has like lines all over their
face from just nonstop smoking all the

1632
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:57,520
time.

1633
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,400
Have you ever met someone and uh,
then you saw them in like five years

1634
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,560
and it was like a hundred years had gone
by. Some people do not age well. Oh,

1635
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:09,360
well if someone gets on Meth,
that's the big one.

1636
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:12,090
I've seen the alcohol.
Yeah,

1637
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,250
I guess I like to tell myself
that I think preserving,

1638
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,550
preserving my body alcohol is,
that's what I like to tell myself.

1639
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:21,510
It might be in a way because he relaxed
a little bit and maybe you feel a little

1640
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:25,620
bit more positive energy
and that counteracts all
the continents in the world.

1641
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:28,950
Right? You know, there, there's, there's
definitely some benefit to alcohol,

1642
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:30,870
but you poisoning yourself.

1643
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:33,080
Did you hear that?

1644
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,980
I wanted to see if you saw that article
that was on today.com about bulletproof

1645
01:29:36,981 --> 01:29:38,630
coffee.
I don't know if you saw that or not.

1646
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,690
No, I did not. What did it say? It's bad.

1647
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,160
Uh, well they said that, you know,

1648
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:46,550
the reports of putting butter
in your coffee today. Dot Com.

1649
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:53,090
It's a, I, I tweeted it earlier. Uh,

1650
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,300
they sit there saying that,
you know, there's no, uh,

1651
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:01,130
evidence that butter in your coffee
does anything but it has more calories.

1652
01:30:01,131 --> 01:30:05,840
Here's the actual article, I guess
that's Today. Like NBC today,

1653
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,210
I guess.

1654
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:11,860
Well, let me, let me just give you
some input right away. First of all,

1655
01:30:11,861 --> 01:30:16,861
coffee caffeine has shown how benefits
shown to have benefits on cognitive

1656
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:21,970
function shown to have obviously obvious
benefits on energy. So there's that.

1657
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:27,360
Then when you take coffee with grass fed
butter and MCT oil and they talk about

1658
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:28,270
the MCT oil here,

1659
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:33,160
what it does is it makes it
a slower digestible thing.

1660
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:36,760
Like it's, it takes a longer
time for your body to process it.

1661
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,260
Whereas if you have just like a Venti
Starbucks black that goes like right in

1662
01:30:41,261 --> 01:30:46,180
your bloodstream song
didn't have bulletproof coffee.

1663
01:30:46,181 --> 01:30:49,000
If you have grass fed butter and MCT oil,

1664
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,820
you're going to get a lot more calories
and it's a lot fatter and it's all

1665
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:55,960
blended together and so it will take
hours for your body to digest that as

1666
01:30:55,961 --> 01:31:00,760
opposed to just the straight coffee.
I've lost weight using MCT oil.

1667
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:04,750
Mct Oil is very good for, you
know, a debate about that.

1668
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:09,520
If you don't know what it is, it's a
medium chain triglyceride oil and um,

1669
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:13,660
it's the most healthy
aspect of coconut oil.

1670
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,350
They take coconut oil and they have some
sort of a process with the centrifuge.

1671
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:20,770
And coconut oil is one of
the best things I've heard.

1672
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:23,710
One of the best oils you can
use to jerk off to. Yeah,

1673
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:28,590
it's supposed to be really good for that.
That's what I hear too. I just here. Um,

1674
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:33,530
so if you're, you know, if you don't
have an issue with cholesterol, um,

1675
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,430
I wouldn't think there's anything
wrong with bulletproof coffee,

1676
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:39,370
but if you do have an issue with
cholesterol, you're dealing with,

1677
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,170
even though everybody says
it's healthy cholesterol,

1678
01:31:41,171 --> 01:31:45,400
we live in a strange world and some
people have like real health problems with

1679
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,360
all sorts of things that for other
folks would be no problem whatsoever.

1680
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:53,530
So if you thinking about taking, you
know, um, bulletproof coffee, you know,

1681
01:31:53,531 --> 01:31:56,740
look into it, find out what your,
you know, we, where your body's at,

1682
01:31:56,741 --> 01:31:59,650
unless you know you're okay. But if, okay,

1683
01:31:59,651 --> 01:32:02,710
with high cholesterol foods
or high calorie foods,

1684
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:07,900
the benefit of the bulletproof coffee
recipe is that it takes a longer time for

1685
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:12,700
you to digest it. So basically it
said all the benefits of coffee with,

1686
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:14,920
um,
a slower digestion period.

1687
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:19,540
So there's nothing mystery
mysterious about it. There's
nothing magical about it.

1688
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:23,530
Well, the, the amount that you drink every
day, which is a huge, like Starbucks,

1689
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:28,060
like what does that Trenta
Trenta canister? It's 20 ounces.

1690
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,640
So they're saying like each cup of coffee,

1691
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:33,940
just a cup of coffee has about
a hundred to 200 calories in it.

1692
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:37,570
So you're eating a ton of cow.
That's enough.

1693
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:41,230
And that's not including the fat, but
what, what they're including the fat.

1694
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:45,790
That's the whole idea of calories. The
calories come from. Yeah, but I mean,

1695
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,620
I'm sorry. Some diets
you, you want it, you're,

1696
01:32:47,621 --> 01:32:52,270
you're looking at calories and
fat intake. But uh, and this,

1697
01:32:52,271 --> 01:32:54,190
this thing that the claim
here is it that MCT,

1698
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:57,790
because it's faster digesting compared
to other fats is an energy booster.

1699
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:00,250
But there's no evidence in this,
but they're pretty much just saying that,

1700
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:03,940
you know, uh, it, uh, be
mindful of the extra calories.

1701
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:06,760
Don't expect weight loss
or enter any extra energy.

1702
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:10,990
That's not necessarily true
because it really is filling.

1703
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:16,290
And if you take 300 or 400 calories in
the form of bulletproof coffee in the

1704
01:33:17,231 --> 01:33:17,800
morning,

1705
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,190
you might not eat until one o'clock in
the afternoon and you might feel good.

1706
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:21,850
You might,

1707
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:25,480
you're not feeling depleted because
you're getting all these healthy fats and

1708
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:27,970
MCT oil and grass fed butter.

1709
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:31,690
And that's where it's really important
because grass fed animals are far

1710
01:33:31,691 --> 01:33:35,190
healthier than corn fed animals.
And see the difference in the,

1711
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:39,640
the tube steak cuts clearly, and this
is not, this is not hippy bullshit.

1712
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,150
If you look at a cut of grass fed Sirloin,

1713
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:48,220
you will see a dark red color.
It looks leaner.

1714
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:51,850
It's a different cut of meat,
like a grass Fed New York strips.

1715
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:54,070
Perfect example cause
very little fat on that.

1716
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,790
But if you look at a regular New York
strip from corn fed, you know you're,

1717
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:02,170
you're going to get like this.
It's all more marble. More
pink. Yeah. I mean that's,

1718
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:07,120
it tastes delicious because it's that
fat makes it all juicy and it cooks down,

1719
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:11,230
but it's really not as healthy that
you're not getting as much out of the,

1720
01:34:11,231 --> 01:34:14,530
the meat itself. It's not as good for
you. Well that's the same with butter.

1721
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:17,530
You're, you're getting butter
from an animal that's corn fed.

1722
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,240
You're going to give this fat,
sloppy,

1723
01:34:19,241 --> 01:34:23,710
stupid cow who's shitting out
pus in her milk? You know,

1724
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:27,400
it's the same with a not good for you.
Same with eggs.

1725
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:31,420
I think if you get the regular, the
regular cheap eggs, they have thin shells,

1726
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:35,500
not as much a mega threes versus
the more expensive like cage free.

1727
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:38,110
All these freeze which
you want because they're,

1728
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,720
they're roaming around
and they're eating grass.

1729
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:44,320
If you can get a chicken seeding grass,
that's a chicken that's healthy.

1730
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:46,540
But somewhere along the
line somebody figured out,

1731
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:49,840
well we can make more money if we just
stack them in like apartment complexes

1732
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:52,930
and shove all these chickens and these
little boxes and feed him the horse

1733
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:55,960
freedom. The Monsanto
grass. Yeah, it's, you know,

1734
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,460
it's unfortunate and that's also

1735
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:03,440
a part of this whole big picture where
people don't want to have to go hunting.

1736
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,530
They don't want to have to go kill a bird.
They don't want to raise chickens,

1737
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:07,400
they don't want to raise goats.

1738
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:10,970
We want to be able to go to McDonald's
and they wanted to be able to just give

1739
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:14,720
their money and get their food and be
done with it. And when you have that,

1740
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,800
then you're going to have this,

1741
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:20,780
you're going to have a regular person
is not going to be able to just produce

1742
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:23,390
for themselves or for a
small group of people.

1743
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,330
They're going to have to produce
for thousands, maybe even millions.

1744
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:30,620
And so when a company or a person or a
business is producing all this food for

1745
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:31,341
millions of people,

1746
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:34,160
and these billions of people can just
pull into these stops with their cars,

1747
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,060
which you've got his madness.
Yeah.

1748
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:40,250
We've got this massive
disconnect from responsibility

1749
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,790
to make money off of shit that
is that cheap to begin with.

1750
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:45,270
You have to be working with
really cheap materials. Yeah.

1751
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:47,800
So you're cutting costs wherever you can.

1752
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:51,850
I mean, if you're buying a $3 cheeseburger
without fucking what is in that thing,

1753
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:56,260
imagine if someone only paid you $3. Say,
listen man, this one wants you to do,

1754
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:00,520
I want you to shoot a cow and then a take,
ship it across the country,

1755
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:01,990
cut a chunk of meat out of it,

1756
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:05,500
and I want you to grind that meat
and then form it into a patty.

1757
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,700
And then I want you to cook it.

1758
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:09,760
And then I want you to put that I would
get some lettuce. You got to get some,

1759
01:36:09,761 --> 01:36:10,594
let us go get it.

1760
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:14,590
Go pick the lettuce and then wash
it off and then cut some tomatoes.

1761
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:17,770
And then polo onion on there.
And then I want you to make some ketchup.

1762
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:21,280
And then I want you to make some
mustard and swirl it all around.

1763
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:24,870
And then I want you to cook it and feed
it to me. How much would that cost? $3.

1764
01:36:24,871 --> 01:36:28,180
It would be a $100. Look at norms,
man. You have steak and eggs for what?

1765
01:36:28,181 --> 01:36:32,500
$7 that Saint Nicholas. But at least
you norms. You sit down, you know,

1766
01:36:32,501 --> 01:36:36,580
norms is like, they're trying to be
frugal and it's probably released.

1767
01:36:36,581 --> 01:36:39,250
You sit down, right?
This drive through shit.

1768
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,850
The craziest thing ever. A cheeseburger
please. Is that it? Yep. That's it.

1769
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,360
$2 and 50 cents please.
$2 50 cents. That's crazy.

1770
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,600
You give him $2 and 50 cents and then
they eat it and then you go like somehow

1771
01:36:52,601 --> 01:36:56,350
or another that cow died.
That bread was cooked,

1772
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:01,630
that's ketchup was manufactured. That
pickle was pickled. It was sliced,

1773
01:37:01,631 --> 01:37:03,090
it was slapped on your bond.
It takes

1774
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:05,520
the social out of, uh, out of eating.

1775
01:37:05,521 --> 01:37:08,640
I think one of the most fun things to
do is sit down with people that you're

1776
01:37:08,641 --> 01:37:10,830
interested in,
have like a nice solid dinner.

1777
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:12,210
Even if it's just a burger or something.

1778
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:15,450
But now you're like in your car
by yourself. You know, you park,

1779
01:37:15,451 --> 01:37:17,880
cause you don't wanna be on the highway
while you're trying to down this thing.

1780
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:21,840
You Park your and your car by yourself.
Just eating something like an animal.

1781
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:26,841
It just kind of consume
these just consuming calories
as quickly as possible so

1782
01:37:26,911 --> 01:37:30,570
you can get on your way.
Rose are talking about health stuff.

1783
01:37:30,571 --> 01:37:34,560
I wanted to ask you about flotation tanks
because I did one in Florida recently

1784
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:37,380
for the first time. Did you
select it? I liked it a lot,

1785
01:37:37,381 --> 01:37:38,910
but I didn't get any of the,

1786
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,500
the cool visuals that were talked
about on the videos. How far,

1787
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:46,260
how many times did you do it? I
did it for an hour. A One? Yeah,

1788
01:37:46,261 --> 01:37:49,260
just once so far toward the end.
Uh,

1789
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:51,980
I saw like kind of like a doll,

1790
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:55,770
white flash on my right side and I
thought that somebody had the tank,

1791
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,630
but it was just like me,

1792
01:37:57,631 --> 01:38:00,600
I guess fantasizing about the tank
being opened because I knew that it was

1793
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:03,330
around that time. But other than
that, there are no visuals at all.

1794
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:07,200
It's just much visualizations. The first
time I did it. Okay. So that's normal man.

1795
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:10,340
Oh yeah. It's completely normal.
It's hard to relax, you know,

1796
01:38:10,341 --> 01:38:13,350
it's a weird environment.
The like the first 1520 minutes,

1797
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:14,900
you just freaking out that
you're in this weird tank.

1798
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:17,970
Well then I could hear my own heartbeat
and feel the blood pumping through my

1799
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:20,440
body. It's pretty weird. It
doesn't feel great though,

1800
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,610
and he fly. I explained it in there.
It's like taking myself on a date.

1801
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:30,210
You're just like, they're like,
it's weird to explain to them.

1802
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:33,300
That's a good way to describe it. Nothing
really happened, but at the same time,

1803
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,610
the rest of that afternoon was awesome.
Yeah,

1804
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:39,450
everything was bright and I was almost
grateful for stimulation because I'm a

1805
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:42,420
very like very intense
type a kind of person,

1806
01:38:42,421 --> 01:38:45,780
so to be in a fucking thing for an hour
and have nothing going on except for my

1807
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:47,220
own thoughts afterwards,

1808
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:51,060
it's like I'm in traffic driving back
from Delray and I'm like, this is great.

1809
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:54,570
I love traffic. You know something to
think about like dodge these other cards,

1810
01:38:54,571 --> 01:38:58,620
you know? That's funny. Hallucinate at
all. Joe, during when you were rolfing?

1811
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,680
No. What does Ross painful
but you don't loosen.

1812
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:06,160
I hallucinate when it's painful massage.
It's like the time it starts.

1813
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:10,200
The other day I was just like seeing all
this crazy shit and it was so high. No,

1814
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,670
I don't like,
I don't like Thai massages.

1815
01:39:11,671 --> 01:39:15,120
They put you on the ground
and they stretch you out.
You don't like, I love that.

1816
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:19,620
I love, I like being on a table. The
oil you up, it's nice stretch you out.

1817
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:22,050
It's better for your body.
Like it doesn't feel as good,

1818
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:25,230
but it's better for your body.
Little snail trails everywhere.

1819
01:39:25,231 --> 01:39:29,880
It's Ho Hey,
I don't even know what those are.

1820
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:30,863
I don't know if I want to know.

1821
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,170
Well you do want to know you and Brian
Hook up after the show. He'll show you.

1822
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:39,030
I'll show you pictures of the NSA is
doubtless already seen. They're starting,

1823
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:42,000
they're going to shut down the program
because they're so repulsed by Brian's

1824
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:45,170
tragic snail trail folders.

1825
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:49,370
17 barf. It's funny, I read that, uh,

1826
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:54,180
like some huge percentage of internet
users put their porn in a file called tax

1827
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:58,680
return. They do like tax returns
2007 and a lot of people do it. So,

1828
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:01,430
so people go, just go
looking, right? So if your,

1829
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:03,360
if your wife or girlfriend is
looking through your computer,

1830
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:06,870
last thing she wants to click on is your
boring tax return so it gets skipped

1831
01:40:06,871 --> 01:40:11,210
over. That's funny. A friend of mine
called would just put it under call.

1832
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:14,280
I was like my girlfriend
and go look at golf.

1833
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:17,670
All you have to do is put it in a folder
and change the file extension from a

1834
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:20,850
folder to like a jpeg and call it
something like sample dot jpeg.

1835
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:23,190
And then when you tried to click on it
and nothing will happen because there'll

1836
01:40:23,191 --> 01:40:25,020
be an error. And then when
you want to look at your porn,

1837
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:29,820
it can switch it back to switch factor.
Nice. No chicks going to figure that out.

1838
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,090
Dude,
you're on a next level CSI shit.

1839
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,640
You should really be
working for the NSA dog.

1840
01:40:36,290 --> 01:40:38,940
Why are you wasting all your
talent here on podcasts?

1841
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:44,280
Um, is there a way to fix
this Shit, David Seaman? Yeah.

1842
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:47,880
I'm glad you asked that because like
you said, I am a really positive person.

1843
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,870
I'm not, I'm not a cynic. I'm not somebody
who, when you're hanging out with me,

1844
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:54,580
I'm complaining about everything.
Cause I think 98%

1845
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:58,990
of human existence and probably like 99%
of human existence in the United States

1846
01:40:58,991 --> 01:41:01,870
is amazing. You don't have
access to so much entertainment,

1847
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:05,200
so much cool shit to do
constantly that there's no,

1848
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,230
if you're bored and you're over the age
of 18, that's your own fault, you know?

1849
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,790
But,
uh,

1850
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:14,791
I was watching this lecture that Glenn
Greenwald gave at Hampshire college and

1851
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,790
the videos on Youtube,
that's how I watched it. Uh,

1852
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,470
it's like an hour long lecture
and then a Q and a session.

1853
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:24,270
And Glenn Greenwald is the
journalist who initially broke, uh,

1854
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:26,050
this NSA whistleblower story.

1855
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:29,410
He published it in the Guardian and
Glenn Greenwald has been all over civil

1856
01:41:29,411 --> 01:41:32,080
rights for like years.
He used to be a lawyer,

1857
01:41:32,081 --> 01:41:34,660
so he knows his stuff
and he's super thorough.

1858
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:38,140
And you would think a guy like that
would be really cynical by breaking all

1859
01:41:38,141 --> 01:41:41,350
these terrible stories about abuses
at Guantanamo and all this stuff.

1860
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:43,260
But he said in his lecture,
he was like,

1861
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:47,050
the one thing we have to keep in mind
is even the most powerful institutions

1862
01:41:47,051 --> 01:41:51,100
throughout human history or just
composed of human beings like you and me.

1863
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:56,170
And it's been shown throughout history,
regardless of the civilization,

1864
01:41:56,530 --> 01:42:01,530
that when enough human beings get together
and decide that that institution is

1865
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:05,080
no longer functioning properly and either
needs to be shut down or reformed in

1866
01:42:05,081 --> 01:42:08,290
some way, that happens without
exception pretty much, you know,

1867
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:11,470
like that can happen. And we're talking
about these agencies as if they're,

1868
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:12,161
you know,

1869
01:42:12,161 --> 01:42:14,860
some monolithic thing is just compose
the people who go home at the end of the

1870
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:18,250
day and want to see their kids and they
want to save up enough money to not work

1871
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:20,810
in a cubicle anymore one day. And, uh,

1872
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,400
the people outside of that system just
don't want to be spied on and they don't

1873
01:42:24,401 --> 01:42:27,970
want to have this country turn into
East Germany where people no longer do

1874
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:30,190
anything because they're
afraid of the consequences.

1875
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,630
Like you look at East Germany,

1876
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:35,560
no great art came out of that
country when it was in lockdown.

1877
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:38,980
A No great inventions that I know of.
And why is that?

1878
01:42:38,981 --> 01:42:41,980
It's because everybody just wants to
get by without attracting attention.

1879
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:44,470
And that's not what the United
States should be. We're the,

1880
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:48,670
we're the total opposite of that where
you get as much attention as you want and

1881
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:51,430
hopefully you'll do something valuable
in the process. That's our system.

1882
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:55,240
And if you want more attention than you
deserve, there's a repercussion for that.

1883
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:58,330
Right? Then you get, you get
slammed down by the, you know,

1884
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:01,600
the people who make fun of the
cardiac issues. There's a balance.

1885
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:05,440
But if you get a situation
where the normal person is
now afraid of what they're

1886
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:09,520
saying in their emails and phone calls,
how many months does it take before? Okay,

1887
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:10,091
first of all,

1888
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:14,410
the journalism dries up and then the
protests dry up and then the entrepreneurs

1889
01:43:14,411 --> 01:43:16,570
dry up because they go,
I could make this app,

1890
01:43:16,571 --> 01:43:19,840
that'll make it easier for
you to pay for your food. Uh,

1891
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:22,510
but I'm a little bit worried about the
government doing what they did to the

1892
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:23,560
bitcoin guys.

1893
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,010
So I'm just going to stay at my shitty
job and not develop this incredible app

1894
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,920
that could be the next paypal.
And then before you know it,

1895
01:43:29,921 --> 01:43:34,120
the u s is no longer this innovative hub
and it's all just happening in Europe

1896
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:36,850
or in fucking New Zealand
where Kim Dotcom is.

1897
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:40,210
And he's the one who's making all the
money off of it because they trust him

1898
01:43:40,211 --> 01:43:43,760
more than they trust American
entrepreneurs. And that's not,

1899
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:46,690
why should we go down that road
when that's not our history.

1900
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:49,330
That's not what we believe in. You
know, it's just, I think there's a,

1901
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:53,030
it's total bullshit. Yeah. There's
Ernest Hemingway quote about America.

1902
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,990
This is a fine place and
it's worth fighting for. And
I feel that way. You know,

1903
01:43:56,991 --> 01:44:01,991
like I was walking around near my hotel
earlier today and the houses in this

1904
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:05,450
neighborhood nearby or not big houses,
they're just modest homes.

1905
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:08,060
Everybody had an American flag out front,
I guess,

1906
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:09,710
cause they're getting
ready for the 4th of July.

1907
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:14,120
Everything was quiet and peaceful.
And people have nice cars, you know,

1908
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,570
like nice pickup trucks and stuff.
America's worth fighting for. You know,

1909
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:20,780
like we're a peaceful,
smart, uh, chill people.

1910
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,170
We don't need to continue to go down this
road of being afraid of everything and

1911
01:44:24,171 --> 01:44:25,690
everything being kept in the dark from us.

1912
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:27,980
Like we're little children
and we can't handle it.

1913
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:31,190
It's really patronizing and it's
not our system. Do you think

1914
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:35,170
that the time of the country is limited?
The time,

1915
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:39,660
the idea of the country and the embracing
the idea of a global civil right.

1916
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:43,460
I, I think we're just getting started.
We're just getting started. Yeah. I mean,

1917
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:47,270
you look at, look at Rome. It's not as if
things stopped and they became imperial.

1918
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,490
That's really when the fun
began, you know? I mean,

1919
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:52,700
we have a lot of shit ahead of us and
it's not all going to be bad stuff. Yeah.

1920
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,950
It isn't all going to be
bad stuff and I'm, I'm,

1921
01:44:55,640 --> 01:45:00,640
I'm wondering how much of that can be
impressed upon the people that are in

1922
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:05,750
power. So it doesn't have to be bad. Like
you can actually run this in a good way.

1923
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:06,584
You fucks,

1924
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:11,390
like someone can come along who has
a enough ideas of how this can be

1925
01:45:11,391 --> 01:45:12,650
structured,
where it can be.

1926
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:16,790
The people still get to make money and
people still get to have order and people

1927
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:20,470
still get to have laws and there's
still respect and there's still, but

1928
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:24,110
some people are already doing that.
Uh, I was in Uruguay last year,

1929
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:28,800
fairly small South American country
I think right next to Brazil. And uh,

1930
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:34,330
I was there and their president is
known as like one of the most, uh,

1931
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:38,060
how do you put this like one of the
least selfish presidents of the world and

1932
01:45:38,061 --> 01:45:42,680
still like the still the figurehead
for a fairly successful country.

1933
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:43,250
Uh,

1934
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:48,250
so he gives away like 80% of his salary
to charity and t his hobbies instead of

1935
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,340
being obsessed with getting
invited to stuff like Bilderberg.

1936
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,270
He Gardens with his longterm girlfriend,
they plant flowers,

1937
01:45:56,450 --> 01:46:00,920
he drives an old VW beetle. Like
one of the ones from the 70s. Yeah,

1938
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:04,520
he drives an old beetle. And what's funny
is his past is really like a messed up.

1939
01:46:04,521 --> 01:46:09,521
He spent I think a decade in a well in
prison as a political prisoner and he had

1940
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:11,990
been shot by police at some
point and all this stuff.

1941
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:17,110
But instead of becoming
radical and becoming this
like anti anti wealth kind of

1942
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:22,070
South American radical, uh, who
wants to seek to get revenge,

1943
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,260
he just became a total moderate.
And you know,

1944
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:27,680
he'd gardens and he's the president.
People love him and he looks like,

1945
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:30,150
like what a South American
dictator would look like. You know,

1946
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:33,200
he's like this old jovial white guy,
right?

1947
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:36,560
Instead of going down that path of just
acquiring more and more power, he's like,

1948
01:46:36,561 --> 01:46:38,660
fuck it.
Like we're going to have a free country.

1949
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,810
And I think that's something that more
and more world leaders could probably

1950
01:46:41,811 --> 01:46:42,530
aspire to.

1951
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:44,540
How much of, yeah. I mean,

1952
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:48,260
how much of the direction of civilization
has really dictated by charismatic

1953
01:46:48,261 --> 01:46:52,650
individuals? I mean, it's, it's so often
than someone in a right way or wrong way

1954
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:56,230
lead. We'll look at Hitler, Hitler
speeches. I watched this thing.

1955
01:46:56,231 --> 01:46:57,460
When you look at Kennedy speech,

1956
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:59,890
I watched this thing where
they subtitled his speeches.

1957
01:46:59,891 --> 01:47:02,410
So you could see what it's actually sang
because I've always wondered how could

1958
01:47:02,411 --> 01:47:05,470
people go along with this raving
lunatic, right? And be like, yeah, yeah,

1959
01:47:05,471 --> 01:47:07,810
we should put the Jews in the
homosexuals and the ovens. You know,

1960
01:47:07,811 --> 01:47:10,330
this sounds good. Uh, how
could they go along with this?

1961
01:47:10,331 --> 01:47:13,480
The Germans are smart and if you look
at the subtitles of his speeches,

1962
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:15,400
he's saying stuff like,
you know,

1963
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:18,760
when one German needs help
and other German should
reach out because that's what

1964
01:47:18,761 --> 01:47:22,630
we're about as a country is you help
out another German who's down, you know,

1965
01:47:22,631 --> 01:47:26,410
down on his luck and we move
each other forward together.

1966
01:47:26,411 --> 01:47:28,900
All this shit that like, you can see
why people would go along with it.

1967
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:30,730
It wasn't right.
It wasn't craziness.

1968
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:34,920
And then behind the scenes he's doing
all of this really terrible shit. And uh,

1969
01:47:36,010 --> 01:47:37,780
so he spoke to the common folk.

1970
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:40,400
Yeah. I guess where I'm going
with this is you're 100% right,

1971
01:47:40,401 --> 01:47:44,690
that there are a handful of charismatic
people that have a huge amount of

1972
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:46,590
influence on what direction would

1973
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:50,460
I like to think that in this day and
age that that's changing. I really do.

1974
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:52,110
I like to think that in this day and age,

1975
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,460
because we live in this new paradigm and
you and I have accepted it because we

1976
01:47:56,461 --> 01:47:59,370
have no vested interest in
keeping the past. You know,

1977
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,900
we didn't have any control and you,

1978
01:48:00,901 --> 01:48:04,950
he neither you nor I had any control
over the way. The world worked a decade,

1979
01:48:04,951 --> 01:48:06,330
two decades ago,
so there's no,

1980
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:10,590
we have no vested interest in
keeping the thing the way it is now.

1981
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:15,600
We recognize that the world is changing.
We recognize that society is changing.

1982
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,840
People are fucking smarter,
man. They're smarter,

1983
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:22,980
they're smarter and they're more aware
and they're more tuned in and it's not as

1984
01:48:22,981 --> 01:48:25,890
easy to fucking trick on.
You see it with entertainment.

1985
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,340
You see it with talk shows.
You see it with the criticism,

1986
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,800
criticism of a newspaper,

1987
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,530
articles and books and blogs.

1988
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:37,380
People are more tuned in now
than they ever have been before.

1989
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,131
Well,
it's funny,

1990
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:42,240
a financial newsletters used to be
really big in the 90s where people would

1991
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:45,960
subscribe to some experts, stock
picks, and he would say, you know,

1992
01:48:45,961 --> 01:48:50,760
I'm up 18% for the past
year. Uh, you know, whatever.
And people would subscribe,

1993
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:54,660
thinking, Oh, if I just listened to what
this guy says, I'll make 1800% per year.

1994
01:48:55,110 --> 01:48:55,770
And uh,

1995
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:59,790
I almost went to work for a company
earlier this year that reached out to me.

1996
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:03,000
And what they do is they've found a way
to actually audit these people whose

1997
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:05,130
results. So they go, oh, okay,

1998
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:07,260
let's actually see what you've
been buying and selling.

1999
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:10,860
You didn't make 18 per 1800% this year.
You made like 10%.

2000
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:14,160
And so they publish all the results
and people pay for access to that

2001
01:49:14,161 --> 01:49:14,994
information.

2002
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:18,780
And so what you're seeing is this one
area that used to be really scammy is now

2003
01:49:18,781 --> 01:49:22,380
moving closer and closer to total
transparency where you know,

2004
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,530
if you're the real thing and you're
actually picking the right stocks,

2005
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,603
then you're going to,

2006
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,480
you're going to gain more followers
than you ever would have before because

2007
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:33,000
people see that you're the real
thing and if your bullshit,

2008
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,370
nobody's going to go down that road.

2009
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:39,600
And I feel like it'd be great if we
get get that going for other areas of,

2010
01:49:39,601 --> 01:49:42,540
than other than stock newsletters, like
let's get going for government agencies,

2011
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:46,230
let's get it going for anything. Like
just show the people the actual numbers,

2012
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:49,660
let them decide for themselves if this
is something that we want to do and if

2013
01:49:49,661 --> 01:49:50,950
not,
it'll go away.

2014
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:53,670
It seems like that's what a lot
of people are terrified of. Yeah.

2015
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:56,520
A lot of people are terrified
about having to do that.

2016
01:49:56,521 --> 01:49:58,140
Having to rise to the occasion,

2017
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:02,340
having to recognize that we live in a
completely new world and that there's a

2018
01:50:02,341 --> 01:50:06,120
lot more competition because there's
a lot more access to the game and

2019
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:09,680
well people say stuff, they're like, well,
should we have that much competition?

2020
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:13,550
And you really, you do want that
because, so like if you have,

2021
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,530
that's a funny thing to say,
she'll,

2022
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:18,410
there'll be that much competition will
say things like the stock market is good.

2023
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,470
Like it is now being closed
on weekends and stuff.

2024
01:50:21,471 --> 01:50:25,160
But ultimately you want total
information exchange at all times.

2025
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,620
You'd want 24 seven like
commodities markets. Right.

2026
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:30,800
And so people are like arguing for
this old shit. And you're like,

2027
01:50:30,801 --> 01:50:33,710
well why are you arguing for that when
it's less transparent? You just want,

2028
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:37,730
ideally you want people to be able to
do anything at any time as long as it

2029
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:38,630
doesn't harm other people.

2030
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:43,480
Yeah, absolutely. And then includes
online gambling, online porn, online,

2031
01:50:43,490 --> 01:50:45,670
anything there.

2032
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:49,150
The idea of regulating human
behavior is completely ridiculous.

2033
01:50:49,151 --> 01:50:52,030
If that human behavior doesn't
hurt other people. And if it's not,

2034
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:55,180
then it's about controlling resources.
And if it's about controlling resources,

2035
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:59,230
it becomes about why should one person
be able to tell you what you can and

2036
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:04,180
can't do if you're not in somehow or
another imprisoning or doing something

2037
01:51:04,181 --> 01:51:08,590
fucked up to other people. If you're
not, then they shouldn't be that long.

2038
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,960
There's just too many.
There's too much.

2039
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:12,910
There's too much business
and enforcing it.

2040
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:17,470
There's too much business and manipulating
words in order to control humans.

2041
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:21,040
And that's what I think
everybody's freaking out
about when it comes to the NDA

2042
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,140
or and,
or the Patriot Act.

2043
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:26,510
Well, this, uh, to this section
to 15 of the Patriot Act,

2044
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:30,290
they have a secret interpretation of it
and that's how the NSA is doing all of

2045
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:33,290
this data collection. Or at least that's
the foundation for some of it, I believe.

2046
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:35,720
And uh,
how ludicrous is that?

2047
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,870
Like the Patriot Act is scary
enough what it actually says,

2048
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,460
but then you have the
government saying, oh no, no,

2049
01:51:40,461 --> 01:51:44,720
we have this secret interpretation in a
lock box that you can't actually look at.

2050
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:48,050
But our secret interpretation
allows us to do a, B, and C.

2051
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:51,830
It'd be like if you signed a contract
and then, uh, the guy doesn't pay you.

2052
01:51:51,831 --> 01:51:54,830
It had been agreed upon and you take him
to court and you sue them and he's like,

2053
01:51:54,831 --> 01:51:58,430
no, you can't sue me because actually
you have a secret interpretation of your,

2054
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:02,150
your compensation on his contract. You'd
be like, that's totally fucking insane.

2055
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:04,040
There's no basis in law for that.

2056
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:08,450
But the government is doing this stuff and
up until, you know, the past few weeks,

2057
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:11,030
people have not really been
calling them out on it. I mean,

2058
01:52:11,031 --> 01:52:11,990
of course some people have,

2059
01:52:11,991 --> 01:52:14,120
but it hasn't gone mainstream
and the way that it is now.

2060
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,670
Yeah. Well you're talking about
everything accelerating, you know, uh,

2061
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:19,840
they're experiencing that now too.

2062
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:24,880
There's experiencing that slowly but
surely. I was like, one, two, three,

2063
01:52:24,881 --> 01:52:25,230
four.

2064
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:28,110
When you look at all these amendment,
these whistleblowers, he's like,

2065
01:52:28,111 --> 01:52:30,930
what the third or fourth
guy from the NSA alone,

2066
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:35,430
how bad must things be there that you
were willing to give up everything to come

2067
01:52:35,431 --> 01:52:36,930
out and talk to the press?

2068
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:39,810
Yeah. Well, there's some people
that feel like they're compelled.

2069
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,310
There's real heroes in this world.
You know, like what Pat Tillman did.

2070
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:45,870
I'm that guy a,
he

2071
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,210
was the football player.
Yeah.

2072
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:52,100
He was a professional football league
player superstar and decided he wanted to

2073
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:53,420
go and defend this country.

2074
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:58,480
So he risked it all and went
over to Afghanistan or Iraq,

2075
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:01,780
wherever it was killed,
I think it was Afghanistan and uh,

2076
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:04,240
found that it was a big fucking shit pile.
Once he got there,

2077
01:53:04,241 --> 01:53:07,220
it was completely disorganized. It was
a mess. And it was very vocal about it.

2078
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:13,240
Some people though that they really will
do with this guy's done and step up and

2079
01:53:13,461 --> 01:53:14,061
say, hey, you know,

2080
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:18,200
this needs to be discussed and talked
about and everyone's chasing after him and

2081
01:53:18,201 --> 01:53:21,410
everyone is talking about,
and this cover of USA Today,

2082
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:25,070
x percent think he should be
prosecuted and blah, blah blah.

2083
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,370
But the bottom line is all the
sudden that dialogue is open,

2084
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:30,860
all of a sudden that
conversation is being had.

2085
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:36,820
Who are these people that are allowed
to read David Seaman's email and why can

2086
01:53:37,131 --> 01:53:39,170
they,
aren't they just people?

2087
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:44,410
And Weird things happen when you call
yourself the NSA or the CIA or the FBI.

2088
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:48,950
You know, when you become part of a
group, you can do some weird shit.

2089
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:52,130
Even when you call yourself district
manager, weird stuff happens. Yeah.

2090
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:55,520
You go from like being an objective
observer. But what happened to,

2091
01:53:55,521 --> 01:53:59,510
well I can't return more than a certain
percentage of shirts because it'll make

2092
01:53:59,511 --> 01:54:01,100
my numbers look bad.
So he had to swing.

2093
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:05,570
He's no longer acting out of total
objective reality and they have a vested

2094
01:54:05,571 --> 01:54:09,950
interest in some kind of outcome and you
multiply that times that thousand and

2095
01:54:09,951 --> 01:54:13,970
you get the national security
agency. Yeah. But uh,

2096
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,620
to go back to being positive and I think
we're headed for a star trek future.

2097
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:23,150
Like if you, if you watch like star Trek,
next generation, not the, the new, uh,

2098
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:26,150
you know, major motion pictures
that are just action flex.

2099
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:29,420
But that whole ideal view that
hundreds of years from now,

2100
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:34,640
people have so much abundance in terms
of energy and information that money is

2101
01:54:34,641 --> 01:54:37,070
no longer the focus.
Cause if you want to get an education,

2102
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:40,010
it will be given to you because it
won't cost us that much to do it.

2103
01:54:40,330 --> 01:54:42,980
So if you want to get education online.
Yeah, exactly. That's what I mean.

2104
01:54:42,981 --> 01:54:46,290
Like you'll get an education,
all the education you need a,

2105
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:48,710
if you need healthcare,
it's going to be so commoditized,

2106
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:51,560
so easy to provide a level of care.
You'll get that.

2107
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,510
If you want to fly across the country,

2108
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:56,110
it's going to cost you almost
nothing because one of the big, uh,

2109
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:00,650
costs right now to fly is the jet fuel.
It's not the least of the airplane.

2110
01:55:00,651 --> 01:55:04,690
It's not the shitty wages they pay
to the pilot and the stewardess is,

2111
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,390
it's actually the jet fuel that's burning.
What about when you,

2112
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,710
when we move away from
that, that kind of, uh,

2113
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:13,520
that era and get something better
to power all of our vehicles,

2114
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:17,180
then it changes everything because then
FedEx something across the country,

2115
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,910
it doesn't cost much anymore either.
Before you know it,

2116
01:55:19,911 --> 01:55:22,100
you have a society where you just don't
have to pay for all that much stuff.

2117
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,210
How about this?

2118
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:27,170
How about when it's down to everybody
acquiring raw materials because you have a

2119
01:55:27,171 --> 01:55:30,590
three d printer in your house that's
going to know ever has to buy anything

2120
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:33,710
that's going to be absolute
crisis that's coming.

2121
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:37,060
You're going to be able to download the
instructions and the directions for your

2122
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:41,420
laptop. Make your own fleshlight making
anything that's happening too. For sure.

2123
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:44,010
I think it's basically going to
be anything, I think it's going to

2124
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,940
start off just like printers were where
you know they were only black and white

2125
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:50,850
and you have to have a big office to
have a laser and it took forever to print

2126
01:55:50,851 --> 01:55:54,300
it out. Yeah, I mean it's completely
changed. It's changed radically.

2127
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:57,720
The ability to download an image. I
remember who used to be like click, click,

2128
01:55:57,810 --> 01:56:01,910
click, click, click, click. It was like
really slow to get like a, you know,

2129
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:06,330
one megabyte jpeg. Now it's
instantaneous. There's,

2130
01:56:06,331 --> 01:56:10,650
there's gonna come a time when everyone
can just get what they want online.

2131
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:13,830
You're going to be able to download the
instructions and people are going to

2132
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:18,750
probably have some sort of a
paypal system or some sort of a,

2133
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:22,830
you know, a, a donation system
where they'll, they'll, hey,

2134
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:27,600
I invented this and they'll upload it and
people donate a bunch of money to them

2135
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:29,970
to, to be able to use it and
they'll find merit in it.

2136
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:33,450
If they find merit in it and
they have the resources, they'll,

2137
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:36,780
they'll upload the money to this person
and that person will be able to benefit

2138
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:37,150
from it.

2139
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:39,190
Yeah. If you live in America, even today,

2140
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:42,090
if you have a truly great idea
and you put it out on, you know,

2141
01:56:42,130 --> 01:56:44,440
whatever these sites,
our Indiegogo and Kickstarter,

2142
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:48,770
you can get the money you need to
make your dream a reality. And uh,

2143
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:50,471
that's extraordinary.

2144
01:56:50,471 --> 01:56:53,590
That didn't exist until very
recently and it will be a reasonable,

2145
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:56,770
you would pitch a bank and if it wasn't
something they thought would produce a

2146
01:56:56,771 --> 01:56:59,350
return and you didn't have the right
credit profile, you'd be denied.

2147
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:01,500
And now you can just
put it on Kickstarter.

2148
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:04,850
Nobody cares about anything
other than is the idea worthy?

2149
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:07,410
Yeah, no doubt. Alex Grey's Kickstarter,

2150
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:11,850
he came on the podcast to
talk about it and um, within,

2151
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,910
I don't know, a couple of days, his,

2152
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:18,210
his Kickstarter had gone over $200,000.

2153
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:21,720
That's a beautiful thing.
It's, it's a, it's a,

2154
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:26,110
it's a weird thing that you can
do that today. It's $210,000 now.

2155
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:29,730
And that was like within
days we watched that change.

2156
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:32,700
It's like all people have to do
is be alerted to a good idea.

2157
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:35,760
And then they look at the Kickstarter,
oh, this is a very reasonable offer.

2158
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,830
He has all these really cool things that
he's going to give you. He's going to,

2159
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,550
he'll draw an image of
you for x amount of money.

2160
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:43,550
He'll give you free tickets
to the opening event.

2161
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:44,700
Theone for this amount of money.

2162
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:47,100
And in doing something like that
and creating something like that,

2163
01:57:47,101 --> 01:57:50,360
he essentially like
organized and, and, and, and,

2164
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:55,110
and energized this base of
supporters. And then, you know,

2165
01:57:55,111 --> 01:57:58,890
if you have a million fans and the x
amount of them give you money, boom,

2166
01:57:58,950 --> 01:58:02,130
you're up and running.
You don't need to sell your diktat Nestle.

2167
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,970
You don't need to stick your
ass up in the air for Coca Cola.

2168
01:58:06,150 --> 01:58:08,190
You do whatever you want.
You can do whatever you want.

2169
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:09,940
Yeah. It takes away the power from, uh,

2170
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:14,450
the guy was the guy got dinner with last
night as a TV producer and he's friends

2171
01:58:14,451 --> 01:58:16,880
with, uh, the guy who
produces Philip defranco show.

2172
01:58:17,570 --> 01:58:21,380
And he was one of the
bigger youtube shows.

2173
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:23,210
And he was talking about how now,

2174
01:58:23,211 --> 01:58:25,820
like these networks just don't matter
because it's, all they have is like,

2175
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:27,530
they're like,
we've been around for 60 years.

2176
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:29,780
And somebody who started two
years ago, I was like, well,

2177
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:33,800
that doesn't fucking matter anymore if
we're producing better content than we're

2178
01:58:33,801 --> 01:58:37,460
actually competitive. And you're seeing
now that location doesn't matter either.

2179
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,650
You know, looking at what's his name
is sai or Gangnam style [inaudible]

2180
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,270
even though he's not in
like a hotbed of us music,

2181
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:49,660
he instantly took off over here
because of this technology.

2182
01:58:49,661 --> 01:58:52,210
We have no watching five Asian,

2183
01:58:52,220 --> 01:58:55,420
you're up dance around and looking
weird with hot Asian girls.

2184
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:57,580
But then we hope they don't
get the fuck before we do.

2185
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:59,350
I guess what I'm saying
is if the idea is good,

2186
01:58:59,351 --> 01:59:02,860
it propagates now in a way that was
just impossible even 10 years ago.

2187
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:05,570
Oh for sure. You know, I mean, look,

2188
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:09,040
this podcast has never been advertised
anywhere. We haven't done anything.

2189
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,680
All we've done is just keep doing it.
And in doing that,

2190
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:14,620
it's built a completely
organic word of mouth. I mean,

2191
01:59:14,621 --> 01:59:17,200
I've talked to people about,
if they asked me about it in interviews,

2192
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:22,570
I've done nothing to try to promote this
podcast as far as like commercially and

2193
01:59:22,571 --> 01:59:25,930
it sorta just caught on on its own.

2194
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:28,060
And I think honestly,

2195
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:32,590
it'd be a slower road for
someone who's not famous.

2196
01:59:32,591 --> 01:59:35,800
But it's possible for
like almost anybody today.

2197
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,660
And I know you have a podcast now and by
you putting your ideas out there on the

2198
01:59:40,661 --> 01:59:44,110
Internet, you gained a lot of support
when you were going to run for Congress.

2199
01:59:44,111 --> 01:59:48,160
And then that support bled over to, you
know, things that I came in contact with.

2200
01:59:48,161 --> 01:59:51,340
And then you and I came in contact with
each other and you came on this show and

2201
01:59:51,341 --> 01:59:53,760
then you started going on a bunch of
other shows and then they're all sorta of

2202
01:59:53,761 --> 01:59:55,090
webs out from each other.

2203
01:59:55,450 --> 02:00:00,310
You didn't have any important family
that you came from, you didn't have any,

2204
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:03,250
uh, you know, privileged influence.

2205
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,520
Well you had a brother who
was the president of the
night or there was nothing

2206
02:00:06,521 --> 02:00:08,740
like that. Well, I think
we're just a guy. It's a,

2207
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:12,430
it's funny because the things that I
thought used to be my weaknesses and this

2208
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,320
new environment are actually
your biggest strengths.

2209
02:00:14,321 --> 02:00:18,070
Like I was kind of deeply insecure back
when I was a journalist and now I'm a

2210
02:00:18,071 --> 02:00:20,320
journalist again because
the congressional thing,

2211
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:23,410
I think that was a little delusional on
my part to think that you can jump in

2212
02:00:23,411 --> 02:00:27,820
there and hope to have any kind of
chance, uh, to, to be taken seriously.

2213
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:30,910
But, uh, now that I'm
back to doing journalism,

2214
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:34,630
the things that I used to be really
insecure about that I wasn't working for a

2215
02:00:34,631 --> 02:00:38,620
TV network and didn't have, you know,
New York Times or NBC News after my name.

2216
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,530
Those are actually your biggest strengths
today because people go, Oh, if,

2217
02:00:41,620 --> 02:00:44,320
if this guy knows about something,
he's not going to hold back.

2218
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:46,660
He's going to do the research
and put it out there.

2219
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,660
And the other thing that I'm not afraid
to do that I think more journalists

2220
02:00:49,661 --> 02:00:53,680
should do is put things into perspective
for people. People are busy, you know,

2221
02:00:53,710 --> 02:00:57,970
I sat there reading for this
boring national security
stuff and then I'm able to

2222
02:00:57,971 --> 02:01:00,460
pick out what's important
and tell people this matters.

2223
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:03,160
And then sometimes people will tweet me
something that seems like a really big

2224
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:05,770
deal. And I'll debunk it. I'm
like, actually it's problematic,

2225
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:07,170
but it probably doesn't
matter because of a,

2226
02:01:07,171 --> 02:01:10,990
B and c and people need that cause
there's no sense of perspective anymore.

2227
02:01:10,991 --> 02:01:14,350
You go to the homepage of Yahoo
and it's something about Obama,

2228
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:19,570
some huge meeting with, you know, Merkel
in Germany. And then the next line,

2229
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,850
right next to it is Kim Kardashians baby.

2230
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:25,060
And then the line below that is the
Duggar family or the Doug, ours,

2231
02:01:25,061 --> 02:01:28,900
whatever they're called, that have 19
kids. The reality TV horse, it's them.

2232
02:01:28,901 --> 02:01:30,460
And so it fucks with your
mind cause you're like,

2233
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:33,220
are these things all equally important?
These,

2234
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:36,430
this is what's most important in the
world today are these three stories.

2235
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:39,980
And you need people who are
not compromised by the system,

2236
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:45,110
who have a no paycheck coming directly
from a news organization to just say,

2237
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:47,060
yeah, this is really important.
People should pay attention to it.

2238
02:01:47,061 --> 02:01:50,180
Or this is bullshit. It's just being
hyped and it's not that big a deal.

2239
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:53,920
Well essentially there's always going
to be a need for junk food. Yeah.

2240
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:56,750
And there's gonna be a need for
intellectual junk food as well.

2241
02:01:56,990 --> 02:02:01,820
And much like actual food. If you
offer people intellectual junk food,

2242
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:06,850
there's a certain group of us and I
lump me in there as well that will self

2243
02:02:08,631 --> 02:02:10,970
sabotage and they will,
they,

2244
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:14,590
they will eat junk food and they will
have a cheeseburger and then when this

2245
02:02:14,591 --> 02:02:19,100
should really have a salad and they will
watch intellectual junk food when maybe

2246
02:02:19,101 --> 02:02:22,550
it would do them better to sit down
and read a book or to watch Nova or to,

2247
02:02:22,551 --> 02:02:24,680
you know,
see a documentary.

2248
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:26,600
There's sometimes you don't
want to watch documentary.

2249
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:30,380
You want to watch a bunch of assholes bid
on storage space, you know, and it does,

2250
02:02:30,381 --> 02:02:33,200
it doesn't make any fucking sense.
And that's, that's good too.

2251
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:35,750
Like there's no reason that you have
to do serious stuff all day long.

2252
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:38,960
You're right. I, uh, I certainly
don't subscribe to that,

2253
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:42,170
but you're a balanced person and
if you're an imbalance person,

2254
02:02:42,171 --> 02:02:44,000
much like people who would
just eat cheeseburgers,

2255
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,820
you're going to have
intellectual junk food 24, seven.

2256
02:02:46,821 --> 02:02:50,510
You're going to be comforted.
Your mind will be occupied by nonsense.

2257
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:51,770
And that's what we really need.

2258
02:02:51,771 --> 02:02:55,640
Our minds are designed to be
occupied by the pursuit of food,

2259
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:58,460
sustenance and sexuality.
That's what we're after.

2260
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:02,660
We're trying to find a place to arrest
someone to fuck something to eat,

2261
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:06,320
keep going, ready, go get up in
the morning. Are you awake? Okay,

2262
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:09,050
fill the needs and now
those needs are filled.

2263
02:03:09,070 --> 02:03:12,650
Instead you're plugged into a fucking
video game and you're playing football

2264
02:03:12,651 --> 02:03:15,050
with some digital characters
and you're eating pizza,

2265
02:03:15,051 --> 02:03:20,051
that some guy actually walked up to your
fucking door and all you had to do is

2266
02:03:20,301 --> 02:03:22,400
give them some paper that
means almost nothing,

2267
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:25,970
and he gives you pizza and you stuffing
in your fat face and go right back to

2268
02:03:25,971 --> 02:03:29,180
your stupid game.
And it's so easy to do that.

2269
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:33,500
It's so easy to do that as long as you
can do enough to justify enough ones and

2270
02:03:33,501 --> 02:03:36,920
Zeros coming into your,
whatever your bank account is these days.

2271
02:03:36,921 --> 02:03:39,650
It's not like the vault,
the vaults are filled with paper.

2272
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:41,450
You know what's in that fucking fault?

2273
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:45,620
It's vault filled with paper that's
promising. He promises inside.

2274
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:49,490
It's very strange. It's actually,
uh, there's a great documentary,

2275
02:03:49,491 --> 02:03:53,560
I think National Geographic did it on
Fort Knox and all the controversies

2276
02:03:53,561 --> 02:03:56,330
surrounding that. What's
important is a no gold, well,

2277
02:03:56,331 --> 02:03:59,630
the one of the theories is that the
gold was replaced over time with like

2278
02:03:59,631 --> 02:04:03,290
tungsten bars or something because most
people never have access to it anyway.

2279
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:07,460
And governments, governments
swapped their goal all the time.

2280
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:10,520
So they're basically saying,
since there's not much transparency,

2281
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:14,900
we don't know what's actually there. And
it could have been sold off, you know,

2282
02:04:14,901 --> 02:04:16,880
20 years ago to some European government.

2283
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:19,190
And what we have here is
just a bunch of blanks.

2284
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:21,260
That sounds like a really good movie.
Yeah.

2285
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:24,830
Like you with Eddie Murphy
and maybe Ben Stiller,

2286
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:28,820
they break into Fort Knox and they
find out there's nothing there. Well,

2287
02:04:28,821 --> 02:04:32,620
I think what's more fascinating
stories? No, that's bank heist.

2288
02:04:32,621 --> 02:04:36,570
The tower heist diehards almost.
I liked to,

2289
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:40,650
it wasn't precious in tower
heist. Oh yes, she was. Yeah.

2290
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,730
The woman from precious.

2291
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:45,900
I think the more fascinating story is
let's take the government at face value

2292
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:49,290
and there's actually hundreds of billions
of dollars of gold in this tiny little,

2293
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:51,930
uh, fort. It's fucking incredible.

2294
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:55,860
It's like something out of ancient
times that we have that, you know. Yeah.

2295
02:04:55,861 --> 02:04:59,940
It's like a Mongol hoards. Exactly.
That's pretty preposterous.

2296
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:01,111
The whole thing.

2297
02:05:01,111 --> 02:05:03,990
We did the whole society that we
live in this pretty preposterous,

2298
02:05:03,991 --> 02:05:06,220
but I think I really do,
uh,

2299
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:11,160
ultimately have faith in the future
and I didn't when I was younger.

2300
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:15,690
I'm more optimistic now than ever before
because I think that ultimately all

2301
02:05:15,691 --> 02:05:20,040
there'll be some peaks and valleys in
some happy and sad and some angry in some

2302
02:05:20,041 --> 02:05:22,770
happy w the convergence,

2303
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,060
the convergence of information and the
convergence of ideas is inevitable.

2304
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:30,000
And I think it will all
balance out because of that.

2305
02:05:30,001 --> 02:05:32,880
I think we're going to be forced
because of this new reality,

2306
02:05:32,881 --> 02:05:34,170
this new digital reality.

2307
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:38,040
We're going to be forced into
a new level of communication,

2308
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:42,750
a new level of understanding and a new
level of, you know, black community.

2309
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:45,300
That's what I think.
What the fuck do I know?

2310
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:49,470
We could all be like on the way to
enlightenment, all of us doing mushrooms,

2311
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:53,460
holding hands, chanting ohm,
and then we get hit by a meteor.

2312
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:57,030
Boom. I can and start from
scratch. I could happen.

2313
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:01,110
It's interesting that people don't, even
today they don't act purely out of uh,

2314
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,300
the need for more paper,
for more money.

2315
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:07,530
Like you look at Reddit and how people
research stuff nonstop and good stuff

2316
02:06:07,531 --> 02:06:11,050
rises to the top of the page. They're
just doing that for these Internet points.

2317
02:06:11,051 --> 02:06:12,840
For Karma. They're just
doing it. Basically.

2318
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:15,840
Other people will recognize that
they're doing good work this game.

2319
02:06:15,841 --> 02:06:18,270
In that though,
and there's also a benefit in that.

2320
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,180
There's a social benefit in that when
you feel good, you know, where you,

2321
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:24,150
you make something that
people enjoy already.

2322
02:06:24,151 --> 02:06:27,990
We're aspiring to better stuff than just
a choir on it. Yeah. Yeah. That's money.

2323
02:06:27,991 --> 02:06:31,050
That is currency.
It's an online currency and you know,

2324
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:34,110
that's what people love about
posting on message boards. You know,

2325
02:06:34,111 --> 02:06:37,710
they love getting the, the, the
approval of the people around them.

2326
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,560
That's why they get so mad
when they get banned. Oh,

2327
02:06:40,561 --> 02:06:44,490
you've taken me out of my hotspot, my
juicy spot. Right. And so much love there.

2328
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:49,920
And I've gotten so much points. You've
cut my cashflow. Yeah, I've cut my, yeah,

2329
02:06:49,921 --> 02:06:53,940
that's why I don't think any of
us. We'll unplug. No, it's a,

2330
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,210
it's a ridiculous idea. Well,
some people do. I love the people.

2331
02:06:57,211 --> 02:07:01,380
I love those mountain men shows when
those, my favorite shows are like Alaska,

2332
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:06,620
the last frontier and mountain men
and ordering a Bering strait gold one.

2333
02:07:07,410 --> 02:07:10,640
That one's awesome. Amish people
are going to rule the world. No, no,

2334
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:12,360
because you know what man,
they're boring.

2335
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:16,890
They're wearing their dressing up like
assholes and fucking driving with Rick

2336
02:07:17,090 --> 02:07:20,910
[inaudible] to see what he talked. Well
those are the people that do that rumble,

2337
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:25,690
that thing that they do. What is
it called? Rumpl style rumble.

2338
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:30,690
So they have a thing they do when they
become an adult and they're allowed to

2339
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:34,290
leave the church and go balls out and
they get crazy and they party and they

2340
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:37,450
fuck and allowed to do it for
like a year or two or whatever.

2341
02:07:37,451 --> 02:07:39,760
And then they're supposed to like make
the decision on whether or not they want

2342
02:07:39,761 --> 02:07:43,240
to come back to the church or their snaps.
Are there stats on what percentage?

2343
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:47,260
Say, actually this is better. I'm going to
stay as a no, there's not. You know why?

2344
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:50,650
Because the stats are skewed by the
fact that 100% of all Amish people are

2345
02:07:50,651 --> 02:07:54,170
retarded.
So those stats fuck up those other steps.

2346
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:59,530
Do I mean that Amish people know? But
guess what? If you listen to this podcast,

2347
02:07:59,531 --> 02:08:02,080
you're not really fucking Amish.
Alright,

2348
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:07,240
so there because this podcast is
illegal in the Amish community,

2349
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:10,840
not allowed to have a podcast.
What's the movie inception about?

2350
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:15,970
I don't know what it's about,
but here's the,

2351
02:08:16,110 --> 02:08:20,310
Oh hey, wait, wait, no, hold on. I
mean, what's the movie inception about

2352
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:26,750
inception is about dreaming,
about dreaming, about dreaming,

2353
02:08:26,751 --> 02:08:29,630
about dreaming about something or other.
I fell asleep.

2354
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:36,430
How dare you. David's seeming sneak out
to save the league or Brian gets silly.

2355
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:40,210
I think we can wrap this up with some,
a little less doom and gloom, Brian.

2356
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:44,110
You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah.
We're run by a bunch of cunts,

2357
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:47,020
but you know what their cons and they
know their content and they wish they

2358
02:08:47,021 --> 02:08:51,850
weren't cuts. So I call out to all eat
cunts gay shit together as cheers. Okay,

2359
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:56,680
all you bitches, I have a
couple of whiskeys. Hug it
out. Go run around the block,

2360
02:08:57,010 --> 02:09:01,660
get a yoga class and every now and
again, open up your chakras. Okay?

2361
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:04,540
Open up your heart. Realize you
don't have to be a fucking asshole.

2362
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:07,870
This is not going to last.
And you're caught up in a big trap.

2363
02:09:07,871 --> 02:09:12,010
And that big trap is you're trying to
collect all the gold and it doesn't matter

2364
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:15,790
body, it doesn't matter. You could have
half the gold and twice the friends.

2365
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:18,610
You'd be three times as happy.
Boom.

2366
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,710
That's Joe Rogan experience
mathematics for you.

2367
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:25,060
At least we found out the real true
ending of the Sopranos today, man.

2368
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:29,890
Fuck James. For folks who don't
know, James Gandolfini died today.

2369
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:34,030
I was in New York two months ago with
my whole family where eating in a

2370
02:09:34,031 --> 02:09:38,380
restaurant and a James Gandolfini walked
right by and I was like, Holy Shit.

2371
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:39,700
You know what?
Uh,

2372
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:43,060
what makes me sad about James Gandolfini
die is the same thing that made me

2373
02:09:43,061 --> 02:09:46,900
happy about you when you came in today
and told me you were stopped smoking,

2374
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:49,810
that you haven't been smoking.
Right. This is Joey Diaz.

2375
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:53,680
I see Joey Diaz and I see James
Gandolfini and I say, okay,

2376
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,600
that's going to happen Joey and I see
you and I think you're not going to live

2377
02:09:58,601 --> 02:10:01,170
forever if you live the way you live
and smoking cigarettes. And Yeah,

2378
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:04,600
the reason why I was quitting smoking as
it, cause I tried to hike the other day.

2379
02:10:04,601 --> 02:10:08,460
I was like, Holy Shit, my cardio is
fucked up. So I'm thinking about what,

2380
02:10:08,461 --> 02:10:11,410
what do you think I should do? I'm
either thinking about doing this, uh,

2381
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:16,150
this girl that was on fear factor
with Yoshi. Uh, she teaches boxing.

2382
02:10:16,151 --> 02:10:20,410
She's an MMA boxing trainer.
Uh, and she wants me,

2383
02:10:20,411 --> 02:10:23,350
she wants me to train with her hair.
I'll tell you in a second. Hold on.

2384
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,410
She wants me to train with her.
Do you think boxing training?

2385
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:29,800
Yeah, it's good. It's great. It's really
hard. It works. Your cardio. Well,

2386
02:10:29,810 --> 02:10:32,060
Louis C K does a lot of
that. Yeah, it's great.

2387
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,980
And you don't have to actually somebody,
right?

2388
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:37,500
You just hit the bag and hit pads
and most important thing is it's,

2389
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:40,640
it's actually fun to do. It
does. It's not like you know,

2390
02:10:40,641 --> 02:10:44,420
it's not getting on an elliptical
machine is sometimes it's really fucking

2391
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:47,690
boring. It's not competitive at
all. So there Carrie Williams,

2392
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:51,620
show me a picture of her. You should do
yoga also. I've gotten really into that.

2393
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:56,480
Yoga is fantastic. And Yoga. Bryan,
you will meet Wu Wei more hot chicks.

2394
02:10:57,530 --> 02:11:01,110
That girl, you know her. She was okay.

2395
02:11:01,630 --> 02:11:06,240
I wouldn't know her like that.
All Naked and oiled up and shit together.

2396
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:10,460
Oh Wow. I barely remember.
This is the problem.

2397
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:15,530
I was so much prettier than I've really
gotten weird looking starting to fade.

2398
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:20,150
You don't look Italian anymore. You
look more Buddhists again. I'm fat man.

2399
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:23,510
My fucking face is fat. People like
your face is fat. I'm like, yeah, no,

2400
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:27,050
everything's fatter. It's harder to keep
weight off when I'm not doing Jujitsu,

2401
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:30,920
but my back is better than it's ever
been before. For the folks who asked me,

2402
02:11:30,921 --> 02:11:31,940
but what I talked about,

2403
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:35,570
what I've been doing is something
called prolozone therapy.

2404
02:11:35,571 --> 02:11:40,310
It's prolotherapy with ozone for my
disc issue and a lot of stretching and

2405
02:11:40,311 --> 02:11:42,530
spinal decompression.
I can't,

2406
02:11:43,330 --> 02:11:46,520
I can't tell you how much better
I feel than just a few months ago.

2407
02:11:46,521 --> 02:11:50,430
So if you got any back issues,
don't be sleeping on that shit. Uh,

2408
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:53,330
but so you're going to do boxing
with her? Well, I don't know.

2409
02:11:53,331 --> 02:11:56,480
She offered to to train me and
stuff like that, but I don't know.

2410
02:11:56,730 --> 02:11:59,510
She probably want some publicity. We'll
give her some, she was on fear factor.

2411
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:02,240
I don't know. I definitely
don't hate her. You know,

2412
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:04,670
I taught saw too many God damn people.
We did,

2413
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:06,590
I don't know how many fucking episode,
the fear factor,

2414
02:12:06,591 --> 02:12:09,560
I think it was 148 over six years.

2415
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:13,130
And then each person has at least
each episode, at least six people.

2416
02:12:13,131 --> 02:12:15,680
So unfortunately there's no
way I can remember 600 people.

2417
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:17,440
That's that Dunbar's number.

2418
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:19,940
You only get 150 that you
could store inside your brain.

2419
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:21,890
It's not wild to think about.
Yeah.

2420
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:25,600
I wonder how that rotates out if they're
in number. Yeah. I wonder if you,

2421
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:28,270
when you meet somebody new,
somebody else's popping out of your brand,

2422
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:30,950
that's what it is. Yeah. Your,
your, your memory just gets deleted.

2423
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:33,240
Whereas people that live in small towns,
like,

2424
02:12:33,241 --> 02:12:35,440
do you ever talk to somebody that grew
up in the same town and see what it

2425
02:12:35,441 --> 02:12:38,720
didn't leave and they know all the same
people and they remember everything that

2426
02:12:38,721 --> 02:12:41,660
happened in high school and they start
telling you some shit that you did and

2427
02:12:41,661 --> 02:12:44,570
you're like, I did that. And they
remember things you don't remember.

2428
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:46,280
You used to date Debbie
Wilson and you're like, fuck,

2429
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:48,740
I forgot about Debbie Wilson.
How the fuck do you know what,

2430
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:50,210
Remember Debbie Wilson?
Why?

2431
02:12:50,211 --> 02:12:53,480
Because they don't have as
much information hitting
them on a regular basis as

2432
02:12:53,481 --> 02:12:56,390
you do. David Seaman, former
congressional candidate,

2433
02:12:56,630 --> 02:13:00,080
bad motherfucker on the Internet.
Your podcast is what sir?

2434
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:05,060
It is the David Seaman and are available
on iTunes. Yeah. Itunes and stitcher.

2435
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:08,900
And if people want to see a positive
side of me, uh, like two interviews ago,

2436
02:13:08,901 --> 02:13:12,170
I interviewed terrorists styles.
Who was Deepak Chopra's yoga instructor.

2437
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:15,770
So that's like interviewing mark
Zuckerberg, like social media experts.

2438
02:13:15,771 --> 02:13:20,750
It's fucking dope. That's fun. Yeah. And
what did, uh, what did Tara have to say?

2439
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,250
Oh she gave me some hangover cure
tips and like being tired tips,

2440
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:29,350
different poses you can try
real and uh, yeah. So uh,

2441
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:33,330
do you park has like a yoga instructor?
It takes care of him or where he goes? Uh,

2442
02:13:33,331 --> 02:13:35,730
I don't think he takes her,
she has a studio in New York,

2443
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:38,670
so I don't think that she's like, does
he live in New York? He lives in La.

2444
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:42,840
He lived somewhere out here. And uh, so
how the fuck is he getting yoga from her?

2445
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,570
Like skyping in apparently
a couple of years ago,

2446
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:47,760
she talks about it on the
episode a couple of years ago.

2447
02:13:47,790 --> 02:13:48,990
He just came up to her and was like,

2448
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:52,770
do you want to be my yoga instructor was
showing know someone else. Sweet. Sweet.

2449
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:56,220
I think they created an iPhone
app together and all that stuff,

2450
02:13:56,221 --> 02:13:59,130
but I'm just super into it cause
it's had an impact on my life.

2451
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:03,570
She's not my instructor.
I just interviewed her but
uh, yogas legit. It is,

2452
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:09,160
I do a lot of breathing exercises
and calms your mind so much. Yeah,

2453
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,370
it's huge for you.
That's um,

2454
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,740
there's a lot of shit that
people figured out before.

2455
02:14:13,741 --> 02:14:15,810
They didn't have phones
and nothing else to do.

2456
02:14:15,811 --> 02:14:19,830
So like how do we optimize this body
by doing all these stretches and they

2457
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:22,260
figured it out and they wrote it
down and you can learn from it.

2458
02:14:22,261 --> 02:14:23,520
It seems like it's nonsense.

2459
02:14:23,521 --> 02:14:27,660
Like how can stretching actually make me
feel better but it does some weird shit.

2460
02:14:27,661 --> 02:14:31,950
It opens up paths in your brain.
Like I remember I was super nervous.

2461
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:35,160
I've been a super nervous a bunch of
times in my life and the best things that

2462
02:14:35,161 --> 02:14:37,590
I've ever done to calm
myself down was yoga.

2463
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,580
I was super nervous the first time I
ever did the Howard stern show the night

2464
02:14:41,581 --> 02:14:42,414
before. Good News, sleep.

2465
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:46,680
So I just did yoga in my hotel room
and that helps when I was high as fuck.

2466
02:14:46,910 --> 02:14:50,160
I did yoga for like two hours and
I just got, hi, I've just hit,

2467
02:14:50,161 --> 02:14:54,270
this is total complete calm zone where
the neck, it carried me over the next day.

2468
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:55,140
I didn't worry about anything.

2469
02:14:55,141 --> 02:14:57,840
I mean I was still a little bit nervous
when I got there because he was like a

2470
02:14:58,170 --> 02:15:02,880
radio hero for me. But once I got in
there I was, it was smooth. I was so calm.

2471
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:06,750
I was so like I felt I was me. I was
100% May. Well I was worried about that.

2472
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:08,860
And uh, the other time, uh,

2473
02:15:08,861 --> 02:15:12,480
I had like a really important set that
I was doing in Aspen at the Aspen comedy

2474
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:15,990
festival and I was nervous about it and,
uh,

2475
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:18,570
I remember this has to do with it was
there that I thought was really fucking

2476
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:22,530
annoying. And um, when I
did the yoga like I got,

2477
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:27,150
and this is like total, like
complete accepting, calm,

2478
02:15:27,151 --> 02:15:28,290
friendly place.

2479
02:15:28,530 --> 02:15:32,280
And I saw the dude that I think is
annoying and normally I'd be like, oh,

2480
02:15:32,281 --> 02:15:36,330
look at this fucking Douche bag. Like
this guy's gross. But I immediately,

2481
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:39,510
I was like, poor fella. Yeah.
Like it didn't bother me at all.

2482
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:42,000
I just like it did in my, I didn't
mind. I would've given him a hug.

2483
02:15:42,030 --> 02:15:44,070
If you asked for one,
like I didn't care,

2484
02:15:44,071 --> 02:15:49,071
I'd hit some some frequency where I
realized that it was manipulatable.

2485
02:15:49,830 --> 02:15:53,310
It was you could, you could alter it.
You could alter it with discipline.

2486
02:15:53,311 --> 02:15:56,890
You could alter it with consciousness
by consciousness on me and he wu

2487
02:15:56,891 --> 02:15:57,660
consciousness.

2488
02:15:57,660 --> 02:16:02,660
I mean by deciding yourself like
I would rather be happy than sad.

2489
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:06,600
I would rather be friendly than distant.

2490
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:10,860
I would rather be warm than cold.
So just do it.

2491
02:16:10,890 --> 02:16:14,140
Go through the work and these hoses.
It takes two to tango.

2492
02:16:14,141 --> 02:16:17,790
It like if somebody is being an asshole
to you after you've taken a yoga class,

2493
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:20,620
you're much slower to react.
Yeah.

2494
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:23,700
You realize that it's not actually a
confrontation until you confront them as

2495
02:16:23,701 --> 02:16:27,420
well. Totally. I ran into
some crazy fucking New York.

2496
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:30,970
I was in New York and there was guy at
the park when we were filming the shed of

2497
02:16:30,971 --> 02:16:35,530
the park and I thought the guy said
something so I said, I'm sorry.

2498
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:38,590
Excuse me. Like did you say something?
I thought, I thought he said something.

2499
02:16:38,591 --> 02:16:42,220
I wasn't being mean all he goes, he goes,
I know you ain't fucking talking to me.

2500
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:47,140
Oh. And, and a, and I go, I thought, uh,
I thought you said something. And he goes,

2501
02:16:47,141 --> 02:16:50,320
I know you ain't fucking
talking to me. And I go, well,

2502
02:16:50,321 --> 02:16:53,190
I am talking to you obviously,
but I didn't, uh, you know,

2503
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:57,640
I didn't mean to disturb
you. I go, I thought you had
said something. And he goes,

2504
02:16:57,730 --> 02:17:02,110
but you ain't fucking talking to me. I
go, I thought I was, I go, my apologies.

2505
02:17:02,111 --> 02:17:05,950
He goes, all right, apology accepted. And
they were like ended, but it was like,

2506
02:17:05,951 --> 02:17:10,070
I didn't engage at all. Like, instead
of like, man, fuck you dickhead, right,

2507
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:12,850
the fuck are you, you know, instead of
that, instead of like, I'll smack you,

2508
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:16,530
it was like, oh, okay.
You know, whatever, like,

2509
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:19,810
and how many times does that happen where
that guy wound up getting stabbed or

2510
02:17:19,811 --> 02:17:22,720
beat up or sent to the hospital or
beat somebody else up or, you know,

2511
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,070
distracting himself from his fucking
miserable, pathetic, crazy life.

2512
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:31,060
Because you know, he manages
to get himself involved in
some sort of a conflict.

2513
02:17:31,061 --> 02:17:31,894
That was exciting.

2514
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:37,090
Even just taking a pause after
something like that happens like uh, um,

2515
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:41,710
I think more about stuff now I do yoga
and normally I'm really quick to react.

2516
02:17:41,711 --> 02:17:45,100
Like I always have some kind of quick
response and in a situation like that now

2517
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,560
I'll think like,
do I even have to talk about this?

2518
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:50,620
Do I even have to respond to this crazy
person or is it better to just laugh and

2519
02:17:50,621 --> 02:17:52,750
keep walking down the
sidewalk? Well, you know,

2520
02:17:52,751 --> 02:17:56,740
Dave Aspery talked about that on the
pockets were just talking about road rage

2521
02:17:57,170 --> 02:18:00,280
and he were talking about crazy to think
about, well what he was saying was,

2522
02:18:00,281 --> 02:18:01,330
and this is the first time I ever,

2523
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:05,770
ever Hindi had anybody explain it like
this was that when you are driving,

2524
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:09,310
you're going very fast and when you're
going fast you have to be able to make

2525
02:18:09,311 --> 02:18:10,510
split second decisions.

2526
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:14,890
So you get locked into this
very pure reptile state of mind,

2527
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:19,270
which just about move, react, do this.
And when someone does something like,

2528
02:18:19,330 --> 02:18:22,480
fuck you, it just comes out.
And the reason why it comes out,

2529
02:18:22,481 --> 02:18:25,450
it's cause you're ramped up
to react without thinking.

2530
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:28,480
Whereas if you're walking casually,

2531
02:18:28,481 --> 02:18:32,950
like down a nice trail in the woods
and someone's coming in the opposite

2532
02:18:32,951 --> 02:18:36,340
direction, there would be no road
rage. They'd be like, Hey, what's up?

2533
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:38,410
How you doing? And it would
be gone. You would do,

2534
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:40,510
you'd move out of each other's way.

2535
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:43,690
We used to be locked into
this reptilian frame of mind.

2536
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,880
I never really thought about it that way.
Our brains,

2537
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:48,250
our brains are not designed
to go 70 miles an hour.

2538
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:52,390
Absolutely trust me out is that when,
you know, when you go on any flight,

2539
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:56,320
you have a guy sitting in the front of
the plane, he's making you know, whatever,

2540
02:18:56,321 --> 02:18:58,720
like 35 or $45,000 a year.

2541
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:04,320
And he's sitting there and he's had to
train himself to move at 500 miles an

2542
02:19:04,511 --> 02:19:08,650
hour and keep that shit together for
you for the duration of the flight.

2543
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:10,670
When his, his, uh, you know,

2544
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:14,080
nervous system is designed to deal with
him going at a Max of like 12 miles an

2545
02:19:14,081 --> 02:19:18,370
hour and he's doing this and it's
like neatly routine cause that's,

2546
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:21,970
it's crazy. And you paid almost
nothing for it. You know,

2547
02:19:21,971 --> 02:19:24,250
you paid like $100 for the flood.
Yeah.

2548
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:27,710
Would you ever watch something and play
tennis like at a high level seem darting

2549
02:19:27,711 --> 02:19:29,710
back and forth trying to swat.
That's fucking crazy ball.

2550
02:19:29,730 --> 02:19:32,960
This guy reminds me of the matrix because
they're almost anticipating where it's

2551
02:19:32,961 --> 02:19:33,950
going to be.
You have to,

2552
02:19:33,951 --> 02:19:37,190
cause they're starting to lunch before
it's even gone over the net. Yeah.

2553
02:19:37,191 --> 02:19:40,580
You have to see some physical language,
the way their foot turns.

2554
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:44,000
You have to anticipate and then people
will fake people out. Like in football,

2555
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:46,070
I loved the, I don't, my favorite thing.

2556
02:19:46,071 --> 02:19:49,430
And football's when someone fakes somebody
out and then spins around and gets

2557
02:19:49,431 --> 02:19:50,840
away from them.
You know,

2558
02:19:50,841 --> 02:19:55,540
it's like the escape is
even more fascinating than
the hits because it's like

2559
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:58,560
that you gotta be able to anticipate
which way someone's moving and that's,

2560
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:02,570
that's fast for people.
But that ain't shit compared to cars.

2561
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:05,840
When you're in a fucking car and you're
flying down the highway like you're on

2562
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:10,400
reptile 10 you're on this, you're,
you're in this weird frequency.

2563
02:20:10,401 --> 02:20:12,440
And that's why people wind up talking to,

2564
02:20:12,650 --> 02:20:15,710
cause they were all tents and freaked out.
You're not supposed to go that fast.

2565
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:18,440
That's also why we have
an issue with news.

2566
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:22,040
Cause you're not supposed
to get all the news. Okay,

2567
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:25,370
you're supposed to get the
shit that applies to your
life and that's supposed to

2568
02:20:25,371 --> 02:20:28,520
get everything that's happening
with 7 billion people.

2569
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:29,840
And it's supposed to be interactive,

2570
02:20:29,841 --> 02:20:32,690
not just you sit in front of a screen
and they tell you all this stuff and you

2571
02:20:32,691 --> 02:20:36,410
just take it at face value versus a couple
thousand years ago you're in front of

2572
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,670
a fire,

2573
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:41,750
you know the campfire and the guy who
came back from the neighboring tribe tells

2574
02:20:41,751 --> 02:20:42,620
you what's going on.

2575
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:46,140
And then a discussion ensues where you
kind of fleshed out how credible is what

2576
02:20:46,141 --> 02:20:49,370
this guy is saying. How credible
is this? What does it mean for us?

2577
02:20:49,371 --> 02:20:53,870
And now we're seeing that reemerge. You
know, social media, it's a conversation,

2578
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,670
stuff like this as a conversation.

2579
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:58,910
And so it's no longer you're looking at
a screen and you have to take everything

2580
02:20:58,911 --> 02:21:03,020
Erin Burnett is saying at face value. You
don't, you know, or any of these people,

2581
02:21:03,021 --> 02:21:04,430
Piers Morgan,
uh,

2582
02:21:04,431 --> 02:21:08,190
who were just shouting at the
screen and in the year 2013,

2583
02:21:08,191 --> 02:21:10,670
they think that still works.
And you can tell it's a broken model.

2584
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:14,360
And those conversations pale in comparison
to the conversations that you will

2585
02:21:14,361 --> 02:21:18,470
see with those people on the Internet.
Anybody that's a guest on Pierce Morgan,

2586
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:22,610
if they came on your show,
you would have an hour plus two hours,

2587
02:21:22,611 --> 02:21:24,140
whatever the fuck you would
have with them, they will,

2588
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:27,560
you would have a way more
of an understanding of who
they really are coming off

2589
02:21:27,561 --> 02:21:29,750
for your show than you ever would.

2590
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:34,280
And these seven minute chunks
of conversation sandwiched
in between commercial

2591
02:21:34,281 --> 02:21:38,250
breaks and, and, and buttons where
they like, Whoa, we're wrap this up.

2592
02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:41,510
You know, like I, uh,

2593
02:21:41,511 --> 02:21:45,290
the first time I did your
show I was pretty squirrely
because I'm used to doing,

2594
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:49,010
you know, like four or five minute TV or
radio segments, but they're like, art,

2595
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:52,160
we're having you on to talk about Nda,
just lay it out for us. And it's like,

2596
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:56,200
it's impossible to lay out the whole
history and how it got to that point in

2597
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:59,600
four minutes. So you're just trying
to boil down a couple of good points,

2598
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:02,690
get it out there in a way that people
will think about and hopefully Google the

2599
02:22:02,691 --> 02:22:05,780
fucking shit on their own,
but you can't possibly dive in.

2600
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:08,990
And then you get on a show like this,
like, oh, I actually can just be myself.

2601
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:12,440
You can do yourself and your no to
yourself for a long period of time.

2602
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:17,300
And I think that's, uh, that's what
people are looking forward today. They're,

2603
02:22:17,301 --> 02:22:20,870
they're, they're looking for,
they're looking for reality.

2604
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:25,900
They have access to reality at in
99% of the places they look where

2605
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:30,070
they don't get it. Is politics
the view of the world? Yeah.

2606
02:22:30,170 --> 02:22:32,730
Media is media. Yeah. But everywhere else,

2607
02:22:32,740 --> 02:22:35,370
usually looking at people really
cutting people's heads off. Look,

2608
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:38,840
there's the video. Mexican drug lord
cuts his girlfriend's head off. Yup.

2609
02:22:38,841 --> 02:22:42,420
There it is. I got eaten by a hip out
yet I'm watching him get eaten. Yup,

2610
02:22:42,421 --> 02:22:45,540
he's dead. Oh, look at that. That
guy can't run as fast as the tiger.

2611
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,160
What a shocker. Yeah. I mean,

2612
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:50,280
you're getting that reality over
and over and over and over again,

2613
02:22:50,490 --> 02:22:54,270
and it's harder and harder to take the
spoon fed bullshit when the Internet

2614
02:22:54,271 --> 02:22:57,690
provides you with reality
in 99% of the instances.

2615
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:58,100
Well,

2616
02:22:58,100 --> 02:23:02,790
in the 70s journalism was about you'd
want to appear to be unbiased because that

2617
02:23:02,791 --> 02:23:05,130
was acquainted with
professionalism for some reason,

2618
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:09,510
so we ended up being in Vietnam for far
longer than we could have been because

2619
02:23:09,511 --> 02:23:10,400
all of these guys there,

2620
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:14,370
they didn't want to insult their audience
by giving them their opinions like, oh,

2621
02:23:14,371 --> 02:23:14,911
it's actually,

2622
02:23:14,911 --> 02:23:18,570
this is fucked up for us to have Americans
coming back in body bags for some

2623
02:23:18,571 --> 02:23:19,740
more that we don't need to be involved,

2624
02:23:19,741 --> 02:23:21,800
and they would never say that
on the evening news. Instead.

2625
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:23,790
They would just be very clinical about it.

2626
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:27,930
But sometimes you need people who've done
the research and then come out and say,

2627
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,820
this is why this is a big deal.

2628
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:32,550
This is why you should be upset
or this is why you shouldn't care.

2629
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:35,580
But they didn't do that at all.
If the height of you know,

2630
02:23:35,581 --> 02:23:39,060
network journalism and then until very
recently you've seen that creep into

2631
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:41,610
everything. Like people who
even work at really big blogs,

2632
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,880
you see they lose some of their voice
because they're like, it's not my,

2633
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:49,130
not my position to tell you what to
think, but really it is. It's your you,

2634
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:52,770
it's my position to tell you what
I think and why I think that.

2635
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:55,650
And then you can come along for the
ride or you can go another direction.

2636
02:23:55,980 --> 02:23:59,550
But to not do that I think
is really dishonest. And
you read the New York Times,

2637
02:23:59,551 --> 02:24:03,660
which is on your tablet, on your iPad. So
it's competing with all this new stuff.

2638
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:08,190
It's better. And they're still, they have
this weird like shine of objectivity.

2639
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:10,320
So like they can't just tell
you what they actually think.

2640
02:24:10,321 --> 02:24:14,970
It has to be Mr. Obama is paying up to
$100 million for his vacation and there's

2641
02:24:14,971 --> 02:24:18,000
no notation like we disagree with this.
It's just here's what's happening

2642
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:22,000
as a figurehead. It doesn't work
anymore. As a, as a label is a, you know,

2643
02:24:22,330 --> 02:24:26,920
box that you put all your stuff into. It
doesn't work anymore. You, I, it's like,

2644
02:24:26,921 --> 02:24:29,710
it's almost like that expression.
Let the market decide.

2645
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:34,630
You really want to let the market decide
whose opinions are valid and there's

2646
02:24:34,631 --> 02:24:35,830
problems with that too.

2647
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:39,580
There's definitely like people will find
people that reinforced their opinions.

2648
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:42,390
We'll get Glenn back. That's one of the
best examples is the perfect example. Oh,

2649
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:46,880
send me his shit cause he does this
marketing tactic. We'll say the NSA leak,

2650
02:24:46,881 --> 02:24:50,930
we've got our own whistle blower.
Uh, it's coming out in 24 hours.

2651
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,600
It's like if you have this, why don't
you just come out with it right now?

2652
02:24:53,601 --> 02:24:56,690
You've got to make people visit your
website again and again over the next 24

2653
02:24:56,691 --> 02:24:59,300
hours. And then he actually
comes out with, and it's never,

2654
02:24:59,570 --> 02:25:01,580
I don't watch enough Glenn
Beck to know if this is true,

2655
02:25:01,581 --> 02:25:03,200
so I don't want to disparage the guy,

2656
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:06,500
but as far as I've seen his big blowout
things that are supposed to change the

2657
02:25:06,501 --> 02:25:08,570
world and everything will be different.

2658
02:25:08,571 --> 02:25:12,260
Never end up delivering
even a 10th on that promise.

2659
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:17,320
Fuck Glenn Beck and all praise
David Seaman. Ladies and gentlemen,

2660
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:19,410
you're a bad motherfucker dude.
I really enjoyed talking to him.

2661
02:25:19,411 --> 02:25:21,970
We got to do this more often. My
powerful Joe Rogan. Powerful David.

2662
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:26,440
See we're making shit happen out there.
One Internet viewer at a time.

2663
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:31,180
Thank you everybody for uh, did you,
did you unveil that tee shirt yet?

2664
02:25:31,330 --> 02:25:33,340
When are you available that
it's going to be a presale?

2665
02:25:33,341 --> 02:25:36,760
Hopefully later this week, if not
next week. There's the newest, latest,

2666
02:25:36,761 --> 02:25:41,200
greatest desk squad tee shirt. The
best ever for sure by far. Oh yeah.

2667
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:45,190
As soon as I saw it, I'm like, you hit
it out of the park kids. It's bad ass.

2668
02:25:45,191 --> 02:25:48,700
The newest desk squad version
number three by Brian red band.

2669
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,800
And that will be out probably
at the end of this week.

2670
02:25:50,801 --> 02:25:55,801
We'll do a podcast tomorrow with the
lovely and talented Jason Silva who I ran

2671
02:25:56,201 --> 02:25:59,530
into at a the g four 2045 conference.

2672
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:03,400
We'll have a lot of crazy shit to talk
about. That dude was on fire. He's,

2673
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:08,320
he loves technology. So he went fucking
crazy when I talked to him last.

2674
02:26:08,321 --> 02:26:12,070
He's awesome. So He'd be here tomorrow,
tomorrow afternoon, and then, um,

2675
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,010
maybe we'll do something this weekend too.
I don't know what's going on,

2676
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:18,910

show, trying to make it happen. Uh,
