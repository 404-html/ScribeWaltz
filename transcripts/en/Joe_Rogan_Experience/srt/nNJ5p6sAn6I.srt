1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,170
Which was really that excited.
Yes.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,900
Hello,
any.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,570
I'm good.
How are you?

4
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:13,350
A sports sunglasses.
I like those glasses.

5
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,450
Glasses,
sunglasses.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,500
This is.
This is how I look in your face.

7
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,150
Well thanks.
It's a good choice.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,740
We do have been flirting with me since I
arrived.

9
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,890
A little bit casual.
Nothing weird.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,010
Just the way you button that shirt all
the way up to the top.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,940
That little top button.
The Jean Jacket,

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,360
that Jay Leno's garage.
Look.

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,490
Yeah,
I just came from dot Levins podcast.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,551
So,
uh,

15
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:39,470
we were just talking about the fights.
I'd stopped you before we actually

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,240
talked.
We were just feeling like,

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,850
like this is more evidence that we are
living in a computer simulation.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,600
Like everything is getting weirder.
Politics is the most bizarre.

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,910
I mean it's,
everything is falling apart and it's

20
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,400
like the Matrix.
Programmers can't keep up with the code.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,240
Do you think that maybe like when one or
two things go weird,

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,410
like the election?

23
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,880
I think the election,
I think having a reality star television

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,570
host guy who's a media mogul become the
president of United States is so odd to

25
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:14,601
people that I think it gives us this
feeling of instability and that feeling

26
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,330
of instability,
instability has like a ripple effect and

27
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:22,320
it starts to fuck with all these other
aspects of our reality and then these

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,360
blurbs just start popping up and these
weirdnesses what's Kinda like rather

29
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,850
than it being a proof that it's a
simulation.

30
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,830
This is the most reality we've had in a
long time.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
Right?
Like we've all been living in this like

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,090
pseudo thi this theater of stability,
that hype.

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,510
I'm sure you've talked about
hypernormalization on this podcast

34
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,120
before having to.
I think the documentary,

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,060
it's real good if people haven't caught
up to it yet.

36
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:47,820
It's on youtube and in its entirety,
it's dense.

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,080
It's not like a light.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,860
It's not a light fun documentary is like
a three hour long British guide droning

39
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,170
on too,
like found footage on pvc.

40
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,670
But his basic point is that,
you know,

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,710
society is unstable and has been for a
very long time.

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,570
That greenland is melting,
we have nukes second,

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,720
destroy us at any point,
and there was no way for the leaders to

44
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,930
actually run a functional and stable
society.

45
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,300
So what they do instead is they put up
this artifice of stability.

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,510
Meanwhile,
shit is fucking collapsing behind the

47
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,520
set and basically prove out example uses
the Soviet Union,

48
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,550
right?
Is like Soviet Union stopped working

49
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,720
almost immediately,
right?

50
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,750
They,
they tried this utopic communistic

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,390
beautiful society and everything fell
apart immediately.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,370
Everybody knew what fell apart.
Everyone in in,

53
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,320
in,
in Russia knew it wasn't working,

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,380
but it,
it served them more to pretend that it

55
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:43,920
was working.
And so people got into this willful,

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,830
a sort of voluntary suspension of
disbelief.

57
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,260
This voluntary cognitive dissonance to
like say,

58
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,190
oh no,
everything's good.

59
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,020
Even though they go to the fucking the
store,

60
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,230
there's no bread.
They would just get.

61
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,130
Everybody was walking around as if it
was real.

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,100
So maybe when somebody like trump gets
elected this fake realness of like

63
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,720
everything's good Americans.
Awesome.

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,300
What a wonderful place.
A utopic society with all these

65
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,980
freedoms.
Maybe that rips the seam.

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,860
Then Anthony Rumble,
Johnson retired from MMA

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,643
or something.

68
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,280
Wow.
Where do you go with that?

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,870
I think
there's always been problems with

70
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,621
society,
right?

71
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,080
I mean,
if you go back to ancient Rome,

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,740
you know,
have you ever visited the coliseum?

73
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,623
Yeah.
Yeah.

74
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,500
Fascinating.
Right?

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,400
It crazy.
Yeah.

76
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,640
And when you think about it,
that's only,

77
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,200
you know,
you're only talking about a thousand,

78
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,890
2000 years ago,
right?

79
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,650
Like when did,
when did it all start in Rome?

80
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,580
Rome was around for,
for 2000 years.

81
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,090
Right,
right.

82
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,230
I mean there were like 10 times as long
as this American superpower has existed.

83
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,640
So.
Yeah.

84
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,440
And they were.
But the thing is they didn't have the

85
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:51,430
technology to strip mine the world the
way we do technology has now caught up

86
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,080
human evil or whatever it is,
or human avarice has always been

87
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,220
probably equal.
Right?

88
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,660
But my point was that there's never been
like any example of a society or a true

89
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:04,780
Utopian society that was like really
together,

90
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,190
very relaxed.

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,290
People are Nice.
There was no war,

92
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,580
there was no crime,
there's no rape.

93
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,070
There was no stealing.
The best example of that is hippie

94
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,904
communes,
right?

95
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,290
Because they're specifically designed to
create a mini utopia and they always

96
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,310
fall apart with a guy at the top.
Fucking everybody flies every time.

97
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,880
It's never not happened.
A friend of mine's ex-girlfriend grew up

98
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,390
in one of those and she was so fucked up
because of it.

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,900
They're always fucked up.
Yeah.

100
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,410
They're all the best you'll ever get out
of a guy or a girl that grew up in one

101
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,570
of those communes is like,
um,

102
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,670
it was in,
there was some really good parts that's

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,670
as good as you can get.
Yeah.

104
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,560
And that's someone that's just really
kind.

105
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,330
Yeah.
I mean they,

106
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,330
people always try to reengineer cycling.
I was,

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,000
I was reading something today about,
um,

108
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,170
a free housing that free housing should
be a universal right for people that

109
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,370
everyone should have free housing.

110
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,040
You know,
and I was reading this was taking a shit

111
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,510
so I didn't go into it too deeply,
but that immediately I was thinking,

112
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,160
well,
who's gonna build the housing.

113
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,080
Like how is that a right?
Like,

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,790
it can't have a universal.
Right?

115
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,150
If some people just don't want to build
a house and they don't want to work and

116
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,430
they don't want to do anything and they
want somebody else to build a house for

117
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,410
them,
that's always going to be a possibility.

118
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,340
Like.
Sure.

119
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:15,970
Yeah.
Right.

120
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,601
I mean,
I guess.

121
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:18,160
Right.
But what are rights rights are

122
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,750
completely constructed,
right?

123
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,510
I mean,
sure,

124
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,880
a lion has no right to loan that.
That should be a right,

125
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:27,730
but the right to privacy rabbit of a
lion or a ape has no rights.

126
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,070
It's just an ape getting eaten and
fucked by its neighbor.

127
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,920
Right?
So we decided what rights are so that.

128
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,190
So the same idea that says something.
Anything is a right.

129
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,360
You could also say,
yeah,

130
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,370
housing is a right.
If,

131
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,450
if society deems that that's true,
I guess.

132
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,420
Or if society has the resources,
we do have the resources.

133
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,860
That's true of right.
I think yeah,

134
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,130
I would.
I would imagine we have the rights or

135
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,450
the resources rather than how's
everybody in the car?

136
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,530
Not In the best way.
Not a sweet apartment,

137
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,470
but you know what I mean.
Just a roof over your head.

138
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,800
Warmth.
Yeah.

139
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:02,801
I think like the idea that we were
getting way into the theoretics of

140
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,010
taxation and civil responsibility,
but like the idea that we spend

141
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,270
trillions of dollars on a protective
military when we are,

142
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,600
we've lapped every other military so
many times over.

143
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,000
Like we could everybody,
every homeless person.

144
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,130
I mean there are countries where they
don't have homeless people,

145
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,640
right?

146
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,120
They just don't know.
I've been in Israel and it's like people

147
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,450
who are homeless in Israel or there are
homeless because they're crazy and want

148
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,640
to be homeless or my,
my brother was just in um,

149
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,820
uh,
one of those,

150
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,740
one of those super white countries,
Switzerland,

151
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,880
I think it was Switzerland.
And everybody was like,

152
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,930
yeah,
we don't have.

153
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,831
I mean,
this is crazy.

154
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,664
What he told me,
he was like,

155
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,990
what's this,
what society?

156
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,370
Like you're like,
it's cool,

157
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,990
you know,
we don't have like a poverty.

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,660
So that's cool.
Like they don't have poor people.

159
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,470
Yeah.
That's not a part of their society.

160
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,980
Is that Switzerland?
Is that.

161
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:53,840
What is that?
I think it was Switzerland.

162
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,900
They have,
they figured out a way to make money on

163
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,640
the Bank of Denmark is Kinda like that
too.

164
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,410
Yeah.
I mean northern Europe,

165
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,730
they,
they've done something right.

166
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,900
I think.
Well,

167
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,720
I think they're also dealing with a very
small population of people that have

168
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,580
existed for a long time in the same
place.

169
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,380
Right.
And you kind of normalize and they've

170
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,210
never conquered their conquerors,
you know,

171
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,580
they're not spreading their resources
thin across the globe,

172
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,620
making battleships and shit.
Right.

173
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,900
I was thinking about you on the way over
here.

174
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,630
I think this is connected.
I was thinking about you and the

175
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:27,950
flirtation we were going to be doing and
I was wondering,

176
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,830
because you're bent,
I've watched her stand up since trump

177
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,790
got elected and you and a lot of the
guys at the store or I would say I've

178
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,890
always taken the store,
like a libertarian,

179
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,540
a intellectual epicenter of comedy.
Right.

180
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,520
And then like if you go to go east it
becomes more and more like socialist

181
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,380
further to travel.
Right.

182
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,820
And um,
I guess what I'm the hot,

183
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,640
it's like the neocons,
but at any rate,

184
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,820
um,
I would say your bent is like,

185
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,750
everything's fucking fine.
You're,

186
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,050
you're crying,
you're making a crisis that doesn't

187
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,884
exist.

188
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,350
And I was wondering,
do you still think that it's not

189
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:05,351
necessarily really my bent,
it's the way that it works now.

190
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,970
That's a real comedian.
Yeah,

191
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,350
the community as well.
Actually I believe it's just one of the

192
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,900
things that I say on stage.
Like I say,

193
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,010
like,
um,

194
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,170
like a lot of the stuff I say it was
fucked up.

195
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,230
So if I say anything that's,
that you don't agree with,

196
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,770
I don't agree with a lot of Shit I say,
but it's funnier than when I agree with

197
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,720
like some of the things I say clearly
fucking around.

198
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,030
And then some of the things I say it's
like where's he,

199
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,370
is he on the fence on this?
But what a lot of it is,

200
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:37,760
is just to set up this idea that the
whole system has always been

201
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:38,840
preposterous.
Totally.

202
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,240
It's just that it's weird.
It's almost our fault,

203
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:41,450
right?

204
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,450
Because he'd take a guy like a Clinton
or a guy like an Obama who's fairly

205
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:51,971
successful at the job and people are
just constantly trying to find chinks in

206
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,770
the armor,
constantly trying to find cracks in who

207
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:57,000
he is.
And it was Clinton and obviously it was

208
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,670
the philandering with Obama.
There was a chink,

209
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,440
the size of a pussy.
Chinks sounds like a weird word to use

210
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,400
even if you're not using it.
And erase the word niggardly got in

211
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,760
trouble for saying niggardly.
Yeah.

212
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,190
And they were like,
you can't say that word.

213
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,010
It's like,
but it's not even etymologically

214
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,670
connected to the n word.
And we were like,

215
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,890
we don't care.
It's spelled differently.

216
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,390
Not the same root word that like,
don't use it,

217
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,700
but I feel that way about swastikas.
Do you know those hippy swastikas and

218
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,850
the Indians Swastika and all these
hippies and am like,

219
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,110
you know,
Buddhists are always like,

220
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,240
yes,
it's a different spots to cuts a special

221
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,160
swastika,
the good swastika.

222
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,350
It's like the good witch and the bad
witch from the wizard of Oz.

223
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,560
And I'm like,
alright,

224
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,910
that's cool Buddhist,
but I think you should just abandon the

225
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,760
good swastika.
You gotta own.

226
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,370
You've got other shit you could do.
It was a symbol used in Okinawa and

227
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,810
karate.
Oh really?

228
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah.
Actually it's made its rounds.

229
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,410
Right?
Because he was in India,

230
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,080
in,
in a Hindu temples,

231
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,060
Okinawa.
Maybe that's Buddhism,

232
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,650
Hinduism to Buddhism to karate.
I like that.

233
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:57,870
I don't know where,
where,

234
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,740
why it was in there.
But I remember seeing it a long time ago

235
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,740
in a store like this Okinawan karate
book.

236
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,340
And there was this like these symbols
and I was like this bizarre,

237
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,640
like a swastika is a part of karate,
but it might've been reversed,

238
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,220
you know?
Sometimes they do it the opposite way,

239
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,420
but yeah,
that's symbols gone.

240
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:16,254
You got to let that go.

241
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,830
Well let's just abandon that one.
Then you could walk away from that with

242
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,300
you got other symbols.
It's like a lot like the Hitler

243
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,620
mustache,
like there's no need.

244
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,220
I mean look,
chaplain suffered,

245
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,190
but no,
I bet Mr. Mr Miyagi was like,

246
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,420
you know,
wax on,

247
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,400
wax off,
put that swastika on your shoulder.

248
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,160
Isn't it funny that you could just
stretch that bitch just a little bit and

249
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,940
you're okay if you just trim it just
light.

250
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,710
Oh,
you're talking about.

251
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,030
But yeah,
as long as it's not the actual Hitler.

252
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,210
If you just stretch it slightly towards
the corner of your mouth,

253
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,480
you just keep going.
Just bring that bitch back like this.

254
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,720
You're okay.
I thought you were being so vulgar for a

255
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:55,050
second and that you just had the most
like pornography pornographic thought

256
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,831
ever.
That crazy.

257
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,660
If you just stretch that bitch just a
little bit,

258
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,050
you're just.

259
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,400
You're okay.
Just stretch it.

260
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,960
Stretch it.
But his mouth.

261
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,440
I was thinking about a pussy.
No,

262
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,940
no,
no.

263
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,350
Wow.
That's weird that you just went there

264
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:05,700
and we're talking about Hitler's
mustache.

265
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,780
Well,
I get turned on.

266
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,880
When I think about the Nazis,
I got a real,

267
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,690
like some of the synopsis in my Jewish
Brain got cross.

268
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,380
She called that desk the next special
mouth.

269
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,040
Fucking Hitler
stretching Hitler's mouth.

270
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,860
But isn't it a weird thing like that
mustache,

271
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:22,230
like it's.
There's a certain amount of space it can

272
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:26,190
cover on your lip and it's okay because
as long as it goes far enough left and

273
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,030
right where I.
Okay.

274
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,840
You know,
I mean the Hitlers haircut is making a

275
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,670
huge comeback.
That's right.

276
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,800
And people get in trouble for that
haircut.

277
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,380
I was the first guy,
I mean I was on the first wave,

278
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,790
I would say I was in the,
not the first right of hipsters

279
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,840
reclaiming that haircut.

280
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,170
Well it's like a longer on the side,
write longer on the side,

281
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,980
sort of puffy on the top.
I mean it's,

282
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,140
you got rocky hit late night.
I used to know this.

283
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,200
This is,
I've changed since because it got too

284
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,010
cool and I truly am a hipster.
I follow,

285
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,510
I follow where the trends go,
but I used to have a,

286
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,270
I used to have a bit about it,
about the dilemma that a Jew has when

287
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,190
he's telling a barbara what he wants.
And the only,

288
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,980
the quickest way to describe it,
it's just to say Hitler.

289
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,790
So you want something,
you know,

290
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,400
like a kind of old timey,
kind of a like a military cut like

291
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,550
Hitler,
Hitler,

292
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,400
the destroyer of my people make me look
like him.

293
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,190
And then the punch,
the tag was as my grandparents turned

294
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,930
over and they're shallow unmarked
graves.

295
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,990
Anyway.
Yeah,

296
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,620
let's start.

297
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,650
Yeah,
it was dark.

298
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,950
But my point was originally,
not really that I had a point,

299
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:31,951
but when we chipping away at this thing,
like we know that politicians are doing

300
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,240
an act.
We know that there when,

301
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,130
you know,
I've always mocked the way they

302
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,710
communicate,
like the way they give speeches,

303
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,120
the long pauses in this very distinct
pattern of behavior that's completely

304
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,460
alien to anything other than a political
speech.

305
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:48,580
Like the only way this country survives,
you know,

306
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,220
like that kind of the strange thing that
they do.

307
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,440
But when,
when we're always like chipping away at

308
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,430
that,
we're always trying to like get to like

309
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,400
be real key.
We gotta get,

310
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,540
we gotta find out what's real and then
we get this guy who realer than anyone's

311
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,560
ever been.
Yeah.

312
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:03,970
And we're like,
well fuck this,

313
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,560
this is crazy.
And it scares us.

314
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,130
That's the point of that documentary we
like to be lied to.

315
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,260
It makes us all feel calm and
comfortable to be given a stable lie

316
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,490
than to be shown the real truth of how
fucked up and unstable everything.

317
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,370
Yeah,
I mean the.

318
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,540
The trailer has this text over over,
just like stock footage.

319
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,980
It's just.
And it's so scary.

320
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:28,720
It's the words are a politicians lie to
us.

321
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,090
We know they lie,
they know,

322
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,340
we know they lie,
they just don't care.

323
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,020
And I just always sent chills down my
spine because it's so true and everybody

324
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,150
knows it.
And yet we're all engaged in this

325
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,920
willful suspension of disbelief.
Like,

326
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,161
no,
no,

327
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,090
no,
everything's good.

328
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,253
You know?
No,

329
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,160
both America's both the greatest country
on earth and it needs to be made great.

330
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,800
Again.
It's like we're all in this weird,

331
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,680
like we're unclear on what were even
arguing for.

332
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,570
It's almost like what trump's done is
put a totally new engine in the heart of

333
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,470
the car.

334
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,890
It's like if you have an old car like
Washington and it relies on a combustion

335
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,410
engine and then someone comes along and
puts an electrical engine and then

336
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:08,831
you're like,
whoa,

337
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:09,250
whoa,
Whoa,

338
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,230
what are you saying?
You don't need congress anymore.

339
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,450
You don't need the Senate.
You don't need this.

340
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,430
You don't need that.
You don't need the cronies.

341
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:19,750
You don't need the lobbyists.
You have this whole new system and you

342
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,750
don't need to pretend to talk like that.
Even more importantly,

343
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,700
you don't need to do the theatrics
anymore.

344
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,340
You can be a real,
the real terrible person who always wore

345
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,750
and everybody goes along with it.
That's the weirdest thing to me about

346
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,640
this election is not the president
himself,

347
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,370
excuse me,
but how many people on line who you've

348
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:43,420
never seen politically engaged are now
in it like like a,

349
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,350
like a sports fan?
You know?

350
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,210
I do understand well to the people that
hate trump.

351
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,770
I understand because what it did was

352
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,250
it disrupted our programming on such a
profound level that people.

353
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,500
I was talking to somebody last night
that said that it was much more

354
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,590
disturbing when trump got elected.
Then nine slash 11 was to them,

355
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,580
and I understand that sentiment because
nine slash 11 was a terrible event.

356
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,020
This feels like a terrible new chapter
in American history,

357
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,380
but nine slash 11 happened while Bush
was in office and Dick Cheney was the

358
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,960
vice president.
He was one of the scariest guys to ever

359
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,650
have no doubt,
and that is the.

360
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,290
I mean,
I think the best point that you're

361
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:29,120
making is like Dick Cheney's pretending
that he's stable while meanwhile he's

362
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:33,590
like Japan stowing evil in to bombing
Iraq and you know,

363
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,640
do you want a guy that makes you feel
somewhat comfortable and stable?

364
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:42,260
Who is actually the most evil Satan
fucker in the world or a guy that makes

365
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,900
you feel the evil but isn't as bad.

366
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,400
Way more transparent.
His motivations.

367
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,580
I mean,
Cheney was the ceo of Halliburton and

368
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,900
then all sudden Halliburton wants to
bomb Iraq.

369
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:55,710
You know,
he does rather they get these billion

370
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,790
dollar,
multibillion dollar,

371
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,780
no bid contracts to rebuild what they've
bombed and you're like,

372
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:03,000
Jesus Christ,
a little kid can connect the dots here.

373
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,440
This is,
this is insane.

374
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,670
I always just wonder what,
how much money do you want?

375
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,870
I never quite get it like you're willing
to just in.

376
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,250
It just seems too simple to me to go,
oh no,

377
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,050
they just wanted money like.
But there's,

378
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,180
there's a lot.
They all had a lot of money.

379
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,340
When I talk to a big businessman,
now

380
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,241
you know what it is,
man.

381
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,370
It's the deal.
It's all about the deal.

382
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,140
It's all about closing deals,
making deals,

383
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:25,250
closing deals,
and winning.

384
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,890
That's what it's all about.
It's like,

385
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,650
that's like saying to someone that loves
video games.

386
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,140
Why are you playing video games?
Like why are you playing them?

387
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,030
You've already played.
You played it,

388
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,190
you've got the game.
You know how to play a game.

389
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,310
Why keep playing?
Because they're getting a little juice

390
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,500
out of it.
Every time they do it at the closing

391
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,380
deals or buying a new yacht.
I've got an amazing,

392
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,180
amazing New York,
the biggest shot ever,

393
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,100
so the most wonderful yacht,
the yacht.

394
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:50,840
You'll see this yacht.
It's amazing.

395
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,400
Wait to you see it.
It's incredible.

396
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,130
The biggest yacht.
That's trump at a nutshell,

397
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:55,540
right?
I,

398
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,140
yeah.
Do would you want the biggest yacht?

399
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,580
No,
I wouldn't either.

400
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,410
Well,
I know a guy has one.

401
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,290
It's a giant target.
You have to have like have these

402
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,920
military guys at guard this fucking
thing because he'll.

403
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,880
What they'll do is they'll travel this
yacht without him just south of France

404
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,380
and then he flies in private jet of
course flies in to the south of France

405
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:20,270
and this private jet climbs out and then
they have to escort him to his gigantic

406
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,720
multi hundred million dollar house that
floats in the water and you have to keep

407
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,450
people from getting on your lawn.
Essentially the like the lawn becomes

408
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:33,050
all the water around your multibillion
dollar house or multimillion dollar

409
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:33,380
house

410
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,960
and it's just so that you can show your
other billionaire friends like,

411
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,050
look what I got.
Well it's also probably fun as fuck to

412
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,100
take no doubt floating mansion

413
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,560
out there on the south of France,
but I guess it's just why else have the

414
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:47,394
money?
I mean,

415
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,130
why not?
If you're balling and you enjoy

416
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,740
all that stuff,
like I guess they just want more.

417
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,660
They just keep.
Keep going.

418
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,130
There's something more to it than just
the acquisition of money because once

419
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,430
you have a billion dollars,
you can afford thing all of the things

420
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,020
that you need or can afford.
All those things though.

421
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
See One of these mansions,
like if you,

422
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:11,601
if you look at a mansion like a crazy
fucking Hampton's mansion,

423
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,130
you know,
you could get one of those for like $50

424
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,960
million,
$50 million,

425
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,480
$100,000,000 before taxes,
right?

426
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
Taxes,
expenses,

427
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,160
sales tax.
You have to makeup,

428
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,830
you have to earn profit of $100,000,000
to get the $50,000,000 mansion and then

429
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,870
that's not,
that's not shit.

430
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,220
Compared to some of these yachts,
like a yacht can go for half a billion.

431
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,070
Like they have yachts,
like what's the most expensive yet we,

432
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,410
we've covered this before,
wasn't it like a billion?

433
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,910
I think it's a billion.

434
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,790
A billion dollars for a boat.
A billion dollar million dollar boat.

435
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,620
Yeah.
And then what we'll do,

436
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,470
you have to have a jack about how empty
you feel inside when you sit the first

437
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,630
night and your billion dollars.
It depends on how much coke you're

438
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:52,180
doing.
You might feel totally full full of coke

439
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,570
and hookers.
Yeah,

440
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,880
you probably do.
And you have three phone calls going on

441
00:18:56,881 --> 00:19:01,881
at the same time doing deals and that is
why I 100 percent believe the reports of

442
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,670
that streets of Monaco $1,000,000,000.
That is crazy.

443
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,920
Yeah,
it's,

444
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,140
it's a castle on a boat that floats in
the water.

445
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,180
It's insane.
Yeah.

446
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,520
Well that's a battleship.
That's an aircraft carrier.

447
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,080
Well,
it's really like a city.

448
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,270
I mean,
look how it's designed.

449
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:23,271
I mean it looked the outside of it.
It all looks like this amazing block and

450
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:26,730
what this is theoretical,
but they will build for someone if they

451
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,050
give them a billion dollars.

452
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,370
Uh,
let's see.

453
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,380
The difference in a yacht and number
three,

454
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,250
which is a $650,000,000,
it's triple the cost.

455
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,500
What is a billion buying?
You will nothing yet.

456
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,090
This one still in construction.
The design,

457
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,550
that fantastic yacht,
unlike the traditional model.

458
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,470
So this is the probably the most.
It's so it's a replica of a casinos and

459
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:50,430
the Monaco Grand Prix track.
It's so funny to me that you spend a

460
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,460
billion dollars on something and it
looks that fucking Gadi and disgusting,

461
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,240
like there's nothing about that that
looks cool other than it's billion this.

462
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,230
Yeah,
that's the only.

463
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,040
It looks cool because it's.
It's mimicking Monaco number,

464
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,230
but the number two one is how much that
one,

465
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:07,350
Jamie,
that's foreign and $50 million to one

466
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:10,230
point $2 billion and I'm sorry,
anybody with a billion dollar yacht

467
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,830
should be murdered.
I don't think I'm going out on a limb by

468
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,270
saying that they should be killed.

469
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,850
Okay.
It costs a billion dollars.

470
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,700
Maybe we don't know the exact cost of
building such a monstrosity,

471
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,490
but various source of listed the price
of construction.

472
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,230
Even as high as one point 5 billion.
It's manned by 70 crew members and owned

473
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:32,910
by Russian billionaire.
Roman Abramovich contains its own

474
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:37,080
private defense system designed to
detect intruders and camera wielding

475
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,210
spectators.
Wow.

476
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,760
It's got a laser to kill to.
We get that.

477
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,850
It uses modern light technology to block
the cameras.

478
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Is Room for 24 to hell.
IPADS and has its own private submarine.

479
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,320
By the time you get the private
submarine money,

480
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,260
something's gone very right and very
wrong in your life,

481
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,450
especially if you're.
If you're a Russian billionaire,

482
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,790
you have to be in bed with Putin.
Oh,

483
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,780
you have to.
Yeah.

484
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,660
You can't just like be.
I'm just politically agnostic.

485
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,510
You,
you'll be straight up drinking a arsenic

486
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,350
at some point or they'll just take your
company and lock you up.

487
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,640
I mean,
they've done that to a bunch of

488
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:15,010
oligarchs.
He'd just takes your company,

489
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,770
puts you in the pokey.
But I wonder,

490
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,230
um,
do you think that you can be that there

491
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:20,751
are.
I mean,

492
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:23,560
I guess like Bill,
Bill Gates and Warren Buffet seemed like

493
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,570
Nice people,
but it seems like if you're a

494
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:28,870
billionaire,
you're probably like at least a cousin

495
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,750
of evil,
like you've done something terrible.

496
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,250
Is that true though?
I mean,

497
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,920
it's got.
There's gotta be a way to be an ethical

498
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,010
billionaire if there is a way to make a
million dollars ethically,

499
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,650
which we believe there is.
There's gotta be a way to make a

500
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,461
billion.
I mean,

501
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:45,670
it's just a matter of keeping going,
I guess.

502
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,620
Buffet seems like a good guy,
but then you get into what good guy

503
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:50,170
means for a billionaire.
Right?

504
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,510
Like good buffets,
good guy is like,

505
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,590
I will allow $800,
million to go to AIDS in Africa,

506
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,000
but I will not allow that same 800
million to go to famine in Somalia.

507
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,620
So there's a kind of a weird moral
arbiter thing that happens which happens

508
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,140
to the president to.
It's like when people point out that

509
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:10,830
like Obama bombed people with drones.
I,

510
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,270
I'm A.
I was pretty disgusted by a lot of

511
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:16,090
things Obama did,
but it's like that is part of the

512
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:20,230
morality of being a world leader is you
have to be comfortable with a morality

513
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,670
that includes killing innocent people.
And that's why I would never want to be

514
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,910
the leader of anything.
Only one reason why there's a ton of

515
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,500
reasons why you'd never want to do that
job.

516
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,580
Yeah.
The worst.

517
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,773
But I,
you know,

518
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,240
there's this idea that people love the
president,

519
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,000
which also like really kind of blows my
mind.

520
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,480
Like why do we,
why do we love our president?

521
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,310
They don't love the president in every
country.

522
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:46,150
There was a super disturbing video that
a guy no took where he was at the

523
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:51,151
inauguration and trump is coming up the
stairs and as trauma's coming stairs,

524
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,540
all supporters,
right?

525
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,403
This is,
uh,

526
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,141
you know,
the,

527
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:57,160
the heart of his love and as he's coming
up the stairs,

528
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:02,161
people are clapping and applauding and
this guy next to this guy I know who's

529
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,290
holding the camera says,
thank you,

530
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,780
Mr Trump.
You are a godsend.

531
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,930
Thank you sir.
Thank you very much.

532
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,810
And it's,
and he barely acknowledges that guy of

533
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,420
course,
just because it was $100 million people.

534
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,300
Right?
And he wanders up the stairs and goes

535
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:22,090
through the room and all these people
are following him with the camera on

536
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:24,160
them.
I think that's what a guy like that once

537
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,460
he wants somebody to say that to him.
Yeah.

538
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,920
He wants to be that guy.
I understand actually being trucked in

539
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,630
that situation and want people to
worship you.

540
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,860
I,
I can get there.

541
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:36,010
I'm a comedian that's,
that's close enough to a desperate ego

542
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,530
where you like laugh at me is similar to
worship me,

543
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,280
but why do we worship politicians?
I can't wrap my brain around it.

544
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Like Gore Vidal

545
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
said that he called it the uniquely
American religion of worshiping the

546
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,300
president.
Well,

547
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:56,270
I think it goes back to the fact that
we've never had a king,

548
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,620
so our president is a different thing
and I think the idea to have the one

549
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,130
alpha is just some ancient ape shit.
Yeah.

550
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,590
One hundred percent does only makes
sense.

551
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,370
There's always an Alpha champ.
There's an Alpha gorilla and there's

552
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:13,880
just like these,
these hierarchies exist in the primitive

553
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,880
versions of us.
Why wouldn't they exist in the most

554
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,110
advanced?
That's really interesting.

555
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:19,830
I never thought about it like that.
Like A,

556
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:25,030
we're so intelligent that we've created
a stratified Alpha pyramid that is $300

557
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,970
million big with a parliamentary system
and a constitution,

558
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,910
but it's still just a bunch of apes know
running around,

559
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,560
you know,
2001 in.

560
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,640
I mean,
even like,

561
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,710
go back to what we're talking about,
like Bill Gates,

562
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,340
who's this in incredibly,
uh,

563
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,340
what,
what,

564
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,760
what he's done charitably is amazing.

565
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,740
He does a lot of great stuff with his
money mean their foundation is really,

566
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:53,741
really beneficial to a lot of people,
but everybody knows him as the king ape

567
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,700
of Microsoft.
I mean,

568
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,360
that's how these businesses work.
Tim Cook,

569
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,220
that's the king eight of Apple.
You know,

570
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,110
we always have a king ape or queen ape,
right?

571
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,710
Very rarely a queen a put when we have.
It doesn't seem to work out.

572
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,750
When named Queen Eight that Toronto is
chick was a big queen a,

573
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:15,020
but it didn't work out because it turns
out she was a fraud.

574
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,840
Who's Toronto's?
You don't want to story.

575
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,571
No.
Oh,

576
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:19,310
it's amazing.
It's amazing story.

577
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,580
It's a story of something where people
wanted something to be true.

578
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,380
So they kind of said yes.
We finally have and they didn't do any

579
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,930
investigating on it until finally
somebody actually did.

580
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,760
I think it might've been the Wall Street
Journal.

581
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,600
It took it down,
but

582
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,230
I was just woman Elizabeth something or
another.

583
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:41,450
She,
she founded this company called Toronto.

584
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,190
There she is,
Elizabeth Holmes,

585
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,240
and she dressed like Steve Jobs.
She wore a black turtleneck black stuff.

586
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,480
She acted like she was this super genius
character and when she was 19 she left

587
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:56,260
college to start this company called
Toronto.

588
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,930
And Toronto is a company that would do
this.

589
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:04,931
I'm very cheap and effective blood scan,
like they would take a drop of your

590
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:11,330
blood,
prick your blood and test you for all

591
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:13,480
sorts of different diseases.
And um,

592
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,160
it turns out it doesn't work at all.
It's just a black box.

593
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,500
No,
but just hugely ineffective.

594
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,960
And she was worth in one point in time
$34 billion dollars because of what this

595
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:28,961
company was assessed as being valued at
which she could have been able to do.

596
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,780
And um,
it turned out that they started looking

597
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,880
into it and then there was a
whistleblower from the company that was

598
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:37,520
saying that she was ignoring all the
negatives and concentrate on the

599
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,220
positives.
And these people know untold,

600
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,650
tens of thousands.
And even,

601
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,070
I think maybe even a

602
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,620
million people were put it.
How many people find out how many people

603
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:50,760
were tested by this shit,
but they were all put at risk because

604
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:53,130
it's hugely effective,
like off by like 40,

605
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:56,550
50 percent negatives and positives and
just wasn't right.

606
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,610
It just was wrong all the time.
Does this idea that she was going to

607
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:03,240
bypass this traditional system and they
were putting them in like walgreens and

608
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:06,210
stuff like that and allowing people to
get tested and screened for all these

609
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:11,211
diseases and it really wasn't effective,
but she was one of the very rare king

610
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,450
queen chimps were the matriarchal
society was,

611
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,340
you know,
her business and it didn't work.

612
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,010
You conflating the collapse of the
business to know.

613
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,130
I'm just saying she was the only one
that I can think of.

614
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,240
What would that have been very effective
female world leaders though.

615
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
Top,
top chimp,

616
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,890
golden my ear,
Margaret Thatcher.

617
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,290
Merkel what's the woman that got blown
up in some very effective women?

618
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,380
You're like,
what's the one that got blown up?

619
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,070
Who Am I thinking of the,
uh,

620
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,380
who was killed?
Yeah,

621
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:39,840
yeah,
yeah.

622
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,980
She's a famous goddammit shipper.
Names of the tip of my tongue.

623
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,520
Oh,
early morning podcasts.

624
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,310
Motherfucker day after travel.
Stupid.

625
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,163
What?
What country?

626
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,010
Don't remember.
One of the Middle Eastern ones that they

627
00:27:56,011 --> 00:27:57,260
killed a woman.
Yeah.

628
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,920
I don't remember.
You know what I'm talking about Jamie?

629
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,620
God dammit.
We'll call the line right now if you

630
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:06,390
know what woman got blown up.
It's a famous story because it happened

631
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,520
in our lifetime.
A Jamie,

632
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,000
you'll find it.
God dammit her.

633
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,280
Her name's at the tip of my tongue.
This is driving me fucking crazy.

634
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,800
Just like blown up like right next to
her limo.

635
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,393
Hmm.

636
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,380
Anyway.
Um,

637
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,670
it's just.
Yeah.

638
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,590
Margaret Thatcher is a good example.
Yes.

639
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,670
But uh,
like companies like lily,

640
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,360
we were talking about like Bill Gates
and stuff like that.

641
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,310
You never see that rent.
Oh,

642
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,580
at the top.
At the top of a Qa.

643
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,790
Carly Fiorina you got.
She was the head of,

644
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,370
uh,
she ran the Republican,

645
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,270
one of the Republican people that ran
for president this and she was at

646
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,570
Hewlett Packard.
I wanted something like that maybe.

647
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,910
Yeah.
What do you think it is?

648
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,100
You really think it's just an ape shit?
Well,

649
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,530
I think there's definitely some women
that have a more masculine

650
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:04,531
characteristics and enjoy the
competition of the board room and that

651
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,370
kind of stuff more than some women do,
but I think that a day.

652
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,910
Yeah.
Then the country was at Pakistan,

653
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:13,481
Pakistan,
right.

654
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,310
I was gonna say Pakistan,
but didn't want to fuck it up.

655
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,280
Um,
yeah.

656
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,470
I don't know.
I mean,

657
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:22,720
what,
what is a masculine characteristics?

658
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:26,610
What's a feminine characteristics?
Obviously there's massive variations in,

659
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,340
in both genders,
but why are almost all lead?

660
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,170
It's the patriarchy man.
I mean,

661
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,870
it is the patriarchy.
I think it is.

662
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,090
What does that mean though?
What it means is that therapists,

663
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,200
there are systems in place and maybe are
biological systems is what suggesting

664
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,320
it's a primary thing and maybe their
societal systems.

665
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,800
Probably the truth is that they're both.
And I think that a person that really

666
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:51,610
believes in,
in like feminism and patriarchy would

667
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,160
say the societal systems are more,
are the bigger,

668
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,820
the bigger issue.
Uh,

669
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,090
but even you can believe in the
patriarchy that's biological,

670
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:01,570
but just that it's more,
there's a barrier to entry that starts

671
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,020
in kindergarten.
It starts in child rearing that would,

672
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,250
that,
that every,

673
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,550
in order for a woman to become a CEO,
they have to have to jump every hoop

674
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,480
higher than the male that want is on the
same path because there are systems or

675
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,240
structural systems in place that want to
snip smack that woman down towards like

676
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,390
a more what is perceived as a no do
something a little bit more feminine.

677
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,040
And so they,
in order to be,

678
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,790
it's this idea that is true with all
oppressed people that in order to be

679
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,080
average you have to be great.

680
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,360
And I,
I saw that directly with like my mother

681
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,820
who's a deaf and uh,
in order I just,

682
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,090
the deaf community is so fascinating and
weird,

683
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:42,940
but like in order to be what my mother
is,

684
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,740
which is like a,
she has a master's degree and she's

685
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:48,430
college educated.
You have to try 20 times as hard as an

686
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,310
average person that wants to get a
master's degree because there's so much

687
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:55,330
insane barrier to entry from day one
from the first day you were born.

688
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,830
So I think that's the patriarchy I don't
think is really up for debate.

689
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,560
I mean even if you believe just in a
biological imperative,

690
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,480
men are in charge and therefore they
keep women from getting to positions of

691
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:09,460
being in charge.
So in order to get up there,

692
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:12,520
in order to be a ceo you have to be more
aggressive,

693
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,970
more powerful,
more more Steve Jobs,

694
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,260
you gotta put a put more turtle necks
on.

695
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,430
Well yeah.
But is that,

696
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,700
is that the actual system that's in
place or are there far more men who want

697
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,090
to do that job?

698
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,640
But why would there be more men that
want to do the job?

699
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,020
That's a good question.
Isn't it

700
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,290
natural?
I mean,

701
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:34,370
is it natural for women to gravitate
towards nursing and physicians and,

702
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:38,060
and healthcare because that is
overwhelmingly run by women,

703
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,400
but then why are they,
for example,

704
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,550
why aren't they,
why don't they gravitate towards being a

705
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:46,520
doctor if there is a lot of women do.
Yes.

706
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,090
Yeah,
but,

707
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,350
but doc be being a doctor is largely and
historically dominated by men and there

708
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,460
something that's the case anymore.
It might not be anymore.

709
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,340
You know,
I mean,

710
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,430
I guess what I'm saying is like if you
look at a woman and say,

711
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:58,881
oh,
well they,

712
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:01,880
like,
they are biologically predisposed to

713
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,770
nurture,
then you would say,

714
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,311
oh,
okay.

715
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:07,250
Then it would make sense that all of the
great doctors of history would have been

716
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:09,110
women or,
or it would have been dominated in the

717
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:09,950
same way nursing has.

718
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,130
Well not necessarily because a lot of
the great doctors in history,

719
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:17,330
you're talking a lot about science.
You're talking about the ability to

720
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,390
recognize issues before anyone else does
and try to like formulate some sort of a

721
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:25,040
solution to figure out some biological
issue.

722
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,640
A lot of that is science and obviously
science has been dominated by men for

723
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:31,310
the longest time.
The real questions are why.

724
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:31,960
Right,
right.

725
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,210
And for sure there's been some sexism,
right?

726
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,920
There's,
for sure there's been some oppressing

727
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,611
of,
uh,

728
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:38,550
women's,
uh,

729
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,490
ideas

730
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,030
and their ambitions and entering into
certain fields.

731
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,990
And there's old boys clubs where they
don't want women around because he can't

732
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:50,600
talk about pussy.
And you can talk about mustaches.

733
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,011
Hitler,
Hitler,

734
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,844
pussies,
you know,

735
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,410
I mean there's a certain amount of
freedom that men enjoy when they were

736
00:32:56,411 --> 00:33:00,530
around only other men and that's in
place because they're the,

737
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,490
they are the Alphas of society.
And so like the freedom that we desire

738
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:05,690
as men.
And I'm not.

739
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:06,883
Look,
I'm like uh,

740
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,940
uh.
Woke boy,

741
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,880
I'd like lefty but I still am a man.
Whoa boy.

742
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,541
Well,
you know,

743
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,340
like,
like I consider myself a political

744
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:15,750
progressive and I do believe in and you
say,

745
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,790
do you ever say I'm so woke?
I mean ironically I will hashtag woke.

746
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,850
Hashtag stay woke all day,
every day.

747
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,900
Hashtag I eat meat,
but that.

748
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,793
No,
that's yours.

749
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,140
Hashtag I eat meat.
You always hashtag things.

750
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,540
I eat meat sometimes.
I don't always.

751
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,040
I think I made it may have.
Well you,

752
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,450
when you have like an what?
Do you have?

753
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:33,900
Like a seared duck?
Yeah.

754
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,320
I enjoy watching your elk.
Elk.

755
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,640
Instagram.
Thanks man.

756
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,630
Yeah.
Do you eat meat?

757
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,500
I eat meat.
Yeah.

758
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,720
Um,
yeah,

759
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,190
I eat meat.
It's a weird one,

760
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,120
right?
Neat.

761
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,153
No,
it's a weird.

762
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,920
It's a weird thing like a admitting like
you've got to go

763
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,090
because we know if you're a real
progressive,

764
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:54,590
if you're real caring person,
it's like,

765
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,240
okay,
you're eating murdered animals.

766
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,040
I mean,
I don't,

767
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,340
I don't think that I am as a,
as ardent a meat eating supporter as you

768
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,960
are,
but I also am not a.

769
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,330
There is a moral imperative not to eat
meat,

770
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:08,820
right.
I,

771
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,150
I fall somewhere in the middle,
which is.

772
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,130
I mean,
I think every thinking person falls in

773
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:16,350
the middle,
which is meat probably isn't an

774
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,400
obviously immoral thing to eat because
we want it.

775
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,540
We are,
we are,

776
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,630
we are animals and we want need and if
we didn't,

777
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,570
why does a lie in the meat?
And we shouldn't.

778
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,220
Well,
we're not a carnivore,

779
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,750
but we are an Omnivore,
right?

780
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,190
I,
I believe that,

781
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,540
but there's a lot of people that say
we're not.

782
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,560
That's the big argument.
You know,

783
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,860
I have this weird herbivores.
I will.

784
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:37,520
Yeah.
It's odd to say the word divorce because

785
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,830
we're not like Mcdonald's.
Mcdonald's,

786
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,720
right?
It's not just that.

787
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,430
I mean,
not that we can get away with eating it,

788
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,620
but their faces designed for it.
Right,

789
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:46,160
right.
Yeah.

790
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,510
For for a big block.
Actually.

791
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,280
Perfectly.
Actually.

792
00:34:49,281 --> 00:34:50,690
Have you heard about the new big Mac?
No.

793
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,760
So there's a new hamburger at
Mcdonald's.

794
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:54,950
It's a big Mac,
but if you don't want all that food,

795
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,380
it's a.
they've taken out one button and one

796
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,720
patty,
so it's just a.

797
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,940
it's a cheeseburger,
but they're calling to the mack Jr.

798
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,990
This is the kind of pernicious.
Real demenTia is a fucking cheeseburger.

799
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,060
So that's what they're calling it.
That's so stupid.

800
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,170
The mac.
There it is.

801
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,620
Jesus.
Come back to you and your solid one less

802
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,600
layer.
So it has the same amount of patties.

803
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:15,730
Is that to patties?
No,

804
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,690
it's not.
It's one less patty.

805
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,850
One less button.
It's a fucking cheeseburger.

806
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,391
And they're like,
oh no,

807
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:20,900
no,
no.

808
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,490
But it comes with our special sauce.
Oh,

809
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:25,580
so it's a bad cheeseburger.
I used to have a joke that actresses are

810
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,260
like big macs.
They never look as good as their

811
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:30,060
pictures.
It's like,

812
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,090
when's the last time you saw a big back
like that?

813
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,530
Like god damn,
that looks great.

814
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,060
Wait,
what about the third big mac?

815
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:36,680
The grand mac.
Oh,

816
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,040
they're going,
what's in the grant?

817
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,560
for those that didn't think the big mac
was big enough,

818
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,300
it's a 100 percent beef patties ways.

819
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,750
A third of a pound,
two slices,

820
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,230
one that this is the problem with two
slices of melty,

821
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,120
melty american cheese.
What does that mean?

822
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,661
It's like,
well,

823
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,430
it's not real cheese.
So we call it melty,

824
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:56,220
melty american cheese.
It's melty american cheese is all one

825
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,900
word.
Melty american cheese.

826
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,450
Stay woke.
Stay melty cheese at all.

827
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,960
Those I eat melty.
I mean it's,

828
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,070
this is the problem with me.
It's not you shooting an elk with a

829
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:10,320
fucking bow and arrow.
It's mcdonald's.

830
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:11,850
Like having like,
you know,

831
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,150
couch weights,
you know,

832
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,770
stacked up and like they'Re eating their
own shit and we're all like just

833
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:20,310
consuming it at the detriment of the
global world.

834
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,170
Green greenhouse gases.
I mean,

835
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,470
if only if everybody hunted to the way
you hunt then then there would be no

836
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,620
moral.
There'd be no moral question about elk.

837
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,090
They would starve.
It wouldn't,

838
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,250
we wouldn't make it,
but I will.

839
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,140
We don't.
We don't even need meat.

840
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,520
No,
we don't need it.

841
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,900
That's what I think the weird argument
about veganism from a moralistic

842
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,610
perspective can be.
If you talk about it from an

843
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:46,290
environmental perspective,
it's very,

844
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,650
very difficult.
I always say like when you talk about,

845
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,510
I don't know if I want to say this on
your podcast,

846
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,820
but when you talk to them about when you
talk about environmental effects of

847
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,690
neat,
it's the same way that it feels the same

848
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,430
as when you bring up the settlements in
Israel,

849
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,340
you can have all these great
intellectual discussions on well

850
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:03,330
actually,
well,

851
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:06,220
and then you bring up the environmental
and you just go back.

852
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,500
Can't defend that.
There's no,

853
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,810
there's no defense there.
I feel the Same way with the settlements

854
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,360
in Israel is like,
I can make an impassioned plea for

855
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,860
Israel and then when you bring up the
settlements,

856
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:14,401
I'm like,
yeah,

857
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:14,970
I got nothing.

858
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,170
Once you start bulldozing people,
I don't know.

859
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,180
I'm not sure what tanks,
but we started this whole thing off with

860
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,050
trying to figure out why women gravitate
towards certain things and whether or

861
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,300
not there'd be suppressed and this is a
subject.

862
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:32,350
It's almost like racism where,
uh,

863
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,190
if you're not a black person and you
start talking about black lives matter,

864
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:35,731
people go,
hey,

865
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:36,930
fuck head.
Like whaT?

866
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,810
What you,
you either be ultra supportive or shut

867
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:42,660
the fuck up now you get to be an ally
or,

868
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:43,620
you know,
get out of the way.

869
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,930
I hear that there is.
Yeah,

870
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,610
I hear that.
And that's kind of representative I

871
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:50,850
think of the way a lot of women feel
like the struggle is so pervasive and

872
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,370
it's so much a part of their lives and
they don't get supported in it.

873
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,950
And iT's so frustrating,
especially a woman that is trying to

874
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:56,910
climb the corporate ladder.

875
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,280
Like I have a good friend who's a big
tiMe executive.

876
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,110
She was at google now setting up another
one of those big tech companies and

877
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:06,540
she's a super,
super intelligent,

878
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:10,590
super ambitious too.
And she's one of Those rare women that

879
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,780
um,
well her mom's like that too.

880
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:14,760
So it's kind of interesting,
it's interesting when you meet her mom

881
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,620
who's this older,
super sharp lady,

882
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,010
but she's just always been like the type
of person that enjoys achieving.

883
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,540
She'd like,
this is like her mindset.

884
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,450
She enJoys it.
She likes to achieving problem solving.

885
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:30,510
She likes getting deals done and she's a
very nice person.

886
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,540
It's not like she's some ruthless
monster who,

887
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,970
uh,
does sit at forsaking all things for

888
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:38,820
profit.
It's a,

889
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,750
but there's not a lot of women like
that.

890
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,430
It's not,
it's not that many.

891
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,740
So if you look at the great pool of
humans,

892
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,700
like how muCh of it is them being held
back or how much of it is them being

893
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,330
like really rare,
like so.

894
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,460
So few people like that.
If you get 100 women in the room is one

895
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:55,480
of them,
like my friend,

896
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:58,120
I don't know.
But the question always is why would

897
00:38:58,121 --> 00:38:59,800
there be so few women that are like
that?

898
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,150
There's no way,
by the way,

899
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:04,030
it's all an intellectual exercise
because there's no way that you could

900
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:08,620
strip away all the thousands of years of
programming and systemic societal

901
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:10,480
oppression to figure out,
oh,

902
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,740
if we're on it,
I always make.

903
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,980
I always think about like if I took 20,
20 kids,

904
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:19,300
I used to think about this in terms of
gender dysphoria and trans transgender

905
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,780
ideas.
Like if you were to take 50 kidS,

906
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,260
50 boys and 50 girls and go put them on
a colony on the moon where they were

907
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:28,720
raised by robots with no reference to
their gender.

908
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,100
What things would you find that were
true about the women back home that were

909
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,300
true of the women up there?

910
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,730
Like if you could somehow strip away
society altogether,

911
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,340
then what would be leftover?
What truly is male?

912
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:42,460
What truly is female?
And I think there's actually a,

913
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,850
there is an intersection between meat
eating and feminine and feminine and

914
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,570
systemic feminism,
which is really like human beings are

915
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,370
this weird concoction of like conscious
aware,

916
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,080
awake woke boys and girls and little
primate,

917
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,820
you know,
kill the alpha.

918
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,440
You know,
fuck the woman.

919
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,130
My monkeys,
and so we're trying to grapple with that

920
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:11,131
constantly like is it in inherent in the
notion that you should morally not eat

921
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:14,380
meat is the idea that you are morally
superior to an animal that can't discern

922
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,130
between the moral correctness of eating
meat and you know what I'm saying?

923
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,710
Like if you're just an animal and you're
just like any dog will eat anything you

924
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,690
put in front of it.
There's also,

925
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,030
there's an Intellectual argument,
right?

926
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,170
Like if you leave these animals loan to
their own devices,

927
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:31,000
what do they do?
Well,

928
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,900
they slaughter each other.
I mean that's what.

929
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,600
That's what they do.
This is what it is,

930
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,570
is a bunch of stuff that grows and
there's a bunch of dumb stuff that eats

931
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:40,900
the stuff that grows and then as much
stuff that eats the dumb stuff and

932
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:43,030
that's.
That's nature and that really is the

933
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:46,820
whole stuff that eats other mean stuff
is mean stuff that he's bigger mean

934
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:51,821
stuff and smaller mean stuff and then if
you step in and you take some of those

935
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,630
dumb things that are eating the grass,
you can feel better [inaudible] healthy.

936
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,240
Your body performs better and that's
just a fact.

937
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,160
I mean,
there's a lot of people that want to say

938
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,520
that meaning is bad for you.
It is absolutely not.

939
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,250
It's just not.
What's bad for you.

940
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,120
Sedentary lifestyle,
what's bad for you,

941
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:14,710
his sugar was bad for you is simple
carbohydrates and high quantities.

942
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,760
There's a lot of things that are bad for
your processed foods are bad for your

943
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:20,290
preservatives are very bad for you.
There's a lot of things,

944
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,240
carcinogens,
all those things are bad for you,

945
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,720
but just meat is protein and water.
I mean that's really what it is,

946
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,960
is a bunch of amino acids and there's a
lot of vitamins in it and as long as

947
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:32,950
you're not eating too much of anything,
it's been proven that there's a lot of

948
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,130
to eating

949
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,851
meat,
first of all,

950
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:37,400
be 12,
which really doesn't even exist in a

951
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:41,900
vegan diet unless you're taking in weird
algaes and or bugs.

952
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,570
Some people were willing to eat bugs.
Bugs are the future,

953
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,400
right?
We're all goiNg to be eating crickets,

954
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,190
but it's a weird thing.
The distinctions of life,

955
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,670
like we decide like for if you wanted to
eat something that's really simple and

956
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:53,750
stupid,
like if your,

957
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:58,751
if your issue is awareness or if you're,
your issue is whether it's something

958
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,550
sentient,
eat mollusks.

959
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,420
There are some of the dumbest fuckIng
thing on the planet dumber.

960
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,070
Even then plants,
like plants communicate with each other.

961
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:10,610
It's been proven.
Michael pollan had some amazing work

962
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,310
about it and not only that,
they have,

963
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,130
not only that,
it's been proven that the communicate

964
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:17,760
with each other,
but they also produce human

965
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,180
neurotransmitters.
They produce like serotonin,

966
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,060
like there's,
there's some arguments that they,

967
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:25,580
um,
they actually allocate resources to

968
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:28,730
support other plants in the community
and talking about those like root

969
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:29,660
systems or whatever.

970
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,670
Yeah.
They have a micrOrisal relationship with

971
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,250
different funguses.
Some trees where if you go into it,

972
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,930
there's a group of elves make them
cookies.

973
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,363
Yeah,
man,

974
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,880
that's responsible for a lot of forest
fires.

975
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,690
Right?
All those killing cookie up man.

976
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,880
But one of those elves actually made it
really far.

977
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:49,190
He's actually the attorney general of
our country.

978
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,380
What's happened,
jeff sessIons and now he was an

979
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,770
[inaudible] guy.
Yeah,

980
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,820
one was,
he was,

981
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:59,850
he was like a top or doping,
but the um,

982
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,770
I think plants talk.
I think it's interesting.

983
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,990
I think they communicate with each other
in a way that we don't understand.

984
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:07,790
And this is one of the reasons I read,
I think this,

985
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,900
they've done these studies where they
played the sound of caterpillars,

986
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,080
played the sound of caterpillars
munching on leaves next to an acacia

987
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:20,930
tree and it changed the way the tree
tastes.

988
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,090
Like when,
when you,

989
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,050
there's certain trees that when they,
they,

990
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,250
when an animal's chewing them,
the acacia bushes,

991
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,880
a famous one when an animal's chewing
them up wind.

992
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,880
So like something's chewing it and then
sent comes down wind to them,

993
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,120
they changed their flavor profile and
become a toxic tasting so that animals

994
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:42,890
will actually starve to death rather
than eat them.

995
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,560
Oh,
they changed so that the caterpillar

996
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:47,660
won't eat them to discourage predation.
Wow,

997
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,360
thAt's wild.
They do it based on sound,

998
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,200
like they'll do it based on the smell,
but also sound plants respond

999
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,060
defensively.
The sound of caterpillars eating their

1000
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:57,500
leaves.
So they produce these,

1001
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,010
these poisons.
So they,

1002
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,400
they taste like shit,
but so that no one eats them and it

1003
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,010
literally will cause they figured this
out from giraffes,

1004
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,860
but that's not evidence of sanctions.
Well,

1005
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,510
it's evidence of some sort of
communication because one,

1006
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,310
one plant way up there is communicating
with the other plants that are nowhere

1007
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:13,550
near.

1008
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,720
That's interesting.
So okay.

1009
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:18,860
So all of the trees and the network will
start tasting like shit just starts.

1010
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:20,750
Interesting.
There's some sort of a network.

1011
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,340
Again,
the michael pollan Book,

1012
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,040
I forget which book it was,
where he goes into depth about this,

1013
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,340
but um,
there's quite a few different,

1014
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,200
um,
scientific papers that have been done on

1015
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:36,201
plant intelligent intelligence and it's
a fairly new and emerging field and it's

1016
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,710
very disturbing field people that are
vegan because they like to pretend that,

1017
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,510
okay,
well we have,

1018
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,640
what we're doing is causing no harm.
that's not true.

1019
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,320
Okay.
Everyone causes harm.

1020
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,230
Life eats life.
And one of the weird things that people

1021
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,090
do where they have no problem eating
with their vegan.

1022
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,530
I'm just gonna eat vegetables.
Well,

1023
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:56,430
large scale agriculture is one of the
most devastating things that can happen

1024
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:59,070
to the ground that those plants are
planted on you.

1025
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,550
You complete,
like if you see a field and it's like a

1026
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,310
thousand acres of corn that is so not
normal.

1027
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,020
I mean that is just sO weird.
And even if it's totally organic,

1028
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,103
right?
Like you're,

1029
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,340
you're displacing all this wildlife to,
to do that.

1030
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:16,420
You're changing that environment
entirely.

1031
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,820
It's,
you're stripping nutrients from the

1032
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:20,850
soil.
are we like running toward a cliff?

1033
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,070
Yeah.
And the way to put the nutrients back is

1034
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,400
you're dead.
Things used fish are dead animals and

1035
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,770
that's how they get the nutrients back
in the store.

1036
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,920
There's a,
there was an interesting article article

1037
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:31,763
that uh,
um,

1038
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:36,980
I tweeted a about a year back that
everybody got so mad that it's actually

1039
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,200
impossible to be a vegetarian.
And thIs is by someone who is a vegan

1040
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,480
saying this.
What did they,

1041
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,910
what,
what,

1042
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,850
what are they saying?
You're not adjusting every animal,

1043
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,300
every plant like devours living things
in order to stay alive and your

1044
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,570
devouring the nutrients from those
living things like by eating these

1045
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:56,340
plants,
you're eating something.

1046
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,130
There it is.
It's actually impossible to be a

1047
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:03,140
vegetarians fascinating read because
it's written by a vegan and it's.

1048
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,190
It's.
It's a weird argument,

1049
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,930
but you realize,
oh,

1050
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,300
there's this connection that's
inexorable.

1051
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,790
Like it's not like these plants just
live only on water

1052
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,990
but isn't the.
I mean,

1053
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,120
here's the idea that brings us back to
this feminism idea and what structure on

1054
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,180
what is and isn't the idea that if you
are.

1055
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,910
If you believe that humanity has a
moral,

1056
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,500
it's encumbered upon humanity to be
morally forthright in a more,

1057
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,470
to be more than an animal,
then you have to reckon with what's the

1058
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:32,060
way that I can do the least harm in the
world.

1059
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,610
I'm not saying I do that.
I'm saying that is,

1060
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,120
that's the,
that's the moral and intellectual idea

1061
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,790
of like,
you know how to deal with systemic

1062
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,420
oppression,
how to deal with a low impact diet.

1063
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Like I think like there's no question
that you hunting elk is in the framework

1064
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,160
of if I'm god in the acceptibility
range,

1065
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,060
right?
[inaudible],

1066
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,060
but then factory farMing And you know,
worst Case scenario and worst case

1067
00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:00,680
scenario is this is the scenario.
Yeah.

1068
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,240
I Think what also would happen is these
societies that we enjoy these

1069
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,680
civilizations like New York city,
la,

1070
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,010
they got too big before we engineered
them before rather we engineered like

1071
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:19,820
I'm an engineer is the wrong word before
we really managed the resources that you

1072
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:25,891
need to allocate to in order to feed 20,
have 25 million people in the greater

1073
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:28,210
los angeles area.
That's about all that shit.

1074
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,343
Yeah.
It's a lot of,

1075
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,040
it's so

1076
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,540
much shit.
What do you do with the shit?

1077
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,910
Do you ever have a story of the ocean?
You ever hear the story about New York

1078
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:35,230
city's shit?
No.

1079
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,580
Where's it go?
Pretty fascinating.

1080
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,380
So they basically,
uh,

1081
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,060
it,
it all goes in the same place.

1082
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:41,110
I mean,
it all goes to plants,

1083
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,050
which is a treatment plan.
It's not,

1084
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:45,130
not,
not plants that feel and make themselves

1085
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:46,520
tastes bitter,
but treatment plans.

1086
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,680
Right?
So every,

1087
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,830
every shitty like,
you know,

1088
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,290
lower eastside hipster and chinatown,
chinese person and like upper east side,

1089
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,490
you know,
do it all.

1090
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,850
There's little squiggly shits.
I'll go into electric plants where they

1091
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:01,780
treat it and then their leftover with
this pile of fucking big old New York

1092
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:02,830
city shit.
And they're like,

1093
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:06,640
what do we do with the shit?
They don't have a farm lands nearby.

1094
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,290
And so they basically,
because a lot of it goes to fertilizer,

1095
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:11,080
so they started trying to take it out on
the,

1096
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,900
on the free market you can sell shit on
the free market.

1097
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,710
Oh my god.
Is that real?

1098
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:18,970
Yeah.
You sell it to farms.

1099
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,030
And the funny part is that all these
like Kansas and Indiana and like real

1100
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,830
down home corn,
husky type of lasers,

1101
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,570
we're like,
we're good.

1102
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,660
We don't want that big city city slicker
shit to our community.

1103
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,070
Oh my god.
Basically the stigma of New York,

1104
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:42,160
yankee ness was too big for them to
accept the shit.

1105
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,110
Wow.
Not even for free.

1106
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,370
Yeah.
They wouldn't take the,

1107
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,200
take it for free and if they buy cow
shit,

1108
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,950
but isn't cow shit way better because
it's all grass will cow shit.

1109
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,930
I don't know.
I don't know if it's better.

1110
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,310
I'm not,
I'm not a shit expert.

1111
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,090
I just dabble in shit.
No,

1112
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,060
I dabble in shit,
you know,

1113
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:01,750
so much.
I mean I smelled like it and I think

1114
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:03,590
about it a lot.
But other than that I talk a lot of it.

1115
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,650
That's right.
wow,

1116
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,660
that's crazy though.
When you think about like how much shit

1117
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,550
it has to go somewhere and all the
garbage when you order stuff.

1118
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,070
We,
I was getting ready for uh,

1119
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,280
for burning man this year and I went to
target to buy pillows and I bought

1120
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:26,740
pillows,
brand new pillows for $4 and I was just

1121
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:27,521
like,
this is great.

1122
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:30,210
And tossed the pillow fresh pillows and
then uh,

1123
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,570
my wife was like,
the fact that there are $4 pillows is

1124
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,070
systemically connected to societies
collapse on some level.

1125
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:44,071
Like there's no way to make a $4 pillow
and not have the earth like suffering at

1126
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:47,500
some point.
Just how do you do that and all the

1127
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,590
garbage and I can go to burning man and
sleep on it for a week and be like,

1128
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,690
this is dusty.
Toss it into a landfill.

1129
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,200
Where is this stuff going?
Isn't the argument that target pLaces

1130
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,570
like tarGet and walmart especially are
subsidized?

1131
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,040
oh yeah,
for sure.

1132
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,630
Yeah,
they definitely are,

1133
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,940
but in one way,
shape or form,

1134
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:06,970
right?
To welfare or through food stamps or

1135
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,130
through actually not welfare.
Right?

1136
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,030
They have to certain wage to.
You mean to.

1137
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,970
Yeah.
In order to support like w how much you

1138
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:19,320
have to qualify for welfare.
Oh,

1139
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,910
I think you.
I grew up on welfare.

1140
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:25,210
Actually need to know.
Did you really do you like that about

1141
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:27,970
yourself?
I find a great of pride in this.

1142
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,210
Said it.
I just blurted it out.

1143
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:29,811
They're like,
yeah,

1144
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:30,644
me too,
bro.

1145
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,480
I do feel like connective.
I get almost nothing makes me more angry

1146
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,390
than a person Who's never interacted
with real poor people.

1147
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:41,150
Talking about the lazy people on
welfare.

1148
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,133
Right.
Well,

1149
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,520
I was very fortunate that my mom,
although we were on welfare,

1150
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,660
she worked too and got to a point where
she didn't have to be on welfare anymore

1151
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:52,100
and then she got off.
Same with me.

1152
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,320
So it made me realize like,
oh,

1153
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,450
like this,
this actually can work,

1154
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,470
can help,
same here,

1155
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,180
that are super poor.
We had food stamps,

1156
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,040
the whole deal and my thing has always
been,

1157
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,120
when it comes to welfare,
look,

1158
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:07,121
wouldn't you rather allow a person to
take advantage of the system so that

1159
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,620
some percentage of those people can
write,

1160
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,280
can raise through the ranks and get off
of welfare and,

1161
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,910
and better themselves and better their
lives.

1162
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,280
Wouldn't you rather have that system in
place?

1163
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,690
Then the system that says,
sorry,

1164
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,660
we're worried about people taking
advantage of the systeM so everybody

1165
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,760
including the good people can go fuck
themselves.

1166
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,090
Which society do you want to live in?
Yes.

1167
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,260
There's certainly the former.
And you know,

1168
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,470
I think with,
uh,

1169
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,880
with my mom's situation,
it was also important to send the

1170
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:35,870
messaGe that it gives a woman an option
to get away from an abusive man.

1171
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,610
Yeah.
My mom left,

1172
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:41,690
my dad and My stepdad didn't have any
money and they weren't married at the

1173
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:43,100
time.
They were boyfriend and girlfriend and

1174
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,100
he was a student and they,
you know,

1175
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,880
we got on welfare and we ate,
you know,

1176
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,650
we drink powdered milk and the whole
deal,

1177
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,280
but it's very similar situation.
Very similar.

1178
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,840
My mom left my dad when I was one and
came out here.

1179
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,260
She's a disabled wOman.
It's like everything was stacked against

1180
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,970
her and uh,
you know,

1181
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,720
so we were raised on food stamps and
welfare jews on welfare.

1182
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:04,060
Very rare.
Very rare.

1183
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,983
It's,
it,

1184
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:05,801
it,
it,

1185
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:09,530
it definitely.
If you have a society that's a caring

1186
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:10,970
society,
it's,

1187
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,150
it certainly serves its function.
What people are worried about is the

1188
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:16,460
same thing you're worried about when
they're talking about free housing.

1189
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,860
I was just gonna say we can bring it all
the way back.

1190
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,720
Yeah.
You're worried about people that come

1191
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,820
along that juke the system that don't
want to work,

1192
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,140
that are lazy.
who cares?

1193
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,101
Yeah.
Let them.

1194
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,300
Duke wouldn't you?
I mean,

1195
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,670
I just,
I would rather help people that need the

1196
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:33,671
help and allow someone to juke the
system than I would live in a stark

1197
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,380
society that says,
I'm sorry we don't help people here

1198
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:39,680
because we're worried that somebody
might steal 100 percent and you know,

1199
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:43,760
there's a real issue that's coming up
right now with artificial intelligence

1200
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:47,780
and automation that's gonna remove
millions and millions of jobs just by

1201
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:49,550
virtue of automated cars are done.

1202
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,690
And so people were talking very
seriously about universal basic income

1203
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,780
is either inevitable.
There are two inevitabilities,

1204
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,310
either universal basic income will come
and take the place of the income that

1205
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,920
was stripped away,
not because anybody did anything wrong,

1206
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:08,921
but because they did everything right
and the eventual automated reality is

1207
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:12,020
that there aren't jobs from people.
There's job for you and me,

1208
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,920
but there's not a job for a skilled
journeymen worker because there's a

1209
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:18,260
fucking machine that can work 24 hours a
truck driver.

1210
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,540
Oh yeah.
A truck drivers are there first.

1211
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,300
They're the shock troops.
That's why this whole thing with trump

1212
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,560
saving coal jobs,
it's like,

1213
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,190
I hate to say it,
but like coal jobs

1214
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,220
don't matter,
you know,

1215
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,410
and in the long,
and I know it's like,

1216
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,420
it's like this hollywood,
like comedian juggler look cool jobs

1217
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:35,880
don't matter and I know if you're a coal
miner listening to this,

1218
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,250
the coal job matters to you more than
anything else,

1219
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,840
right?
You know how Few coal jobs are.

1220
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,220
It's very few,
very few.

1221
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:46,250
There's like $75,000 overall coal jobs
and there's some insane like new energy,

1222
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:49,380
like there's a half a million new energy
jobs just in California alone.

1223
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,540
Exactly.
Yeah.

1224
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,710
And so everybody kind of made those
numbers up,

1225
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,050
but it's big and everybody paid.
Everybody focuses on the human being.

1226
00:53:58,051 --> 00:53:59,430
Does every,
they focus on the,

1227
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,530
on the day to day,
they focus on the sun going up and down.

1228
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,510
They don't focus on the year going by,
right?

1229
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,010
It's like you go,
oh,

1230
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:07,230
but my job is gone.
I want my job back.

1231
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,380
But it's like your job doesn't matter.
Yeah.

1232
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,700
entire coal industry employs fewer
people.

1233
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:14,550
That arby's,
holy shit.

1234
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,350
Imagine if he was talking about arby's
though,

1235
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:21,210
but I think what he's doing is sort of
like this giant pro business push

1236
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:22,770
transparent.
It's so transparent.

1237
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,090
It's,
it's obvious.

1238
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:28,260
It's just about Making a lot of people
that he knows money and allowing a bunch

1239
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:32,790
of people that have lost money that have
probably in some way or shape or form

1240
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,380
contributed to him.
Yeah.

1241
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,840
And also he's not an idiot.
I mean it might be,

1242
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,180
but he also won the election by about
the amount of people that work for me.

1243
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:44,550
It's
definitely not an idiot.

1244
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,470
She's probably got some kind of high iq
that is overshadowed by a severe

1245
00:54:49,471 --> 00:54:50,950
personality disorder.
Yeah.

1246
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,190
And what do you think that is?
Like narcissistic.

1247
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,480
Yeah.
I just think he's.

1248
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,850
There's something wrong with him.
No doubt about that.

1249
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,390
For sure.
There's something wrong with them.

1250
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,470
Don't you think that in order for
someone to put their name up on

1251
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,960
everything like that.
Like I was in New York this past weekend

1252
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,020
and we drove by this like trump
research,

1253
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:11,770
a rehabilitation center,
trump rehabilitation center.

1254
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,130
It was like this real shitty old
building.

1255
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:15,120
Yeah.
What they do is they put a,

1256
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:17,630
they put a,
a crack rock in front of you and it,

1257
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,900
and they say,
which one do you want to grab?

1258
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,560
Just keep diverting you do the pussy.
And then further down the line it was

1259
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:29,580
trump links were driving on this road
and it said trump links golf course.

1260
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,330
So it was golf.
I know about the trunks.

1261
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,500
Trump steaks,
steaks.

1262
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,160
Like,
oh,

1263
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,140
have you never seen this commercial?
It's really funny.

1264
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,180
The trumps state commercial is like,
oh,

1265
00:55:39,181 --> 00:55:41,210
you just gotta you gotta love it.
It's so beautiful.

1266
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,053
Really.
You can you.

1267
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,990
Can you play video on here?
uh,

1268
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,420
is it illegal or something?
I think we'll put it for us.

1269
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,850
Yeah,
we'll play the volume that whenever we

1270
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:52,590
play a video,
the real issue with us,

1271
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,750
it seems to be,
um,

1272
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:58,350
animal attack videos because those get
so many hits that somebody owns them and

1273
00:55:58,351 --> 00:56:00,710
claims them.
And then you get pulled off of facebook.

1274
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:02,550
I got off of youtube,
we get flagged.

1275
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,140
Trump steaks is like hilarious.

1276
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,650
I mean,
look,

1277
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,110
trump's not a fool.
Trump is a,

1278
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,333
well,
he is a fool,

1279
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,430
but he's not stupid.
And the trump steaks,

1280
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:13,890
the world's greatest days.
Give me some volume young jamie.

1281
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,930
When it comes to great steak,
it just raised the stakes at the sharper

1282
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:23,980
image is one of my favorite stores with
fantastic products of all kinds.

1283
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,040
That's why I'm thrilled they agree with
me.

1284
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,650
Trump steaks of the world's greatest
stakes,

1285
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:32,140
and I mean that in every sense of the
word.

1286
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,280
And the sharper image is the only store
where you can buy them.

1287
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:41,410
My are by far the best tasting,
most flavorful beef you've ever had,

1288
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,620
truly in a league of their own trump
steaks or fivestar gourmet quality that

1289
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:51,100
belong in a very,
very select category of restaurant and

1290
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:56,101
our certified angus beef prime.
There's nothing better than that of all

1291
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:58,150
of the beef produced in America.

1292
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,840
Less than one percent qualifies for that
category.

1293
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,910
It's the best of the best until now.
You can only enjoy steaks of this

1294
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:11,650
quality in one of my resort restaurants
where america's finest steakhouses,

1295
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,910
but now that's changed today through the
shop image.

1296
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:20,920
You cAn enjoy the world's greatest
stakes in your own home with family,

1297
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:24,190
friends,
anytime trump steaks or rage to

1298
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,130
perfection.
Provide the ultimate and tenderness and

1299
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,130
flavor.
He

1300
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,820
absolutely loved trump steaks.
Treat yourself to the very,

1301
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:37,090
very best life has to offer and as a
gift,

1302
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,300
trump steaks are the best you can give
one bite and you'll know exactly what

1303
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:45,970
I'm talking about and believe me,
I understand steaks.

1304
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:51,430
My favorite food and these are the best
because it was kind of endearing when

1305
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,870
she was just a businessman.
So call that wacky businessman guy.

1306
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:57,610
Here he is.
It's the trump guy.

1307
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,700
It's like there's a guy in India,
they used to dress all in cold.

1308
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,030
I know the guy you're talking about.
It's kind of something funny about it.

1309
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,890
He's a character.
What's the trump guy?

1310
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,660
Puts his name on everything and but then
he become president in that.

1311
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,780
What made you kind of cute?
Is it terrifying with?

1312
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,740
Yeah,
I mean that's the president state guys

1313
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:20,350
talking about sticks in the exact same
way that he's talking about governmental

1314
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:21,250
policy.
how the fuck,

1315
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,790
the sharper image they sell back
massagers oh,

1316
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,450
they sell them the best steaks in the
world.

1317
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:26,210
If there's no place,

1318
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,970
I would rather get my meat and then the
sharper image I go to brookstone or

1319
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:30,710
sharper image.

1320
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,960
That's my butcher donnelly that whoever
wrote that,

1321
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:37,970
like that's in need of a second draft,
so is a terrible why it's so good.

1322
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,210
I would eat.
I would push back and say,

1323
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:43,550
donald trump's not a big second draft
guy.

1324
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,090
He's just like,
uh,

1325
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,200
I'm going to say I'm really good and
know a lot about it and let's do this.

1326
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,720
He's right up there with l ron hubbard.
When it comes to second drafts,

1327
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,673
did you

1328
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,330
you watch the choice on frontline during
the election?

1329
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,570
No.
It was this amazing documentary about

1330
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:02,250
hillary clinton and Donald Trump and it
shows you exactly who they are and why

1331
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,480
they are the way that they are.
Hillary clinton,

1332
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:08,740
who cares at this point,
but trump is so interesting.

1333
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,950
Like basically he was raised with a
father that was extremely harsh,

1334
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,040
not loving it all,
and he found this father figure,

1335
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:18,880
this guy ray cohn,
who was this like an extremely

1336
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:22,010
aggressive lawyer in new,
who was

1337
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,220
a big in the mccarthy erA.
He was a prosecutor in the mccarthy

1338
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,270
communism trials and cones.
Whole strategy and philosophy was when

1339
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:32,900
someone hits you,
you hit them back on a level that's so

1340
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:37,520
disproportionately out of control that
they forget about the thing that you are

1341
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,950
even talking about.
so the example of,

1342
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,630
uh,
how he got sued for racial

1343
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:43,910
discrimination is getting sued for
racial discrimination.

1344
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:45,140
That's a bad thing.
Remember that.

1345
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:50,600
And he sued the people that Were suing
him for $25,000,000 in 1970.

1346
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,020
So it's like now the story is,
oh,

1347
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,590
a $25,000,000 suit,
donald trump's suing some poor kid for

1348
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:01,130
$25 million.
No one's talking about the original

1349
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,080
thing anymore.
They're only looking at this flashy,

1350
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:07,250
insane pt barnum level lawsuit.
The racial discrimination thing was in

1351
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:08,240
regards to housing,
right?

1352
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,340
Yeah.
That basIcally there was a,

1353
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:15,580
they were setting up the systems where
black people and latinos wouldn't get,

1354
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,200
wouldn't be allowed into trump housing
through like weird coded language or

1355
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,034
something like that.

1356
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,770
Well,
he's definitely a very litigious guy.

1357
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,240
Oh yeah.
which is fascinating that this woman who

1358
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:30,980
is suing him for sexual harassing or
groping or what is she?

1359
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,380
What is exact?
It's a gloria allred thing.

1360
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,330
Oh,
I don't know the suit that you're

1361
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,100
talking about,
are they still going?

1362
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,000
No,
this is the thing.

1363
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,220
He just claimed immunity because he's
the president.

1364
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,500
Like this woman was suing him before she
was one of the ones that sued him once

1365
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,570
he became president or once he was
running,

1366
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,500
she came out like one of the last few to
came out and gloria allred was behind

1367
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:52,450
her and everybody was,
oh,

1368
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,340
see this coming,
let's gloria allred's in your corner.

1369
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:56,031
You're like,
oh,

1370
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,890
I See what's going on here.
So I'm just trying to get paid.

1371
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,410
But okay.
Someone's trying to get paid jump claims

1372
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:03,560
immunity from apprentice contestants
lawsuit that somebody's trying to get

1373
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:03,800
paid.

1374
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,380
That's a fair.
I could see that argument.

1375
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:09,230
The other argument would be he's about
to become the president,

1376
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:12,890
so a person who he's violated who was
willing to let it go when he was just

1377
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:15,740
some weird guy selling steaks for the
sharper image is now like,

1378
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,950
I'm not gonna let this monster become
the president.

1379
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,390
Well,
you could look at it that way.

1380
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,150
Um,
but what is,

1381
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:24,360
what did he do?
Like he did,

1382
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,380
but her claim that she's been pretty
open about our clamp.

1383
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,330
He made a passenger.
Yeah.

1384
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,440
that's really it.
YeAh.

1385
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,400
So it's not,
it's not really like what it can

1386
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,320
constitutes.
It's not,

1387
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,300
you're not talking about something
monstrous.

1388
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,290
No,
I'm not talking about it.

1389
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,810
But in this case,
the gloria allred thing,

1390
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:42,910
like,
um,

1391
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:46,050
you know,
gloria read like I was a woman and uh,

1392
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,800
something was going down like that where
I wanted to get paid.

1393
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,170
That's who I'd go to.
Like that's her thing.

1394
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,550
She,
there was some,

1395
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,710
some article written about how many
cases of hers actually go to trial and

1396
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:00,560
how many get settled and it's just,
she's a settlement person.

1397
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:03,130
You ever been sued now you,
yeah.

1398
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,460
Clothes.
What about,

1399
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:08,040
uh,
a lIne in my book and uh,

1400
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:13,590
and it is,
you realize immediately that it was a

1401
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:16,130
stupid line and one that if I had,
had,

1402
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,590
had hindsight,
I just never would have put it in and

1403
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:23,591
the person right to be upset and uh,
but then you realize very quickly that

1404
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,260
this is poker,
we're just playing poker,

1405
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:32,490
like it costs so much money for you to
go to trial and defend yourself if you,

1406
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:34,020
even if you felt like you did nothing
wrong,

1407
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,940
which in this cAse,
you know,

1408
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,950
I probably wouldn't have even made that
claim.

1409
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,990
I mean,
the thing about writing a memoir is it's

1410
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,560
all like these wisps of memory,
you know,

1411
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,480
and you're just like grabbing stuff and
throwing it in and like you have to.

1412
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,760
It's almost like you have to write the
first one in order to realize like,

1413
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,320
oh,
here are the responsible ways to do

1414
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,480
this.
You can't just like grab memories

1415
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,420
thinking that all of your memories
belong to you because other people are

1416
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:55,380
in them.
You know what I'm saying?

1417
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,790
So anyway,
basically it's like if you could defend

1418
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,860
yourself,
maybe you have a defense will cost you

1419
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:06,240
$200,000 or you could settle.
That's what I no longer buy this idea

1420
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,940
that like if you settled,
that's an implication of guilt.

1421
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:10,200
That's,
that's coMplete bullshit.

1422
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:14,580
Anybody thAt's been sued is realizing
the reality that like you could fight

1423
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:17,780
for your honor and it'll cost you double
the amount for you to just say here's

1424
01:03:17,781 --> 01:03:19,750
some money,
but I know a bunch of people that have

1425
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:23,130
been sued and settled when they were
absolutely 100 percent innocent and they

1426
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,800
actually passed a rule at the ufc.

1427
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,100
Were you not allowed to take pictures
choking people because of it?

1428
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,590
Because people would ask,
okay,

1429
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,330
chuck liddell come choke me.
Take a picture.

1430
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:36,780
You put me in a rear naked choke hold.
Both chocolate dell and matt hugheS were

1431
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:39,420
sued.
Chocolate dell wound up settling and he

1432
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:42,300
absolutely didn't do anything wrong,
but this guy had a picture of him

1433
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:43,710
getting choked and he says,
look,

1434
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,210
this guy hurt me.
He'S a killer.

1435
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,920
You hurt me.
Here's the picture.

1436
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,870
Oh,
pretty cut and dry here.

1437
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,790
And the other one was mad.
He was the same thing.

1438
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,610
This guy wanted matt.
He was choking him so mad he was choked

1439
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:57,720
him and this guy wound up suing them.
Then they do an investigation on the guy

1440
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,660
and like they go into it and they find
out that this guy is a corrupt cop.

1441
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:04,320
So the guy winds up going to jail for
being a corrupt cop.

1442
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,110
Hilarious.
He started this whole cascade that

1443
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:08,910
eventually wound up with him being in
jail.

1444
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,930
Yeah,
I mean people are.

1445
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,020
LiTigiousness is,
is,

1446
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,280
is a monster of our age.
But it works.

1447
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:15,330
Yeah,
it works really well.

1448
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,850
I mean a company that I'm part of,
I got sued recently,

1449
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:20,640
some weird funky patent lawsuit and
like,

1450
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,750
oh,
what do we do here?

1451
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,310
And it was one of those things where
you,

1452
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,860
if you settle you,
you get this amount,

1453
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,200
you know,
you give them this amount.

1454
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,390
If you go to trial,
it's going to cost you in legal fees

1455
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:33,870
three times that even if you win,
what's chocolate l supposed to do it.

1456
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:34,921
Okay.
Chuck,

1457
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:37,110
you could,
you could defend yourself and maybe when

1458
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,590
you could spend $250,000 and maybe when
even though you're right,

1459
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,670
or you could write this check for
$20,000 and never think about it again.

1460
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,380
It's like I get that.

1461
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,340
What's weird about trump being so
litigious is that the republicans were

1462
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:52,620
the ones that made it almost impossible
to sue people.

1463
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,680
That's their whole thing.
Do you saw that hot coffee documentary?

1464
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:56,910
Yes.
So fucking good.

1465
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:59,490
Right?
And that was a republican talking point.

1466
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:00,930
It's like we have to start with tort
reform,

1467
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,750
tort reform,
and then all of a sudden there were all

1468
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:04,650
these like,
you know,

1469
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,680
meaningless and frivolous lawsuits.
That's a bIg talking point in the glp

1470
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:11,220
and all of a sudden now trump is like
the most suing this mother fucker that's

1471
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,840
ever,
ever touched anything.

1472
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,470
Would you hear him talk about it during
the,

1473
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,290
during the,
uh,

1474
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,340
run for president?
He was talking about

1475
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,250
people writing things about you that
aren't true,

1476
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,430
and we're going to change the laws.
We're going to change the law so we can

1477
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,130
go after those people.
it's harvey firestone or trump.

1478
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,340
They're doing right now.
Uh,

1479
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,460
that was trump.
no,

1480
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:32,390
I was not good now.
Hover fire thing that maybe that was too

1481
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,910
deep of a cut.
I was trying to.

1482
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,340
I don't know.
Nobody wanted that would be more like,

1483
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,580
here you go.
I just don't know.

1484
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:44,581
A good trump says I can't make that
speaks to your spirit.

1485
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,210
Does it?
That you can't find that.

1486
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:48,020
Do Mike Tyson?
You're good at tyson.

1487
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,240
I don't do it.
I'm pretty good.

1488
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,590
Oh,
that's difficult.

1489
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,110
I got,
I got stephen hawking and I got the

1490
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:54,880
movie phone guy.
Those are the two.

1491
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,380
That's it.
That's how I got.

1492
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,530
Welcome to a movie phone.
People don't even know what movie phone

1493
01:05:59,531 --> 01:05:59,910
isn't you?

1494
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:00,980
I know.
There's no point that.

1495
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,860
Yeah.
What about one of my impressions is

1496
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:04,690
defunct.
Goes up.

1497
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,720
Hello and welcome to movie phone brought
to you by one.

1498
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:08,411
Oh,
six point one.

1499
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:11,280
and kmel jams.
If you know the name of the movie you'd

1500
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:13,180
like to see.
Press one now.

1501
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,650
Yeah.
They used to be the thing.

1502
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:18,070
That's where the movies are played and
what the times were.

1503
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,200
Phones used to be so connected to the
Internet.

1504
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:22,150
You ever studied hacking?
You know,

1505
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,490
it's like all of the original hackers
like these,

1506
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:26,540
like really like phone.
Yeah,

1507
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,430
the phone freaks do what they were doing
was like not even interesting anyMore.

1508
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,380
Like captain crunch,
you know about that guy.

1509
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:35,710
He's an interesting dude.
I knew that dude really when I was a

1510
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:37,580
little boy explain who he is.
Oh,

1511
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,600
so captain crunch is one of the first
phone freak hackers and the thing that

1512
01:06:40,601 --> 01:06:44,030
he did is he found a whistle and a
captain crunch box and he found that it

1513
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,780
had the tonality that if you play it
into the phone,

1514
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,760
like whatever the tones that the phone
was hearing were similar to the dial

1515
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,120
tones that would connect people to long
distance so he could get free long

1516
01:06:55,121 --> 01:06:55,690
distance.

1517
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,230
Now kids,
this is when long distance cost money.

1518
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:01,420
So he was one of the first dudes that
was doing that.

1519
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:06,421
He's a legend.
So I met him when I was a big raver when

1520
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,960
I was a kid.
I was Like big time.

1521
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:12,970
Like I spent most of my teenage years in
san francisco raves and so I started

1522
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:17,790
going to have 16 and captain crunch was
like 70 and he was at every rave,

1523
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,190
I mean every single rave.
And he was 70.

1524
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,640
He was old and it was funny because.
And he was just doing ecstasy and

1525
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,820
partying big time.
No teeth in front of the speakers,

1526
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,310
like speaker freak like you now.
He was a phone freak,

1527
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:33,370
then it became a speaker free.
So he's blown his ears out,

1528
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,280
just like sitting there full of fear,
like no teeth,

1529
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,650
little shorts.
And I was like 16.

1530
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,240
And who he is,
there he is.

1531
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:42,910
Yeah,
he said to me,

1532
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:43,930
uh,
it looks very good.

1533
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,310
Guy does a lot of ecstasy.
oh yeah,

1534
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,620
he's done it all.
So that dude was like,

1535
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:50,020
do you want to,
do you need a job to me because I was a

1536
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:52,190
cute young young boy.
You want to fuck anything?

1537
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,880
I don't know if you wanted to fuck me.
I've been sued before so I have no

1538
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:56,650
opinion on that.
But I do know that.

1539
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:58,620
He said,
I do know that he.

1540
01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,501
I was like,
hell yeah,

1541
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:00,370
I want a job,
and he's like,

1542
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:02,680
great.
It starts with a body work session that

1543
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:04,690
my house in mill valley and I was like,
eh,

1544
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:06,550
I'm good.
I'm good crunch.

1545
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,160
Who has to deliver the bodywork?
He's the guy.

1546
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,850
I mean,
basically it starts with a body work

1547
01:08:12,851 --> 01:08:14,470
session.
You ever had a job like that?

1548
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,340
You meet a metal rake.
Jobs.

1549
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,140
There are 70 year old man.
You made it a rave.

1550
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:20,980
They do a bodywork.
No,

1551
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,200
that's legit.
What are you going on about how weird?

1552
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,990
That was a hard pass.
Hard pass.

1553
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,780
How many people said yes to that?
I guess that's one of those pitches,

1554
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:30,620
you know?
Yeah,

1555
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:33,470
we'll try it enough time.
Throw it at 100 people and every now and

1556
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:35,020
then it's like,

1557
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,680
oh,
I'm sure he's thinking a baseball

1558
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,270
metaphor.
Yeah.

1559
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:43,790
I wonder.
That's how weird fucking choice.

1560
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,040
I was very interesting to me.
Thank god.

1561
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,440
I was like aware enough that it was very
transparent.

1562
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,520
Maybe if he'd,
you know,

1563
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:51,320
when you're young,
sometimes things that are very

1564
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:53,270
transparent or not transparent at all
you like,

1565
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,740
oh,
okay.

1566
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,420
I guess I'll do that.
no,

1567
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:02,420
I almost got a.
When I was maybe seven or eight,

1568
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:05,210
probably eight.
I almost got scooped up by a child

1569
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:08,240
molester because of that.
I almost did to what happened with you

1570
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,550
don't want to hear yours.
I was in a library.

1571
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:13,280
I used to like a monster books.
I was really into monsters,

1572
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:15,570
like dracula,
guys like,

1573
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,100
hey kid,
you like monster.

1574
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,870
Why was
he,

1575
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:22,670
um,
I was looking through this section,

1576
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:26,120
this horror section of this library.
And um,

1577
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,420
this guy came up to me and he said to
you,

1578
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,140
you do you like books about monsters?
Just said,

1579
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:30,974
yeah,
yeah.

1580
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,720
He goes,
I've got some really good ones in my

1581
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:33,650
car.
Do you want to see them?

1582
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,693
And I was like,
okay.

1583
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,830
I was like eight.
I was a total latchkey kid.

1584
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:38,750
My parents just opened the door just
out.

1585
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,570
Why went?
They worked when you get home from

1586
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:46,571
school and you basically were at the
mercy of society and I lived in san

1587
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:48,950
francisco.
So it's like from,

1588
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:52,460
I was born in New Jersey and we moved to
san francisco when I was seven.

1589
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:54,260
Serious thing.
We have a lot of parallels.

1590
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:56,300
interesting.
I'm from oakland,

1591
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,090
you know that.
Yeah,

1592
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:57,923
yeah,
yeah,

1593
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:58,810
yeah.

1594
01:09:58,810 --> 01:09:59,301
I.
Same thing.

1595
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:01,580
I was in a parking lot,
accident my car in the car and my

1596
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:05,720
grandma went in to go shopping with my
brother and this dude came to the window

1597
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,220
and was like,
do you want to come with me?

1598
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:10,040
I'll give you a bicycle and thank god
I'm jewish.

1599
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,420
Because I was like,
okay,

1600
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:13,490
I'll take the bicycle,
but I don't actually ride a bike.

1601
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,100
I need training wheels.
And actually my brother needs a bike

1602
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:16,850
too.
He liked,

1603
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,800
I swear to god.
I started negotiating with the guy.

1604
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,340
I was like trying to get more bicycle
for my box.

1605
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,590
And then by the time I was done talking
to the guy,

1606
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:27,590
my grandma came out and was like,
chased the guy away.

1607
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,020
So if it wasn't for these negotiation
skills,

1608
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,790
that's amazing.
I'd be in a sex dungeon.

1609
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:31,990
Right?

1610
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,040
No,
you were annoying.

1611
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,590
You had the guy away from me.
Now that's hilarious.

1612
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:36,970
even a child molester,
he was like,

1613
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,230
I,
I,

1614
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,820
you know what,
forget it.

1615
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,020
Yeah,
you can keep it.

1616
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:45,430
I was on my way out the door with this
guy and the lady who worked the counter

1617
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,720
at the library or the librarian screamed
at joseph,

1618
01:10:49,721 --> 01:10:52,870
you get away from that man.
He just got out of jail.

1619
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:57,930
Jesus and the guy ran.
He ran and I started crying and just

1620
01:10:58,181 --> 01:11:01,240
crying and crying.
The joe rogan experience could have been

1621
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:05,460
so different.
I mean,

1622
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:08,440
the Guy just got out of jail.
He probably did want to go back to jail

1623
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:10,980
again.
Do those little things,

1624
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:14,820
minutes and seconds between you and the
most dastardly thing.

1625
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,770
I mean,
not only that,

1626
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,190
this is 1970,
whatever.

1627
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:19,350
It was like,
good luck catching that guy like,

1628
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,420
yeah.
Have you ever almost died?

1629
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,810
I don't think so.
What's the most dangerous thing you've

1630
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:25,561
ever done?
Oh,

1631
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:26,940
jesus.
I don't know.

1632
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:32,160
Fight the fight and die and a drive safe
or drive unsafe.

1633
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:36,000
Yeah.
I remember I was a kid and we were

1634
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:36,750
always like,
look,

1635
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:41,470
exploring places to go smoke weed.
That was like when you're young,

1636
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,900
I,
and maybe it's different now,

1637
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:44,860
now that weed's legal,
but when you're young and we,

1638
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,740
it was illegal,
it was like you always were like looking

1639
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:48,850
for these cubbies,
just smoke weed.

1640
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:51,330
And so you'll appreciate this as a bay
area guy.

1641
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:52,410
The,
uh,

1642
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:57,410
somebody found this a chain link area
that you could get over and get onto

1643
01:11:58,201 --> 01:11:58,790
the,
uh,

1644
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:01,140
the bart tracks where you would go.

1645
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,960
I've been in the bar tracks before
because I was a graffiti writer when I

1646
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,520
was a kid and so we would sneak down
there,

1647
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:10,521
but this was like a very narrow liquid,
just a foot long walkway and we end.

1648
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:15,600
Somebody said that there was like a room
inside of the tunnel that was between

1649
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:18,660
oakland and contra costa county,
that there was this little,

1650
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,850
I don't know how they knew that,
but like a little anti chamber.

1651
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:22,770
We were always like looking for anti
chambers to like,

1652
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,720
there was another one that was like a
sewer tunnel in oakland in rockridge

1653
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,260
that I could show somebody where it is
right now,

1654
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:32,220
but it's basically you go down and we
would bring flashlights and hairspray

1655
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:35,520
and lighter so that we could like torch
spiders if we saw there was a little

1656
01:12:35,521 --> 01:12:38,000
anti chamber there too and there was an
anti chamber,

1657
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,320
like a little know a room inside of a
tunnel,

1658
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:41,210
like a,
like a.

1659
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,750
I don't know what,
why it was there,

1660
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,330
but there was like this little sewer
room in there that this guy fro hawk

1661
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:48,900
lived in and there was,
he was like a black punk rocker.

1662
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,220
He lived there.
He did.

1663
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,560
He had,
he lived on the lawn on a lawn of like a

1664
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,090
pool folding chair down there.
He slept.

1665
01:12:57,091 --> 01:12:59,160
I slept there one night actually.
But anyway,

1666
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,410
so we were always just,
you not relate to that,

1667
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,760
like you're always like looking at you
and your friends,

1668
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:07,140
like looking for a weird place to do ill
explore.

1669
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,820
Yeah,
exactly what to do that kinship.

1670
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,940
Yeah.
So we were in there and I was like,

1671
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,600
I was kind of chubby when I was a kid,
so they made me go with the back.

1672
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:17,400
It was like a one person,
you know,

1673
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,860
walkway to get to the room in the middle
of the tunnel,

1674
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:22,830
not the sewer tunnel,
but now the bart train tunnel and we're

1675
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:25,140
on this little one foot walkway.

1676
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:29,600
And um,
I was aT the back of the line and we're

1677
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:33,870
walking towards the room and of course
we will get into the tunnel and we could

1678
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:38,871
feel all of a sudden like the air got
hot and sucked out of the tunnel and it

1679
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:39,870
was like,
oh.

1680
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,170
And you could hear that level of like
bbb,

1681
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,720
bbb beep and the train was coming and it
was like,

1682
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,200
it was so close to us.
I can't,

1683
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,390
my memory,
I don't know if my memory is accurate,

1684
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:52,880
but my memory is that it was like,
I mean,

1685
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:56,350
this as close as this mic is to me,
just like food,

1686
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,190
food.
And we were all like up against the

1687
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:01,620
wall.
And then the funny part was that we all

1688
01:14:01,621 --> 01:14:06,070
stopped and then the train stopped.
I remember they pulled the,

1689
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,700
like the train stopped in the tunnel and
they must have maybe they saw us or

1690
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:11,930
something and somehow it stopped.
I

1691
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,290
don't know,
maybe that's not an accurate memory,

1692
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,350
but I feel like yes,
the train stopped and I,

1693
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,260
I know that the people at the front of
the line screamed,

1694
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,540
turn around and like run,
but now all of a sudden fat moshe,

1695
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,990
young,
fat moshe wiifm is at the front of the

1696
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,800
line.
Right.

1697
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,920
And it's like a strip stand by me
situation because I'm like chubby,

1698
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,900
like,
and there's all this wind coming at me

1699
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:36,970
because the wind is all been pushed by
the train.

1700
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,860
So I'm like trying to run from the train
conductor and they're screaming all my

1701
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:43,180
friends like run,
run,

1702
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:46,780
run you fat motherfucker.
The worst,

1703
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,300
scariest,
craziest experiences.

1704
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,720
And then the train finally pulled off
and the we'd like hopped back over and

1705
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:56,850
like shaking.
We'd like smoked weed in the just in

1706
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:57,730
public are like,
fuck it,

1707
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,340
we don't need to go a caverns.

1708
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,620
Me and a buddy of mine in high school
hopped on the back of the tea in boston,

1709
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,580
you know,
the um,

1710
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:10,240
public transport.
It's a train essentially.

1711
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:15,640
It stopped and we jumped onto the tracks
and climbed onto the back and wrote it.

1712
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,770
The train served on the back.
I've done that.

1713
01:15:17,771 --> 01:15:18,670
Not on the train,
but on the,

1714
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,500
the uh,
the buses,

1715
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:24,100
the ac transit buses.
There was a trick where you could grab

1716
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:25,930
the,
there used to be like a handle on the

1717
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:29,050
back of the bus and you put your feet on
the bumper and right,

1718
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,160
like basically write it like you were
like a illegal immigrant or something

1719
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,310
and we would just do that for fun from
one if you want to take like one stop or

1720
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:37,720
whatever.
It was so scary.

1721
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,650
It was so stupid.
It's like the risk of like falling off

1722
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:43,060
of that thing was so dumb.

1723
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,530
You were on top of it?
No,

1724
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:45,520
we were on the back.
Oh,

1725
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:46,900
just holding on just like,
oh yeah,

1726
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,210
it's so crazy.
Like standing on something and holding

1727
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,280
onto something.
But it wasn't a good grip.

1728
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:52,280
It wasn't,
you know.

1729
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,250
And if there was anything that really
bumped you,

1730
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,440
not that it would on a train,
but if it did,

1731
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,200
most likely I wouldn't let go.
I mean,

1732
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,720
it was fun though.
Being young was very fun.

1733
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,550
Stupid.
Being stupid was fun.

1734
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:05,770
It's just amazing.
When you think about how many times

1735
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:07,090
things like that happened,
you go,

1736
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:09,070
oh yeah,
there was that time like you asked me,

1737
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,400
did I do anything dangerous?
Like,

1738
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:11,680
oh,
let me think.

1739
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,090
And you have to go over these things.
Yeah,

1740
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,050
I did a lot of stupid shit.
A lot of climbing things you shouldn't

1741
01:16:17,051 --> 01:16:18,160
have climbed.
Oh yeah,

1742
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:19,450
for sure.
Yeah.

1743
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,120
We'd start a fire once in a warehouse.

1744
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:25,540
I remember once we found this chemical
in a,

1745
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,540
uh,
in a way somebody broke into a car and

1746
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,850
found all this chemical.
I don't know what it was,

1747
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:34,300
but it was some like volatile flammable
chemical.

1748
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:39,100
And there was this cement slide at the
elementary school in the neighborhood

1749
01:16:39,101 --> 01:16:41,950
that we lived in.
And so we poured the chemical down the

1750
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:46,951
slide and lit it on fire.
Just not familiar with the concept of

1751
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:49,270
explosives,
but it was,

1752
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,250
there was a wall of flame,
I don't know what it was,

1753
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:54,390
but it was so big that we were,
I think we were on acid and,

1754
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:57,730
and,
and we were in the after this big old

1755
01:16:57,731 --> 01:16:59,800
wall of sliding flame,
like,

1756
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,770
like the cut.
We were chilling out in this place,

1757
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:06,820
the grassy field up above there and the
cops came and they were like,

1758
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:09,730
we've heard reports that there's someone
playing with a flame thrower.

1759
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,860
I remember we laughed so much at peace
ops because like,

1760
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,470
anyway,
now that was a good memory.

1761
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,600
Well we were a lighting bottle rockets
in this field and I'm one of the bottle

1762
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:25,480
rockets ignited some grass and I stomped
on some of the grass but then some,

1763
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:28,250
it started out real small,
like a laptop size fire,

1764
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:29,690
you know,
stomped on it,

1765
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:32,090
but it just kept going.
It was going left and right.

1766
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:36,110
And then you try to circle around,
but then the side of it gets bigger and

1767
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:37,790
then you can't catch it.
And then it got to the point where like,

1768
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:38,900
oh fuck,
I can't do this.

1769
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,640
I can't,
I can't stop this out,

1770
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:45,760
and then it's whoosh,
and then it became a fire and we were

1771
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:50,990
like 13 and we ran and we got to the
street right when we got to the street.

1772
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:51,800
Just dumb luck.

1773
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,410
Aqap was there,
we just gave it up right away.

1774
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:58,070
We started firing and the cop was like,
get the fuck outta here.

1775
01:17:58,071 --> 01:18:02,090
And we ran and we ran and then the
firetruck came and then we assessed it.

1776
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:04,460
The next day we went by.
We didn't go anywhere near it.

1777
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:06,440
We were just hoping and praying.
Like to this day,

1778
01:18:06,441 --> 01:18:10,640
my parents don't know I did it,
but hoping and praying that nobody died

1779
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:11,570
and that,
you know,

1780
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:14,570
we didn't go to jail so we didn't tell
anybody about it.

1781
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,800
Then we went the next day and it was
just,

1782
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:20,000
it's massive surface area of fire.
Everything was black.

1783
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:24,140
This enormous field,
like several football fields sized.

1784
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,670
Obviously it's number 13.
I,

1785
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:31,340
uh,
I remember that we were once out in,

1786
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:32,960
we were all on mushrooms.
I don't remember this.

1787
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,970
this is all when I'm like 13,
by the way.

1788
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:37,400
Jesus christ,
that's the problem.

1789
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,420
That's why I got sober,
so yeah.

1790
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:42,590
You're a bad example though.
For someone who uses drugs as well.

1791
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:44,540
If you do drugs and fucks your brain up
because look,

1792
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,620
you're very smart.
DId it.

1793
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,250
Did a lot of acid.
A lot of mushrooms.

1794
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:50,420
Yeah.
I loved it.

1795
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,590
I did.
I loved it.

1796
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:54,700
we talked about it last time I was here
at how much I fondly remember I'm

1797
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,470
psychedelics anyway.
But you,

1798
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:00,450
you're sober because of other things.
No.

1799
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,520
You know,
in reality,

1800
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:04,820
I think we talked about this last time,
but in reality it's like now that I look

1801
01:19:04,821 --> 01:19:05,654
back,
you know,

1802
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,210
especially writing that book,
the book covers all of this stuff,

1803
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,790
all these wayward youth stories,
all these insane.

1804
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:13,130
It's called catcher in the rye in case
anybody wants it.

1805
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:17,960
I'm very proud of it,
but it's like once I wrote that book I

1806
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:21,530
realized like I was a wild kid just like
you,

1807
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,443
you know,
or,

1808
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,800
or maybe wilder than when you were
really young,

1809
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,320
but I was a wild kid with a lot of
behavioral issues,

1810
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,540
a lot of mental health stuff going on.

1811
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:32,270
Not like,
not like chronic and systemic,

1812
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:37,271
but like circumstantial and I spent a
lot of time thinking of myself as like

1813
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,920
an alcoholic and I don't knoW what,
what if I even believe that,

1814
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,800
that I didn't even know if I believe in
that label any longer.

1815
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,240
But you don't believe in the label.
Well,

1816
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:53,390
I just talk about this afterwards.
I mean basically I don't know is

1817
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:57,050
basically it has nothing to do.
People always want to ask you that.

1818
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:57,501
I go,
oh,

1819
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,370
I got sober.
I was 15,

1820
01:19:58,371 --> 01:19:59,031
and they go,
oh,

1821
01:19:59,031 --> 01:19:59,721
cool.
Crazy.

1822
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:01,280
What were you doing?
And it's like,

1823
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:03,260
then the answer is always very
embarrassing.

1824
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:07,530
So nothing asset,
pot drinking and now I realize like it's

1825
01:20:07,531 --> 01:20:08,550
not really embarrassing

1826
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,570
because the only reason it's
embarrassing is because I've been like,

1827
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,990
I want to say heroin.
So the people will go,

1828
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:17,070
oh,
I acknowledged that.

1829
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:19,200
That's legitimate,
but I didn't have that story.

1830
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:22,830
That's Not the truth.
The truth is really the question is why

1831
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:24,330
did it should be,
why did you get sober?

1832
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:27,330
And the answer probably would be because
I was a juvenile delinquent and that was

1833
01:20:27,331 --> 01:20:32,310
the way out that I found at the time.
And I probably could take mushrooms now

1834
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:33,930
and before,
but I don't know,

1835
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:35,520
you know.
That's interesting.

1836
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:40,740
That's really interesting.
So do you ever think about exploring it?

1837
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,100
Definitely.
Yeah.

1838
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,310
I Think we did talk about this stuff.
Yeah.

1839
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,960
But definitely I do.
But what,

1840
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:49,680
what keeps you from doing that is,
is it this distinction that you have

1841
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:52,050
where you're,
you're a sober person for sure.

1842
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:54,030
There's that membrane.
I think about that a lot.

1843
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,260
It's like membrane.
You're either,

1844
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:58,110
you're like,
like you are either you are or you are

1845
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:58,944
not.
Right.

1846
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,210
And that's part of it.
Part of it is a,

1847
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:02,190
a,
you know,

1848
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,710
a harm reductIon,
best practices type of thing.

1849
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,920
It's like everything's good.
You know,

1850
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:09,120
I know a lot of drug addicts,
I know a lot of people that use drugs

1851
01:21:09,121 --> 01:21:10,740
and have great experiences.
Right.

1852
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,740
But I know a lot of people that got
sober and thought,

1853
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:14,550
oh,
I'll try again,

1854
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,260
and then they're all fucked up.
right.

1855
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,720
I don't necessarily think that would be
me,

1856
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,120
but I do know that,
right?

1857
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,580
Uh,
and one a and finally I just,

1858
01:21:23,581 --> 01:21:25,320
yeah,
I guess I worry about like,

1859
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:28,170
just habituated,
but I mean,

1860
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:30,780
it hasn't affected you.
It seems to have affected you in the

1861
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:32,320
opposite way.
Yeah.

1862
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:34,050
You're,
you're better.

1863
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,420
But everybody's different.
Everybody is different.

1864
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,440
And what I,
I'm not doing coke doing meth.

1865
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:43,270
There's no argument for meth or coke
maybe even see.

1866
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,690
I mean there's no argument from math
period that just doesn't.

1867
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,780
It doesn't.
There's not going to expand your mind.

1868
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:51,090
Although I guess there's an argument for
adderall.

1869
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,770
Yeah.
Because you want to sit down to write a

1870
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:55,230
script over a weekend.
There is an argument to be made for.

1871
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:57,510
That might be a bullshit script about
cleaning

1872
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,730
script,
about organizing your underwear based on

1873
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:03,620
color.
Uh,

1874
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,740
drugs are weird,
man.

1875
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,510
I mean,
I'm a big drug advocate.

1876
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:08,310
Big time.
I'm not,

1877
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:08,990
I'm,
I,

1878
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,900
I,
I think that they're powerful and

1879
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:16,010
unnecessary and I want,
I want psychedelic experiences.

1880
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:17,880
I've had them,
but I had them.

1881
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:21,450
I always say like the funny part about
taking mind expanding drugs when you're

1882
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:24,810
12 years old is that there's very little
mind upon which to expand,

1883
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,000
you know,
you're like doing these things that are

1884
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:30,810
like rom das,
ask like deep diving into the fractal

1885
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:34,050
pool of existential reality and there's
nothing there.

1886
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,350
You're just like point it.
So it's a weird experience.

1887
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:39,210
Like you're having these freakouts and
you know,

1888
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:42,360
your mind is bursting open,
but uh,

1889
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,890
I certainly wish I would like the
experience of trying that with an adult

1890
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:50,100
brain.
Maybe It'd be worse maybe,

1891
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:51,800
but I doubt it.
I don't know.

1892
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:54,540
I mean,
I think that what would drugs do,

1893
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:57,780
what any drug does is it alters your
brain chemistry,

1894
01:22:57,781 --> 01:23:00,210
right?
And everybody's brain chemistry is

1895
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:02,940
different.
So some people could use a cup of

1896
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:03,780
coffee,
right?

1897
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:06,130
And some people it freaks them out and
some people

1898
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,240
could use some pot and some people just.
There's a lot of people that I know that

1899
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:14,770
they just go into deep paranoid fits if
they get involved with marijuana in any

1900
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:15,551
way,
shape or form.

1901
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:17,920
Right.
Whereas I kind of liked that self

1902
01:23:17,921 --> 01:23:20,760
exploratory and examination aspect of it
because I think,

1903
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,360
I think it's far too easy to be cocky as
far too easy to not be introspective or

1904
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:29,200
that paranoid feeling.
I think it just,

1905
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,840
it forces your brain to examine all
these perhaps uncomfortable truths.

1906
01:23:33,841 --> 01:23:36,510
So you're saying you'd like the paranoia
aspect of it?

1907
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:38,500
I think it's beneficial.
That's really interesting.

1908
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,690
I've never heard that before.
I think it's beneficial because I think

1909
01:23:40,691 --> 01:23:44,390
what you're paranoid of when you're
paranoid the.

1910
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,200
Unless you're thinking the government
spying on you and I'm like,

1911
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:50,110
I know a buddy who was a big time
pothead and he started thinking that

1912
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:52,270
the,
that the government was waiting outside

1913
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:54,700
of his house with a car and they were
watching them constantly.

1914
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,980
Everywhere he went and as soon as he
left they would come out of the bushes,

1915
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:00,280
like he got a little crazy,
but I think he had his own issues.

1916
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,810
Yeah.
And he was also dealing with.

1917
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:04,120
His dad was dying and it was a lot lot
going on,

1918
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,140
but that's one of the weird parts of
drugs is that.

1919
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:09,190
And I don't think that I have this,
you obviously don't,

1920
01:24:09,191 --> 01:24:13,030
but one of the weird things about drugs,
if you have latent mental illness and

1921
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:15,580
you get into your brain and you pour a
chemical on it,

1922
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,530
it'll,
it'll unlock itself,

1923
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:20,860
you know,
get the dragon will uncoil and make

1924
01:24:20,861 --> 01:24:22,460
itself known.
I don't think that.

1925
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:24,460
I'm not worried about that for me,
but I think that is interesting.

1926
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:27,250
I've seen that a lot.
Like a dude's like 25 and it's like,

1927
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:28,750
oh,
I think I'll try start trying

1928
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:31,750
psychedelics or weed and it just goes in
there and it's like,

1929
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:32,920
oh,
you didn't know you had that.

1930
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:35,230
Not that they wouldn't have had that
experience anyway,

1931
01:24:35,231 --> 01:24:38,950
but it's definitely a,
a incidental onset of mental illness.

1932
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,990
Yeah.
There was a study they did about the

1933
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:45,220
correlation between marijuana and
schizophrenia because a lot of people

1934
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:47,290
have tried to connect marijuana,
schizophrenia.

1935
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:50,410
And what they found is essentially the
numbers are stable.

1936
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,900
It's one percent,
it's one percent across the board.

1937
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:56,230
So it's one percent that whether they're
doing pot or not doing pot.

1938
01:24:56,650 --> 01:25:00,130
And so you can make that correlation.
Like this guy got into pot and look at

1939
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:03,550
all these examples of people who started
smoking pot and became schizophrenic,

1940
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,110
but that's just humans.
Yeah.

1941
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:09,520
There's a certain percentage of people
that just will become mentally ill.

1942
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,530
That's a scary.
That's the scariest thing.

1943
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,460
I have a brother who has schizophrenia
and it's like the scariest thing ever.

1944
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,550
Regular kid rig,
totally regular sweet person.

1945
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,110
And then all of a sudden one day It was
like,

1946
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:20,980
are you okay?

1947
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,230
And then couple of years later it's
like,

1948
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,020
oh,
you're,

1949
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:27,370
you are done.
Your brain is cooked and what is,

1950
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:28,720
what is,
what happens?

1951
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,100
Well,
uh,

1952
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:34,540
he was in New York so I didn't see the
entire uncoiling but it's basically,

1953
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:37,150
you know,
he starts weird and gets weirder and

1954
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:38,410
then at a certain point you're like,
oh,

1955
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:40,240
you're different.
You're a different human being.

1956
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,010
Like you just giggling to himself,
smirking weird outbursts,

1957
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:47,020
just scary,
scary stuff.

1958
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:49,900
And it's like your brain turns on you
and there's no.

1959
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,330
I mean it happened around when my dad
died.

1960
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:54,640
So I sometimes I think to myself like,
oh,

1961
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:57,370
maybe that was it.
Maybe in the same way you pour weed on

1962
01:25:57,371 --> 01:25:58,204
it,
maybe if you pour,

1963
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:02,980
you pour trauma on it because trauma's a
brain chemistry buster to 100 percent

1964
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,040
and so I think

1965
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,540
that probably like popped the scab open
or whatever that was in his brain,

1966
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,490
but yeah,
a year later was lIke,

1967
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,720
oh,
you're a different person.

1968
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:14,060
You don't have the same personality.
You don't.

1969
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:17,450
It's,
it just shows you how much of you is

1970
01:26:17,451 --> 01:26:21,440
just brain chemistry and how lucky you
are in the same way.

1971
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:23,090
You were lucky not to get,
you know,

1972
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,140
kidnapped by a monster at the library.
You're also lucky that the monster

1973
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,020
wasn't living inside your brain.
Yeah,

1974
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,650
me too.
Well,

1975
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:34,000
there's,
there's all sorts of dIfferent kinds of

1976
01:26:34,001 --> 01:26:35,200
mental illnesses,
you know,

1977
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:39,880
I'm sure I've got a few right.
Like whether or not they're beneficial.

1978
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,350
That's the other thing.
I of the,

1979
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,650
I was talking to michael irvin once the
football player and he was describing to

1980
01:26:44,651 --> 01:26:47,950
me what happens to someone's brain when
they're in the womb,

1981
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:50,910
when the mother experiences violence,
uh,

1982
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,510
the mother experiences any sort of
violence or really bad neighborhoods or

1983
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,630
around traumatic situations that it,
it elevates the,

1984
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,150
uh,
fight or flight response in the baby.

1985
01:27:01,151 --> 01:27:06,151
So kids come out of the womb,
like pre predetermined to overreact to

1986
01:27:07,181 --> 01:27:09,310
violent situations are dangerous
situations.

1987
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,100
I definitely think I have that.
That's interesting.

1988
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,710
I can,
I ramp up way too quick.

1989
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:17,050
I calm myself and I'm,
I'm very aware of it.

1990
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,033
So I,
I,

1991
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:21,100
I control it and I'm,
I know what it is,

1992
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:24,360
but like if something goes on,
like I,

1993
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:29,470
I hit red line,
like immediately laura goes from zero to

1994
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:34,690
100 miles an hour in like a second.
And that's not usually manageable.

1995
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:38,510
Right?
I mean that maybe that's a link to our

1996
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:41,780
earlier conversation about the
patriarchy.

1997
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:45,200
I mean,
if you can pass on incidental trauma to

1998
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:47,750
a child because the mom is experiencing
violence.

1999
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,900
If a woman is living in the,
you know,

2000
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,960
infrastructural like 20 700,000 layers
deep of infrastructural oppression,

2001
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:01,220
then it stands to figure that a female
child is born with a little bit of that

2002
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:05,840
trauma too,
and a little bit of dna based like,

2003
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,600
um,
maybe I won't fight that fight or maybe

2004
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:12,770
I won't be pushy or maybe I won't be
allowed broad or maybe I won't,

2005
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,260
you know,
argue because that's not feminine or you

2006
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:18,620
know what I'm saying?
And so all of that in,

2007
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:19,850
you know,
trauma,

2008
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:23,090
intergenerational trauma,
which has been studied and proven,

2009
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:26,180
right,
is maybe is maybe in every woman that

2010
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,014
you've ever met.

2011
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,550
Oh,
no doubt about it.

2012
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:30,740
I mean,
I think all of us have some form of

2013
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:31,491
programming.
I mean,

2014
01:28:31,491 --> 01:28:35,090
if you ever been around a kid who has an
overly oppressive dad,

2015
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,410
you know,
and they're,

2016
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:38,120
they're,
they're handicapped by it.

2017
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:38,931
You know,
literally,

2018
01:28:38,931 --> 01:28:43,931
like whether it's a boy or a girl,
that their life is affected by this

2019
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:48,971
overbearing person who's constantly
engaging in manipulation and control of

2020
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:50,534
their reality.

2021
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:52,920
That's what you get when you,
you ever had a.

2022
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:54,450
I'm sure you've had a friend.
This is a drug addict.

2023
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,630
The most tempting thought in the world
when you have a friend that's a drug

2024
01:28:57,631 --> 01:28:59,550
addict is just like,
why don't you just stop,

2025
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,100
just stop doing that.
Stop it.

2026
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,160
It seems so stoppable cause it's so
selfish and so like obviously the wrong

2027
01:29:07,411 --> 01:29:10,500
thing to do and you're over here doing
the right thing and such with such ease

2028
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:13,770
and what having my brother's mental
illness,

2029
01:29:13,771 --> 01:29:14,940
my,
my younger brother,

2030
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:18,390
it made me realize is like you actually
have the same thought when there's a

2031
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:20,300
mentally ill person.
It's just with the,

2032
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,340
the next reality is like,
oh,

2033
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,470
he really can't.
It makes everything clearer,

2034
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,030
right?
Like sickness,

2035
01:29:27,031 --> 01:29:29,670
cancer,
you don't say to the person stop because

2036
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:32,130
you're just like,
oh you can't mental illness.

2037
01:29:32,131 --> 01:29:34,350
You say stop,
but then you realize you can't drug

2038
01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:36,570
addiction,
which is like kind of a mental illness.

2039
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:40,740
You say stop and it seems seductive to
believe that they could stop and if you

2040
01:29:40,741 --> 01:29:42,990
could really be compassionate and say,
oh,

2041
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:44,390
he can't.
That's like,

2042
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,620
you know,
that's like compassionate nirvana.

2043
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:48,620
Yeah.
And you can take it to another place

2044
01:29:48,621 --> 01:29:49,610
too.
With gambling,

2045
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:53,270
it's really the same thing.
So an emulation of human human

2046
01:29:53,271 --> 01:29:55,160
neurochemistry,
like somehow or another,

2047
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:59,870
a betting money on things gives you that
charge that you cannot.

2048
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,960
You can't escape the grip of it.
Like there's a lot of people that are

2049
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,850
really,
really addicted to gambling.

2050
01:30:04,851 --> 01:30:05,900
I've seen it.
It's crazy.

2051
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,690
Which is really crazy that the
government has fucking legalized

2052
01:30:08,691 --> 01:30:12,290
gambling everywhere at gas stations.
Those goddamn scratch tickets are

2053
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:15,740
nothing more than legalized gambling.
Lottery legalized gambling.

2054
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:17,420
Are you.
And you're not anti-gambling though.

2055
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,313
I mean,
I'm for it.

2056
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,820
I'm not,
by the way I want it.

2057
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,620
Yeah.
I don't do it a lot,

2058
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:25,350
but like before I worked for the ufc,
I used to bet on fights all the time.

2059
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:26,870
Oh really?
You don't have the.

2060
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,990
You don't have the bug,
the bug?

2061
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,570
No.
I used to enjoy betting on pool to play

2062
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:34,760
pool a lot and I would gamble on pool
games,

2063
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,760
but it just made it more thrilling.
I never got addicted to it.

2064
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:41,930
But you do,
you run the risk,

2065
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:44,450
you run the risk,
you run the risk of getting caught up in

2066
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:46,010
it,
maybe to a lesser extent than someone

2067
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:49,520
who has an issue.
People seem to have inherent issues with

2068
01:30:49,521 --> 01:30:53,210
it.
It's like it gets you filipino woo.

2069
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,330
They love playing pool and gambling.
Yeah,

2070
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,980
I shouldn't.
What the filipino.

2071
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:59,930
Okay.
Thank you jo.

2072
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:02,300
Because now it's time for me to bring up
my grand race theory.

2073
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:03,920
Okay.
The fIlipinos,

2074
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,580
filipinos are some of the best pool
players in the world.

2075
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:08,510
Is that right?
Yeah.

2076
01:31:08,511 --> 01:31:11,570
And it all happened in a,
after the war,

2077
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:15,440
after the war,
a gis went to the Philippines and they

2078
01:31:15,441 --> 01:31:17,120
introduced pool.
Interesting.

2079
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:18,050
and uh,
you know,

2080
01:31:18,051 --> 01:31:19,820
it doesn't cost a lot or you need as a
table.

2081
01:31:19,821 --> 01:31:23,030
There's a lot of outdoor tables in
manila and a lot of the islands,

2082
01:31:23,031 --> 01:31:24,740
there's thousands of islands.
I don't know if you've ever been.

2083
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,040
No,
I never been there.

2084
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,500
I know how it does,
it seems like a,

2085
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,940
a contiguous country and it just so
isn't like culturally too,

2086
01:31:31,941 --> 01:31:34,610
like from one to the next,
like they like muslim extremists here

2087
01:31:34,611 --> 01:31:39,380
and like catholics here by the way,
they are like weird people too or that I

2088
01:31:39,381 --> 01:31:40,940
get like,
you know,

2089
01:31:40,941 --> 01:31:42,830
I'm kind of in the muck of the internet
sometimes,

2090
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,180
you know,
and I'm kinda like trying to shake up

2091
01:31:44,181 --> 01:31:45,210
some of these uh,
uh,

2092
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,370
outright trees,
you know?

2093
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,480
What do you mean?
I don't know.

2094
01:31:47,481 --> 01:31:48,920
I just like getting into it,
you know,

2095
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,180
how do you get into it?
I like,

2096
01:31:50,181 --> 01:31:52,520
you know,
I post and then people shit post me and

2097
01:31:52,521 --> 01:31:54,390
that kind of like go back and post,
you know,

2098
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,720
the posters.
We had explained shit posting to me,

2099
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,960
oh yeah,
shit.

2100
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,530
Posting with people,
let's posting,

2101
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:00,040
you know,
these

2102
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,740
are the people that they,
they think of themselves as the people

2103
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:04,780
that named trump into the white house
right there.

2104
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:07,320
They're kind of like,
they're almost like a,

2105
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,550
the people that think that the right is
the new punk rock.

2106
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:10,520
That's who they are.
They're like,

2107
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:15,430
they're down to like get in and they
think that the disruption of society is

2108
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,340
inherently good,
so they or they don't care and they just

2109
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:20,110
want to fuck shit up so they,
you know,

2110
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:21,850
they'll,
they're the people that like when I get

2111
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:25,330
an antisemitic post lobbed at me with
like a big old nose and like,

2112
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:28,240
uh,
hey jew or shut them down like the,

2113
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:32,050
I can't express to you how like water
off my back that,

2114
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:33,940
like,
it couldn't bother me less,

2115
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:34,774
you know what I mean?
Like,

2116
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,530
because I just know that it's probably
like an asian kid or like,

2117
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,640
you know,
a black kid.

2118
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,250
It's like,
it's not even actual antisemitism.

2119
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:46,060
It's like a computer person going let's
just fuck with some.

2120
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,280
Like this is the,
this is the attack.

2121
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:50,740
Like if you were going to play chess,
rook to king,

2122
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,603
whatever,
you know,

2123
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:55,420
it's less thought out than that.
It's just messy and chaotic and what's

2124
01:32:55,421 --> 01:32:58,270
the most offensive in most insane,
you know,

2125
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:01,270
most wild crazy attack that I can make.
And so,

2126
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,560
uh,
there,

2127
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:06,130
there's a philosophy,
it's a weird kind of anarchistic

2128
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:08,410
philosophy to it.
And it started in four,

2129
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:09,620
chan and kind of,
you know,

2130
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,830
it bubbled out to uh,
uh,

2131
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,800
to uh,
anonymous is an outcropping of the

2132
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,540
fortune.
I wouldn't call them shit posters

2133
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:19,630
because they have like at least kind of
a cogent philosophy,

2134
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,740
you know.
But,

2135
01:33:20,741 --> 01:33:21,341
uh,
anyway,

2136
01:33:21,341 --> 01:33:25,120
the shit posters are the people that
when you tweet something sincere about

2137
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:28,660
how angry you are about trump,
all of a sudden you see like 90 cartoons

2138
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:32,130
of the most offensive thing that you
could possibly imagine.

2139
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,460
You're like,
why did these people,

2140
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:36,460
why are they attacking me?
And it's because they like looking for

2141
01:33:36,461 --> 01:33:37,840
people.
Little whiny bitches.

2142
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:39,700
Like,
you know,

2143
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:40,331
they're like,
oh,

2144
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:41,860
we found a little tiny bits come this
way.

2145
01:33:41,861 --> 01:33:45,280
And then all of a sudden it's just a
tidal wave of these things.

2146
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:46,660
Well,
if you call them,

2147
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:49,850
if you say their name,
that's where it gets really strange.

2148
01:33:49,851 --> 01:33:54,220
So she wears done exactly what she's.
I looked at some posts that she made

2149
01:33:54,221 --> 01:33:56,230
recently about some magazine cover that
she was on,

2150
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:58,360
showed up on my feet.
And then I read the comments.

2151
01:33:58,361 --> 01:34:00,820
It was like,
jesus christ.

2152
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,780
Yeah,
she,

2153
01:34:01,781 --> 01:34:05,260
if she was a ship,
it would be so filled with rats.

2154
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:07,000
You'd have to light a fire,
right?

2155
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:07,834
It's,
yeah,

2156
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,480
it is like rats and barnacles too
because it's just like all of a sudden

2157
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:11,830
they're just like two,
two,

2158
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,101
two,
two,

2159
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:12,630
two,
two.

2160
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:14,560
Yeah.
But barnacles could be on a cool ship

2161
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:17,530
and you get in there and there's a lot
of people drinking and have a good time

2162
01:34:17,531 --> 01:34:20,950
and barnacles on the outside.
This is rats beCause it's everywhere.

2163
01:34:20,951 --> 01:34:23,380
It's in the pantry.
It's in every aspect of it.

2164
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,980
It is,
it is a part of the new landscape and

2165
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:29,950
where we live,
this digital landscape is filled with.

2166
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,830
I mean in a way.
I mean I don't,

2167
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,160
I don't like them.
Obviously they're not nice but.

2168
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,650
and I think decency is,
is a sad,

2169
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,960
a collateral damage of the digital age,
you know,

2170
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:43,840
it's just like everybody's in decent
now.

2171
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,350
Somehow people Think that being in
decent as positive and that if somebody

2172
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:51,220
disagrees with you politically,
like it's fun and okay to just try to

2173
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:54,610
destroy that person emotionally.
Well you're not really communicating

2174
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:55,750
with them in,
in front of you.

2175
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:58,520
Yeah,
exactly that that is a huge aspect of

2176
01:34:58,521 --> 01:35:01,160
being a person is looking at someone
while you communicate with that,

2177
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,650
removed that there's consequences to
that.

2178
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:04,310
Well,
yeah,

2179
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:05,070
everything,
the pr,

2180
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:08,720
a big problem is the other end and the d
and the internet has made othering so

2181
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:10,400
simple and easy,
you know,

2182
01:35:10,401 --> 01:35:14,030
it's like the arcgis was watching this
documentary and they were talking about,

2183
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:17,030
it was this really good documentary
actually about,

2184
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:20,420
I forget the name of it,
but it was about this guy who he's a

2185
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:24,170
black dude that confronts kkk members
like one on one,

2186
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,320
you know,
and he like talks to them and to them he

2187
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:30,410
converts them and he's like,
he's d hooded like 24 clansman or

2188
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:33,290
whatever.
And there was a story or hooded them as

2189
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,450
It were.
What were,

2190
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,910
what hood there.

2191
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:41,840
There's actually an a very intense.
Have you seen the documentary?

2192
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:42,381
No,
I haven't,

2193
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:45,350
but I've heard of it super intense
moment in the film because the whole

2194
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:48,950
time you're with a guy so charismatic
and brilliant and interesting and you're

2195
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:49,341
like,
wow,

2196
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:51,470
this guy's,
this guy's righteous.

2197
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:52,520
Can you look it up?
Sorry,

2198
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:53,780
I can find it.
what's his name?

2199
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:56,900
He's really fascinating.
Jamiel what's the moment?

2200
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,880
so there's a moment in the documentary
where you're,

2201
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:00,380
you're the whole time you're in there
going like,

2202
01:36:00,381 --> 01:36:02,540
this guy's righteous and awesome.
It's cool.

2203
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:04,910
And d hooding these people.
And then he goes and speaks with these

2204
01:36:04,911 --> 01:36:09,040
black lives matter activists who are.
Oh yeah,

2205
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,210
accidental courtesy.
That's right.

2206
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,830
Daryl davis and race in America.
And uh,

2207
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,900
he's interesting.
But then he goes and he talks to these

2208
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:22,620
black lives matter activists and they're
so angry with him there.

2209
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:27,590
So not into what he's doing because
they're basically like,

2210
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,760
we were In the streets fighting for
black America and here you are spending

2211
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:34,790
your entire life talking to these
racists and you've only,

2212
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:37,190
you've only d hooded 24 of them.

2213
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,670
But it's also.
So there's,

2214
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,010
there's a point that they're making.
I was like,

2215
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:41,930
what are you even doing?
What's even the point of what you're

2216
01:36:41,931 --> 01:36:45,020
doing?
But his point is I'm making micro

2217
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:49,070
victories and I'm converting people one
person at a time.

2218
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,190
But there's a bigger conversation which
is really interesting.

2219
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:58,060
Which is that the person that is closest
to you ideologically is more offensive

2220
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:03,320
to you when they don't do what you want
them to.

2221
01:37:03,321 --> 01:37:05,960
Then the person that's furthest away.
In other words,

2222
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,070
when a person calls me ju online,
some dude in the Philippines with like

2223
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:13,070
an anime avatar and he puts like
antisemitic stuff.

2224
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,260
I give a fuck about that.
That's not real.

2225
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,920
That's not real to me.
But when a person who lIke seems like

2226
01:37:18,921 --> 01:37:22,650
they should get it,
who seems like they should know that

2227
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:25,820
better says some weird antisemitic shit
or talks about like,

2228
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,040
you know how cushner is connected.

2229
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:32,180
Like the global zionism is like,
that's when it bothers me more.

2230
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:33,140
Does that make sense?
yeah.

2231
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,250
No it does.
It does.

2232
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:37,910
Because you think they should know
better and they're ruining the cost

2233
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:40,040
because they're connected to your idea.
Exactly.

2234
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,370
So at any rate,
there's a story in there where he talks

2235
01:37:43,371 --> 01:37:47,350
about a talking to this person who's
like a.

2236
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:50,840
He lived in an all white town except one
of the klansmen that was d hood.

2237
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:54,500
It talks about he lived in this all
white town and he was raised very racist

2238
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:57,900
and that black people were the worst and
there was one black family like the

2239
01:37:57,901 --> 01:38:00,030
johnson's or whatever,
and his father told him,

2240
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:02,730
all black people are the worst of the
monkeys.

2241
01:38:02,731 --> 01:38:05,700
They're the worst except the johnsons.
The johnsons are good.

2242
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:08,520
They're good people.
And he had thIs realization,

2243
01:38:08,521 --> 01:38:10,950
this tickle in his brain of like,
wait,

2244
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:15,030
my father hates all the black people
except the black family that he's met.

2245
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:19,650
like all black people are bad except the
one group that he's actually met.

2246
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,740
And that is like the phenomenon of
othering,

2247
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,633
right?
It's like,

2248
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,900
oh,
black people are bad.

2249
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:27,450
Muslims are bad.
But actually my friend tom,

2250
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:30,600
the muslim,
he's nice but muslims wanna kill me.

2251
01:38:30,601 --> 01:38:33,360
But the tom over here,
he's a good dude.

2252
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:35,040
Hmm.
Anyway,

2253
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,280
I think othering is like the big one of
the big problems that we have.

2254
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:39,300
Well,
it's also,

2255
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,400
I think what's going on with black lives
matter.

2256
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:44,400
One of the things that's going on is
that they're in the middle of the battle

2257
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,240
right in the middle of the battle.
Everyday.

2258
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:49,080
YOu wake up prime for battle getting
online,

2259
01:38:49,081 --> 01:38:50,110
you're active,
you're,

2260
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:50,840
you're,
you're,

2261
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,470
you're activating your membership,
you're,

2262
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:55,530
you know,
organizing,

2263
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:57,720
doing whatever.
and then this guy comes along and he's

2264
01:38:57,721 --> 01:39:01,410
doing something totally different.
He's out there talking to the klansmen.

2265
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:02,760
You'll fuck those people,
man.

2266
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:04,380
Doing right.
Totally.

2267
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:07,270
Yeah.
I was for my show that,

2268
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,690
uh,
that I'm doing my comedy central show.

2269
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:13,800
We're doing like we just did a cultural
appropriation episode and I was

2270
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,390
studying,
so I was studying.

2271
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:17,610
I was like deep in the cultural
appropriation of the reading.

2272
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:19,590
So much shit about it.
But one of the more interesting things

2273
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:23,640
that said about black lives matter,
it's kind of connected to this is that

2274
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:27,630
one thing that happens with cultural
appropriation and things in general is

2275
01:39:27,631 --> 01:39:31,170
that people seize on language.
We're in like a crazy language war right

2276
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:31,651
now,
right?

2277
01:39:31,651 --> 01:39:34,400
Like so many of the phrases that we use,
uh,

2278
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,690
are so charged with secondary and
tertiary,

2279
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:38,820
meaning that we can't,
they don't even mean anything anymore.

2280
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:42,690
Like white privilege is a concept that
the moment you bring it up,

2281
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:45,600
there's so many I levels of eye roll
that it's like,

2282
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,240
I don't even think it's a useful phrase
anymore because it's like the moment you

2283
01:39:48,241 --> 01:39:51,420
say white privilege than a person,
the white person who you're saying it's

2284
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:54,690
privileged just going like fuck you,
and the minute someone saying fuck you,

2285
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,340
your conversation has ended.

2286
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:00,090
So the thIng they said about black lives
matter was also a lot of silly.

2287
01:40:00,091 --> 01:40:01,950
People use that expression.
No doubt.

2288
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,940
That's the weird baggage that it has.
Like it's good.

2289
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:08,910
The thing that we learned about that I
learned about cultural appropriation

2290
01:40:08,911 --> 01:40:09,750
because for me,
I.

2291
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:13,170
I roll my eyes so deeply.
The concept of cultural appropriation,

2292
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:13,890
right?
It's like,

2293
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:15,780
oh,
so I shouldn't eat burritos anymore.

2294
01:40:15,781 --> 01:40:19,050
Is that what you're also.
I always think I'm always really tickled

2295
01:40:19,051 --> 01:40:20,880
with the idea of like the person saying,
oh,

2296
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:24,420
you shouldn't wear that tribal gear,
and then it's like go to the third world

2297
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:29,370
country where the market is and tell
them like impoverished a merchant like,

2298
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,550
oh,
I'm sorry I can't buy this bit of silk

2299
01:40:32,551 --> 01:40:35,220
from you because it's racist for me to
wear it.

2300
01:40:35,221 --> 01:40:36,180
That person's like,
please,

2301
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,650
please buy it and wear it.
Like,

2302
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:38,880
or you know what I'm saying?

2303
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,170
Or like the family that's like,
oh,

2304
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:42,970
it would be a great honor if you would,
where the sorry or whatever.

2305
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:47,970
So it's a big eye-roll except then you
start to think like upon reading it it's

2306
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:48,481
like,
oh,

2307
01:40:48,481 --> 01:40:51,540
the thing is it's not incidental,
it's emotional.

2308
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:55,420
It's like deeper than,
than just like trying to parse out the

2309
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:58,960
logic and go,
oh well I found an example where your

2310
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:02,260
thing falls apart.
It's like it's emotional.

2311
01:41:02,261 --> 01:41:04,080
There's an emotional reaction.
Like when,

2312
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:06,860
when somebody you know affects,
you know,

2313
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,400
dreads up their hair even though you can
say,

2314
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:13,630
but people have been dreading their hair
in other cultures for a million years.

2315
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:18,580
Vikings had dreads and that is true.
It doesn't matter because the person

2316
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:21,250
that's in front of you,
that's a black person that's going,

2317
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:25,900
I have pain when I'm.
I have this pain that I'm looking at,

2318
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:27,550
you know,
a person that's affecting my culture

2319
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:29,260
without any of the negative parts.
Right,

2320
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:31,600
so you can,
you can wear the hair and you can have

2321
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:31,990
the.

2322
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:34,100
why is that okay?
Just because of the word culture,

2323
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,080
because if that's the case with someone
else,

2324
01:41:36,110 --> 01:41:38,720
some someone else wearing something that
you might find a failure.

2325
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:42,980
What if you're a person that's extremely
a conservative when it comes to dress

2326
01:41:42,981 --> 01:41:45,260
and you see a woman in a short skirt and
you have pain,

2327
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:48,290
should that impose upon that woman's
ability to wear that skirt?

2328
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:49,141
No,
definitely,

2329
01:41:49,141 --> 01:41:54,141
and I'm not making a case that anybody's
pain ought to be automatically adopted

2330
01:41:55,081 --> 01:41:57,330
as like a behavioral standard.
Right?

2331
01:41:57,331 --> 01:41:59,210
That's not really.
What I,

2332
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:04,270
I learned from this whole discussion is
it's like it's not really about going.

2333
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:10,190
No one is really saying except the most
emotionally kind of a inferior,

2334
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:13,910
like the person that doesn't have the
language to express what they're really

2335
01:42:13,911 --> 01:42:16,190
saying.
Almost no one that I read when I was

2336
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,520
reading these real like intellectuals
and their concepts of cultural

2337
01:42:19,521 --> 01:42:24,110
appropriation is saying white people
should stop doing this stuff altogether.

2338
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:28,340
Almost no one.
I didn't find one left wing woke article

2339
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:32,510
that said white people should stop
adopting the culture of other,

2340
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,640
of people of color.
Right?

2341
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:39,470
I read a lot of right wing think pieces
that were saying this is absurd.

2342
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:42,080
Why are you telling us to stop adopting
these cultures?

2343
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,780
Isn't all culture a melting pot and all
cultural borrowing,

2344
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,890
but not once did I read somebody's
saying white people stopped this

2345
01:42:48,891 --> 01:42:50,880
altogether,
but what did you read?

2346
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:52,130
so,
so mostly,

2347
01:42:52,131 --> 01:42:55,670
and I hope I can articulate this well
because I'm not the best advocate for

2348
01:42:55,671 --> 01:42:57,440
this position because like I said,
it's,

2349
01:42:57,441 --> 01:42:59,330
it's,
it's one that I struggle with that's

2350
01:42:59,331 --> 01:43:01,430
dubious,
dubious and difficult.

2351
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:04,700
And,
and there are ridiculous parts of the

2352
01:43:04,701 --> 01:43:08,590
cultural appropriation argument,
but one thing that like,

2353
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:13,400
it's all connected to historical trauma.
It's all deeper.

2354
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:16,910
Like basically,
let's see if I can articulate this well,

2355
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:18,410
what this one,
um,

2356
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:21,410
this one person,
and I wish I could find his name

2357
01:43:21,411 --> 01:43:22,510
actually,
but uh,

2358
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:25,910
because he deserves it because he's a
really deep thinker about this stuff was

2359
01:43:25,911 --> 01:43:27,480
talking about was that,
you know,

2360
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:30,290
we have racism.
Racism is a,

2361
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:35,620
a huge word that describes everything
from a white person like hugging their

2362
01:43:36,621 --> 01:43:40,910
purse closer to their chest when a black
person walks by or even like a weird,

2363
01:43:40,911 --> 01:43:41,744
like,
you know,

2364
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:45,980
just the smallest little racial
weirdness all the way to lighting across

2365
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:49,520
on somebody on somebody's lawn to
murdering someone.

2366
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,610
LIke that's all encompassed and racism.
So they started trying to like parse it

2367
01:43:52,611 --> 01:43:53,900
out.
People are going,

2368
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,700
oh,
when you call someone a racist,

2369
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:56,481
right?
They go,

2370
01:43:56,481 --> 01:43:58,250
I'm not a racist.
You're calling me a monster.

2371
01:43:58,251 --> 01:43:59,390
And then somebody will go,
oh no,

2372
01:43:59,391 --> 01:44:03,710
I meant like a systemically racist.
It's like you need more specific

2373
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:07,220
examples.
So cultural appropriation is one,

2374
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,070
white privilege is another.
There's all these,

2375
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:12,710
but still go back to what,
what cultural appropriation.

2376
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:16,190
Like you said that no one was saying
don't do it.

2377
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,110
Right.
So what.

2378
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,790
So what are they doing when they're
trying to chop someone's dreads off?

2379
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:21,480
Okay.
I don't know about the spa.

2380
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:22,710
A spa.
I mean,

2381
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,780
what,
what example?

2382
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:26,080
You mean the san francisco state example
where the girl attacked guy.

2383
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:30,230
I mean that girl was just inarticulately
expressing some insanity.

2384
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:31,760
I don't,
I don't think that's defensible.

2385
01:44:31,761 --> 01:44:34,070
And I,
and I think most of the articles in the

2386
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:37,010
stuff that I read about that specific
instance or just like basically saying

2387
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:37,580
that women's,
uh,

2388
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,260
an uh,
a lunatic.

2389
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:41,090
Well,
I've heard people though enforce it and

2390
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:44,810
I know someone who was mad at their
friend is a black girls matter.

2391
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:47,450
Her friend who was a white girl who had
braids,

2392
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:50,720
she had like cornrows and she was mad
because she was saying that it's

2393
01:44:50,721 --> 01:44:52,820
cultural appropriate cultural
appropriation.

2394
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:54,260
I said,
do you know about bo?

2395
01:44:54,261 --> 01:44:56,990
Derek?
But like she was one of the first people

2396
01:44:56,991 --> 01:45:00,260
to ever have cornrows on roman coins
actually.

2397
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:01,094
Right.
I mean it's,

2398
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:03,350
it's crazy thing to call that cultural
appropriation,

2399
01:45:03,351 --> 01:45:07,430
but also saying that a white person
shouldn't wear that.

2400
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,800
That's fucking crazy because what do
you.

2401
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,720
What about a black guy wearing a polo
shirt?

2402
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:12,321
Well,
okay,

2403
01:45:12,321 --> 01:45:12,910
so,
okay.

2404
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:16,730
There was a good example is a,
and again,

2405
01:45:16,731 --> 01:45:18,950
I'm not like,
I'm not the greatest advocate for this

2406
01:45:18,951 --> 01:45:21,440
position.
I just read so much that made me

2407
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,200
empathize with the position.
Not necessarily agree with it,

2408
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:25,700
but empathize with where it's coming
from.

2409
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:29,360
So the polo for example,
when you see you as a white dude or me

2410
01:45:29,361 --> 01:45:31,490
as a white dude,
when I see somebody wearing a polo,

2411
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:34,600
it's just a polo.
It has no historical antecedent,

2412
01:45:34,601 --> 01:45:39,601
it has no historical baggage to it and
there's no connection to systemic racism

2413
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:42,320
or,
or elvis presley stealing the cream of

2414
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:46,070
the intellectual musical crop and then
never giving back to that community or

2415
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:49,070
iggy azalea coming in,
adopting a black accent and then just

2416
01:45:49,071 --> 01:45:50,750
like taking all the money and running,
you know,

2417
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:54,450
it has no connection to deeper root
systems like these trees have the

2418
01:45:54,451 --> 01:45:56,720
communicate with each other,
like taste bitter,

2419
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:59,120
right?
So all it is is a polo.

2420
01:45:59,121 --> 01:46:02,300
It's just a guy wearing a polo and
that's why the the counterargument

2421
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:05,930
doesn't make sense because it's like
nobody's upset when they see a black

2422
01:46:05,931 --> 01:46:09,330
dude and a polo shirt.
I mean maybe some weird racist guy is

2423
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:10,430
his,
but mostly not.

2424
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:14,960
On the other hand,
when a person sees a,

2425
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,890
like a,
a white person affecting a deep part of

2426
01:46:18,891 --> 01:46:23,260
black culture without any of the baggage
that is associated with it.

2427
01:46:23,261 --> 01:46:24,350
Like for example,
dreads,

2428
01:46:24,351 --> 01:46:26,630
right?
One of the arguments I read a lot is

2429
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:29,180
that like white people wearing braids
and dreads,

2430
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:31,070
you know,
you get rewarded for it,

2431
01:46:31,071 --> 01:46:34,310
you look cool,
you look awesome and meanwhile black

2432
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:37,100
women are having a difficult time
getting a job because they have black

2433
01:46:37,101 --> 01:46:40,760
hair or black people getting fired from
jobs because they have dreads.

2434
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:43,340
Right?
So there's these consequences that black

2435
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:46,730
people experience because of black shit
that white people that are adopting it

2436
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:48,920
don't necessarily experience think
that's true at all.

2437
01:46:48,921 --> 01:46:49,980
I,
if you were working in

2438
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,240
an office and some white dude at dreads,
he'd be highly suspicious of his

2439
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:54,810
behavior.
Well,

2440
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:57,510
for example,
like is this guy's kind of like a dork?

2441
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:59,040
I hear what you're saying.
I'm going to hire him.

2442
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:02,850
There's a guy that had hair like you and
right next to him with some stinky white

2443
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:04,650
dude with them.
Stinky dreads has dreads.

2444
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:05,550
Stink.
Okay.

2445
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,760
Take dreads out.
Let's say that's a good example.

2446
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:10,870
Would there in the us military,
there was just a,

2447
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:12,630
a new,
um,

2448
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:17,010
a new set of acceptable hairstyles and
mo,

2449
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,100
almost every one of the unacceptable
hairstyles that they,

2450
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,170
that they accept,
that they put into place.

2451
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:26,670
It was basically black hair,
like braids,

2452
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,420
wearing your hair natural.
I don't know the actuaL.

2453
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:31,050
What do you mean?
I mean,

2454
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:33,180
I would have to,
we'd have to be like an afro.

2455
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,790
Yeah.
Short afro.

2456
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:36,450
Yeah.
I mean,

2457
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,410
you're not allowed to do that.

2458
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,620
You'd have to pull up the article to
give these specific examples.

2459
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,800
But basically there are a million
different examples like that.

2460
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:44,880
And like I said,
I'm not,

2461
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:48,180
I'm not necessarily an advocate for heat
and,

2462
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:52,350
and honor the call of the appropriation
accuser.

2463
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,860
I'm more like now realizing that,
uh,

2464
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:59,700
I'm more now realizing that there's like
just a lot of deep emotional,

2465
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,140
weird trauma underneath every,
every accusation of appropriation.

2466
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:07,980
It's not that I think therefore white
girls shouldn't wear braids.

2467
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:12,981
It's that I think I understand more
where the person that is upset is coming

2468
01:48:13,081 --> 01:48:15,600
from it.
Just from a compassion perspective.

2469
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:17,790
You know,
I get that.

2470
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:19,950
I get that.
It just logically,

2471
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:22,170
it doesn't jive.
It's not about logic.

2472
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:24,270
Yeah,
but it should be all human interaction

2473
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:26,940
should have some basis in logic.
If you're going to communicate with

2474
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:28,770
things.
I don't agree because emotions aren't

2475
01:48:28,771 --> 01:48:29,550
about logic,
right?

2476
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:33,320
But should anybody be subject to your
oWn emotions like should like,

2477
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:35,700
you change your behavior,
your dress.

2478
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:39,420
If you're a person who's completely not
racist but you enjoy the way your hair

2479
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:42,870
looks and braids should you take into
consideration all the people that you're

2480
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:45,810
going to run into and they're going to
be upset at you over braids,

2481
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:48,920
even though they're ignorant about the
history of braids and carneros,

2482
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,720
should you alter or change your
behavior?

2483
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:54,690
Should you accept the fact that you're
just going to have a certain amount of

2484
01:48:54,691 --> 01:48:55,890
cultural appropriation?
Well,

2485
01:48:55,891 --> 01:48:57,990
let me ask you this.
Like if you.

2486
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:00,340
I don't have an answer to that question.
I don't think so.

2487
01:49:00,430 --> 01:49:02,340
That is an important part of this.
I mean,

2488
01:49:02,341 --> 01:49:04,830
if you're going to accept the fact
there's some sort of an emotional

2489
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:07,110
attachment to these things and that's
where the argument comes from.

2490
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:11,830
Shouldn't you decide or at least
contemplate whether or not that emotion

2491
01:49:11,831 --> 01:49:12,664
is valid?

2492
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:15,810
It doesn't seem to be.
Seems to me there's real examples of

2493
01:49:15,811 --> 01:49:18,140
racism and horrible things.
Like if you want to,

2494
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:21,300
you know,
make your eyes squinty and look like a

2495
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:24,420
japanese character from a bugs bunny
cartoon in,

2496
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,720
you know,
1940 and then you want to go to a party

2497
01:49:27,721 --> 01:49:30,000
and people think you're a racist.
You should,

2498
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:34,590
you should be aware that you're
presenting an image that is inherently

2499
01:49:34,591 --> 01:49:35,221
racist.
Like,

2500
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:37,470
that's,
that's something that's kind of fucked

2501
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:41,370
up and you should be considered about
the way people's emotions are going to

2502
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:44,310
fire up looking at your image.
That's what I'm saying.

2503
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,180
Yeah,
but that's a different thing than

2504
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,710
braids.
Oh,

2505
01:49:47,711 --> 01:49:49,160
but oh,
but that's what I'm.

2506
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,040
I'm not advocating.
First of all,

2507
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:53,800
I'm not advocating anything.
I'm just saying I've done.

2508
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:58,510
I've delved into this topic enough that
I started to understand where people are

2509
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:01,180
coming from when they,
when they get activated by this stuff

2510
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:02,860
too,
but I think a big part of it is

2511
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:06,130
reinforcement in the community that
that's acceptable to be upset at people

2512
01:50:06,131 --> 01:50:07,810
for corn rows or brave and I don't.

2513
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:10,750
I actually don't disagree with you.
I think you're right about that and yet

2514
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:15,751
I think it also is connected to like a,
a legitimate emotional reality that's

2515
01:50:15,881 --> 01:50:17,320
happening.
Like for example,

2516
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,400
by the way,
the logic is,

2517
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:22,660
is very important and I would say logic
is more important than emotion when it

2518
01:50:22,661 --> 01:50:25,780
comes to communication,
but it doesn't because something is more

2519
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:27,760
important,
doesn't negate the,

2520
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:30,100
the importance of the other thing.
well,

2521
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:33,040
it certainly doesn't solve the situation
just by clearly using the logic.

2522
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:35,500
You mIght get a certain percentage of
the people that agree with you because

2523
01:50:35,501 --> 01:50:37,870
of logic,
but that's more rare than it is common,

2524
01:50:37,871 --> 01:50:38,620
right?
It's like,

2525
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:41,530
would you.
Would You feel comfortable going to a

2526
01:50:41,531 --> 01:50:44,260
native american powwow,
you know,

2527
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:45,850
with a headdress on,
not even a power.

2528
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:48,340
There's a powwow next door.
You can see It and you're at a music

2529
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:48,940
festival.

2530
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:50,680
Would you were an indian headdress?
I wouldn't,

2531
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:54,220
but the reason why you can't and the
reason why you shouldn't or the reason

2532
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:56,470
why it's an issue is because the people
are marginalized.

2533
01:50:56,471 --> 01:50:59,680
Let me tAke my own people.
I'm italian and my people,

2534
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:03,050
for the longest time there was a lot of
anti italian races.

2535
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:06,100
My grandfather talked to me about it,
what it was like coming off the boat,

2536
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:11,070
but then somewhere along the line it
became acceptable for italians in,

2537
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,410
in american culture where it's not.
There's no real racism.

2538
01:51:14,411 --> 01:51:18,940
It doesn't stick and cause a Guinea to
our face.

2539
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:20,770
We will laugh.
No one cares.

2540
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:23,260
You could make meatballs and spaghetti
all day long.

2541
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:25,750
Nobody gives a shit.
Nobody accuses you of,

2542
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,620
uh,
you know,

2543
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,690
you have a pizza party.
Nobody thinks it's cultural

2544
01:51:28,691 --> 01:51:30,880
appropriation,
but try having a taco party,

2545
01:51:30,881 --> 01:51:33,340
try having taco tuesdays people get
pissed to you.

2546
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,890
Why?
Because mexicans still experienced real

2547
01:51:35,891 --> 01:51:38,680
racism in this country.
Whereas italians largely just don't,

2548
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:40,750
right.
and like taco tuesdays and example of

2549
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:42,310
something that's like,
who fucking cares,

2550
01:51:42,311 --> 01:51:43,620
that's not important.
And,

2551
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,010
and so if I'm wearing a sombrero,
exactly offensive to people,

2552
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:50,560
If that's as,
that's as deep as most people go,

2553
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,510
that's dumb.
What are you talking about?

2554
01:51:52,511 --> 01:51:54,940
A kennedy to taco.
I mean that's done and it is dumb,

2555
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:58,200
but if you kinda like get under the dme,
which is the name of my,

2556
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,280
my third,
my third special.

2557
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:02,220
So it's mouth.
It's live,

2558
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:05,410
live in oakland now.
fucking hitler and then get under the

2559
01:52:05,411 --> 01:52:07,390
dme.
But if you get under the first,

2560
01:52:07,410 --> 01:52:10,150
like the most,
the epidermal layer of like flashy

2561
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:13,240
insanity and go like,
what's really happening here is like,

2562
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,740
oh,
it's just what you're saying actually

2563
01:52:14,741 --> 01:52:17,080
you're more woke than you than you let
on june interest.

2564
01:52:17,081 --> 01:52:19,330
It's like it's really about power
dynamics.

2565
01:52:19,331 --> 01:52:21,430
Is that really about the appropriation
incident?

2566
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,910
Although on some level maybe it is.
It's really about the power dynamic

2567
01:52:24,911 --> 01:52:25,870
underneath it.
Well,

2568
01:52:25,871 --> 01:52:28,930
I think one of the things that we're
seeing in universities in particular is

2569
01:52:28,931 --> 01:52:33,820
people that are exercising the ability
to affect change.

2570
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,540
Even if it doesn't make sense,
they have the ability to,

2571
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:39,910
uh,
point out something that they think is

2572
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:44,560
incorrect or is unjust and then they
attack it and go after it and then they

2573
01:52:44,561 --> 01:52:46,190
see and by seeing

2574
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:49,340
those results,
it's almost in a lot of ways kind of

2575
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:52,490
attached to the same idea.
Like if you're worth x amount of

2576
01:52:52,491 --> 01:52:53,930
dollars,
why do you still chase money?

2577
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:57,200
Because you're trying to get the thrill
of the accomplishment.

2578
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:59,960
There's the game that's going on and
there's a certain amount of game going

2579
01:52:59,961 --> 01:53:03,620
on trying to get that white kid that you
don't even know to cut off his dreads.

2580
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:05,900
Whether or not you know that the romans
wore dreads,

2581
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:06,531
whether or not,
you know,

2582
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:09,290
the greeks wore dreads,
the vikings and all these different

2583
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:11,120
people have them.
It doesn't matter.

2584
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:14,240
It's like there's a little tiny white
guy and that girl could yell at that

2585
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:16,010
white guy then chase him with a pair of
scissors.

2586
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,141
Yeah,
exactly.

2587
01:53:17,141 --> 01:53:19,810
It's,
it's the incidence are the absurdity.

2588
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,520
But the,
but the current,

2589
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:24,190
the conceptual current is somewhat
valid.

2590
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,470
I mean,
to you,

2591
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,353
I'm sorry,
you know,

2592
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:29,470
to some degree,
like even you and I think that you're

2593
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:32,470
naturally skeptical towards concepts
like cultural appropriation because,

2594
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,840
and I am too because as,
especially as comedians,

2595
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,250
it's very easy to see the absurdity and
it's stupid and it's so,

2596
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,300
it's so pointless.
Like what?

2597
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:43,960
We can't not adopt each other's cultures
that won't ever happen.

2598
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,120
So,
but even we go,

2599
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:49,180
okay,
but I wouldn't wear a sombrero to a

2600
01:53:49,181 --> 01:53:51,790
mexican club.
I wouldn't walk into a club like,

2601
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:52,211
oh,
hey,

2602
01:53:52,211 --> 01:53:53,050
what's up?
Right.

2603
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:54,310
So,
so if you say,

2604
01:53:54,311 --> 01:53:56,170
okay,
it's almost pornography,

2605
01:53:56,171 --> 01:53:57,340
right?
I know it when I see it.

2606
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:59,230
right?
I know when I know it's offensive when I

2607
01:53:59,231 --> 01:54:00,064
feel it.
Right.

2608
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:03,250
You know?
So if you kind of expand further and go,

2609
01:54:03,251 --> 01:54:05,050
okay,
even the absurd examples,

2610
01:54:05,051 --> 01:54:07,960
I kind of understood,
I'm going to try to understand for me,

2611
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,510
I'm going to try to understand where
people are coming from with that.

2612
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:14,140
Then I can kind of contextualize it now.
I don't have to agree with it,

2613
01:54:14,141 --> 01:54:15,490
but I can at least say,
oh,

2614
01:54:15,491 --> 01:54:19,300
I get where this is coming from.
It's coming from historical antecedents

2615
01:54:19,301 --> 01:54:22,180
of racism and oppression that are
connected to hairstyle and,

2616
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:23,260
and the,
and,

2617
01:54:23,261 --> 01:54:24,094
and,
uh,

2618
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:27,790
all of these musicians that have taken
black culture and made money off of it.

2619
01:54:27,791 --> 01:54:32,260
There's all this like deeper sedimentary
layers of emotionality.

2620
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,960
I don't have to heat it and change
accordingly,

2621
01:54:34,961 --> 01:54:37,210
but I do.
I would be foolish to ignore it.

2622
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:38,060
Right?

2623
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:39,710
Yeah,
that completely makes sense.

2624
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:44,030
And also I get it from a point of view
of a person who comes from a culture

2625
01:54:44,031 --> 01:54:46,550
that used to be maligned and isn't
anymore.

2626
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:47,680
So

2627
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:50,440
I'm from a culture that used to be
maligned and then I thought wasn't

2628
01:54:50,441 --> 01:54:52,210
anymore.
And then very recently things have

2629
01:54:52,211 --> 01:54:53,044
gotten weird again.

2630
01:54:53,730 --> 01:54:57,720
It's really easy to say that jews are
responsible for a large problem.

2631
01:54:57,930 --> 01:55:00,950
Part of the problem in the world today.
I've seen it a lot lately.

2632
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:05,460
It used to be like reAlly inappropriate
thinking and talking just 20 years ago

2633
01:55:05,461 --> 01:55:05,500
ago,

2634
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,960
it used to be very taboo and it is not
anymore.

2635
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:10,120
And uh,
it's uh,

2636
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:11,230
it's,
it's weird.

2637
01:55:11,231 --> 01:55:12,280
It's very weird.
It's definitely,

2638
01:55:12,281 --> 01:55:13,360
I,
you know,

2639
01:55:13,361 --> 01:55:18,361
I don't take stuff antisemitism.
Antisemitism is like the closest I come

2640
01:55:18,731 --> 01:55:23,731
to believing in magic because it's like,
it's like I'm not a big mystical guy,

2641
01:55:24,581 --> 01:55:27,940
but like antisemitism has never gone
away.

2642
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:31,030
It just has an eye.
I could see if you're an anti semite

2643
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:33,970
you're going.
The evil of the jews is the closest I

2644
01:55:33,971 --> 01:55:36,670
come to believing in magic because they
just never stopped being evil.

2645
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:39,460
Like I just don't understand how this
never goes away.

2646
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:43,210
It never goes away.
It's so fucking weird.

2647
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:47,940
Like no matter where jews have lived,
no matter how assimilated they've been,

2648
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:51,060
you know that the jews in berlin where
the most assimilated jews in history,

2649
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:51,731
they,
they,

2650
01:55:51,731 --> 01:55:54,360
they didn't.
They were known for having christmas

2651
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:57,890
trees and eating pork and that they
would describe these christmas parties

2652
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,510
were only be jews because the germans
wouldn't go,

2653
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:03,600
but it would be all of them worshiping.
I mean a celebrated christmas.

2654
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,370
They were the most assimilated jews
ever.

2655
01:56:05,371 --> 01:56:07,830
And that was the epicenter of the nazi
movement.

2656
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:11,040
Yeah.
So it follows the jews and I mean,

2657
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:13,470
I know that,
I'm sure at least one of your listeners

2658
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:14,790
is like,
no,

2659
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:16,740
the jews follow it,
but it's like,

2660
01:56:17,190 --> 01:56:19,200
it's crazy.
it just won't go away.

2661
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:20,250
It's a,
it's a,

2662
01:56:20,251 --> 01:56:22,800
it's a virus that won't ever ever die
down.

2663
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:24,010
Well,

2664
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:29,010
I think there's,
there's a bunch of problems with this

2665
01:56:29,951 --> 01:56:32,140
antisemitic thing going on.
Um,

2666
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:37,210
and one of them is the accomplishments
of the jews are very disproportionate,

2667
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:40,960
especially european jews.
If you look at european jews and nobel

2668
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:44,230
prize winners,
it's fucking staggering saying jews who

2669
01:56:44,231 --> 01:56:45,910
were intellectuals,
chess champions,

2670
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,090
a bunch of,
there is a select gene pool,

2671
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:54,430
especially particularly european jews.
Nobody talks about it that I don't think

2672
01:56:54,821 --> 01:56:55,780
that's true.
No,

2673
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:59,340
true.
I thought it was a no.

2674
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,460
Okay.
Okay.

2675
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:03,250
Giant people.
So everyone's probably a huge hogs.

2676
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:06,400
Um,
but do you know the story of fritz

2677
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:10,300
haber?
Fritz harbor's one of the most shocking

2678
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:13,740
a jewish stories in terms of a,
a,

2679
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:17,950
a,
a jewish scientist who was a part of

2680
01:57:17,951 --> 01:57:20,650
world war one on the side of the
germans.

2681
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:24,160
He aLso invented the hopper method of
extracting nitrogen from the

2682
01:57:24,161 --> 01:57:25,750
environment.
You know,

2683
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:28,890
nitrogen Is one of the most important
things when it comes to fertilizer.

2684
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:33,700
We were talking about fertilizer plans
and nitrogen is 80 percent of the air we

2685
01:57:33,701 --> 01:57:36,190
breathe.
Most people think the air is oxygen and

2686
01:57:36,191 --> 01:57:38,320
carbon dioxide.
It's mostly nitrogen.

2687
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:42,310
And then there's some oxygen and then
there's some carbon dioxide we breathe

2688
01:57:42,311 --> 01:57:46,000
out that that plants use.
Fritz harbor figured out a way to

2689
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:51,001
extract nitrogen from the acts of the
actual oxygen from the actual air around

2690
01:57:52,031 --> 01:57:56,920
us and take that nitrogen and use it in
the soil as fertilizer.

2691
01:57:58,030 --> 01:58:03,030
And he won a nobel prize for that.
And 50 percent of the nitrogen in most

2692
01:58:04,421 --> 01:58:08,270
people's bodies came from the harbor
method like his.

2693
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:10,840
This is like from,
you know,

2694
01:58:10,841 --> 01:58:13,190
the early 19 hundreds of sky figured
this out.

2695
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:17,830
It's still being used today.
He also was the first guy to invent

2696
01:58:17,831 --> 01:58:21,880
using poison gas and they use it on the
allied troops in world war one.

2697
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:25,870
So he was wanted for crimes against
humanity and simultaneously winning the

2698
01:58:25,871 --> 01:58:27,970
nobel prize during world war one.

2699
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,240
And then when the nazis took over,
he,

2700
01:58:31,241 --> 01:58:33,580
um,
he created zyklon,

2701
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:36,760
a client a is a,
um,

2702
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:40,240
it's,
it's a gas that has a very distinct

2703
01:58:40,241 --> 01:58:45,010
smell and I think it was a pesticide and
they used a,

2704
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:50,470
the smell was added to it to make people
acutely aware that this pesticide was

2705
01:58:50,471 --> 01:58:54,290
being used because it was very poisonous
they changed it to be,

2706
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,110
which is they use the gas,
the jews.

2707
01:58:56,380 --> 01:59:01,380
So this fucking guy created the actual
gas that was used in the fucking

2708
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:08,160
concentration camps to kill the jews and
they just took the smell out of it.

2709
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,610
That's how they created zyklon b,
whatever that thing was,

2710
01:59:11,630 --> 01:59:13,960
they added to icon a to make it smell
bad.

2711
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:17,470
They took that out for his icon based.
So it was almost odorless and they were

2712
01:59:17,471 --> 01:59:21,040
killing people left and right with it.
And he was forced out of the country.

2713
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:22,660
I mean,
it's a crazy,

2714
01:59:22,661 --> 01:59:24,640
crazy story.
I mean,

2715
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:26,840
when he was going to,
um,

2716
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:30,160
the front line to help implement his
gas,

2717
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:31,300
uh,
on,

2718
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,360
on the allied troops,
his wife shot herself in front of him

2719
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,770
and he left his kid behind with his
dying wife to go to war.

2720
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:41,560
it's fucking crazy stories.
Crazy.

2721
01:59:41,561 --> 01:59:45,280
And he wound up dying seeking refuge
away from Germany.

2722
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:49,210
He was one of the few scientists that
they didn't want a few jews.

2723
01:59:49,211 --> 01:59:53,440
They didn't lock up and he just couldn't
tolerate.

2724
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:57,970
I mean he couldn't stand by while these
other jews that he knew were going to

2725
01:59:57,971 --> 02:00:01,720
the concentration camps and people were
being rounded up and he'd go leaving.

2726
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:03,810
Did he know that cycle b?
Yeah.

2727
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:07,330
I think that might have happened.
Like while he was,

2728
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:10,740
while he was on the run.
Not sure I'd have to get into that,

2729
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:13,000
but I mean that would be a crazy
realization that,

2730
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:13,881
I mean it's like the,
you know,

2731
02:00:13,881 --> 02:00:15,860
the t and t guy.
I either built dynamite,

2732
02:00:15,861 --> 02:00:17,620
like realizing what he'd done to the
world.

2733
02:00:17,621 --> 02:00:18,940
I mean,
how about oppenheimer,

2734
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:19,990
right?
Yeah.

2735
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,660
I mean oppenheimer is quoting the
bhagavad gita.

2736
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:27,220
We played that on the podcast last week.
Come the death destroyer of worlds.

2737
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:30,850
Fuck man.
Speaking of billionaires,

2738
02:00:30,851 --> 02:00:31,930
being able,
I mean,

2739
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:36,220
to have that quote is like that's a big
yikes moment.

2740
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:37,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

2741
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,550
So I mean,
I think there's.

2742
02:00:39,551 --> 02:00:44,551
That is that jews have been so almost
genetically smart for so long.

2743
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,430
There's a reason for that.
You know,

2744
02:00:46,770 --> 02:00:47,603
what is it?
Well,

2745
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:51,810
it's that basically in the whole of the
dark ages,

2746
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,600
the dark ages are characterized by
people being illiterate.

2747
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:58,140
That's they were in the dark and only
the clergy could read that.

2748
02:00:58,141 --> 02:01:03,141
The jews were a 98 percent literate
people and that is literally the reason

2749
02:01:05,310 --> 02:01:08,430
if you want to talk,
it actually comes all the way back to

2750
02:01:08,431 --> 02:01:10,050
systemic oppression.
Right?

2751
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:12,990
In the same way that there are barriers,
you know,

2752
02:01:12,991 --> 02:01:15,300
if you're deaf or if you're black or if
you're a woman,

2753
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,480
there are barriers you have to jump past
if you are given an advantage.

2754
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:19,500
I mean,
it's all evolution,

2755
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,990
right?
Then you're going to leap forward,

2756
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:26,700
and so when you have a history of 500
years where no one in europe reads,

2757
02:01:26,701 --> 02:01:29,130
except for the jews and the clergy,
well,

2758
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:30,750
no shit,
they ended up,

2759
02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:33,870
you know,
being at the front lines of,

2760
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:35,250
you know,
uh,

2761
02:01:35,330 --> 02:01:38,430
of nobel prize winning and science and
intellectual ism,

2762
02:01:38,431 --> 02:01:41,990
not because they're obviously,
but because they just were reading that

2763
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:42,824
whole time.

2764
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:45,140
And there'S a reason for the idea of
jewish greek too,

2765
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:46,041
is that,
you know,

2766
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:47,540
about this is,
is that,

2767
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:50,900
you know,
jesus said somethinG about usury.

2768
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:55,250
Basically,
catholics were not okay with a lending

2769
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:58,370
money at interest,
at an interest rate that was against the

2770
02:01:58,371 --> 02:01:59,270
rules,
right?

2771
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,860
And,
uh,

2772
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:02,840
so you're not going to lend people money
for no interest.

2773
02:02:02,841 --> 02:02:05,870
That's just not how it works.
And then there were some people that

2774
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:09,590
weren't subject to the rules of
christian anti usury laws and those were

2775
02:02:09,591 --> 02:02:12,230
the jews.
And so the jews would lend you money at

2776
02:02:12,231 --> 02:02:14,990
an interest rate.
But who do you hate more than anybody on

2777
02:02:14,991 --> 02:02:16,580
earth?
Who is the person you wish you were

2778
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:17,930
dead?
Your creditor.

2779
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:21,320
You're the banker that is going to
foreclose on your home and is going to.

2780
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:24,230
Now I'm not saying that's good or bad.
I also hate the banker,

2781
02:02:24,231 --> 02:02:27,490
but that's just historically speaking,
when they called jews moneylenders,

2782
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,420
it's not because jews are like,
oh,

2783
02:02:29,421 --> 02:02:31,430
I'm pernicious and I want to fill this
gap.

2784
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:34,940
It's that nobody else in society would
lend people money.

2785
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:37,460
And so not only were they the creditors
that people hate it,

2786
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:42,080
but they were also the financier's that
made the possibility of european,

2787
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:45,710
you know,
greatness occur because without capital,

2788
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:47,960
without funds,
you can't build a society.

2789
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,410
So,
uh,

2790
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:53,300
that is one of the many reasons that
people have come to hate the jews,

2791
02:02:53,301 --> 02:02:56,840
is that they lent them the money and
that they needed.

2792
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:58,640
And then when it was time to come
collecting,

2793
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:00,440
they'd be like,
fuck this dude.

2794
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:03,740
So fascinating.
We could find the root of certain

2795
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:05,600
prejudices.
Oh yeah,

2796
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:07,250
yeah,
for sure.

2797
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:08,770
That's a good one.
Those,

2798
02:03:08,771 --> 02:03:12,590
those two are very good ones.
Especially the one about being literate.

2799
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:13,670
I mean,
absolutely.

2800
02:03:13,671 --> 02:03:16,760
That makes sense.
I mean that it wasn't until I was like

2801
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:21,761
the 14 hundreds with martin luther that
they distorted translating the bible

2802
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:26,570
into a phonetic alphabet where people
could read it and means stop and think

2803
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:27,260
about that.

2804
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:31,400
It's crazy.
It is what happened with martin luther,

2805
02:03:32,090 --> 02:03:36,980
the reformation and the printing press
with martin luther is the was the

2806
02:03:36,981 --> 02:03:41,981
cracking of the old guard of of society
and finally made demo democratization of

2807
02:03:43,191 --> 02:03:47,210
knowledge available to everybody and you
know that everybody was at a

2808
02:03:47,211 --> 02:03:51,260
disadvantage of historical disadvantage
and the same thing as you can see that

2809
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:54,710
truth in other systems.
That's a system of oppression to.

2810
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:55,300
Yeah,
sure.

2811
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:58,760
That's a systemic oppression where the
clergy wanted to keep information from

2812
02:03:58,761 --> 02:04:01,820
the people so that they could keep them
stupid and keep them under foot.

2813
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:04,070
Yeah,
and those people.

2814
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:08,240
There was a patriarchy there too,
except that the patriarch was god or

2815
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:11,960
papa the pope.
It was really the clergy more than it

2816
02:04:11,961 --> 02:04:14,240
was god.
God wasn't really enforcing these laws,

2817
02:04:14,241 --> 02:04:17,960
but the literal patriarch pope.
That was one of the most problematic

2818
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:21,320
things about martin luther apparently
was that he was telling people,

2819
02:04:21,321 --> 02:04:23,720
you're allowed to interpret what this
means.

2820
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:27,800
You don't have to accept anybody else's
interpretation because they're just men

2821
02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:28,700
as well.
Right?

2822
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:30,440
Those are just human beings
interpretation,

2823
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:34,130
interpreting the word of god,
so if you interpret it to be a different

2824
02:04:34,131 --> 02:04:35,450
thing,
you're allowed to do that.

2825
02:04:35,451 --> 02:04:37,560
And they were like,
what in the fuck is this saying?

2826
02:04:37,790 --> 02:04:38,060
Yeah,

2827
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:40,440
I mean think about how seductive that
must've been for the church.

2828
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:40,861
Like,
oh,

2829
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:43,860
we can just keep the information from
everybody and just tell them anything we

2830
02:04:43,861 --> 02:04:45,860
want.
We'll bAck then also the.

2831
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:50,040
The pope had women.
The pope was allowed to fuck all the

2832
02:04:50,041 --> 02:04:51,720
clergy.
Fuck they were rockstars.

2833
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:55,380
They weren't what we think of now as
these creepy dudes molest children,

2834
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:56,130
right?
No,

2835
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:58,050
they were fucking.
There were.

2836
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:03,810
These were people that had armies.
I mean they called upon the pope when

2837
02:05:03,811 --> 02:05:08,700
gang is con was conquering,
like going over the steps and conquering

2838
02:05:08,701 --> 02:05:11,340
Russia.
They were calling upon the pope and

2839
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:15,810
though the army of rome,
I mean that's literally where he had

2840
02:05:15,811 --> 02:05:18,120
power.
It's very strange when you look at how

2841
02:05:18,121 --> 02:05:22,740
that's changed and now it's become this
weird cabal of odd older gay men,

2842
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:24,600
you think,
what do you think of that's about by the

2843
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:25,230
way,
thank you.

2844
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:28,380
Take people's ability to have sex away
and the only people that are going to

2845
02:05:28,381 --> 02:05:32,610
stay are the people that are creepy and
sexually repressed and there's a few

2846
02:05:32,611 --> 02:05:34,890
that hang in there and they say,
well,

2847
02:05:34,891 --> 02:05:37,230
you know,
maybe I can just go without sex and they

2848
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:41,220
get weirded out and then sex becomes
this horrible taboo thing and of course

2849
02:05:41,221 --> 02:05:45,250
when sex becomes a horrible taboo thing,
then people gravitate towards sex.

2850
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:48,690
She'd take the ability of people to have
sex away from people.

2851
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:52,440
They want to have sex more than they
want anything in life,

2852
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:55,050
right?
It's like a or or is the opposite?

2853
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:56,460
True?
Is it that people are.

2854
02:05:56,490 --> 02:06:01,490
Predators are attracted to a system that
is shrouded in privacy and no sex and

2855
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:03,650
they can,
you know,

2856
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:05,850
they can.
I gueSs the question is like,

2857
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:10,230
do you go in there trying to be holy or
trying to get away from your sexuality

2858
02:06:10,231 --> 02:06:14,460
that then bursts out in this abberant
way or are you an absolute monster that

2859
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:17,880
goes into the clergy to prey on people,
but once it's been established,

2860
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:20,190
maybe both,
but once it's been established,

2861
02:06:20,191 --> 02:06:22,230
that becomes part of the issue because
when you're,

2862
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:25,810
you're also indoctrinating young
children that do get molested by the

2863
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:26,610
priest.

2864
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:29,850
If you have some altar boys and these
priests molesting these kids and they

2865
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:33,480
stay in the system,
the odds of them turning into molesters

2866
02:06:33,481 --> 02:06:35,470
themselves or it's extremely high.
Right?

2867
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:37,140
What do you think,
uh,

2868
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:40,590
why do you think people molest children?
Boy,

2869
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:44,700
I think there's probably a whole host of
reasons for that psychological reasons,

2870
02:06:44,701 --> 02:06:48,270
but I think that a big part of it was
being molested themselves.

2871
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:53,010
There's some enormous percentage of
people who have been molested,

2872
02:06:53,011 --> 02:06:55,860
who turned to become the very thing that
victimized them.

2873
02:06:55,861 --> 02:07:00,160
It's almost like they want to get back
at someone and best way to do the

2874
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:01,140
attack,
the innocent.

2875
02:07:01,141 --> 02:07:04,160
It's the only way you can impart that
same har crazy.

2876
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:06,660
It's insane.
It's also like a kind of weird dark

2877
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:07,650
magic.
It's like,

2878
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:09,660
why are,
why are there a certain percentage of

2879
02:07:09,661 --> 02:07:11,880
human beings that do that?
Kind of the weirdest,

2880
02:07:11,881 --> 02:07:14,940
most abhorrent thing.
Do you hear the,

2881
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:18,650
um,
there's a really interesting radiolab,

2882
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:21,660
I think episode that's basically about
these kids,

2883
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:25,890
this kid who realized that he was a
pedophile,

2884
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:29,820
like he,
that's what he wanted and he realized

2885
02:07:29,821 --> 02:07:33,180
he'd never offended.
Is that a reason why it's a few years

2886
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,410
old,
but he realized he'd never,

2887
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,130
he had never offended.

2888
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,350
And so he went to his mother and was
like,

2889
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:41,740
there's something wrong with me,
like I'm a pedophile or whatever.

2890
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:44,830
It's like a teenager.
And so the mother tried to find

2891
02:07:44,831 --> 02:07:49,831
treatment for him but nobody would treat
him because it's such a deep taboo of

2892
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:53,140
evil that people like,
I don't want to get involved in that.

2893
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:56,530
I don't want to treat you and then have
you offended and then have it come back

2894
02:07:56,531 --> 02:07:59,110
on me.
So basically he'd never offended.

2895
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:04,030
He had these desires and he couldn't get
help and he started this organization

2896
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:09,130
for other people like him that it's like
a support group of pedophiles that have

2897
02:08:09,131 --> 02:08:10,420
never offended.
You can't.

2898
02:08:10,421 --> 02:08:15,340
If you've offended you're not eligible
for a membership in this group and you

2899
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:20,341
can help each other not,
it's like pretty deep in the annals of

2900
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:23,320
like with a weird dark web or whatever,
or I don't know where they find each

2901
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:24,490
other,
but uh,

2902
02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:25,443
it's pretty crazy.

2903
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:27,280
Have you seen the,
there's a,

2904
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:31,460
there's a whole market that's being
developed where they're going to make

2905
02:08:31,730 --> 02:08:35,740
like artificial children on like,
um,

2906
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,730
like a,
like a sex doll,

2907
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,730
like a child sex doll.
And there's this argument that that

2908
02:08:40,731 --> 02:08:44,210
would prevent people from becoming
pederasts.

2909
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:45,960
Wow.
That is crazy.

2910
02:08:45,961 --> 02:08:49,230
Like the ultimate iteration of
teledildonics is that it cures

2911
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:50,693
pedophilia.

2912
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:53,410
Well,
it's the same argument they would use

2913
02:08:53,411 --> 02:08:55,560
towards a anime,
anime,

2914
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:57,610
pedophilia or any,
any sort of,

2915
02:08:57,611 --> 02:08:58,710
um,
you know,

2916
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:03,370
cgi based pedophilia is that.
If you could look at child porn,

2917
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:07,420
that's not real and no one's a victim of
it and your lock yourself in your room,

2918
02:09:07,421 --> 02:09:10,450
you could alleviate your desire to have
this thing,

2919
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:13,670
but maybe that's true.
Problem with that is man,

2920
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:17,410
there's a real argument that that's
feeding your desire to do that because

2921
02:09:17,411 --> 02:09:20,710
that's what happens with men when it
comes to regular pornography.

2922
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:23,480
just what I was going to say,
that would only hold true if it wasn't

2923
02:09:23,481 --> 02:09:26,470
for the fact that you.
If you didn't see something important to

2924
02:09:26,471 --> 02:09:27,304
go,
I got to try that.

2925
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:30,340
I think the problem is we're looking for
a solution like,

2926
02:09:30,341 --> 02:09:31,020
you know,
oh,

2927
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:32,440
there's a fire,
throw water on it.

2928
02:09:32,441 --> 02:09:36,790
There's no like when it comes to people
and thinking especially like sexual

2929
02:09:36,791 --> 02:09:39,460
things and behavioral things,
like a dictum things.

2930
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:40,960
people are messy.

2931
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:43,570
Yeah.
There's a crazy ted talk.

2932
02:09:43,571 --> 02:09:47,320
I think it's a ted talk out there.
This woman who's worked with teenage sex

2933
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:52,321
offenders like her whole career and she
basically says that we think of that.

2934
02:09:55,610 --> 02:09:57,910
It's at least with teenage sex
offenders,

2935
02:09:58,060 --> 02:10:02,020
which is like pedophilia,
teenage on younger pedophilia.

2936
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:07,440
The cure and recidivism rate is,
it's extremely treatable,

2937
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:09,250
right?
Like it's very,

2938
02:10:09,251 --> 02:10:13,330
very treatable,
but we look at that phenomenon as you.

2939
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:16,150
Once you are that you are that forever
and you will always re-offend and

2940
02:10:16,151 --> 02:10:21,130
there's no hope and no going back from
it and it's not statistically that

2941
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:24,340
doesn't hold water and her point is
basically like,

2942
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:29,320
it is easier for us to think of these
people as monsters than to think of them

2943
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:30,910
as sick.
People that could get better if we can

2944
02:10:30,911 --> 02:10:33,770
just say like throw them away.
They'll never be better

2945
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,620
than we can kind of synthesize it into
our brain.

2946
02:10:36,621 --> 02:10:40,300
But in reality these are messy.
Like you said,

2947
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:42,610
even bring that up.
What you just said.

2948
02:10:42,611 --> 02:10:44,300
You're a sympathizer,
right?

2949
02:10:44,830 --> 02:10:47,350
You know that these people are monsters
and I think the idea is that,

2950
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:49,180
you know,
we were talking about spectrums like

2951
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:52,060
there,
like say if you get a 100,000 people,

2952
02:10:52,061 --> 02:10:52,600
right,
what,

2953
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:57,400
how many of those hundred thousand
people feel like they were born into the

2954
02:10:57,401 --> 02:10:59,470
wrong sex?
You know how many,

2955
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:04,210
how many of those 100,000 people have
some bizarre sexual attraction to body

2956
02:11:04,211 --> 02:11:09,211
parts or to a underage people or to
older people,

2957
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:10,600
you know,
vulnerable people.

2958
02:11:10,601 --> 02:11:14,440
There'S,
there's a bunch and what causes those

2959
02:11:14,441 --> 02:11:16,870
things,
but there's a host of different reasons,

2960
02:11:17,290 --> 02:11:21,040
but it's so messy and so complicated for
people to defend,

2961
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:23,270
especially to defend pedophilia in any
way.

2962
02:11:23,850 --> 02:11:25,020
It's a radioactive.
Yeah.

2963
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,380
You want to kill those people.
That's it.

2964
02:11:26,381 --> 02:11:27,640
That solution is killam,
killam,

2965
02:11:27,641 --> 02:11:28,400
black and white.

2966
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:29,630
It makes sense.
Yeah.

2967
02:11:29,690 --> 02:11:33,410
Everybody in this,
in this makes every player in this story

2968
02:11:33,411 --> 02:11:35,810
makes sense where it doesn't make sense.
History.

2969
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:36,831
Oh,
right.

2970
02:11:36,831 --> 02:11:38,180
Because they used to have different
views of.

2971
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:41,120
It doesn't make sense that everybody
that was like,

2972
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,350
you know,
he goes,

2973
02:11:42,370 --> 02:11:43,940
socrates,
plato.

2974
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:46,440
I mean you go through the line.
They were all monSters,

2975
02:11:46,441 --> 02:11:49,030
so it was their quote.
I've never been able to verify it's

2976
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:49,873
real,
but the.

2977
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:52,820
They say the persian said a woman for
duty,

2978
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:55,370
a boy for pleasure and a melon for
ecstasy.

2979
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:59,300
Lou melon,
fuck a melonite gets.

2980
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:02,260
They fucked him on it because it tastes
good.

2981
02:12:02,261 --> 02:12:04,060
That's ecstasy because it lived in the
desert.

2982
02:12:04,150 --> 02:12:05,740
I'm pretty sure they fucked a melon.
jesus,

2983
02:12:05,741 --> 02:12:07,750
why would you fuck a melon?
It's hard on the outside.

2984
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:10,480
I think that would change your dick.
That doeSn't seem like a good move.

2985
02:12:10,481 --> 02:12:12,580
Unless she likes bevel the edges.
That's my fourth.

2986
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:14,370
My fourth special.
Don't fuck them.

2987
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:19,790
Melon
melon for ccs.

2988
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:25,300
Oh wow.
That's so strange.

2989
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:26,380
Yeah,
I mean that's a.

2990
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:29,530
I mean that's what people said that have
gone over to Afghanistan to write.

2991
02:12:29,770 --> 02:12:32,560
A lot of soldiers have said that runs
rampant over there.

2992
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:35,950
Right?
And that child sexual abuse can child

2993
02:12:35,951 --> 02:12:38,590
dolls keep pedophiles from offending?
One man thinks so.

2994
02:12:38,591 --> 02:12:40,930
He's been manufacturing them for clients
for more than 10 years.

2995
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:42,610
Is there any images of these things?

2996
02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:46,620
Is it going to show it online?
But I could show you guys if you could

2997
02:12:46,770 --> 02:12:47,571
show us.
No,

2998
02:12:47,571 --> 02:12:49,040
thank you.
You don't want to see.

2999
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:49,903
No,
I'll see.

3000
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:52,460
I just want to be on record saying no
thank you.

3001
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:57,140
Roll up to the website.
That's the japanese had to translate it.

3002
02:12:57,290 --> 02:12:58,400
Here we go.
Oh boy.

3003
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:00,230
English.
To get a tor browser.

3004
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,430
Oh
boy.

3005
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:05,600
Okay.
All right.

3006
02:13:05,630 --> 02:13:07,610
Wow.
That's weird.

3007
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:08,930
They're fucked up,
man.

3008
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:13,790
You just got racist as fuck.
Forget about your cultural mean the

3009
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:14,441
dolls.
Oh,

3010
02:13:14,441 --> 02:13:16,030
you mean the japanese.
Wait,

3011
02:13:16,031 --> 02:13:17,900
what did I do?
You said they're fucked up.

3012
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:20,420
They are to mean the japanese.
But do you mean.

3013
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:25,000
Oh no,
I meant the judge not so silently do

3014
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:25,863
this,
this,

3015
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,500
this.
Let's turn this off.

3016
02:13:27,501 --> 02:13:29,240
Especially as a guy with daughters.
I'm not really.

3017
02:13:29,241 --> 02:13:30,160
Yeah,
that's a.

3018
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:32,070
I don't have daughters.
Can you throw it back

3019
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,070
up?
Actually wrote back.

3020
02:13:33,170 --> 02:13:34,830
That's how that's going to have a son
either

3021
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:39,360
do any melons.
MelonS up there.

3022
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:44,420
It's what we're looking at about 10.
It looks like maybe younger even.

3023
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:46,143
I,
uh,

3024
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:48,090
that was disturbing.
Um,

3025
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:50,340
man.
And the ideas that somehow or another

3026
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:53,280
that's going to be able to stop people
from molesting kids by fucking that

3027
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:58,200
rubber doll or is it going to charge up
their desires even further?

3028
02:13:58,220 --> 02:13:58,560
I,
yeah,

3029
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,790
that's a crazy.
I don't know.

3030
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:00,930
I have no way.
No way to.

3031
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:02,760
I wouldn't want to fuck a dog by the
way.

3032
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:05,760
That's the number one argument against
pornography.

3033
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,560
Pornography rather.
Prostitution.

3034
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:11,790
Number one argument that I've ever heard
against it because I feel like a grown

3035
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:13,560
woman,
she'd be like,

3036
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:15,780
there's all sorts of levels of
prostitution,

3037
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,760
like here's the level,
here's,

3038
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:21,270
here's an acceptable level.
A woman who likes to give massages.

3039
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:25,110
Say if you're a woman and you're a
massage therapist and you have a select

3040
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:27,510
group of clients and you enjoy giving
those men massages,

3041
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,360
you're giving them some sort of physical
pleasure with their body.

3042
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:35,010
You can have the same sort of deal with
a bunch of people and give them sex,

3043
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:35,730
right?
Sure.

3044
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:38,580
And that's all it is.
It's just a in you like them.

3045
02:14:38,581 --> 02:14:40,050
They're your friends.
You hugged them,

3046
02:14:40,051 --> 02:14:42,280
they give you some money and you're.
Thank you.

3047
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:44,340
We'll see you next tuesday.
You gonna keep your tuesday appointment.

3048
02:14:44,341 --> 02:14:44,981
Yeah,
yeah.

3049
02:14:44,981 --> 02:14:47,020
I'll see you tuesday.
The guy looks forward to tuesday,

3050
02:14:47,021 --> 02:14:48,870
caesar on tuesday.
They get together.

3051
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:49,590
She,
you know,

3052
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:52,230
she gives him a backrub.
She light some candles.

3053
02:14:52,231 --> 02:14:53,610
They have sex.
He gives her money.

3054
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:56,820
That's to me,
that's a victimless crime.

3055
02:14:56,821 --> 02:15:00,690
One hundred percent,
but then you get into the idea of sex

3056
02:15:00,691 --> 02:15:03,690
slaves.
You get into the idea of indenture child

3057
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:06,270
sex slaves and there's actually a
crazier argument.

3058
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:09,120
I'm not crazy,
but more a more even more compelling

3059
02:15:09,121 --> 02:15:12,090
argument for the moral good of
prostitution,

3060
02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:15,990
which is that there are these
prostitutes that only sleep with a

3061
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:18,640
severely disabled people.
Yeah,

3062
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:21,180
and I heard this radio special on.
It was very interesting.

3063
02:15:21,181 --> 02:15:23,560
This guy,
he himself was a radio producer but also

3064
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:27,330
had lou gehrig's disease and he said
it's very similar to pedophiles.

3065
02:15:27,331 --> 02:15:31,350
Actually.
We like to think of disabled people as

3066
02:15:31,351 --> 02:15:34,290
having no sex drive as when they became
disabled.

3067
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:37,800
Their sex drive's were disabled as well,
and the reason we like to think of it

3068
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:39,770
similarly,
we like to think a pedophiles as

3069
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:43,200
monsters because that simplifies.
That is it's nice for us to think of

3070
02:15:43,201 --> 02:15:46,560
disabled people like not having
horniness because they can't get laid.

3071
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:49,920
I mean if we're being frank,
there are certain levels of disability

3072
02:15:49,921 --> 02:15:51,900
that it's very difficult to find a
partner,

3073
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:52,501
you know,
you're,

3074
02:15:52,501 --> 02:15:55,590
you're intense to look at or you're
drooling all over yourself,

3075
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,990
but you're still just as horny as every
other person.

3076
02:15:58,230 --> 02:16:02,010
So there was this radio special of the
sex workers that go and they fuck or

3077
02:16:02,011 --> 02:16:06,460
jerk-off these severely disabled people
who are so they are so disabled they

3078
02:16:06,461 --> 02:16:09,210
can't even masturbate.
And it's like,

3079
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:12,200
I heard that and I was just like,
I went from going like it.

3080
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:15,000
Prostitution is something I sort of
agree with to like,

3081
02:16:15,150 --> 02:16:18,210
these people are heroes.
These are like miracle workers.

3082
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,820
Yeah.
I mean it's not a whole lot different

3083
02:16:20,821 --> 02:16:23,760
than massaging those people that,
you know,

3084
02:16:23,761 --> 02:16:25,860
uh,
one of the key,

3085
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:27,690
I don't know if you've ever heard of
rolfing,

3086
02:16:27,691 --> 02:16:29,980
you've heard.
so one of the best

3087
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,420
therapies for injuries to recover,
it breaks up fascia and it's really

3088
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:37,000
brutal.
Deep tissue massage that doesn't feel

3089
02:16:37,001 --> 02:16:38,080
good at all.
It's a very painful,

3090
02:16:38,210 --> 02:16:41,070
a massage inside of your mouth and your
nose to do that.

3091
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,460
There's like a ralph 10 and one of the
10,

3092
02:16:43,530 --> 02:16:47,940
the 10 different treatments.
And one of the 10 is the soft palate of

3093
02:16:47,941 --> 02:16:50,160
your mouth inside of your nos inside
your nose.

3094
02:16:50,220 --> 02:16:51,870
Wow.
It's real intense.

3095
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:53,730
Why do they do that?
I don't know.

3096
02:16:53,910 --> 02:16:56,610
Some theory.
I don't know if I'm going to fucking

3097
02:16:56,611 --> 02:16:59,190
just go on a theory and let you stick a
rod up my nose.

3098
02:16:59,191 --> 02:17:01,170
I know that it's their fingers.

3099
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,450
Oh,
come on.

3100
02:17:02,451 --> 02:17:03,940
You're not even supposed to pick your
nose,

3101
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:05,150
you know.
Well,

3102
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:07,910
you're talking to a guy who's had nasal
surgery because my nose was broken so

3103
02:17:07,911 --> 02:17:10,310
many times.
I've deviated septum surgery where they

3104
02:17:10,311 --> 02:17:14,300
went in and they had a cut parts of my
nose out that calcified.

3105
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:17,200
Oh jesus.
They're going to this gala.

3106
02:17:18,850 --> 02:17:22,790
Our structural integration knows work
for insight.

3107
02:17:23,780 --> 02:17:25,840
Yo,
that visual.

3108
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:28,250
Yeah.
I think that's some asshole that wants

3109
02:17:28,251 --> 02:17:30,980
to stick their finger up.
Your nose doesn't make any sense.

3110
02:17:31,130 --> 02:17:33,200
Nasal doctors tell you not to pick your
nose.

3111
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:37,010
Cause infections.
It's very close to the bloodstream.

3112
02:17:37,011 --> 02:17:40,150
The thIn,
the skin is very thin on the inside of

3113
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:41,720
the nose.
That's why picking your nose is

3114
02:17:41,721 --> 02:17:44,660
dangerous because you can get infections
and infection goes right to your

3115
02:17:44,661 --> 02:17:47,490
bloodstream and straight to your brain.
Yeah.

3116
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:48,950
Um,
uh,

3117
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:49,700
we started.
Oh,

3118
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:52,130
so rolfing.
So like what they do is,

3119
02:17:52,131 --> 02:17:55,280
I'm ida rolf,
the woman who invented rolfing.

3120
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:56,173
I think that's her name.

3121
02:17:56,820 --> 02:17:58,500
No,
it's really a dog from the muppets.

3122
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:01,740
I don't think that's off the dog.
I don't think the piano player.

3123
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:02,850
No,
it's not the same role.

3124
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:04,231
Okay.
All right,

3125
02:18:04,231 --> 02:18:06,690
go ahead.
I think the woman invented it because

3126
02:18:06,691 --> 02:18:11,460
her son had cerebral palsy and was one
of the best ways to alleviate some of

3127
02:18:11,461 --> 02:18:16,260
his mess muscle issues was this intense
form of manipulation because he'd become

3128
02:18:16,261 --> 02:18:21,090
so bound up by his disease that she had
figured out a way to loosen up the

3129
02:18:21,091 --> 02:18:25,680
tissue so they had more range of motion.
I found some great relief with that

3130
02:18:25,681 --> 02:18:27,470
stuff,
but it's ruthlessly pain.

3131
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:29,290
Yeah.
I've had some rolfing done to.

3132
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:29,840
It's,
it's,

3133
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,570
it's nice,
but it's also awful.

3134
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:33,850
it's great in its result.
But man,

3135
02:18:33,851 --> 02:18:37,090
it's brutal.
I wanted to make one final point about

3136
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:41,140
that because I think I figured out how
to make my cultural appropriation point.

3137
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:43,540
Uh,
I don't want to take us back too far,

3138
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:47,620
but I think what we're,
what we're doing is like we came to a

3139
02:18:47,621 --> 02:18:50,890
good place with a dislike.
What we're talking about.

3140
02:18:50,891 --> 02:18:51,880
It's all about language,
right?

3141
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:54,420
So cultural appropriation,
your immediate reaction is that's

3142
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,830
absurd.
And some of the examples people use is

3143
02:18:56,831 --> 02:18:58,020
absurd,
but the,

3144
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:00,640
the underneath the racism is just,
we're talking about racial

3145
02:19:00,650 --> 02:19:02,950
insensitivity,
we're talking about being sensitive and

3146
02:19:02,951 --> 02:19:07,090
if you try to just focus on that,
then you can get to like other reality

3147
02:19:07,091 --> 02:19:09,580
of what's happening.
And the original point I wanted to make

3148
02:19:09,581 --> 02:19:13,780
waS in this article I read about it,
it said that we often get locked on

3149
02:19:13,781 --> 02:19:18,300
these linguistic,
the boat that the concept floats in on

3150
02:19:18,310 --> 02:19:19,180
the absurd boat.

3151
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:21,520
So like black lives matter is the
ultimate example you gave.

3152
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:23,050
I just thought this was such a
fascinating point,

3153
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:28,220
is like black lives matter is the name
of the organization that is there to

3154
02:19:28,221 --> 02:19:31,610
fight against police brutality and
killing of black kids.

3155
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,520
Right?
And people react to the words,

3156
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:36,110
right?
So people go,

3157
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:37,430
what are you talking about?
Black lives matter.

3158
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:39,170
All lives matter.
Blue lives matter.

3159
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:44,150
And basically if you.
You don't acknowledge that it's black

3160
02:19:44,151 --> 02:19:46,370
lives matter too,
which is really obvious,

3161
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:48,650
right?
You're fighting about the words black

3162
02:19:48,651 --> 02:19:50,870
lives matter where we haven't been
talking.

3163
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:54,950
You've left the foundation principle
behind like a long time ago,

3164
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:56,870
which is police brutality.
No one's even talking about police

3165
02:19:56,871 --> 02:19:58,550
brutality anymore.
Now they're just talking about the

3166
02:19:58,551 --> 02:20:00,440
language that you chose to call your
group.

3167
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,590
So at any rate,
I think that was the thing I was trying

3168
02:20:03,591 --> 02:20:04,424
to say.

3169
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:05,630
Make sense?
Look,

3170
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:10,130
all of it makes sense.
If what is going on is people are being

3171
02:20:10,131 --> 02:20:11,550
racist,
right?

3172
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:15,960
If someone is doing something for racial
and appropriation or sex or culture and

3173
02:20:15,961 --> 02:20:20,030
appropriation at the heart of it
involves racial insensitivity,

3174
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:20,660
racist

3175
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:23,150
insensitivity,
but there's a difference,

3176
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,620
right?
Racist.

3177
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:28,310
Theoretically,
racist is an.

3178
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:29,990
Again,
racism is a word that doesn't have a lot

3179
02:20:29,991 --> 02:20:33,980
of use anymore either because you
described the same phenomenon of you

3180
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:35,600
saying too,
like your black friend.

3181
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:38,360
Like wow,
I didn't expect you to be so articulate.

3182
02:20:38,390 --> 02:20:39,510
You mean well,
right.

3183
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:44,420
You mean you're trying to be polite or.
I don't like black people there.

3184
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:46,340
They're bad.
These are the same.

3185
02:20:46,430 --> 02:20:48,320
It's the same word to describe both of
those things.

3186
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:50,940
Right.
So in sensitivity is,

3187
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:54,650
is not overt.
An aggressive racism.

3188
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:55,573
Yeah,
I think,

3189
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:56,630
yeah,
yeah,

3190
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:58,430
yeah.
It's insensitive.

3191
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:00,800
It's insensitive.
Racism.

3192
02:21:01,010 --> 02:21:03,980
Like you're not being sensitive to the
possibility that you're saying something

3193
02:21:03,981 --> 02:21:06,060
offensive or just doing something
boringly dump.

3194
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,360
Now I agree with you.
The logic is more important than that

3195
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:11,080
the nap.
But I think you know,

3196
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:14,390
the more aware we can all be about how
to not be a dick.

3197
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:15,513
Yeah.

3198
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:17,880
It's like people want to say,
you know,

3199
02:21:17,881 --> 02:21:20,370
you could never have all in the family
on tv today.

3200
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:23,070
Could you imagine people would go crazy.
Well,

3201
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:27,060
that's because we moved past that.
I mean that's what's going on.

3202
02:21:27,061 --> 02:21:30,120
What's going on is there's a process and
one of the things is disturbing to

3203
02:21:30,121 --> 02:21:35,121
people about trump and what's disturbing
to people about this new freedom to mock

3204
02:21:36,481 --> 02:21:40,050
jews are appointed them as the root of
all evil and then it's much more open

3205
02:21:40,051 --> 02:21:42,960
than it's been before,
is that we thought we got through that

3206
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:48,050
and then slowly but surely the
demonization of individual groups and in

3207
02:21:48,871 --> 02:21:53,610
terms of like who are the bad guys and
who are the good guys and instead having

3208
02:21:53,611 --> 02:21:58,611
it been boiled down to activities and
behaviors and individual human beings

3209
02:21:58,981 --> 02:22:03,270
that have the problem.
Not giant groups of people that believe

3210
02:22:03,271 --> 02:22:06,600
in one god versus another god,
which is what it's been historically.

3211
02:22:06,630 --> 02:22:09,750
Right.
The idea is that as time goes on and as

3212
02:22:09,751 --> 02:22:13,020
people like my people,
the italians become so integrated that

3213
02:22:13,021 --> 02:22:16,020
you can't be racist about us anymore.
It doesn't work.

3214
02:22:16,050 --> 02:22:16,850
Right?
Totally.

3215
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:18,420
I mean,
it really doesn't work.

3216
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,280
It's one of the best examples of it.

3217
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:22,730
Totally.
It's fascinating because there's so many

3218
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:24,470
things that are there still and you're
like,

3219
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:26,220
they don't have any charge or power

3220
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:27,270
any longer.
Not only that,

3221
02:22:27,271 --> 02:22:29,190
there's so much gross behavior by
italian.

3222
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:31,990
It just goes unchecked,
you know,

3223
02:22:31,991 --> 02:22:34,530
and I think the sopranos is probably
responsible for a lot of that.

3224
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:38,520
I was in Italy last year and I was
walking home real late at night and I

3225
02:22:38,521 --> 02:22:41,280
saw this guy,
he's got his girlfriend up against the

3226
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:44,790
car and he's fucking like going off on
her and I'm like this little like

3227
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:48,030
liberal american boy,
like is somebody going to call the

3228
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:50,080
police?
And then I kind of stood there for a

3229
02:22:50,081 --> 02:22:53,290
while longer and he's screaming in her
face and then I just look for about like

3230
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:54,270
two or three minutes.
I go,

3231
02:22:54,750 --> 02:22:56,250
oh,
this is just some italian shit.

3232
02:22:58,110 --> 02:23:01,610
I just walked home.
I like realize like,

3233
02:23:01,611 --> 02:23:02,670
oh,
there's nothing happening here.

3234
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:03,680
Oh yeah.
They used to.

3235
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:05,440
That's what they used to do,
you know?

3236
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:06,510
And they still do it over there.

3237
02:23:06,510 --> 02:23:08,190
When I was over there,
my driver,

3238
02:23:08,191 --> 02:23:13,050
we had this cab driver and this
motherfucker was a cartoon.

3239
02:23:13,290 --> 02:23:15,420
Oh,
he was driving and driving like a

3240
02:23:15,421 --> 02:23:16,710
maniac.
And then he would pause.

3241
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,840
oh mama mia,
look at this girl's ass.

3242
02:23:18,841 --> 02:23:21,780
And no,
Italy iS so italian.

3243
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:23,700
It,
there are parts of how italian it is.

3244
02:23:23,701 --> 02:23:27,510
That will boggle your mind like a dude
smoking a cigarette on a vest.

3245
02:23:27,511 --> 02:23:31,350
But with a girl sitting sideways and
everything is like the most italian

3246
02:23:31,351 --> 02:23:32,810
thing you could ever imagine.
Yeah.

3247
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:36,000
It's,
it's funny because I went there with my

3248
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:38,010
family and my wife was like,
oh,

3249
02:23:38,011 --> 02:23:42,480
so this is where you get your shit for
like from a group of eight people.

3250
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:44,790
Uh,
Italy is the best.

3251
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:46,440
Yeah.
The best place,

3252
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:48,730
it's fun.
We went to the mall fee coast.

3253
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:50,940
I'm all for incredible,
so good.

3254
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:52,350
So pretty.
Doesn't even look real.

3255
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:53,580
It's,
it's insane.

3256
02:23:53,581 --> 02:23:56,520
I mean Italy is like a jewel box.
It just everything.

3257
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:59,250
any further into it you go.
The more pretty good heard.

3258
02:23:59,251 --> 02:24:01,480
CecIly is really beautiful too.
I never went on.

3259
02:24:01,490 --> 02:24:04,920
I haven't even either.
I went up to tuscany and I drove all

3260
02:24:04,921 --> 02:24:08,910
through there and me and natasha found
like this bath cities,

3261
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:11,500
these cities where the romans would come
to bay.

3262
02:24:11,501 --> 02:24:12,271
Then it was like,
you know,

3263
02:24:12,271 --> 02:24:15,330
every time italian city has like a town
square,

3264
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:20,870
this had a town pool in the center of it
and it was so cool and weird and there

3265
02:24:21,001 --> 02:24:25,680
was this big old mountain like mound of
sulphuric residue.

3266
02:24:25,681 --> 02:24:30,681
This like soft white mountain gets
called theosophy fossil bianco and it's

3267
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:33,220
just big white mountain of like soft,
chalky,

3268
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,370
sulphuric residue that the,
the,

3269
02:24:35,410 --> 02:24:39,810
the like the soda water has been fallen
on it for so long that it's carved these

3270
02:24:39,811 --> 02:24:43,050
pools into it and they're like little
hot tubs that you can get into on this

3271
02:24:43,051 --> 02:24:45,510
mountain and italy's bananas.

3272
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:48,360
Wow.
We wanted to go to,

3273
02:24:48,361 --> 02:24:50,490
um,
what's the place where the volcano went

3274
02:24:50,491 --> 02:24:52,740
off and everybody does stromboli oh,
a pump,

3275
02:24:52,741 --> 02:24:55,620
a pump a I wanted to go to,
but we never got around to it.

3276
02:24:55,621 --> 02:24:57,570
I thought that would have been
fascinating to see what these people

3277
02:24:57,571 --> 02:25:01,710
just hanging out and all of a sudden
lava and ash covered everybody and

3278
02:25:01,711 --> 02:25:03,600
they've frozen their tracks.
Died.

3279
02:25:03,601 --> 02:25:06,150
Their pumping is a wild place for sure.
You know,

3280
02:25:06,210 --> 02:25:08,790
It's um,
it's also interesting to go to europe

3281
02:25:08,791 --> 02:25:10,800
because you realize how old everything
is.

3282
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:11,820
oh,
these,

3283
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:14,220
this culture's been around for thousands
of years here.

3284
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,740
Will brings us back to the beginning,
which is the roman empire.

3285
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:19,780
It's just like,
you look at the artifice,

3286
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:24,610
the residue of the all the hugest
society

3287
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:26,760
that has ever existed mean the coliseum
they,

3288
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:30,490
they made.
They killed so many animals for sport.

3289
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:35,520
They put certain animals out of business
like they extincted some animals.

3290
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:37,630
Really?
which ones?

3291
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:38,860
I don't know.
They don't,

3292
02:25:38,890 --> 02:25:42,340
they don't have them anymore,
But like certain kinds of animals that

3293
02:25:42,341 --> 02:25:43,600
they would important,
important,

3294
02:25:43,601 --> 02:25:44,350
important.
They're just like,

3295
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:46,450
yeah,
we killed them all just for sport.

3296
02:25:46,530 --> 02:25:49,720
It's not for any other reasons.
When we were in the coliseum,

3297
02:25:49,721 --> 02:25:51,850
they were explaining where the,
um,

3298
02:25:52,090 --> 02:25:54,880
they had those elevators.
It would take the animals up from the

3299
02:25:54,881 --> 02:25:58,750
ground floor and open the floor up and
then the animals would pop through and

3300
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:01,510
they would do battle with them,
but they were talking about how they had

3301
02:26:01,511 --> 02:26:05,590
to raise up the side of the fences
because the lower levels,

3302
02:26:05,591 --> 02:26:07,450
we're,
all the rich people sat larry and they

3303
02:26:07,451 --> 02:26:08,800
were getting jacked by lions.

3304
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:13,000
The lions figured out how to jump up and
get the people that were at the top.

3305
02:26:13,001 --> 02:26:14,770
Fuck yeah.
We needed to get some lines back to get

3306
02:26:14,771 --> 02:26:17,110
those billionaires with their yachts and
just eat them.

3307
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:19,090
Yeah.
How much money do you have to have to

3308
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:22,120
put one point $5.
Billion of it into a boat.

3309
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:24,550
So crazy.
I had a friend who bought a boat for

3310
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:27,760
like $60,000 and he took her for one
ride,

3311
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:30,220
crashed into the pier,
put it in the garage for two years and

3312
02:26:30,221 --> 02:26:33,880
then sold it for 20,000.
So he took a $40,000 boat ride.

3313
02:26:34,050 --> 02:26:35,680
Oh,
jesus christ.

3314
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:37,120
Yeah.
That's what they say,

3315
02:26:37,121 --> 02:26:40,300
it's a hole in the water where you pour
money into right now,

3316
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:45,540
but if you like to fish it.
The cool thing about boats is that when

3317
02:26:45,881 --> 02:26:46,361
you,
like,

3318
02:26:46,361 --> 02:26:47,650
if you save,
you have something,

3319
02:26:47,651 --> 02:26:49,810
you'd go out,
marina del rey in,

3320
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:51,520
you just go out into the water.

3321
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:53,980
You could kind of go wherever the fuck
you want.

3322
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:55,960
Like there's no road.
Right?

3323
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:58,200
But you can go where it's,
but you know,

3324
02:26:58,201 --> 02:27:02,230
it's all water so you can go left and
right and as long as you don't hit an

3325
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:04,630
island you can kind of do whatever the
fuck you want.

3326
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:06,520
Did you see that maiden voyage
documentary?

3327
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:10,720
Was that it's about this 14 year old or
16 year old girl that sales around the

3328
02:27:10,721 --> 02:27:12,190
world by herself.
Oh yeah,

3329
02:27:12,191 --> 02:27:14,100
I heard about that.
So interesting.

3330
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:17,680
Who the fuck are her parents?
I mean there are some northern european

3331
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:20,100
danish,
like previous events,

3332
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:22,480
white people,
white people that don't have poverty.

3333
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:25,650
That's
poverty.

3334
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:28,270
I mentioned that call when you land,
you should get some poverty.

3335
02:27:28,271 --> 02:27:30,430
Actually that'll give you a little bit
more to do with your life.

3336
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:32,710
Well,
you gotta think that the negative

3337
02:27:32,711 --> 02:27:37,210
aspects of certain societies do create
some sort of a rebound effect from those

3338
02:27:37,211 --> 02:27:38,050
negative aspects.
No,

3339
02:27:38,051 --> 02:27:39,640
shit.
They didn't make rock and roll in

3340
02:27:39,641 --> 02:27:42,070
Sweden.
They didn't make hip hop and fucking

3341
02:27:42,071 --> 02:27:43,270
Denmark.
That's right.

3342
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:47,260
They didn't make all these like
vaudeville and standup comedy.

3343
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:50,790
I mean this all came from people of
oppression and that's why about

3344
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:51,790
yourself.
Yeah.

3345
02:27:51,791 --> 02:27:55,120
I mean thinking about like you growing
up with a deaf mom being poor and all

3346
02:27:55,121 --> 02:27:59,410
that craziness that you went through and
you're a kid like that kind of all that.

3347
02:28:01,970 --> 02:28:05,020
It pushes something through.
It's totally true.

3348
02:28:05,380 --> 02:28:06,101
Yeah.
I wouldn't.

3349
02:28:06,101 --> 02:28:09,010
I wouldn't go back and have been raised.
Are rich with normal parents?

3350
02:28:09,011 --> 02:28:10,420
Not for a million dollars.
No way.

3351
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:11,830
No,
not now.

3352
02:28:11,890 --> 02:28:14,560
Once you've already done it,
but I w I wouldn't have wanted it to

3353
02:28:14,561 --> 02:28:17,620
have been done in a different way.
I like the trauma will also,

3354
02:28:17,621 --> 02:28:20,710
you know that you made you,
well a lot of people helped you,

3355
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:23,750
but you made yourself.
Whereas if your parents were trump,

3356
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:27,380
you know,
or your parents were the rockefellers or

3357
02:28:27,381 --> 02:28:30,620
whatever,
and they gave you this monthly stipend.

3358
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:32,540
No.
Fuck man.

3359
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:34,460
Who are you then?
Who is trump?

3360
02:28:34,461 --> 02:28:36,530
He's the same.
He's the same version.

3361
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:40,610
He started from nothing.
I mean he started from $2 million from 2

3362
02:28:40,610 --> 02:28:43,700
million bucks from his father who was
one of the richest people in upstate New

3363
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,660
York.
And now who is he?

3364
02:28:44,900 --> 02:28:47,810
Is he.
What is he like when the lights are off?

3365
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:51,020
I wish I could have a fucking a feed of
trump's brain.

3366
02:28:51,021 --> 02:28:53,150
When the lights go down,
it's probably chaos.

3367
02:28:53,210 --> 02:28:54,440
What is he thinking?
Is he like,

3368
02:28:54,441 --> 02:28:55,730
I'm killing it,
or is he like,

3369
02:28:55,731 --> 02:28:58,280
what have I done?
I think there's got to be both.

3370
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:00,650
Yeah,
he's got to be a.

3371
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:01,550
Well,
he doesn't drink.

3372
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,670
He doesn't do drugs.
Right.

3373
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:06,350
And I think there's got to be a part of
his brain that's pushing down the what

3374
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:09,050
have I done?
And reinforcing,

3375
02:29:09,051 --> 02:29:12,380
doubling down on the I'm the greatest.
I'm the best.

3376
02:29:12,770 --> 02:29:14,480
I mean,
that's why I kept saying about his

3377
02:29:14,481 --> 02:29:17,120
inauguration.
Numbers are so many people were there

3378
02:29:17,121 --> 02:29:20,120
and even when they told him that it
wasn't the case,

3379
02:29:20,121 --> 02:29:22,610
he fought it.
Then when he kept parenting,

3380
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:26,000
not just parenting to friends but doing
it to the news,

3381
02:29:26,001 --> 02:29:30,290
doing it to the press that he got the
largest number of electoral college

3382
02:29:30,291 --> 02:29:31,124
votes.

3383
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:34,670
That's crazy.
It's psychedelic narcissism.

3384
02:29:34,850 --> 02:29:38,090
It's like it's so far out there.
It starts to seem like,

3385
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:41,150
whoa,
you're bending reality and actually is

3386
02:29:41,151 --> 02:29:42,590
bending reality.
He's done.

3387
02:29:42,830 --> 02:29:47,570
He's done a fascinating job of just
making people not know what's real

3388
02:29:47,571 --> 02:29:50,930
anymore and no one knows what's real
anymore and Syria as the ultimate

3389
02:29:50,931 --> 02:29:53,840
example because it's unclear what
Israel.

3390
02:29:53,841 --> 02:29:56,150
They're like,
no one knows what the right thing to do

3391
02:29:56,151 --> 02:29:58,100
is.
Who are we attacking and why?

3392
02:29:58,101 --> 02:30:00,420
What are we trying to stop?
You sent bombs,

3393
02:30:00,421 --> 02:30:03,740
so the people that are fighting isis to
fight those people from doing chemical

3394
02:30:03,741 --> 02:30:06,860
warfare on their own people,
but then we also were fighting isis with

3395
02:30:06,861 --> 02:30:08,960
them and then it's just the whole thing.
You're just like,

3396
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:13,130
I give up you ron.
Paul was saying that the chemical attack

3397
02:30:13,131 --> 02:30:16,970
doesn't make sense,
so certain certain republicans are

3398
02:30:16,971 --> 02:30:18,410
actually looking at ms dot ron paul.

3399
02:30:18,410 --> 02:30:20,720
Technically republicans more libertarian
than anything,

3400
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:23,230
but they're looking at it and saying
like this.

3401
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:25,700
This might not even been real.
I mean,

3402
02:30:25,970 --> 02:30:28,700
I just.
I heard this great thing about how no

3403
02:30:28,701 --> 02:30:31,520
one in Israel believes that rabin was
killed by yigal amir,

3404
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:33,460
the jewish guy like that.
They,

3405
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:37,820
they believe in that.
Basically hearing a conspiracy theory

3406
02:30:37,821 --> 02:30:42,821
that widely believed in a country that
isn't my own made me realize how wildly

3407
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:46,100
desperate for conspiracy theory everyone
is.

3408
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:48,320
Like somehow the distance where it was
like,

3409
02:30:48,321 --> 02:30:48,851
oh,
it's Israel.

3410
02:30:48,851 --> 02:30:50,690
It's not really me.
Made me go like,

3411
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:52,010
oh,
this is so interesting.

3412
02:30:52,011 --> 02:30:56,030
Like everybody wants to believe it
wasn't one hour until they were saying

3413
02:30:56,031 --> 02:30:58,850
that the chemical attack by assad was
not real.

3414
02:30:58,851 --> 02:31:02,030
Even though assad has done gas based
chemical attacks on his own people

3415
02:31:02,031 --> 02:31:06,080
before and his father did before him.
Somehow this one was like,

3416
02:31:06,450 --> 02:31:06,760
no,
no,

3417
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:07,593
no.
This is fake.

3418
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:10,300
It might be fake.
That's what's so crazy and mind bend

3419
02:31:10,301 --> 02:31:13,460
day.
It might be fake and yet I don't buy any

3420
02:31:13,461 --> 02:31:16,160
conspiracy theories anymore because I
know how desperate people are to believe

3421
02:31:16,161 --> 02:31:16,641
them.
Well,

3422
02:31:16,641 --> 02:31:19,980
this was the same scenario that led
obama

3423
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,420
to make that speech saying that we need
to go into Syria and the whole american

3424
02:31:24,421 --> 02:31:27,540
people went fuck that because we were
deep in the Iraq war,

3425
02:31:27,541 --> 02:31:30,380
deepen the Afghanistan war,
and that was when this,

3426
02:31:30,530 --> 02:31:35,530
I think that was 2013 or 14,
but trump made quotes.

3427
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:40,140
It's crazy that he tweeted like,
what does the us have to gain for going

3428
02:31:40,141 --> 02:31:42,600
into Syria?
We should be America first and then

3429
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:47,090
winds up acting almost instantaneously.
It happens.

3430
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:48,870
People keep dropping these,
like you said,

3431
02:31:48,871 --> 02:31:53,430
this bombs at trump's feet like he cares
about intellectual coherence or

3432
02:31:53,431 --> 02:31:54,630
hypocrisy.
He doesn't care.

3433
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:58,140
He's a fucking brat trapped.
He's trapped in a corner of a maze and

3434
02:31:58,141 --> 02:31:59,970
he's going like,
what the fuck do I do?

3435
02:32:00,050 --> 02:32:00,790
Oh,
I'll just do this.

3436
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:02,190
It's so.
It's so transparent,

3437
02:32:02,191 --> 02:32:07,170
like 35 percent approval rating.
Everything is collapsing under your own

3438
02:32:07,171 --> 02:32:08,790
weight.
You have the house and the senate and

3439
02:32:08,791 --> 02:32:09,780
you can't get anything done.

3440
02:32:09,930 --> 02:32:11,550
No one likes you.
You're the worst,

3441
02:32:11,610 --> 02:32:15,210
so what do you do?
You fucking make something explode.

3442
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:18,960
It's just such a terrible recipe of
something actually goes wrong.

3443
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:22,170
Oh yeah.
Like Syria as a minor issue.

3444
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:23,860
No one died.
Totally bomb.

3445
02:32:23,861 --> 02:32:26,210
Some airfields.
They ruined some.

3446
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:27,950
Some ground.
I agree.

3447
02:32:27,970 --> 02:32:32,520
Ruined some air ships planes.
But what happens if something really

3448
02:32:32,521 --> 02:32:35,190
goes down and that guy is.
That is the figurehead,

3449
02:32:35,370 --> 02:32:40,320
that is the difference between the roman
empire and this empire is that the roman

3450
02:32:40,321 --> 02:32:45,090
empire didn't have the power to press a
button and destroy like half the

3451
02:32:45,091 --> 02:32:48,390
countries on earth and we do.
So that's the scary part.

3452
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:52,200
Come to the comedy store that saturday
night.

3453
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:57,080
Yeah.
Let's wrap it up with depressing.

3454
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:59,910
I'm doing.
I'm doing a show on comedy central.

3455
02:32:59,911 --> 02:33:01,280
I should probably mention.
Yeah,

3456
02:33:01,281 --> 02:33:03,750
you briefly mentioned it earlier,
but tell everybody what it is.

3457
02:33:03,751 --> 02:33:06,470
April 18th we debut.
It's called problematic.

3458
02:33:06,510 --> 02:33:07,830
Yeah.
I'm excited about it.

3459
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:09,840
Why do you call it problematic and why
you look at hitler?

3460
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:14,040
Because iT's problematic.
We're basically.

3461
02:33:14,041 --> 02:33:16,440
I mean it doesn't even look like you.
That's what a weird photo you don't

3462
02:33:16,441 --> 02:33:17,130
think.
I think it's.

3463
02:33:17,130 --> 02:33:19,380
I think I look cute if you do look cute.
Thank you.

3464
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:22,140
Well you look like you're 19 years old
with your mom.

3465
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:24,120
Yeah,
it's still have my deaf mom.

3466
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:27,210
I'm still running embarked trans.
Um,

3467
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:30,060
basically it's a theme.
Every week is a theme of some of the,

3468
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:30,970
you know,
the,

3469
02:33:30,970 --> 02:33:32,820
the undercurrents of society.
We're talking,

3470
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:34,800
we're not talking politics.
We're talking about like the,

3471
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:37,080
the tectonic plates underneath them,
you know,

3472
02:33:37,081 --> 02:33:40,380
so cultural appropriation,
how the internet is changing our brain,

3473
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:41,940
the dark web,
all these kind of like,

3474
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:43,980
you know,
a lot of the fun stuff that you'd like

3475
02:33:43,981 --> 02:33:44,980
to go to to,
you know,

3476
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:46,530
just these big,
big concept,

3477
02:33:46,531 --> 02:33:47,364
big ideas.

3478
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:49,410
And it's like,
it's a talk show where.

3479
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:51,320
Oh.
And the other cool thing is it's very

3480
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:53,640
donahue.
So we'd go out into the audience and let

3481
02:33:53,641 --> 02:33:57,210
people ask questions and get on up and
say their piece.

3482
02:33:57,211 --> 02:33:59,790
And so you do it in front of a live
crowd from the live audience.

3483
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:03,120
And so some of it's done in the field
and then you bring it back and show it

3484
02:34:03,121 --> 02:34:04,160
to the audience.
And like,

3485
02:34:04,170 --> 02:34:06,420
so like we,
this week we're,

3486
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,980
we're doing the how,
the,

3487
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:10,620
how technology is changing us.
We have this guy nick carr that wrote

3488
02:34:10,621 --> 02:34:14,580
the shallows on and um,
and it's a couple of comedians to make

3489
02:34:14,581 --> 02:34:18,010
it fun and funny and uh,
basically,

3490
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:20,500
uh,
every week as a different topic and a,

3491
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:23,230
and we ask a question and hopefully we
get to the bottom of it.

3492
02:34:23,620 --> 02:34:25,630
Did you come on sometimes though?
I will love to.

3493
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:27,580
What do you want me to do?
I don't know yet.

3494
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:29,020
What do you think you would?
Yeah,

3495
02:34:29,021 --> 02:34:31,040
I'll send you some.
I'll send you all the topics and we'll

3496
02:34:31,870 --> 02:34:32,650
figure something out.
Yeah.

3497
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:33,311
Cool.
Yeah,

3498
02:34:33,311 --> 02:34:33,761
it's,
it's,

3499
02:34:33,761 --> 02:34:34,680
uh,
it's perfect for,

3500
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:37,660
it's perfect for people that like this
show because it's like real

3501
02:34:37,661 --> 02:34:40,330
conversations.
It's not like it's an actual.

3502
02:34:40,331 --> 02:34:42,240
I think people are desperate for that.
And I think that's,

3503
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:44,590
I think you,
you were actually kind of ahead of the

3504
02:34:44,591 --> 02:34:48,550
curve on the real conversation thing,
but I think people are like podcasts in

3505
02:34:48,551 --> 02:34:50,950
general are.
I think it's so interesting that we are

3506
02:34:50,951 --> 02:34:55,420
simultaneously like making technology
and entertainment shorter and shorter

3507
02:34:55,421 --> 02:34:59,500
and shorter and shorter and there's
things like your show where there like

3508
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:02,260
two hour episodes.
It's like at the same time people are

3509
02:35:02,261 --> 02:35:04,270
driven to distraction.
They're also like trying to.

3510
02:35:04,570 --> 02:35:07,210
They're desperate to get some depth and
uh,

3511
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:09,850
hopefully this will will find.
Well it just fills a different,

3512
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:12,990
a different void that's a

3513
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,680
available in entertainment,
especially when people are driving.

3514
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:18,180
Like if you're driving for long periods
of time,

3515
02:35:18,181 --> 02:35:20,070
which a lot of people listen to this
right now are doing,

3516
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:21,300
hi everybody.
How you doing?

3517
02:35:21,301 --> 02:35:25,650
Drivers tune in if you're on a plane
flight and it's going to take you 14

3518
02:35:25,651 --> 02:35:27,600
hours,
downloaded a bunch of podcasts.

3519
02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:30,540
That stuff is the best.
It's like you can just sit there and

3520
02:35:30,541 --> 02:35:35,080
chill and it allows you to enrich your
mind because you,

3521
02:35:35,130 --> 02:35:39,500
you listen to these conversations and
you feel like you're there and you,

3522
02:35:39,501 --> 02:35:44,501
you also know this is like the thinnest
sort of organization available as bare

3523
02:35:46,591 --> 02:35:48,510
bones as it gets.
This is leanne.

3524
02:35:48,610 --> 02:35:49,443
Yeah,
but it's,

3525
02:35:49,790 --> 02:35:51,340
that's the part of it's beauty.
I mean that's,

3526
02:35:51,341 --> 02:35:55,190
and that's the difference between making
a show and podcasts and podcasts and

3527
02:35:55,191 --> 02:35:59,200
it's awesome because you can find the
colonel in minute 48 and you're like,

3528
02:35:59,201 --> 02:36:00,070
oh,
I found what that

3529
02:36:00,380 --> 02:36:01,930
it was about,
like we've done a couple of times in

3530
02:36:01,931 --> 02:36:04,480
this conversation,
go back to things and see how they're

3531
02:36:04,481 --> 02:36:07,000
connected,
but we don't have an executive standing

3532
02:36:07,001 --> 02:36:09,610
over our shoulder telling us to hit all
the data points.

3533
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,710
Right.
So I hopefully,

3534
02:36:11,711 --> 02:36:13,660
and by the way,
comedy central has been,

3535
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:15,310
and I'm not just saying this is a
company man,

3536
02:36:15,311 --> 02:36:18,490
they've been cool about saying like,
go get weird.

3537
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:19,780
They kind of have to know.
Yes,

3538
02:36:19,781 --> 02:36:20,650
I totally agree.

3539
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:22,550
They're locked into the spot like,
oh my god,

3540
02:36:22,580 --> 02:36:24,950
everyone's going away.
there's no one left on television.

3541
02:36:24,951 --> 02:36:26,180
Exactly.
And they have,

3542
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:28,100
they have south park,
which is the best.

3543
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:31,040
And then they have [inaudible],
which is a monster and they don't have

3544
02:36:31,041 --> 02:36:31,731
much else.
Yeah,

3545
02:36:31,731 --> 02:36:31,900
yeah,

3546
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:33,430
yeah.
They got another period.

3547
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,590
My lovely wife.
so what is that?

3548
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,850
Oh,
you've never seen it.

3549
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:38,110
It's really funny.
Is it on right now?

3550
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:38,711
It's on,
yeah,

3551
02:36:38,711 --> 02:36:40,630
it will be.
Its third season is the summer of.

3552
02:36:40,631 --> 02:36:43,840
I wrote and produced that show for the
last few years,

3553
02:36:43,841 --> 02:36:45,880
but it's a spinoff for more than a year.
Yeah.

3554
02:36:45,881 --> 02:36:46,990
This,
it'll be third season.

3555
02:36:46,991 --> 02:36:47,710
this,
uh,

3556
02:36:47,710 --> 02:36:49,180
I mean there's too much tv,
joe.

3557
02:36:49,330 --> 02:36:52,690
There's just is too much tv used to be
when a comic had a show,

3558
02:36:52,691 --> 02:36:53,920
it was a big deal.
I know.

3559
02:36:53,921 --> 02:36:56,980
It's crazy.
A comment getting his own show is now a

3560
02:36:56,981 --> 02:37:00,730
comic doing like a doing a comedy
central presents or,

3561
02:37:00,750 --> 02:37:02,190
or premium blend.
You know,

3562
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:04,930
it's like the same equation and the
young comics are so funny because

3563
02:37:04,931 --> 02:37:07,180
they're like,
they think they deserve a show and it's

3564
02:37:07,181 --> 02:37:08,080
like,
really?

3565
02:37:08,081 --> 02:37:10,980
It's used to be me thinking I deserve to
go to like montreal is like,

3566
02:37:10,990 --> 02:37:13,030
I'm thinking where's my network show?

3567
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:15,410
fuck you.
That's so weird.

3568
02:37:15,411 --> 02:37:17,740
It's weird.
What a weird time man.

3569
02:37:17,810 --> 02:37:19,880
It definitely is,
but it's a weird time.

3570
02:37:19,970 --> 02:37:21,170
But you don't podcast too,
right?

3571
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:22,580
I do.
Yeah I do.

3572
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:25,250
Oh I still need to come on to.
I'll do it.

3573
02:37:25,370 --> 02:37:25,950
Yeah.
Uh,

3574
02:37:25,950 --> 02:37:28,940
it's called the hound tall discussion
series and it's basically what led to

3575
02:37:28,941 --> 02:37:32,060
this a tv show on comedy central,
which was that we were getting,

3576
02:37:32,061 --> 02:37:35,710
we get one expert on and it's in front
of a hound tall instead of the town

3577
02:37:35,711 --> 02:37:36,544
hall.
Yeah,

3578
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:38,690
yeah.
The little play on words that we expect

3579
02:37:38,691 --> 02:37:40,900
people to remember that no ill advise,
bad name.

3580
02:37:41,090 --> 02:37:42,500
I'm willing to admit that,
you know,

3581
02:37:42,501 --> 02:37:44,150
about three episodes in.
I said to them,

3582
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:45,260
the listeners,
I was like,

3583
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:47,420
I'm willing to change his name.
I'm thinking that stupid.

3584
02:37:47,570 --> 02:37:48,560
They all were like,
no,

3585
02:37:48,561 --> 02:37:51,080
we like it now.
so don't listen to them in the first

3586
02:37:51,081 --> 02:37:51,350
place.

3587
02:37:51,350 --> 02:37:54,050
They're the ones who are willing to
listen to it with a crazy name.

3588
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:58,440
So we basically get an expert on and we
have that person tried to give a talk in

3589
02:37:58,441 --> 02:38:00,440
this field of expertise while comics
riff over it.

3590
02:38:00,850 --> 02:38:03,030
So it's like mystery science theater
meets a ted talk kind of.

3591
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:03,830
Oh,
that's cool.

3592
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:05,150
Yeah.
So every,

3593
02:38:05,210 --> 02:38:07,490
every.
So that's kind of what led to the tv

3594
02:38:07,491 --> 02:38:09,800
shows that every week is a different
topic and this is,

3595
02:38:09,801 --> 02:38:12,620
every episode is a different topic.
So you enjoyed doing this conversation

3596
02:38:12,621 --> 02:38:13,454
with thing?
It was fun.

3597
02:38:13,490 --> 02:38:14,031
Yeah,
it's fun.

3598
02:38:14,031 --> 02:38:15,440
I,
I'm into like,

3599
02:38:15,441 --> 02:38:17,240
you are.
I'm into like big ideas and big

3600
02:38:17,241 --> 02:38:20,180
conversations.
It's harder to have big conversations in

3601
02:38:20,181 --> 02:38:21,470
bite size,
you know,

3602
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:22,880
use it half,
half hour,

3603
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:25,270
half hour.
I'd like it to get to be an hour if,

3604
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:26,270
if,
if all goes well,

3605
02:38:26,271 --> 02:38:29,270
I'd like that to happen.
Especially when you're dealing with

3606
02:38:29,271 --> 02:38:30,830
things like cultural appropriation.

3607
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:33,770
I know just the opposing sides,
they're going to take more than 15

3608
02:38:33,771 --> 02:38:34,640
minutes.
Exactly.

3609
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:37,280
It's electric,
it's electric.

3610
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:40,430
The full tapings have been really fun
and electric and then you have to

3611
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,580
squeeze them into 22 minutes.
So we're going to be releasing a bunch

3612
02:38:43,581 --> 02:38:44,550
of extended,
uh,

3613
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:47,740
stuff lIke we had mc search on.
It was really a great conversation and

3614
02:38:47,741 --> 02:38:51,530
had mc search on to talk cultural
appropriation that real so real.

3615
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:53,420
Did he keep it really real?
I mean,

3616
02:38:53,421 --> 02:38:54,390
this is a bit.
Yeah.

3617
02:38:55,100 --> 02:38:58,760
Mc search used to have the worst talk
show in the history of the known

3618
02:38:58,761 --> 02:39:03,260
universe and it was so bad they will
play clips of it on opiod anthony and

3619
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:06,140
clips of him talking about where we're
going to keep it real y'all.

3620
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:08,810
But thIs conversation I had with search
was so first of all,

3621
02:39:08,811 --> 02:39:10,010
I love search and he was.

3622
02:39:10,010 --> 02:39:13,250
So our conversation about appropriation,
I used to love him.

3623
02:39:13,251 --> 02:39:14,100
Third base.
yeah,

3624
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:14,780
yeah,
right.

3625
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:19,780
He's like the original guy and we were
talking with like a 1981 white rapper

3626
02:39:19,941 --> 02:39:22,250
about cultural appropriation when it's
like a really cool,

3627
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:25,190
really awesome.
Well he appropriated the whole deal.

3628
02:39:25,191 --> 02:39:27,680
He got a black wife and the whole deal.
He went,

3629
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:29,193
yeah,
he went deep.

3630
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:31,400
He went to duke.
He saId something so funny in this

3631
02:39:31,401 --> 02:39:36,170
interview I was asking is it different
that when white people appropriate just

3632
02:39:36,171 --> 02:39:38,240
we were talking about it's different
with black people appropriate versus

3633
02:39:38,241 --> 02:39:40,400
when white people appropriate and he
goes,

3634
02:39:40,401 --> 02:39:41,630
he thinks for a second.
He goes,

3635
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:46,840
well white people as a whole or the
devils of society.

3636
02:39:50,050 --> 02:39:52,940
Like I did not think you were about
this.

3637
02:39:53,050 --> 02:39:54,290
He's white.
I mean,

3638
02:39:54,291 --> 02:39:56,990
it was just so bizarre,
but anyway,

3639
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:59,150
uh,
so every week is a different topic and a

3640
02:39:59,270 --> 02:40:00,103
smart guy.

3641
02:40:00,110 --> 02:40:02,390
I think he's a very smart guy.
One of the best storytellers I've ever

3642
02:40:02,391 --> 02:40:03,170
met.
Really.

3643
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:05,870
You got to hear his story about how mc
hammer tried to have him killed.

3644
02:40:05,871 --> 02:40:08,480
It's one of the greatest stories.
It's one of the greatest stories of all

3645
02:40:08,481 --> 02:40:09,410
time.
Is that a real.

3646
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:10,251
Oh,
It's amazing.

3647
02:40:10,251 --> 02:40:12,110
It's on my pop,
my old podcast that I did with neil

3648
02:40:12,111 --> 02:40:13,010
brandon,
the champs,

3649
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:15,720
his episode,
a mc searches episode.

3650
02:40:15,721 --> 02:40:19,410
It's on there and it is one of the
craziest stories you will ever hear in

3651
02:40:19,411 --> 02:40:20,730
your life.
Wow.

3652
02:40:20,790 --> 02:40:21,960
Yeah.
It's real.

3653
02:40:21,961 --> 02:40:23,850
Mc hammer tried to have him killed.
Listen.

3654
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:25,170
hey,
listen to the story.

3655
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:26,153
I mean,
yes,

3656
02:40:26,270 --> 02:40:27,910
you want me to tell you the story?
I can tell you a verse,

3657
02:40:27,940 --> 02:40:28,830
a quick version.
Okay.

3658
02:40:29,370 --> 02:40:33,160
basically,
he did an a song where they dissed mc

3659
02:40:33,161 --> 02:40:34,290
hammer's mom,
right?

3660
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:35,100
Oh,
jesus.

3661
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:37,380
For some lyrical reason.
I mean it didn't.

3662
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:43,160
And mc hammer got angry and called the
head of the crips in la to put a

3663
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:45,280
contract out on their life.
Right?

3664
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:48,780
So Russell Simmons hears about it,
right,

3665
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:53,190
and they are at third base is in a
flight from New York to California and

3666
02:40:53,191 --> 02:40:55,140
Russell Simmons hears about it and it's
like,

3667
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:57,270
oh my god,
they're gonna kill third base,

3668
02:40:57,300 --> 02:40:59,520
right?
And so he calls the head of the crips

3669
02:40:59,521 --> 02:41:00,750
and it's like,
you have to take this,

3670
02:41:01,130 --> 02:41:02,160
uh,
uh,

3671
02:41:02,370 --> 02:41:03,690
you have to dead this,
uh,

3672
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:05,940
this contract,
please don't kill my clients or

3673
02:41:05,941 --> 02:41:07,290
whatever.
and so The guy,

3674
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:11,550
the head of the crips is like,
I will end this hit on third base,

3675
02:41:11,551 --> 02:41:15,020
but only if you can get me tickets to
the emmys,

3676
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:17,190
uh,
to the grammy's and sitting next to

3677
02:41:17,191 --> 02:41:20,460
Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is
like,

3678
02:41:20,461 --> 02:41:21,660
oh my god,
okay.

3679
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:25,860
And then he calls Michael Jackson
through some crazy series of events and

3680
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,920
somehow gets some Michael Jackson and
Michael Jackson says,

3681
02:41:28,921 --> 02:41:30,660
okay,
I'll let him sit next to me if blah,

3682
02:41:30,661 --> 02:41:31,350
blah,
blah happens.

3683
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:33,040
I don't know what it was.
Some other weird twist.

3684
02:41:33,060 --> 02:41:35,090
Bring some robot.
Fuck kid does

3685
02:41:37,710 --> 02:41:40,620
go to the future.
FinaLly sees kids bringing them back.

3686
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:43,530
And then third base,
by the way,

3687
02:41:43,531 --> 02:41:45,990
they have no idea they're in the air.
They're flying while all of this,

3688
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:51,020
like weird machinations are happening,
they land and meeting them at the gate

3689
02:41:51,870 --> 02:41:54,540
is a crip,
a high level like lieutenant crip.

3690
02:41:54,541 --> 02:41:56,370
Right.
And he's like,

3691
02:41:56,371 --> 02:41:58,590
stay with me.
There's a contract on your life and the

3692
02:41:58,591 --> 02:42:01,560
only way that you'll live through this
trip is if you stay right next to me.

3693
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:04,740
So they're walking through la and these
trips are coming up who haven't because

3694
02:42:04,741 --> 02:42:05,780
it's like the crips,
you know,

3695
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:07,510
they don't have like a structure.
Right,

3696
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:10,740
exactly.
So these trips are like roll up and the

3697
02:42:10,741 --> 02:42:13,190
lieutenant will be like a crip crip,
you know,

3698
02:42:13,360 --> 02:42:16,680
hand sign,
stand down and the crip will be like

3699
02:42:16,770 --> 02:42:17,670
about to kill him.

3700
02:42:17,730 --> 02:42:19,200
And then would go,
oh,

3701
02:42:19,201 --> 02:42:21,060
thank god search.
I'm a big fan man.

3702
02:42:21,061 --> 02:42:21,894
Right on.
Like,

3703
02:42:22,060 --> 02:42:25,820
oh my god.
Jesus christ.

3704
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:28,590
That's the craziest story.
Mc hammer jumps the gun.

3705
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:30,940
Huh?
A little crazy there.

3706
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:33,000
I mean indeed that I don't know if it's
true,

3707
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:35,010
but I know that he told that story.
Wow.

3708
02:42:35,130 --> 02:42:36,420
Anyway,
let's leave it at that.

3709
02:42:36,460 --> 02:42:37,590
