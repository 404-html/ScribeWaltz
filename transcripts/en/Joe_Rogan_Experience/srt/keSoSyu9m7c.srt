1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,640
Okay,

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,820
boom,
and we're live.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,110
How are you?
Welcome to the show.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,990
I'm doing great Jeff.
Thanks for her rehab.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,870
Close.
There you go.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,380
I know you've done a podcast for.
You did Tim Ferriss podcast.

7
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:19,990
I heard you on that.
Actually three of them.

8
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:23,170
I think I did for three.
Three really cast.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,730
Oh,
I need to listen to the other two then.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,860
What is this one you brought me?
Man,

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,570
this is crazy.
That is.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,710
Do you think I'm a drunk?
This is what.

13
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:32,500
This is.
Maybe the dry farm wines.

14
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:36,820
Guys think that this giant magnum.
I'd have to have a party.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,880
It's a,
it's a wine that's pretty legit in 

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,220
regards to if you want to stay on a 
ketogenic diet.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,640
And a,
I tested this in my office actually and 

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,640
just found that to be.
It's non glycaemic for one thing,

19
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:54,580
which means it doesn't impact the sugar 
content is so low.

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,930
There's not an elevation in blood 
glucose and uh,

21
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:03,840
I can stay in Ketosis on this one if I 
do one glass two or three.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,890
Three starts to kick me out.
But to glasses of wine,

23
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,390
you can completely stay in Ketosis.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,260
Most glasses,
most wine will kick you out of Ketosis.

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,650
Uh,
yeah.

26
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:18,200
I mean it's highly dependent on like a 
merlow.

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,210
A dry wine typically doesn't,
but a smart little more dry,

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,500
uh,
most of it,

29
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,460
yeah,
most of the time.

30
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:27,310
Yeah.
A white wines tend to kick me out more.

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,040
And of course something like a sweet 
wine,

32
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,170
we'll go bowling or something like that.
Really sweet.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,610
Uh,
St Maria,

34
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,210
you know,
that'll take you out very fast.

35
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,330
Just sugar.
And even beer does,

36
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,850
even though it's supposed to be low carb
beer tends to kick me out.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,390
Really Michelob ultra and maybe one,
you know,

38
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,610
one or two.
But other than that,

39
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:50,611
yeah,
I mean I get that question a lot so it 

40
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,341
actually got me interested in studying 
this so I can answer some of the 

41
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,971
questions with some level of knowledge 
and after testing these wines and uh,

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,910
I came to the conclusion,
yeah,

43
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:05,170
you can drink two glasses of wine a day 
on a strict ketogenic diet.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,460
And I think this is important for people
that are doing it to manage their health

45
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,580
long term and um,
especially people with actual health 

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,020
issues were ketogenic diet,
ketogenic diet benefits them,

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,130
like epileptic.
Absolutely.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,760
Like when I got into this,
it was a pediatric epilepsy like in 2007

49
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:27,820
or eight and now the applications are 
expanding,

50
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,620
you know,
a dozen or more.

51
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:34,621
So we hold a conference and Metabolic 
Therapeutics Conference where the top 

52
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,750
tier people in academia and like from 
Johns Hopkins,

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,860
they probably one of the spearheaded 
ketogenic diet application clinically 

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,630
and a top tier scientists from Yale and 
Harvard and other places,

55
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,280
uh,
present here.

56
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:53,281
And it's,
I think the applicate it was like 11 or 

57
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:56,191
12 applications for the key to genic 
diet where there's good peer reviewed 

58
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:59,310
research to support the efficacy,
uh,

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,700
as a metabolic based therapy for a 
number of everything from,

60
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,130
you know,
polycystic ovary syndrome to acne to 

61
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,130
rare.

62
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,500
Even genetic disorders like Angelman 
Syndrome is something that we're 

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:13,500
studying,
a,

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,331
it's a,
it's a genetic disorder where a 

65
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,580
housekeeping gene is mutated and it 
results in seizures and a motor function

66
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,970
impairment and the ketogenic diet is 
remarkably effective.

67
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,660
Uh,
not.

68
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,020
It's really drug resistant seizures that
these kids have,

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,520
and even in the presence of a persistent
molecular pathology,

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,490
a genetic pathology,
the key to genic diet,

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,750
uh,
through altering metabolism with the 

72
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,800
Diet,
you can largely silenced the pathology 

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,830
and the motor function impairments 
associated with this disease.

74
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,190
And that,
that's amazing to me that you have a 

75
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,431
disease that is persistently there due 
to a genetic mutation and you can 

76
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:56,290
largely silence the symptoms that is 
yours

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,360
in the interest of addressing people 
that are probably on the ground floor.

78
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:04,361
And I feel like there's very few people 
today that don't understand what a 

79
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,951
ketogenic diet is,
but just in case for people who don't 

80
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:10,071
know,
there are people that use carbohydrates 

81
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:13,611
mainly for fuel.
And then there's the mutagenic diet 

82
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,720
which makes your body run on fats and 
ketones.

83
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,170
So try just kind of explain that to 
people,

84
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,720
like how this came about.
Um,

85
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,120
how people started to,
uh,

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
researching this and how you got 
involved.

87
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:27,900
Okay.

88
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,350
Uh,
I mean this goes back to if not 

89
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,350
centuries,
millennia,

90
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,960
you know,
dating,

91
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:38,961
back to the time of hypocrisy when it 
was observed that fasting was a quote 

92
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,370
unquote cure for seizures and with the 
observation.

93
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,390
Yeah.
So fasting puts you into fasting 

94
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,390
Ketosis,
right?

95
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,720
So even intermittent fasting,
like I do the 14 hour thing where I,

96
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,290
14

97
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:50,860
hours,
you know,

98
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,580
that's,
that's clinic.

99
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:57,581
I mean technically that's kind of,
I call that semi a semi fasted state 

100
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:57,610
when you achieve that,
you know,

101
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,611
when you're eating breakfast,
it could be 12 hours or more a you've 

102
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:03,130
eaten last and you're breaking the fast 
essentially.

103
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,560
But with severe epileptic patients,
uh,

104
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,610
it was found that when you,
when they restricted food and in some 

105
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,440
cases water after about two or three 
days,

106
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:18,520
you had profound seizure control or it 
silenced even the worst seizures.

107
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,340
And this was observed,
uh,

108
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,650
you know,
for Millennia,

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
like I said,
and uh,

110
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,540
the,
there was some work done in the,

111
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,880
the early 19 hundreds and 19 twenties.
Uh,

112
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,900
there was some work done at the Mayo 
Clinic that I observed the presence of 

113
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,381
these ketone bodies and people that were
eating a carbohydrate restricted diet 

114
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,760
that was primarily a based on eating fat
and with a minimal amount of protein 

115
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:49,060
just enough to ensure there's not 
protein malnutrition.

116
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,510
And it was observed that there was an 
elevation of ketone bodies,

117
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,730
Beta hydroxy butyrate acetate in the 
blood.

118
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:58,040
So they called it a physiologist called 
it the key to genic diet.

119
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,170
Uh,
even technically,

120
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,260
maybe Beta hydroxy butyrate is not a 
ketone,

121
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,160
but physiologists called these ketone 
bodies,

122
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,890
Beta hydroxybutyrate acetate and 
acetone,

123
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,420
and it mimics the physiological state of
fasting in many ways.

124
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,960
So if you were to draw blood off someone
on a ketogenic diet,

125
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,050
it would sort of look like they had been
fasting a few days,

126
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
uh,
because it's mimicking the way I think 

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,410
about it.
It's suppressing the hormone insulin and

128
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,980
kind of mimicking the fuel,
the substrate utilization that you would

129
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:31,670
be using in a state of being fasted,
which is primarily fats,

130
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,470
ketones.
And,

131
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,980
uh,
to a lesser extent a of,

132
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,370
I mean,
a glucose from amino acids from protein.

133
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,610
You are mobilizing some gluconeogenic 
amino acids from your skeletal muscle 

134
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:45,610
when you are fasting.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,250
Ketones are protein sparing though,
so they are anti catabolic in that way.

136
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:54,251
So because we make ketones and our large
brain has a massive demand for energy 

137
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,630
and the ketones fulfill that for the 
most part.

138
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,860
When fasting,
uh,

139
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,110
it prevents us from breaking down 
muscle.

140
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Uh,
it prevents us from liberating the 

141
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,081
gluconeogenic amino acids that would 
otherwise be chewed up and use to 

142
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:12,581
maintain our glucose levels.
So the ketones sort of replaced the 

143
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:16,061
glucose.
The brain has the metabolic flexibility 

144
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,490
to adapt from using glucose to using 
primarily ketone bodies in those ketone 

145
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,610
bodies really have a protein sparing.
Anti catabolic.

146
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,200
No.
Is this an ancient system that was in 

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,200
place back when people,
you know,

148
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,100
obviously couldn't go to the store and 
your diet varied depending upon what was

149
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:31,470
available and it just allowed people 
like say,

150
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:36,471
like maybe inuits that lived off a lot 
of fats because they really don't have 

151
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,070
many carbohydrates.
If you're living off a whale blubber and

152
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,960
things along those lines like they had 
to back then.

153
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,210
Yeah.
Uh,

154
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,970
I mean it's hardwired in,
in humans and other animals.

155
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:48,030
My,
my wife Studies Manta rays and uh,

156
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,060
and they,
they're the,

157
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,460
like the Einsteins of the sea that,
so they're the fish with the biggest 

158
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,591
brains of all animals and we've done 
metabolomic studies on them and looking 

159
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,630
at the blood and they produce a 
significant amount of ketones,

160
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:01,800
like two millimolar,
uh,

161
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,500
they dive really deep so it may help 
protect them from that.

162
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,830
So yeah,
animals will go into ketosis during 

163
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,730
fasting or even if you manipulate their 
food source,

164
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,780
uh,
the Quito pet sanctuary actually treats 

165
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,671
dogs that have cancer and they implement
a key to genic diet in dogs,

166
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,520
uh,
in addition to some other things to 

167
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,520
help.
Uh,

168
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
and the many of these are our dogs from 
kill shelters and,

169
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:32,521
and put them on an anticancer therapy 
program and they can get into ketosis 

170
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,210
for the most harder.

171
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,340
But most of them,
most dog food is not kidogenic is like 

172
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,340
documents have grain in it,
right?

173
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,170
Yeah.
For fillers and things along those 

174
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,170
lines.

175
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,170
Yeah,
it's really interesting.

176
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,170
I was talking with,
uh,

177
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,340
Ron Pena,
uh,

178
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,110
yesterday,
uh,

179
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,150
from quest nutrition.
The CEO of quest nutrition and he 

180
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,520
brought to my attention that if you look
on a package of dog food,

181
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:55,521
you won't see carbohydrates listed even 
though it's the primary because there 

182
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:59,661
was some laws or policy put into action 
to prevent carbohydrates from even being

183
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:03,930
listed on kibble on dog food,
which I find,

184
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,980
you know,
there's a lot of reasons why mostly 

185
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,321
because dogs really shouldn't be eating 
a carbohydrate based diet and that's 

186
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:15,380
probably part of the reason,
but there's sort of other reasons why a.

187
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,420
But it's really important that the.
So the food that the Quito pet sanctuary

188
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,230
gives the dogs that have cancer and they
confirmed that they have cancer with a,

189
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,640
a glucose pet scan and they do it,
you know,

190
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,660
before,
during and after is basically kind of 

191
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,451
like a raw foods key to genic diet 
that's almost completely restricted in 

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,370
what we've called glycemic 
carbohydrates.

193
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,390
Things that would elevate the glucose 
levels and it's very high in fat,

194
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,640
relatively speaking.
Yeah.

195
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,890
But dogs,
you know,

196
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,820
really should not be eating any grains 
at all.

197
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,210
Yeah.
I feed my dog grain free dog food,

198
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,630
but I don't know if it's carbon free.
I don't know what's in there is a kibble

199
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,180
kibble.
It's hard to find out.

200
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,230
Right?
Yeah.

201
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,310
Uh,
I mean,

202
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:01,620
you know,
dog food that has a,

203
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,670
like some peas and sweet potatoes and 
things like that.

204
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,390
It is.
Okay.

205
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,830
Uh,
but ideally,

206
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:12,831
you know,
you want to give your dog like a whole 

207
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:13,170
food nutrition just like humans and you 
know,

208
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,440
they say don't give your dog human food,
but that's,

209
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,740
there's no evidence for that.
And uh,

210
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,100
you know,
I've given talks where I talked about 

211
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,941
giving dogs raw food and there was a,
there'd be a reaction from the audience 

212
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:30,141
while it's dangerous to give your dog 
like raw food or what do they in a 

213
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:30,141
while,
you know,

214
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:34,110
I mean if the,
if it's ground beef that's been sitting 

215
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,110
around at a processing plant for a while
yet maybe,

216
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,280
but fresh,
you know,

217
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,790
a meat from a butcher,
fresh meat.

218
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,980
I mean,
it's probably the ideal thing for a dog.

219
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,110
Ideally,
organ meats like liver,

220
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,010
heart,
kidneys,

221
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,450
things like that.
Grind it up.

222
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,010
Uh,
you know,

223
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:52,011
and some,
some Greens tos and things like spinach 

224
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:55,131
you can buy like spinach powder.
So the Quito pet sanctuary has an ebook 

225
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,040
that's completely free if you go to 
Quito,

226
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,710
pet sanctuary,
a.org,

227
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,770
I believe,
and you can download the Ebook and it 

228
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,110
tells you very precisely how to make 
your dog food not only to,

229
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:05,730
to,
you know,

230
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,731
if your dog has cancer,
but to maximize its overall performance 

231
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:14,841
and you are preventing cancer by virtue 
of putting them on a diet that optimizes

232
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,260
your,
their metabolic health.

233
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,530
Well that's got to be very difficult to 
package though.

234
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:24,090
And something that's sort of evergreen.
So it's on the shelf and paper bag.

235
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:25,830
You can rip open and just pour into a 
bowl.

236
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,870
That's what everybody wants,
like this convenience thing,

237
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,010
but there is a way to do it.
And uh,

238
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,020
you know,
I know,

239
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,050
I know those guys,
you know,

240
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,700
epigenics a foundation,
they,

241
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:36,370
uh,
are,

242
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,410
are working.
They basically support the Quito pet 

243
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,031
sanctuary and they're working out not 
only the macronutrient ratios that need 

244
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:48,201
to go into the food,
but also the types of food and also 

245
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:51,950
being able to package it in a way to 
ultimately come up with a food that you 

246
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,721
can go.
It may not be on the shelf and probably 

247
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,801
ideally shouldn't be on the shelf,
but it will be like in the refrigerator 

248
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,240
section of your pet food store.
So you go there and like for our dogs we

249
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:06,140
get like a tube of freshly ground up,
a steak or whatever.

250
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:11,141
And we feed that.
We take the ground me and mix it with 

251
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:11,890
Oregon,
me and mix it with a different greens,

252
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,080
Broccoli and things like that and give 
it to them.

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,030
And they love it.
We put a little bit of coconut oil on it

254
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,040
sometimes.
So you would go to the grocery store or 

255
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,040
it would be,
could be shipped to your house.

256
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,860
And it's basically kept refrigerated and
it has the compliment of like organ 

257
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:28,300
meats to,
you know,

258
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:31,120
the proper types of fats,
a official hill,

259
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,500
fats and fiber.
And um,

260
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,970
and it fits that macronutrient ratio,
the ketogenic diet dog was horrific 

261
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,060
farts.
One of them that,

262
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,280
yeah,
we have a great Dane.

263
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,890
They're both rescue dogs.
Uh,

264
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,960
one of them does Broccoli,
organ meats and coconut oil.

265
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,570
I'm like,
Whoa,

266
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,630
go room.
Yeah,

267
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,210
it's either my wife,
uh,

268
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,610
or uh,
the dog,

269
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,850
I don't know.
She might be blaming the dog,

270
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,490
maybe blame the dog.
They're healthy.

271
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,580
How long have you been involved in 
ketogenic research and research on Keto 

272
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:05,580
diets?
And,

273
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,780
and how long have you been doing it 
yourself?

274
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,820
Yeah,
I guess it was.

275
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:13,930
I got turned onto it in 2007 or eight.
And,

276
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,450
uh,
actually I was communicating online,

277
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,500
uh,
on a nutrition forum on a fitness 

278
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,500
website.
And uh,

279
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,660
I was a neuroscientist.
I did my phd on cellular neuroscience.

280
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:29,851
I didn't let something called patch 
clamp electrophysiology where I 

281
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:30,520
electrically record from neurons and it 
was,

282
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,210
you know,
really,

283
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,250
uh,
mostly just neuroscience and my 

284
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,010
postdoctoral research was studying 
seizures and uh,

285
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,130
I got to the point where we're doing 
some drug based research on seizures and

286
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:47,131
other types of research and the types of
seizures that I study are powerful tonic

287
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:52,651
clonic seizures that a navy seal could 
potentially experience using closed 

288
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,610
circuit rebreather.
So when they're underwater,

289
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:59,611
a limitation for their time underwater 
is cns oxygen toxicity and it's also 

290
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,840
limitation for hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy,

291
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,990
rebreathers or those ones that don't 
emit bubbles.

292
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,700
Is that correct?

293
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,920
Yeah.
So there's a bit of a stealth component,

294
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,710
so you're underwater and if you're going
over a lake to uh,

295
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,830
engage the enemy,
they can't see you coming.

296
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,260
So that's the advantage that they're 
very,

297
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,170
um,
stealth,

298
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:23,171
like a,
the disadvantages that at 50 feet of 

299
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,970
seawater in just 10 minutes,
you have the potential to get cns oxygen

300
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,410
toxicity.
Of course,

301
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:30,520
if you follow the guidelines and dive 
within the guidelines,

302
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,110
uh,
of you know,

303
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,140
the depth and the time,
then you're typically okay.

304
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,960
90 nine point nine percent of the time,
but if you have,

305
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,930
you know,
a,

306
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,110
uh,
someone shooting with a 50 caliber 

307
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,110
machine gun on,
into the water,

308
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,710
you're not going to want to come up,
you know,

309
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:49,711
you're going to want to stay down there.
If you have a mind to go down to the 

310
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:50,560
bridge or ship or something,
you have to likely,

311
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,920
in many cases go down below 50 feet and 
it puts you at the potential of having a

312
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,540
seizure and a seizure under water.

313
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,760
The seizure itself is not a,
a deadly per se,

314
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,410
but having a seizure under water could 
be fatal to the mission and in,

315
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,260
you know,
the warfighter.

316
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,480
So,
uh,

317
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,580
my research was really developing 
various technologies where we actually 

318
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:12,630
put things inside of Microsoft,
uh,

319
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,740
inside a hyperbaric chamber,
like an atomic force microscope or a 

320
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,750
laser scanning confocal or we can look 
at the Mitochondria under pressures that

321
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:24,260
simulate these operational conditions.
And,

322
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,060
uh,
and that was about 10 years ago,

323
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:31,061
and out of that research evolved 
studying various things and looking at 

324
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:35,651
the cells and even the Mitochondria and 
observing that ketones essentially 

325
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:39,910
enhance brain energy production.
And resilience in extreme environments 

326
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,450
of high pressure and high oxygen.
And from those cellular studies,

327
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,870
uh,
I became more interested in what people 

328
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,171
do when drugs don't work for epilepsy.
And I looked up and found the ketogenic 

329
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:57,311
diet and uh,
this fits in perfect because my 

330
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,790
background was studying nutrition and I 
was studying pharmacology at the time,

331
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,480
but it allowed me to bring nutrition 
back into my research program,

332
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,830
uh,
and studying the ketogenic diet 

333
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:07,830
specifically.

334
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,510
And the program officer at the time at 
the office of navy research really liked

335
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,740
the idea of the ketogenetic diet and a 
drug.

336
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,800
So being able to consume something that 
can elevate these blood ketone levels 

337
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,590
which can cross the blood brain barrier 
and make our brains kind of super brains

338
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:26,540
under physiological extremes.
So that's what I really.

339
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:31,541
I put my efforts into studying the 
ketogenic diet and also into developing 

340
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,891
and testing a wide range of exonerations
ketone products and which come,

341
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,920
which are on the spectrum of drug like 
to,

342
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,950
on the spectrum of kind of natural based
things that can be combined together 

343
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,120
that put you in a state of therapeutic 
ketosis within like 30 minutes to 60 

344
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,940
minutes so you can use it right before 
an operation,

345
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,170
a for mission or therapeutically.
So if you have a child,

346
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,300
for example,
that has status epilepticus,

347
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:04,301
which is continuous seizures that you 
can't stop instead of giving them an 

348
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:07,670
anti epilepsy drug that can have side 
effects and even developmental delays.

349
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,110
Uh,
the Ketogenic Diet,

350
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,280
you know,
it takes 24,

351
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,350
48,
maybe 72 hours to work,

352
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,420
but if you can tube feed them a,
a,

353
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,940
a ketone supplement and put them into 
therapeutic ketosis,

354
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,970
then you can mitigate these seizures 
which could have potential longterm 

355
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,170
effects.
So that's just one example of a 

356
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:29,750
therapeutic application of exogenous 
ketones.

357
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,370
But,
so you're doing the research on this and

358
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,800
you decided to start doing it yourself?
Yeah,

359
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,160
I started doing it myself to get a 
better understanding.

360
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:40,610
Actually the,
there was a patient in in the UK,

361
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:45,611
his name is Mike Dancer,
and if you just kind of Google Mike 

362
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:45,710
Dancer and epilepsy,
you'll come up on his story,

363
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:49,160
which is a really remarkable story 
because he tried a dozen,

364
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,350
half dozen,
maybe even a dozen different types of 

365
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,110
antiepileptic drugs and high doses,
things like Keppra,

366
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,380
like things that are the standard of 
care and it didn't work for him.

367
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,380
He connected with me and I,
I mentioned a couple supplements before 

368
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,010
I embarked on the Ketogenic Diet.
And long story short,

369
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:07,920
I gave him the information kind of 
here's the key to genic diet.

370
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,921
Here's a scientific rationale.
It looks like before you go and have 

371
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:16,011
brain surgery,
they were going to remove part of his 

372
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,011
hippocampus.
Well,

373
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,011
uh,
I said,

374
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,830
you know,
just use this as a,

375
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,960
maybe about 2008 or nine ish.
And a long story short,

376
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,850
I didn't talk to them because they got 
really busy.

377
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,480
I transitioned into a tenure track 
assistant professor position.

378
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,060
I was working very long hours,
maybe four months or so,

379
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:35,061
went by,
and then when I contacted him he was 

380
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,731
like,
I have not had a seizure in this time 

381
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:37,731
and he was having multiple seizures 
sometimes per day and couldn't leave the

382
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:42,501
house and it was almost like a proof of 
concept and it also caused pretty 

383
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:47,121
significant body composition changes in 
him and he was in the fitness industry 

384
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:47,490
and even did a bodybuilding show.

385
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,400
So he basically was,
it saved.

386
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,930
It saved his life actually because he 
had what,

387
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,580
what I would call and what the doctors 
called terminal epilepsy.

388
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,580
There was no way to control seizures and
when,

389
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,220
when the drugs failed,
the ketogenic diet worked for him.

390
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,270
And that was almost like proof of 
concept I'm reading.

391
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,150
I thought the qg Hank Diet was kind of 
like this fad diet.

392
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:14,151
I just knew about it in the fitness 
circles is something that I would 

393
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:18,080
actually typically avoid.
But when you read about the history of 

394
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,140
the Diet in the 19 twenties,
early 19 twenties,

395
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:22,980
and how Dr Wilder kind of developed this
therapy,

396
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,240
uh,
at Mayo clinic there's like really 

397
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,471
legit.
A peer reviewed research behind it and 

398
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:33,300
enormous amount of research and I 
realized it was a grossly underutilized,

399
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,390
you know,
mega bought what I would call a 

400
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,390
metabolic based therapy for seizures.

401
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,350
Why would you typically avoid?
Because they're in our healthcare 

402
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,580
systems,
there's really not the infrastructure 

403
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,510
when a patient comes in and uh,
and they have uncontrollable seizures.

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The neurologists or epileptologist 
typically does not have the skillset in 

405
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:59,121
nutrition knowledge in nutrition to be 
able to guide a patient successfully 

406
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:03,561
into nutritional ketosis and to do that 
so they would have to refer them to a 

407
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:07,281
registered dietician,
which typically are not savvy and 

408
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:07,740
ketogenic diets.
Uh,

409
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,280
but,
uh,

410
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:13,281
but now the Charlie Foundation is a 
foundation that worked closely with 

411
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:15,900
Johns Hopkins and I think there's about 
150 to 200 clinics worldwide,

412
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,340
uh,
that are key to genic diet clinics that 

413
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,340
have,
you know,

414
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,830
registered dieticians that are working 
to assist patients.

415
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,000
So now,
you know,

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,010
uh,
the infrastructure is kind of there,

417
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,510
but doctors typically will prescribe a 
drug whenever they can.

418
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,940
And even when they know they may,
most of them are probably aware that,

419
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,680
you know,
it is the standard of care,

420
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,890
a drank diet is a standard of care when,
when drugs fail and there's things like 

421
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,020
vagal nerve stimulation and other 
things.

422
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,000
But the ketogenic diet has been around 
so long,

423
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:50,001
it has an amazing track record.
There are some side effects associated 

424
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:53,461
with it,
mostly associated with a classical Kj 

425
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:53,461
Diet,
which was like 90 percent fat,

426
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,870
eight percent protein.
But now,

427
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:59,170
uh,
Eric Kossoff at Johns Hopkins has done a

428
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,980
lot of work on what I would call the 
modified ketogenic diet.

429
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,310
He calls it the modified Atkins Diet,
which is more liberal and protein.

430
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,370
It's 20 to 30 percent protein and the 
balance being mostly fats from healthy 

431
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,980
sources and the carbohydrates are just,
you know,

432
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:19,981
completely non glycemic carbohydrates 
you'd get from salads or green 

433
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:20,320
vegetables and things like that.
And what are those side effects?

434
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,070
Uh,
so with the classical Qj Diet,

435
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,760
they found that kids put on the Diet it 
a reduced igf one,

436
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,130
which if you're into longevity,
that's,

437
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,540
that might be a good thing,
right?

438
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Uh,
and it reduced their terminal height in 

439
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,120
some cases because of the protein 
restriction.

440
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,480
So restricting protein can,
uh,

441
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,460
for reasons we know in the longevity 
field,

442
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,010
you know,
uh,

443
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:43,760
reduce,
uh,

444
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,420
igf one signaling insulin,
igf one signaling,

445
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:50,920
and that was found to be the case in 
kids versus the suspected mechanism.

446
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,970
But when protein was titrated back in,
uh,

447
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:59,470
that was not the case.
So there's also kidney stones can happen

448
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,970
and there was a supplement potassium 
citrate that can help kind of offset the

449
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:08,971
mild metabolic acidosis that occurs when
you go in the ketogenic diet and just 

450
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:08,980
simply,
I mean,

451
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:13,981
you could do that nutritionally just by 
formula in your diet and using more 

452
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:13,981
salt,
uh,

453
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:18,720
to balance out and using more minerals.
So actually the big issue was just the 

454
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,070
protein just yeah,
I think the protein and for kids that 

455
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,551
are growing and developing and uh,
and if you restrict protein and kids 

456
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:31,200
that have all these growth factors and 
everything that really kind of require 

457
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,930
a.

458
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,820
and also if you go on the Ketogenic Diet
it,

459
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,930
you may be inadvertently limiting total 
calories just because of the 

460
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,950
palatability of the.
Especially the classical Qj Diet,

461
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,020
whereas the modified Atkins Diet,
which was studied very rigorously at 

462
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,350
Johns Hopkins by Eric Kossoff,
has shown to have like 90 percent of the

463
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:55,351
benefits of this draconian,
a classic ketogenic diet and a when 

464
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,680
possible,
you know,

465
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,530
it's better to put.
And that's what I follow.

466
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,840
I follow a modified Atkins,
which is just higher in protein.

467
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,580
So let's,
let's establish the protocol.

468
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,290
So the step,
the classic Ketogenic Diet is 90 percent

469
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,600
fat.
Eight percent protein,

470
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,100
two percent carbs.
Is that what it is?

471
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,680
Uh,
that's about the macronutrient ratios.

472
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,080
Yeah.
And they call it a clinically,

473
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,290
they call it the four to one or the 
three to one ketogenic diet.

474
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,160
And that's really confusing because that
four to one is in grams,

475
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,570
right?
So it's a,

476
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,020
it's actually like four parts fat to one
part protein and carbohydrates,

477
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:34,990
carbohydrates being very,
very small part of that one,

478
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,920
that four to one ratio.

479
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,920
And if three to one ratio would be,
and that would be like 92 percent fat,

480
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:46,591
I mean it's really high.
And then the three to one ratio is like 

481
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,030
88 percent fat or close to 85 percent 
fat.

482
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,360
So I like to do it.
It's,

483
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,330
it's,
it's,

484
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,770
it's better,
it's more,

485
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:55,790
it's more easy for me to consider in 
terms of percentage of calories.

486
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,330
And um,
and about 75 percent calories from fat 

487
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,960
is pretty doable and pretty palatable.
So that's how you do it.

488
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,140
Yeah.
Sixty five to 70 percent if it's super 

489
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,240
important for people,
uh,

490
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,240
not only in the clinical realm,
but also people that are doing this,

491
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,010
you know,
for athletic reasons,

492
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:18,011
for losing body fat,
managing type two diabetes is probably 

493
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:21,821
the biggest,
the low hanging fruit of all these 

494
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:21,821
applications.
And I can talk more about that.

495
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:24,290
Uh,
the biggest thing to do is to count your

496
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,360
macros and test your ketones of course.

497
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,360
But people are horrible at counting how 
many calories they are getting in when 

498
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:35,350
you tell them to follow a diet.
So they really need a,

499
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,890
a,
a,

500
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,930
an APP,
a software program,

501
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,740
a,
an APP,

502
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:44,741
and a Avatar.
Nutrition makes the kind of gold 

503
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:48,101
standard app for tracking your macros.
And I'm working with them hopefully to 

504
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,320
develop,
it's called avatar nutrition.

505
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,960
That's the actual app name that is the 
APP name.

506
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:57,650
And that's a,
it's a very highly innovative,

507
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,440
a app that not only does it,
you know,

508
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,380
you put in your macro has,
it's a macro calculator,

509
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,710
those,
that macro nutrient profile is in the 

510
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,971
system and you do body composition 
measurements a weekly and it calculates 

511
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,020
through what I would call an artificial 
intelligence system and ai system in the

512
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:23,021
algorithm to,
to adjust your calories week by week 

513
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:23,960
based on the progress that you're 
making.

514
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,110
And uh,
and it's the only system that I know of.

515
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,160
It's kind,
that's a,

516
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,180
like a macro tracking system that also 
gives you feedback on how to titrate 

517
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,970
your calories and your macros over time 
to hit specific body composition changes

518
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:41,360
that you want to get.
And this is the system.

519
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:43,660
It's the ideal platform to,
uh,

520
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,770
incorporate the ketogenic diet into.
So it's gonna take some work with the,

521
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,370
you know,
the guys that are writing software to 

522
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:54,370
design it.
But essentially,

523
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,601
you know,
you'll have available a key to genic 

524
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,821
diet app that we'll be able to adjust to
whatever output that you want,

525
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,030
whether it be managing seizures,
uh,

526
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,670
maybe a metabolic management of cancer 
or,

527
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,720
you know,
body composition changes or performance 

528
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:12,720
changes over time.
And that's all being written up.

529
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,430
Now.
I've got a bunch of questions.

530
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,220
First of all,
what do you,

531
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,770
what,
what,

532
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,730
what are your primary fats like when 
you,

533
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,140
when,
when you tell someone that your diet is,

534
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,110
I mean,
forget about the classic 90 percent fat,

535
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:26,120
but even 75 percent fat people just go.

536
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,160
Jesus,
like where?

537
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,000
Where's all that fat coming from?
Like what you,

538
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,080
what do you use for fats and do vary it.
Yeah.

539
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,250
Um,
my,

540
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,510
my dad is pretty.
I get the same 12 to 15 foods probably 

541
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,150
pretty much every week.
My wife kind of eats outside of the 

542
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:43,150
range of the Ketogenic Diet.
So sometimes,

543
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,050
or she.
Yeah.

544
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:44,990
How dare she?
Uh,

545
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,070
I don't try to pasta in front of you and
mock you a she does,

546
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,140
but I don't crave it.
So that's the thing.

547
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,140
And she thinks it's really strange.
I mean,

548
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,280
Italian,
I am,

549
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,010
so that created a bit of a problem with 
my family,

550
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,600
like when I go home,
yeah,

551
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:05,601
I was up on pasta so you might.
Carbohydrate tolerance is actually 

552
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,770
really good.
So if I go back to a higher carb diet,

553
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,480
uh,
you know,

554
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,530
I can't throw in three,
400 grams of carbs a day,

555
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,180
but I tolerate it very well.

556
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,980
So me going into a ketogenetic diet was 
a very strange thing for me to do that.

557
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Uh,
I had read Robb Wolfe's book and knew 

558
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,430
about the Paleo Diet and uh,
and even,

559
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,150
uh,
some,

560
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,680
some of the writings of Gary Taubes,
but I was a little hesitant or skeptical

561
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,910
about about it and skeptical.
Well,

562
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,990
I really thought that you need carbs to 
grow in the gym and maintain your 

563
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,330
strength and uh,
and performance.

564
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:43,200
And I just felt that the brain needs 
glucose for fuel and I didn't,

565
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:48,201
you know,
I was kind of unaware of the research 

566
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:48,670
that was done in Harvard in 1967,
uh,

567
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,690
by George Cahill.
And I did get a chance to talk to him 

568
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:53,690
for a pastor.
Rob Wolf is,

569
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,540
you know,
rob is really into Jujitsu,

570
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,610
right?
He's having an issue with maintaining a 

571
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,511
strict ketogenic diet.
I don't know if he's going with the 

572
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:02,511
classical ketogenic or the modified 
Atkins,

573
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:07,041
but he has a problem with having the,
the carbohydrate restriction when he has

574
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:08,940
really hard training days.

575
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,650
Yeah,
I would to,

576
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,680
I,
I've talked to rob about that a little 

577
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:15,680
bit.
Uh,

578
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,230
the body is incredibly adaptable to 
switching fuel sources and adapting to 

579
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,341
that fuel source over time.
And some people may be a little less 

580
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,500
adaptable than other people,
but I think that if he was to give it a,

581
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:28,530
I think you knowing rob,
he did give it a very legit shot.

582
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:33,531
He may benefit from adding some slow 
carbs in just prior to an intra workout.

583
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,340
During what's up?
What do you consider a slow carb?

584
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,420
Uh,
you know,

585
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,890
there are supplements out there,
but yeah,

586
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:42,330
if we're going to talk about,
uh,

587
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,990
I would say yeah,
maybe a little bit of sweet potato in,

588
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,600
you know,
prior to training or the day before,

589
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:52,890
maybe a few hours before.
So it's some sort of a car with a plenty

590
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:57,420
of fiber or something like a digest 
slowly the idea,

591
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,510
even a high molecular weight,
carbohydrates that are on the market 

592
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:02,510
now,
what are the,

593
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:02,780
um,
you know,

594
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,690
I don't use them anymore.

595
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,630
I know Jeff Bullock has a product out,
uh,

596
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,400
you can,
I think you can.

597
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,470
Starch is the name of it and it just,
uh,

598
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,750
you know,
it will slightly elevate your glucose 

599
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,570
and not trigger an insulin response so 
you won't go hypoglycemic after and 

600
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:20,570
it'll just,
you know,

601
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,450
essentially,
you know,

602
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,490
titrating carbohydrates and glucose into
your system over a predetermined period,

603
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,400
you know,
so they know that you're a,

604
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:33,750
it'll kind of hit your system and 
sustain it for three or four hours,

605
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,400
which is ideal for people engaging in,
you know,

606
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,410
a,
a,

607
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,340
an,
an,

608
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,890
a or cycling during that,
during that timeframe.

609
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,710
But I think,
I mean if you're getting in a sufficient

610
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:48,790
amount of calories and if you are using 
things like creatine monohydrate,

611
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,550
which knows where you work through the 
foster gen system,

612
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:56,551
you are able to generate atp for those 
short bursts of power that you need to 

613
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,610
manage your opponent and sustain it.

614
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,150
So for a supplementation,
if we're going to stop my creatine,

615
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,160
would you do that prior to the workout?
Would like know a lot of people take 

616
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,980
creatine,
postworkout?

617
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,120
Yeah.
I just,

618
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:10,960
uh,
you know,

619
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,970
if you're tickling pre attentive.
Yeah.

620
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:15,160
And you stopped taking,
created it's in your system for,

621
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,350
you know,
a couple of days to a week or more.

622
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,760
So it's just,
you know,

623
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,400
on a daily basis doesn't matter 
necessarily when you take it.

624
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:26,401
It's just that you take it on a and 
probably at least three grams per day 

625
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:28,330
for a larger guy at three to five grams 
per day.

626
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Is that something you take a,
it's one of the few supplements that I 

627
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,661
take.
I only take maybe three or four 

628
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:39,301
supplement.
I used to take all these different 

629
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:39,301
supplements so I'm more of a food guy.
Uh,

630
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:42,520
but maybe I'd take three or four 
supplements and they use some of the new

631
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,920
food products that are coming out on the
market now,

632
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,250
a junk food products and that allows me 
to maintain my kid drank diet when I'm 

633
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:50,250
traveling.

634
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,580
Do you ever mess around with Beta 
Alanine?

635
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,230
Yeah.
Uh,

636
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,280
it's something I use to increase a 
carnosine levels,

637
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,500
right?
It's something that I used in the past.

638
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:04,501
I don't like the tingles that I get a 
lot of people like to tinker with them 

639
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:07,630
and it's not quite that extreme.
It's like Niacin,

640
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,820
but it's working through a different 
receptor.

641
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:14,821
Yeah.
The first time I took notice and I 

642
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:14,821
thought I was going to die,
but yeah,

643
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,090
it's unpleasant.
It's not something that,

644
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,440
you know,
some people look forward to it.

645
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,910
I don't know,
those people are strange,

646
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:23,260
but the Beta Alanine is a good.
Makes me uncomfortable.

647
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,780
But I remember drinking on the way to 
the gym.

648
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:28,920
It was part of my preworkout formula.
Um,

649
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,080
and it just made me itchy.
It's didn't like it.

650
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:35,110
And you know that the data's not dance a
little bit.

651
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,040
It's not.
I wouldn't,

652
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,160
it's not what I would call compelling,
but it looks like it may offer a 

653
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,160
benefit.

654
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,920
It was just recommended to me.
That's why I brought it up.

655
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,600
So you're creating three grams per day 
and what do you that up to 15,

656
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:47,260
something like that.
What?

657
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:49,900
He was on the mark.
I would go to the.

658
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,310
I lost some weight or yeah,
that was like almost almost exactly.

659
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:57,220
So I had a couple of weeks ago I got 
down,

660
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,310
I did an a mission with NASA and I was 
underwater for a while and when it came 

661
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,170
back up,
how long is awhile?

662
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,230
Uh,
I was under for 10 days,

663
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,790
which is Christ.
That's more than a while.

664
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,070
It makes me an aquanaut yeah.
Wow.

665
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,540
That's crazy.
So,

666
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,970
and during that time,
during the training for it,

667
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,820
I was doing a lot of swimming,
which was a,

668
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,940
I sink like a rock.
I'm kind of negatively buoyant and so it

669
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,970
took a lot out of me and I tried to get 
into my file that I was like closer to 

670
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,490
200.

671
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,450
I think maybe you'd be more likely to be
an astronaut candidate for your,

672
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,370
like lower weight and space is a big 
thing.

673
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:35,371
Has Been.
So I tried to get my body weight from 

674
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:35,371
2:26
down to two.

675
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:35,371
Oh seven.
And I did it,

676
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,660
took about three months and now I'm 
creeping slowly back up.

677
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,690
I'm down.
And what did you do to do just high 

678
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,700
aerobic workout restriction?
I did intermittent fasting.

679
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Really just transitioned to a diet where
I typically to a ketogenic breakfast 

680
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:54,761
that's kind of small and I would made 
that a little bit smaller and two or 

681
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:55,520
three days out of the week,
um,

682
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,580
on average I would just kind of naughty 
until dinner and then I would eat a 

683
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,160
substantial dinner and then maybe do 
some activity after that and then kind 

684
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,820
of nibble at nighttime,
maybe an hour or two before bed.

685
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,530
And that was kind of my routine.

686
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,950
So almost like a warrior diet type deal.
Pretty close to that.

687
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:17,951
Yeah.
From what I know that that's pretty 

688
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:19,511
close to that and I did not in any way 
feel deprived of food and that's really,

689
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:25,181
you know,
people who follow a low carb diet or 

690
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:27,311
ketogenic diet,
they think you don't have to count 

691
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:27,311
macros,
which was like the biggest mistake.

692
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:28,970
They think you just go on this and you 
don't have to count calories,

693
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:31,070
but you really do.
I mean you could sit back,

694
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,420
you could sit down in front of the TV 
with like a bag of cashews and I can 

695
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,840
Polish that off pretty quick and you 
could do a lot of damage.

696
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:38,580
Like that's a lot of calories.
Yeah.

697
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,000
It depends on the kind of foods that 
you're eating.

698
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:44,960
Two handfuls of almonds I think is like 
500 calories or something.

699
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,420
Yeah.
That's like,

700
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,390
that doesn't even make sense.

701
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,390
Yeah.
So I talked to people who follow the 

702
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:52,400
Diet and they're like,
the huge one diet doesn't work for me.

703
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:55,250
I got on it and I gained like three 
pounds and I was like,

704
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,420
well,
what was your calories?

705
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,390
What was your macros?
Oh,

706
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,520
I have no idea.
I don't.

707
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:00,080
I was told I don't,
I'll have to count that,

708
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,180
you know,
that's the most important thing.

709
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,600
So this is the function of the APP I 
told you about Avatar,

710
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,530
which is kind of a macro counting 
program.

711
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,990
Uh,
right now you can set the adjustments to

712
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,460
do low carb,
but uh,

713
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:16,580
the,
once the software is written up to,

714
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,440
uh,
for the Quito option,

715
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,770
that will be a tremendous resource for 
people.

716
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:26,771
The average person that wants to do the 
occasion Hank Diet and hopefully we're 

717
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:26,771
going to craft it in a way to,
to,

718
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:27,760
to help the,
uh,

719
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,270
the clinical community too.

720
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's one of the reasons why I wanted to 
have you on is because you're an actual 

721
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,611
scientist and this is,
there's so many misconceptions when it 

722
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:37,611
comes to ketogenic diet,
at the benefits,

723
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,120
the problems associated with it.
And there's a bunch of people that.

724
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:47,450
One of the things that I've found really
fascinating is recently because the 

725
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,331
ketogenic diet has become so popular,
there's been these sort of sparsely 

726
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:56,910
educated meathead trainer type dudes 
that are pulling the ketogenic diet.

727
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,440
And whenever I see that happen,
I go,

728
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,500
oh,
here's a person whose ideas are 

729
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:03,970
threatened and you know,
like whenever someone says the Ketogenic

730
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,530
Diet is not beneficial or it's not 
really worth it,

731
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:08,040
I'm like,
okay,

732
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,060
but you're not saying anything like 
where's the science like point to 

733
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,050
something because there's a substantial 
amount of science that shows the benefit

734
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,260
of the key to genic diet.
But there's a lot of meat heads that 

735
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,990
are,
that have been critical of it.

736
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,310
And when I,
when I read that,

737
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:23,820
I'm like,
okay,

738
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,360
you're not saying anything.
Like there's no substantial reason why 

739
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,261
you're critical of it.
This makes me think that you have been 

740
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:33,750
pushing a certain type of diet for a 
long time.

741
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,860
This comes along,
it shows contrary evidence and trying to

742
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,800
diminish it in some sort of a way,
but without any actual science.

743
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,010
So what have been the criticisms of the 
Ketogenic Diet and how many of them are 

744
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,541
actually valid in terms of when,
when what I'm talking about when I'm 

745
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:55,521
talking to people,
especially if I'm talking to 

746
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,141
professional athletes,
I'm talking to athletes who's very 

747
00:35:57,141 --> 00:35:57,720
health is very critical that they have 
energy,

748
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,010
right?
We were talking about fighters.

749
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,510
So for them like to recommend a 
ketogenic diet to a fighter,

750
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,950
it's very tricky because we,
you're talking like one percent,

751
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,980
two percent performance could be the 
difference between victory and defeat 

752
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,300
and maybe even being knocked out or 
submitted and being successful.

753
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:18,930
Yeah,
so I think most important people need to

754
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:23,931
appreciate that when you transition your
body from burning carbohydrates and 

755
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:28,191
glucose and forcing it to rely primarily
all fat and ketones for fuel or not.

756
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,070
It's not one or the other,
but you're shifting for the predominant 

757
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,940
fuel source to be fat and ketones.
And that's not happening.

758
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,970
That's not something that happens like 
overnight and it doesn't even happen in 

759
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,440
two or three weeks.
So what I've seen in elite level,

760
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,470
cyclist and and other types of sports is
that it really takes a minimum of three 

761
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,680
months,
ideally six months and even after a year

762
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,120
I think you're getting a changes even at
the epigenetic level.

763
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:02,121
We know that ketones function as a 
signaling molecule through histone 

764
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:06,651
deacetylase activity that it's actually 
turning on genes that are causing 

765
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:10,110
adaptations in our body and these,
these happened slowly over time.

766
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,110
The more you follow the huge hank diet,
the easier it gets because there's a 

767
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,890
learning curve to to implementing it,
but the more you follow it,

768
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:21,891
the easier it gets and the more benefits
you derive from it over time and those 

769
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:26,361
benefits really don't start to emerge.
The benefits that that I'm thinking 

770
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:31,401
about after about two or three months 
and you're talking about benefits on a 

771
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:34,911
cellular level,
not a performance from a performance 

772
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:34,920
level,
a minimum of two months,

773
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,400
like your performance will go down.
So you have to accept,

774
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:41,130
I mean this is something that voters 
would have to do in the off season.

775
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,790
Athletes.
I was stunned at how much of an impact 

776
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,790
it had on me.
I mean,

777
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,300
I mean,
how fast were the benefits?

778
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,990
Well,
the benefits of the weight loss was 

779
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:53,990
pretty,
pretty significant.

780
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:58,521
Pretty quickly.
I lost a few pounds within the first 

781
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:00,150
week or two,
whereas I'm pretty active and it's not,

782
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,910
you know,
it didn't change much other than that.

783
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Um,
but what I was amazed at like the Keto 

784
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,180
flu,
you know,

785
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,291
what people call the Keto flu.
Did you get that dragging for the first 

786
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:16,280
week or two?
Like I was just dry and I would do a 

787
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,280
hard workout.
I was like,

788
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,260
oh my God,
I don't know how to keep doing that.

789
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:17,690
Yeah,
okay.

790
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,490
That's like a big one was hitting the 
bag.

791
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,490
That's what I would really feel it 
because uh,

792
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:25,300
you know,
I do rounds or I'll,

793
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:26,130
I'll set,
you know,

794
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:27,600
like a,
a certain amount of rounds,

795
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:32,601
a certain amount of time and that's when
I can really feel the difference from 

796
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:35,500
day to day and I'm just really 
struggling.

797
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,100
Yeah.

798
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,130
And how long did it take you to adapt to
that?

799
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:40,350
Or did you adapt to that?

800
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,650
Like A,
a month in?

801
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,320
It started to

802
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,920
normalize,
but I mean that would be consistent with

803
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:49,490
the literature if you're looking at 
cyclists and if you're,

804
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,960
you know,
a number of different athletes,

805
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,170
it takes about six weeks.
I mean your performance will go down and

806
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:56,840
then start to creep up back to baseline 
at,

807
00:38:56,841 --> 00:39:01,841
around the six week mark and if you 
adhere to it strictly and really stick 

808
00:39:02,061 --> 00:39:03,230
with your training,
you know,

809
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:08,330
in the 12 week mark you could be 
breaking new pgrs depending on personal 

810
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:10,650
words.
Yeah,

811
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,320
yeah.
Non personal records.

812
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:17,000
And that's primarily directed to a,
I would say endurance athletes,

813
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:20,260
ultra marathon athletes to cyclists who 
runners too,

814
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,800
you know,
iron man athletes.

815
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,650
Uh,
and the thing that had merged out of all

816
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:29,651
the emails that I get people sending me 
blood work and their performance 

817
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,640
measurements is that I used to think it 
was about a month or two.

818
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:36,641
It's more like three months to six 
months when they really start hitting 

819
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,690
their stride because I think there's 
pretty profound changes when you,

820
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,470
when you alter the fuel that you're 
giving your body in such a profound way.

821
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,780
Well,
one of the first things that I noticed 

822
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,000
the benefit,
one of the first benefits was cognitive 

823
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,070
clarity,
um,

824
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,910
lack of fogginess towards the middle of 
the day,

825
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,320
the no desire to take a nap and no a 
note drop.

826
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,250
Like,
you know,

827
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,950
I would have the,
the big meal thing and then the drop the

828
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:03,150
valley when you know,
like,

829
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,100
oh,
your body's digesting everything.

830
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:07,830
And people.
I thought that was just how you lived.

831
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,960
I thought there was no getting around 
that.

832
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,660
That's life you eat,
then you get sleepy.

833
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,260
I just,
yeah,

834
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,260
I didn't think that there was any other 
options going on.

835
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:18,540
A ketogenic diet completely changed 
that.

836
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,160
And when I would tell people about it,
they're like,

837
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:20,940
nothing.
I'd be like,

838
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,890
I'm telling you,
there is no difference.

839
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,070
I mean I would eat a meal and go 
throughout my day and then it'd be like 

840
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,070
4:00
in the afternoon.

841
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,790
I'm like,
where's this crash?

842
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,620
The crash is supposed to be here.
Like,

843
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,980
where's it coming?
No crash.

844
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,300
Yeah.
Same thing with me.

845
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,030
Uh,
I mean looking back at an Undergrad when

846
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:39,300
I was like task loaded with a lot of 
classes and stuff I would make,

847
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:41,030
I was trying to bulk up at the time and 
I would,

848
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,100
I would put like steak or beef on a 
Bagel so I would cut a Bagel kind of in 

849
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,660
half and put like meat and stuff.
So I would be getting all the carbs from

850
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:52,340
the Bagel and I would just go get a big 
starbucks coffee to,

851
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,260
to mitigate that crash that I would 
have.

852
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:00,290
And now,
so the key to genic diet when you eat a 

853
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:00,290
meal,
it essentially,

854
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,091
if it does not abolish,
is significantly attenuate that insulin 

855
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:06,230
response that you get.
So if you,

856
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:11,250
you know,
where something like a continuous blood 

857
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,250
glucose measurement,
like a dexcon or something,

858
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,980
and you look at that and you eat a,
a standard American diet,

859
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:18,870
you see a big spike in glucose,
typically in the postprandial glucose,

860
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,460
that'll be hypoglycemic.

861
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,700
And when you do that,
not only does your mental and physical 

862
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,341
performance crash,
but you crave food so that we'll send 

863
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:28,341
you,
searching,

864
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:28,470
sending you,
running to the refrigerator.

865
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,660
Again,
to seek a reward,

866
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,400
to mitigate that,
that dysphoria,

867
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,710
I would say that you get from the 
hypoglycemia,

868
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,850
so when you on a Ketogenic Diet,
you essentially abolished that you don't

869
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:44,210
have this spike in glucose which spikes 
insulin and your.

870
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,570
Your energy levels are maintained in.
The big thing is cognitive.

871
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,040
So the cognitive resilience is is a big 
thing.

872
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:57,041
So even if you're hypoglycemic,
you could like use something to lower 

873
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,360
your blood glucose,
insulin and push it down to a level that

874
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:02,420
would put someone into a coma and if 
their ketones are elevated,

875
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,850
they are asymptomatic.
For hypoglycemia,

876
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,150
and this was a study actually going back
to the work done by George Cahill at 

877
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,261
Harvard where he fasted subjects for 40 
days and he did a battery of cognitive 

878
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:19,601
tests and he measured blood going to the
brain and blood coming away from the 

879
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:19,601
brain.

880
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:23,440
And he determined that about 70 percent 
of brain energy metabolism is derived 

881
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,491
from ketones when you're fasting.
And the same occurs with a ketogenic 

882
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:31,451
diet too.
So you are literally switching the fuel 

883
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:33,320
source that your brain is using.
But in an extension of the study,

884
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:38,321
he injected to 20,
I use of Insulin and pushed glucose down

885
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,060
to one millimolar,
uh,

886
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:43,420
which is universally fatal and everyone,
so you take a crowd of people are eating

887
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,020
a standard diet and push it down to 
that,

888
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,160
they'd,
they'd all die.

889
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:51,490
So none of them died in the study.
I have no idea how they got it passed 

890
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,361
the Irb,
the ethics review in Harvard Medical 

891
00:42:55,361 --> 00:42:55,361
School.
But they did.

892
00:42:55,361 --> 00:42:55,700
What year was this?
Nineteen 67.

893
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,150
And it was a steady.
I became completely fascinated with 

894
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,811
because I couldn't believe that they did
it because you can't even do it in 

895
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:04,811
animals nowadays.

896
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:05,180
You know,
the IOC committee of the Animal Care and

897
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:06,320
use committee would,
uh,

898
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,660
would put a stop to that very quick.
You know,

899
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:13,661
they probably sent the investigator out 
of the university if they propose to do 

900
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,450
some of the studies that were done.
Uh,

901
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,530
but what they,
when they lowered blood glucose down to 

902
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,230
that level,
which would put someone into a coma,

903
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,770
the subjects were asymptomatic for 
hypoglycemia because they,

904
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,800
their brains were keto adapted.
They had essentially been over a week 

905
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,170
and in a fasted state,
they were all kind of heavyset.

906
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,320
They were divinity students,
uh,

907
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,180
and a few,
I think we're Harvard medical students,

908
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,040
so they tend to be overweight.
So there,

909
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:42,041
there were liberating a lot of fat from 
the adipose and making lots of ketones 

910
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,330
and they were in a state where their 
brain was tremendously resilient against

911
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,760
hypoglycemia because their ketones were 
elevated.

912
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:51,410
And that has practical implications for 
so many different.

913
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,900
And I was reading this and couldn't 
believe what I was reading.

914
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,610
I called George Cahill.
We talked about it.

915
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:57,920
I called all these old time,
you know,

916
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:00,980
physiologists that were in the field 
just to pick their brain.

917
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:03,410
And they were like thrilled that a young
guy,

918
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,900
you know,
just entering ag,

919
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:09,901
a tenure track position was going to 
like kind of make this as career goes 

920
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,390
back a ways.
But I saw all the implications,

921
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,750
not just for epilepsy but for things 
like Alzheimer's disease,

922
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,120
traumatic brain injury,
and uh,

923
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,440
a whole host of neurological disorders.
Like there's one in particular called 

924
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,430
Glucose transporter type one deficiency 
syndrome or glut one deficiency.

925
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,700
And the kids that have this literally 
have a deficiency of the glucose 

926
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
transporter on the blood brain barrier 
and their,

927
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,320
their blood glucose is normal,
a normal levels,

928
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,100
but the glucose in their cerebral spinal
fluid is under a two millimolar,

929
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,790
which is,
I mean,

930
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,730
their brains are essentially living in 
hypoglycemia.

931
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,570
So they're constantly having seizures.
They can't move a lot of them.

932
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,690
They're confined to a wheelchair.
You put them on a Ketogenic Diet,

933
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,400
uh,
many of them wake up,

934
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:56,490
they start walking around,
their motor function is reversed.

935
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:01,520
So it,
the key to genic diet restores brain 

936
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,451
energy metabolism in these kids that 
can't use glucose as an energy source 

937
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,460
with this disorder,
it's called Glucose transporter type one

938
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:13,461
deficiency syndrome.
And another very interesting example of 

939
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:17,541
a disorder where there is a persistent 
molecular pathology where the symptoms 

940
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:22,431
can be largely silenced with the,
the application of a key to genic diet 

941
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,130
that needs to be pretty strict.
And that's where ketone supplements come

942
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:27,150
in.
So I was,

943
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:28,590
you know,
one,

944
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,360
it's,
it's difficult for some of these kids to

945
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:35,361
follow occasioning diet.
So like a ketone supplement can 

946
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:36,840
potentially circumvent the dietary 
restriction.

947
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:41,841
That's needed for kidogenic diet and 
make it easier for parents and kids to 

948
00:45:41,841 --> 00:45:46,821
implement,
but I also think that a ketone 

949
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:49,431
supplement can just further elevate 
ketones if you're on a ketogenic diet 

950
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:53,870
and further augment the therapeutic 
efficacy of the ketogenic diet or 

951
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,640
performance enhancing efficacy.
So my main application is the warfighter

952
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,700
and maybe astronauts do a.
So we just think of it as a way to 

953
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,000
augment further,
augment a therapeutic effect or a safety

954
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:11,001
effect when it comes to divers or 
performance effect when it comes to the 

955
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:11,001
warfighters are diverse.

956
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:11,980
Now when you,
um,

957
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,510
excuse me,
when you,

958
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:16,480
when you talk to people about mental 
performance,

959
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,680
have there been studies that have shown 
any variation between,

960
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,770
uh,
the same individuals on a Ketogenic Diet

961
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,800
or carbohydrate,
glucose based diet in terms of mental 

962
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:28,800
function?

963
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,450
Not good studies and not really good.
So what Ha has been done?

964
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Uh,
I mean the first study I would say 

965
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,030
purely key to genic study that I'm aware
of.

966
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:41,520
Use something as simple as medium chain 
triglycerides.

967
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,670
And uh,
it was actually a substance that the 

968
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,650
chemical name was ace 12.
Oh,

969
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:50,600
two.
And that substance is in the patent list

970
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,290
as a substance called AC 12.
Oh,

971
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:56,310
two for people unfamiliar with mct oil,
coconut oil.

972
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,910
Yeah.
So if you were to pull this patent,

973
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,080
uh,
interestingly,

974
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:02,280
Mike,
my colleague and friend,

975
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:06,490
Dr Mary Newport did and wrote a book on 
Alzheimer's disease about the use of,

976
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,160
of ketones for Alzheimer's.
Uh,

977
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:14,210
she identified that the ingredients in 
this supplement that helped to enhance 

978
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:18,240
cognitive function in people with mild 
cognitive impairment.

979
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,310
The,
the ingredient of this,

980
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:23,130
if you dig into the patent,
was caprylic triglyceride,

981
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,070
which is a medium chain triglyceride,
mct oil.

982
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:31,790
And they did a study.
It was a double blind controlled study 

983
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:35,071
that showed that people who 
interestingly they were not apo e four 

984
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:36,400
positive,
that group did not respond.

985
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:37,480
But,
uh,

986
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,730
which is another kind of pathway we can 
go down,

987
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:44,731
but they,
their improvement in cognitive function 

988
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:47,740
correlated with their elevation and 
ketone levels with this supplement.

989
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:52,770
It was a fat that when you consume it 
independent and the amount of 

990
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,491
carbohydrates you consume,
it converts that fat into Beta 

991
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:59,710
hydroxybutyrate,
which you can measure with a little 

992
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,921
blood meter and adds that level creeped 
up and it didn't even have to creep up 

993
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,671
that high.
It was like point six that they were 

994
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:08,401
getting significant improvements in the 
mini mental status test and other tests 

995
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,020
that are sort of like the standard test 
for Alzheimer's disease.

996
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,470
And that really got me interested 
because I knew that levels could go up 

997
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,611
way higher than point zero six and 
they're showing that there's a 

998
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:23,940
correlation as ketone levels rise up,
uh,

999
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,920
that you have a proportional increase in
cognitive function.

1000
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,790
So I'm thinking with a ketone ester or 
other types of Ketones,

1001
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,770
you could elevate that to one,
two,

1002
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:37,771
three and four millimolar and then get 
some really robust because that's 

1003
00:48:37,771 --> 00:48:42,181
sending a lot of energy to the brain.
So every millimolar of Beta 

1004
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:46,801
hydroxybutyrate that's in your blood 
could it's been estimated that it gives 

1005
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:46,801
you,
like your brain,

1006
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:51,451
about a 10 percent boost in energy.
It can restore energy up to up to 10 

1007
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,840
percent.
If you look at a,

1008
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,200
if you do a,
an fdg pet scan and um,

1009
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,670
and a ketone pet scan,
so you do a dual imaging for that.

1010
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,510
Dr Steven Koonin in Canada has done 
some,

1011
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,280
some work on that,
but that's insane that it was so,

1012
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:08,630
like for

1013
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,620
college students or someone who's 
studying for an exam or someone is about

1014
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:14,650
to do something very important.
I'm exogenous.

1015
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,900
Ketones should be like standard,

1016
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:17,950
right?
Well,

1017
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,320
uh,
yeah,

1018
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,010
there's some pretty good evidence to 
show,

1019
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,830
but is that especially if you have a 
deficit,

1020
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,640
right.
So,

1021
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,170
uh,
and actually,

1022
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,960
you know,
the application that I'm using it for is

1023
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:31,840
in an extreme environment when your 
brain is already at a deficit.

1024
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,030
Uh,
but we could say we're at a deficit,

1025
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:37,000
right?
So tomorrow I'm jumping on a red eye and

1026
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:39,340
I can't sleep on a plane and night land,
you know,

1027
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:44,341
and go to my university where I have to 
teach for a couple hours and then drive 

1028
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:47,881
a couple hours north and give another 
lecture at night and I'll be on zero 

1029
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,971
sleep.
And I would not even attempt that if I 

1030
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:50,971
was,
you know,

1031
00:49:50,971 --> 00:49:54,760
wasn't doing what I have been doing.
Like I've kind of figured out protocols 

1032
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,670
where I can allow me to function even on
extreme lack of sleep.

1033
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,130
So build the motor through it.

1034
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,010
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but.

1035
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:06,011
So when you land,
so what would you immediately take some 

1036
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:06,520
sort of an exotic as ketone,
some sort of what,

1037
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:07,520
what do you take?
Like what are you,

1038
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:08,390
ketone supplements?
That's

1039
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,700
a lie.
There's a wide variety of ketone 

1040
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,500
supplements on the market.
So I'm kind of a food guy so I just used

1041
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:20,950
them a almost kind of sparingly,
but I do tend to use them every day.

1042
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:26,010
Uh,
the supplements that I've packed my bag 

1043
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:26,920
are.
The key genex supplement is one that I'm

1044
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,980
a ben using and also the Pruvit Keto os 
product that mixes Beta hydroxybutyrate 

1045
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:38,590
salt with mct powder.
So there's a couple other forms of just 

1046
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,690
Beta hydroxy butyrate,
but our studies show that just consuming

1047
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:44,730
Beta hydroxy butyrate does not give you,
at least in the,

1048
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:49,850
the ketone salt formula,
does not give you a lot of the benefits 

1049
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,620
that we see in some of the studies that 
we're running and the Beta 

1050
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,570
hydroxybutyrate needs to be mixed with 
medium chain triglyceride fat and that's

1051
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:59,960
pretty important and I think that that 
has a number of benefits.

1052
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,020
The medium chain triglyceride delays 
gastric absorption,

1053
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,480
so,
uh,

1054
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:09,490
it also further boost ketone levels 
higher than you could get with ketone 

1055
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,360
salts alone.
So you get an elevation of ketone levels

1056
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:16,361
that sustained for longer and that 
probably that sustainment is due to kind

1057
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:22,271
of delaying gastric absorption because 
the fat kind of delays the release of 

1058
00:51:22,271 --> 00:51:23,240
the ketones into the blood stream.
And it also,

1059
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:25,310
it's stimulating your own ketone 
production.

1060
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:30,340
So you're taking a fat right?
And that's what happens when you 

1061
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,651
mobilize body fat.
You have a wide variety of enzymes that 

1062
00:51:32,651 --> 00:51:34,040
convert that fat into ketones.
If you take a ketogenic fat,

1063
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:39,041
the same thing is happening.
You're revving up that system in 

1064
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:39,920
addition to the exogenous ketones,
so the,

1065
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,520
the pruvit product,
Quito as a key gen x and,

1066
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,590
and there was a couple other companies 
emerging on the market.

1067
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:48,110
We have our own company,
a ketone technologies,

1068
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,370
and we are partnering with government 
agencies like Department of the fence,

1069
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:57,490
Onr,
NASA to do research to fund research 

1070
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,980
with these institutes to really nail 
down the optimal formula,

1071
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:06,420
uh,
for antiseizure affects the optimal 

1072
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,101
formula for a motor function,
affects the optimal formula even for 

1073
00:52:09,101 --> 00:52:09,140
strength.

1074
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,450
And the one was strength will probably 
involve,

1075
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,070
you know,
adding amino acids,

1076
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:18,071
adding creatine monohydrate.
So these will be formulas that will be 

1077
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:18,590
optimized.
So our company is working on that.

1078
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:21,440
We don't have any products yet,
but if you sign up for the newsletter,

1079
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,080
we,
we will update people on the newsletter.

1080
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,870
And then when the products do come out 
in emerge,

1081
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,550
you know,
we'll kind of let people know.

1082
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,530
So when you,
when you say you're a food guy,

1083
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,010
are there any foods that you can eat 
that will sardines,

1084
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,520
sardines?
Yes.

1085
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,000
It's,
I,

1086
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:41,770
I travel with a,
this trip it was canned chicken and 

1087
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,960
sardines.
So there's a couple of wild planet makes

1088
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,810
a good Ken and Tim Ferriss,
I kind of turned him onto it and uh,

1089
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,400
it really exploded the company,
like kind of emailed me and thanked me,

1090
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:53,870
you know,
they're really exploding.

1091
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,220
So it's a small company.

1092
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,220
They do wild wild planet sardines and 
they're packed and olive oil and there 

1093
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,120
might be,
depending on what you buy,

1094
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,220
like a little bit of lemon,
they might have a slice of lemon or 

1095
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,220
lightly lightly smoked or whatever,
but they are really,

1096
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:11,990
really good.
And uh,

1097
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,430
I mean I look forward to eating them.
Uh,

1098
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,300
for me I'm kind of weird.
Like that is a treat for me.

1099
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,980
Uh,
and that's,

1100
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,310
you know,
I've taken a lot of different things and

1101
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:26,220
experimented with a lot of different 
things and simply just eating sardines.

1102
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:29,550
Like it's like the perfect food and eggs
to are the perfect food.

1103
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,890
You asked me like where I get my fat 
from A.

1104
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:34,490
I do get a lot from the olive oil that 
are packed in this already.

1105
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:37,170
And so I eat a lot of fatty fish,
lots of egg yolks.

1106
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,340
I will make an egg yolk omelet and I'll 
give the whites to my dog for protein,

1107
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:46,370
you know,
cause they need a little bit more 

1108
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,231
protein,
so I'll make an egg yolk omelet and I 

1109
00:53:48,231 --> 00:53:49,320
will cook it in butter and um,
you know,

1110
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:51,660
maybe make some asparagus on the side,
like cooked in butter.

1111
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,110
So I get a lot of fat from a macadamia 
nuts,

1112
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,050
a few nuts,
sardines,

1113
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:03,051
fatty fish,
a lot of salmon and a lot of egg yolks 

1114
00:54:03,051 --> 00:54:03,480
and fatty cuts of meat.
So we go to the butcher and particularly

1115
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:07,710
pick out fatty cuts of meat.
And I'm olive oil,

1116
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:11,450
coconut oil,
mct oil are all things that we have you.

1117
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,090
Have you ever had issues with Sardines 
and heavy metals?

1118
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,110
No.
Um,

1119
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,900
I think heavy metals are more of an 
issue with larger predatory fish.

1120
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,050
Like,
I mean,

1121
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:27,930
I think swordfish would be kind of at 
the top of the chain there.

1122
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,910
Uh,
of course,

1123
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:34,911
you know,
you're eating like a Maaco shark or 

1124
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:34,911
something like that and you're going to 
be ingesting.

1125
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:35,790
And if you do that on a daily base,
I wouldn't want.

1126
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,310
If you're a pregnant woman,
you know,

1127
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,240
I would stay away from big predatory 
fish,

1128
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:44,450
but one thing about sardines is that 
they can be farmed in a sustainable way 

1129
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,480
and uh,
the,

1130
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,520
the amount of heavy metals will be 
typically proportional to the size of 

1131
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:51,690
the fish and whether it's predatory.

1132
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,780
The reason why I'm asking this is I was 
eating sardines like two cans a day for 

1133
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,231
a while and I got my blood work done and
there was like a very trace amount of 

1134
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:03,540
arsenic and my sister arsenic and the 
doctor said,

1135
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:08,870
what are you eating?
And he was going over to different 

1136
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,870
things.
I said,

1137
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:09,060
I eat a lot of sardines.
Do you know where it came from?

1138
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,950
Those out the sardines?
Yeah.

1139
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,560
No,
I don't know,

1140
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,400
just whatever was on the shelf.
I mean,

1141
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:18,360
we travel all over,
we're in Borneo and uh,

1142
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:23,361
you know,
Malaysia and Indonesia and all these 

1143
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,101
places and you see some,
some boats coming in and those sardines 

1144
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:25,760
are going to various plants.
So,

1145
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:28,710
and even bigger companies,
you know,

1146
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:31,860
we'll source out wherever,
wherever is cheapest.

1147
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,640
Uh,
so I like to be pretty particular about,

1148
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:40,641
especially if I'm going to eat something
in such a high volume like where it's 

1149
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:44,121
coming from to actually visit the plant 
and where it's coming in and get some 

1150
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:44,970
information to where it's coming from.

1151
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,710
A,
you know,

1152
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:51,711
we,
I do use some of the meats from the 

1153
00:55:51,711 --> 00:55:54,060
butcher box,
so butcher box offers a wide array of,

1154
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,870
of meat from grass fed animals and,
and that's,

1155
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,460
uh,
a lot of our meals at nighttime are,

1156
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:00,950
uh,
from,

1157
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,430
from butcher box.
Uh,

1158
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:03,930
but that's interesting about the 
arsenic,

1159
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,220
you know,
arsenic can,

1160
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:10,270
uh,
get concentrated in the ground where 

1161
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:10,470
plants are grown in.
So,

1162
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:11,670
uh,
if,

1163
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
if rice is grown in,
in China or whatever plant is grown in 

1164
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,050
China and that,
that soil has arsenic in it.

1165
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,480
Uh,
I lived behind our house,

1166
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:25,630
we had like a peach orchard and apple 
orchards are notorious for this,

1167
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:30,631
for having high levels of arsenic just 
based on the chemicals that were used 

1168
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:31,600
over time.
And uh,

1169
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,660
so this is something to consider.
Maybe it's something you were eating 

1170
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:36,660
with the sardines or maybe it was a 
sardines itself,

1171
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,530
depending on what's already into 
reading.

1172
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,840
Have the nutritionist was pretty 
convinced that with sardines,

1173
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:43,200
want to cut them out in one way?
Yeah,

1174
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,340
he was saying that it was probably just 
from pollution.

1175
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,990
Yeah,
it could be.

1176
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Yeah.
I mean that's why it's really important 

1177
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:52,800
to pick out,
you know,

1178
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,160
where your food's coming from.
This company you recommend wild planet.

1179
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,140
They're fantastic coming is doing the 
farm in this audience.

1180
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,470
Uh,
yeah,

1181
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:04,471
they have.
There's different methods that you can 

1182
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:05,140
use that uh,
would kind of put you in the category of

1183
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:10,141
sustainable farming for sardines.
So it's one of the few fishes that are 

1184
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:13,000
really low on the spectrum of,
of having heavy metals and things.

1185
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:14,010
So if you're,
you know,

1186
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,660
there's women.
I get this question a lot like,

1187
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,490
you know,
if a woman becomes pregnant,

1188
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,050
you know,
should they stop eating fish?

1189
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,700
Who did they stop eating,
you know,

1190
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,610
a Ahi tuna,
swordfish and things I would say.

1191
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Yeah,
definitely the big predatory fish you'd 

1192
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:29,640
probably want to cut back on.
Um,

1193
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,770
I did take a couple courses in 
neurotoxicology where we went over,

1194
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:36,340
like mercury poisoning and,
and every possible chemical and,

1195
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:40,840
and just the take home message was a for
the normal person,

1196
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,930
probably not an issue.
Um,

1197
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,420
you know,
unless you're consuming really high 

1198
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:48,420
levels.
In,

1199
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,380
in Grad school I was eating these big 
cans like 12,

1200
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:55,381
I think there are 12 ounce cans of tuna 
fish and there was like five servings 

1201
00:57:55,381 --> 00:57:55,960
per can and I would eat like three cans 
a day.

1202
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Like I would take that and add,
I was fat phobic at the time that it 

1203
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,080
would be a chunk light tuna now to put 
balsamic vinegar on it.

1204
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:07,081
And I would literally eat three of these
12 ounce cans a day and that would be 15

1205
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:09,010
servings of tune per day.

1206
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,700
And I did that day in and day out.
And uh,

1207
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,090
no ill effects.
Uh,

1208
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:18,091
well I never got tested at the time.
So nowadays I tend to do a lot of blood 

1209
00:58:18,091 --> 00:58:18,650
work just to check different things.
Uh,

1210
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,060
but no overt signs of toxicity or 
anything.

1211
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,190
Uh,
maybe like a little someone,

1212
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,190
one of the professors that I was doing 
something for,

1213
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:32,191
she had or her friend had lost a lot of 
hair due to eating tuna that had high 

1214
00:58:32,191 --> 00:58:35,560
mercury and at the time like Kinda had a
lot of hair loss at the time,

1215
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:37,180
but it was also kind of a stressful 
period.

1216
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,580
So maybe when I stopped eating I noticed
like,

1217
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:45,020
this is back in my mid twenties now.
I haven't had a significant amount of 

1218
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:45,480
air loss since,
since,

1219
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,420
uh,
uh,

1220
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,950
and a couple people,
you know,

1221
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,980
and that actually that's one of the 
symptoms to have mercury toxicity.

1222
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,430
We are tingling and feelings like kind 
of neurological effects.

1223
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,010
So just something,
something that you consider a,

1224
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,880
but getting tested is probably a good 
thing to do.

1225
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,570
I've heard that from people that just 
consumed ridiculous amounts of Sushi.

1226
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,230
Yeah.
But I would,

1227
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,970
I would imagine like Sushi or dealing 
with smaller portions of the actual fish

1228
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:11,890
itself,
it might be,

1229
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:16,891
if you do that day in and day out,
it's probably good to get tested and 

1230
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:18,280
sometimes may not show up in the blood 
in the serum.

1231
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:22,010
You might have to look at the red blood 
cell because sometimes you know,

1232
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,160
some of these metals are more reflective
of the levels on the,

1233
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:29,480
on the red blood cells or the hair too.
So there's different ways that you can.

1234
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,210
You can measure it.
I read that you eat.

1235
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,050
Was it candy oysters as well?
Yeah.

1236
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,380
Yep.
It's something I usually bring it 

1237
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:40,380
thought.

1238
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:40,380
I think I brought on this trip to like 
candy oysters,

1239
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,610
King Oscar.
There's a few brands out there that I 

1240
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,131
kind of vetted out things and oysters 
are really rich and a lot of 

1241
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:49,880
micronutrients that could,
you could get depleted in,

1242
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:51,440
on the Ketogenic Diet.
So B,

1243
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:56,470
12 is something I do supplement 
magnesium to be 12 insulation from 

1244
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,110
Ketogenic Diet.
What would that come from?

1245
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,870
Well,
you know,

1246
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,960
it could be due to a sources of b 12 
that you're kind of eliminating through 

1247
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,920
food choices on the ketogenic diet.
A,

1248
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,780
b,
12 was basically an animal based.

1249
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,880
Uh,
yeah.

1250
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,740
Pretty much.
Yeah.

1251
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:20,741
And I've,
I've never met or I think I did measure 

1252
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:23,321
that once and it wasn't.
But people have reported to me that it 

1253
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:26,291
was the thing that showed up on my blood
work was lower on the low end of 

1254
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:30,641
magnesium and I was getting cramps at 
the time and that's the only you asked 

1255
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:30,641
about side effects.

1256
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:33,860
So the only side effect that I 
experienced was cramps at nighttime,

1257
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,920
always between three and four in the 
morning and it would start in my foot 

1258
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,520
and then start to creep up to my cab 
and,

1259
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,640
or if I did like legs or something,
sometimes my hamstrings.

1260
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:49,350
And then when I,
the magnesium supplementation a really 

1261
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,680
prevented much of that.
Have you ever used an isolation tank?

1262
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:55,580
No.
One of the cool things about her is that

1263
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:57,890
you get my museum to the water.
That's right.

1264
01:00:57,891 --> 01:01:02,891
Yeah.
Because the water's filled with a salt 

1265
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:02,891
and the salt is magnesium and I don't 
know,

1266
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,900
I think there's,
there's pretty legit a science behind 

1267
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,040
that.
I was a traveling in,

1268
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,380
um,
in Israel and I went to the Dead Sea,

1269
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,220
which is really high in magnesium and it
has a calming effect,

1270
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,030
uh,
which is reportedly due to the very high

1271
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:22,490
magnesium levels and other salts that 
are in there.

1272
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:27,490
So that magnesium is relatively small 
molecular weight that anything with a 

1273
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,900
molecular weight like under three,
400,

1274
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,830
I think can,
can get into your bloodstream.

1275
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:36,010
Yeah,
I think that's why people like those 

1276
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,601
epsom salt baths.
I think that's one of the things that 

1277
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:37,601
relaxes people.
Yup.

1278
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:38,340
Yeah.
And epsom salt bath is,

1279
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:43,750
you're talking about a very small amount
of salt in comparison to a tank which 

1280
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,510
has my tank is a thousand pounds of 
epsom salts in it and 11 inches water.

1281
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:52,600
So because you're so buoyant,
you just need to do this daily at your 

1282
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:52,600
house.
No,

1283
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,120
not daily,
but whenever I want,

1284
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,480
because it's in my basement,
I just go down there and get into it,

1285
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:58,700
but it's a,
the relaxing effects.

1286
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:00,470
It's pretty profound.
That's interesting.

1287
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:03,650
You know what it brings to mind?
Most of the.

1288
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,890
I've had at least a half dozen emails 
about doing epsom salt baths from als 

1289
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:14,081
patients because als is associated with 
a chemical called glutamate,

1290
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:19,420
which is excitatory amino acid 
transporter and high magnesium levels 

1291
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,231
can kind of,
some of the cytotoxic effects of high 

1292
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,391
glutamate and they were there physically
patients that they get and twitching 

1293
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:27,030
muscle twitching that they get and they 
found that,

1294
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:32,450
you know,
dosing magnesium or these epson salt 

1295
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:32,450
baths,
you know,

1296
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,880
higher and magnesium can calm them down 
and,

1297
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:38,190
and also maybe mitigate some of the 
twitching that they had,

1298
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:43,610
which is probably a reflection of a 
glutamate induced neurotoxicity.

1299
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,730
So the cells are dying,
they're releasing.

1300
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,330
So maybe neuroprotective in that way.
And it definitely,

1301
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:52,620
you know,
I know magnesium,

1302
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:57,621
you can feel it.
Like if you take a legit source of 

1303
01:02:57,621 --> 01:02:58,340
magnesium that's bioavailable,
like magnesium glycinate or,

1304
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,680
or other forms of magnesium,
you can really feel kind of a calming 

1305
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,410
effect.
Has know it makes sense.

1306
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:05,910
A lot of people take it before they go 
to bed.

1307
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,960
Yep.
Yeah.

1308
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:07,550
But the,
uh,

1309
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,320
the tank is,
it just wouldn't get out of there.

1310
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:12,030
Your whole body just feels relaxed.
I mean,

1311
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:15,770
I think part of is because the zero 
gravity effect of floating,

1312
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,320
you're floating like you're,
you're very buoyant,

1313
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,430
right in this because the water,
very heavy rail,

1314
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,300
like the,
like the,

1315
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:27,330
the Dead Sea,
like only maybe a third of your body is 

1316
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:27,330
kind of floating in it,
right?

1317
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:31,011
Or half of your body,
half your body essentially like your 

1318
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:31,410
ears are underwater where your faces 
above water.

1319
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,640
It's amazing.
You got to try it.

1320
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,880
I'm a big proponent of it.
But,

1321
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:37,440
um,
the,

1322
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:38,670
um,
als,

1323
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:40,990
is there a benefit in the ketogenic diet
to,

1324
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,500
for people they'll off?
Yeah,

1325
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,860
that's another application.
Uh,

1326
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:49,910
there's a guy Dr Pasinetti and I think 
he's at a and Mount Sinai in New York.

1327
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:55,160
Uh,
he's got a couple of studies on this 

1328
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,691
looking at caprylic triglyceride,
which is a medium chain fatty acid and 

1329
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:57,360
he also,
prior to,

1330
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,460
that's a clinical trial I think is 
ongoing now.

1331
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,680
But prior to that he demonstrated in a 
mouse model of,

1332
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,630
uh,
of als,

1333
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:11,631
which is the sod one gene,
93 a mouse model and it has a gene 

1334
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:13,950
defect that mimics the familial form of 
als.

1335
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,080
Which accounts for maybe about 10 at 
most,

1336
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:20,820
20 percent of als a pathologies.
And he found that a ketogenic diet,

1337
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,200
a improved motor function and some 
neurological scores.

1338
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,650
It did not improve overall survival 
though.

1339
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:33,950
So we actually followed up on that study
with a therapy that we call the deanna 

1340
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:37,140
protocol therapy after Deanna to don't.
And uh,

1341
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:38,470
her father,
uh,

1342
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:43,050
Dr Vinson to don't observe that his 
daughter responded remarkably well to,

1343
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:48,060
if you supplements,
which was our Janine 

1344
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:48,060
Alpha-ketoglutarate,
uh,

1345
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,550
and a Gabba and a coenzyme q 10.
A few things that we actually put into a

1346
01:04:55,231 --> 01:05:00,231
supplement.
And we reproduced the same study using 

1347
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:02,510
this gold standard mouse model.
And we looked at motor function,

1348
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:07,520
we looked neurological score.
And then we looked at total longterm 

1349
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,611
survival too.
And we found that using medium chain 

1350
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:14,271
triglycerides,
which was a ketogenic fat with Arginine 

1351
01:05:14,271 --> 01:05:18,910
alpha-ketoglutarate,
which is something that's in preworkout 

1352
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:19,900
formulas.
It's evasive dilator from the Argentine.

1353
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Uh,
we used a Gabba was in that or any view 

1354
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,560
if ventilated form of gamma that crosses
the blood brain barrier and um,

1355
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,230
and coenzyme q 10 in the form of 
identity known,

1356
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:34,270
which was kind of like the drug like 
form of it,

1357
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:35,350
I think it's still available.

1358
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,740
You can get it online,
it might be kind of a drug or Ubiquinol,

1359
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,800
which is a powerful warm.
So those supplements together I think 

1360
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,091
offer are neuroprotective in a way and 
it had a therapeutic and what I would 

1361
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:51,460
call performance enhancing effect on 
this als mouse model.

1362
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:57,270
And those supplements had a therapeutic 
effect on Deanna to don't.

1363
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,640
I mean there's other things in the 
what's called the Deanna Protocol,

1364
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:05,670
uh,
people interested in this can go to 

1365
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:05,670
winning the fight foundation.
Uh,

1366
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,360
it's a Tampa based als,
a five zero,

1367
01:06:07,361 --> 01:06:12,361
one c three foundation and you can sign 
up on the foundation and they give you 

1368
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:16,681
the actual protocol and there's more 
than a thousand patients registered on 

1369
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,930
this that are benefiting from the end.
There's several peer reviewed studies on

1370
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:21,310
this.
Uh,

1371
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,790
ideally we'd like to get enough funding 
to do a human study,

1372
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:26,650
but the mouse works pretty compelling 
and it just,

1373
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:27,640
it's just,
it,

1374
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
it's an extension of work that has 
already been done really in further 

1375
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,721
supporting a compelling support for this
proof of concept for using a metabolic 

1376
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:39,250
based approach like targeting energy 
metabolism,

1377
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,100
preserving mitochondrial function.
So the cells work better.

1378
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:47,600
No,
when you were talking about epileptic 

1379
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,731
kids and I'm supplementing their diet 
with ketone supplements because a lot of

1380
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:52,500
them have a hard time following 
kidogenic diet.

1381
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,740
Can you get the same benefits of a 
ketogenic diet by following a standard 

1382
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:00,930
American diet and supplementing with 
exogenous ketones?

1383
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,380
I doubt it at this time with the ones 
that are commercially available.

1384
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:10,590
But I do think that was some of the 
ketone esters in development right now.

1385
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,370
We've observed using a range of 
different animal models that,

1386
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:20,371
uh,
the thing is that these things are not 

1387
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:20,371
very palatable.
Third,

1388
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:22,090
pricey to make a,
but we're working with various companies

1389
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:27,120
and doing what's required for the FDA to
be generally recognized as safe or some 

1390
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,140
of these compounds.
I don't think they taste bad.

1391
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,630
I've heard people complain about like 
think eugenics.

1392
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:35,110
I didn't think it was pro bono.
Ingenix actually tastes pretty good.

1393
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,430
Uh,
don't let it sit.

1394
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:38,890
If you mix it up.
That's one problem with the eugenics.

1395
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,160
If you mix it up and let it sit,
then it's like,

1396
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,390
tastes like battery acid for were 
allowed.

1397
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,960
But so I mix it up and if you just keep 
it with some ice cubes in it,

1398
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:48,460
you can probably keep it around for 
about a half hour.

1399
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:50,260
But I generally try to drink it pretty 
quick.

1400
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,440
But some of them,
some of them are nasty.

1401
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,640
Yeah.
Uh,

1402
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:59,670
well the ketone esters.
So these are things that if I gave you 

1403
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:00,640
right now you would gag.
You would not be able to drink it.

1404
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,960
Somebody sent me some.
Where's that jazz?

1405
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:08,080
We still have that laying around here,
that little thing to ketone esters and 

1406
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,180
some dude sent.
It was in like a sealed,

1407
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:13,330
a little foil seal plastic thing.
I'd be curious.

1408
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:20,741
I know all the,
all the people behind this was here 

1409
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,600
somewhere.
Okay.

1410
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,250
This place is a mess.
What else?

1411
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:32,940
Um,
so like if someone had a big bowl of 

1412
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:32,940
pasta and then they took something like 
key genics,

1413
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,660
would that knock you back in the state 
of Ketosis?

1414
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:36,050
Yeah,

1415
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:41,140
you could,
you could eat a bowl of pasta and then 

1416
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,070
consumer key gen x product and then test
your test your blood ketones.

1417
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:48,071
I didn't.
Would it look like you're on a strict 

1418
01:08:48,071 --> 01:08:48,071
ketogenic diet that's a mild,
like a,

1419
01:08:48,071 --> 01:08:50,750
what I would call a modified atkins diet
were as to the ketone ester.

1420
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:55,780
You could eat a bowl of pasta and then 
take a ketone ester and it would look 

1421
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,981
like you fasted for 10 days.
So it puts you into starvation level 

1422
01:08:59,981 --> 01:09:00,770
ketosis.
So interestingly,

1423
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:05,771
another application of ketones is that 
it lowers blood glucose and we don't 

1424
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:08,060
know why we're studying that right now.
But uh,

1425
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,890
and it may do it by your liver is like 
the main regulator of what your glucose 

1426
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:17,030
is.
So your liver as glycogen in it,

1427
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:21,140
and it's constantly being broken down 
and kind of spilling glucose into a.

1428
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:25,430
It may be affecting that process or it 
may be enhancing insulin sensitivity,

1429
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:30,460
which means you take ketones and your 
cells use the glucose that there becomes

1430
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:32,900
more readily available to the cells 
which greater uptake.

1431
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:37,790
So we're looking into precisely why when
you consume exogenous Ketones,

1432
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:40,760
why glucose goes down,
we've replicated it many times,

1433
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:45,850
different forms of ketones.
So would that be a way for a person who 

1434
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,971
maybe he's just not so good at being 
disciplined with their diet to just 

1435
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:51,020
throw it in there like say God,
I want him to have some ice cream,

1436
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:52,970
but I've been really good with my diet.
Fuck it.

1437
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:57,971
I'll just have the ice cream within.
Have some key x or something like that 

1438
01:09:57,971 --> 01:09:57,971
afterwards.

1439
01:09:57,971 --> 01:10:01,520
Well,
I firmly believe there's no shortcuts 

1440
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,870
and I think of ketones and I try to.
I think I mentioned this on Tim Ferriss 

1441
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,901
too,
and he put it in there that ketones are 

1442
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:08,190
just another source of energy.
So if you have,

1443
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:13,250
if you're eating 2000 calories of food 
and then taken lots of ketone 

1444
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,371
supplements,
you are eating a lot more than 2000 

1445
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:16,371
calories of food

1446
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:18,040
[inaudible] can you tell as fat,
but as far as like gaining weight,

1447
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:20,590
but as far as like keeping your body 
into a state of Ketosis,

1448
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,430
it actually does work.

1449
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:26,510
Absolutely,
and the benefits of that would be a 

1450
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:30,890
maybe not weight loss,
but by elevating your blood ketone 

1451
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:34,410
levels,
there's a lot of beneficial effects.

1452
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,440
Even from a signaling standpoint,
like completely independent of 

1453
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,550
metabolism.
We know that it's a a,

1454
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,070
a super fuel essentially for the brain 
that you can.

1455
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,920
Your brain cells can generate energy 
from,

1456
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:49,650
from ketones in a more efficient manner 
than than glucose.

1457
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:54,480
That's really hard for people to believe
because that's the one thing that people

1458
01:10:54,481 --> 01:10:59,481
always would say,
you need glucose to fuel your brain 

1459
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:02,900
under certain conditions.
So there are a few stipulations to that 

1460
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,350
and I could get a little bit technical,
but for example,

1461
01:11:04,351 --> 01:11:06,960
I mean obviously if you have one 
deficiency syndrome,

1462
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,390
you know you are.
You're transporting it,

1463
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:14,391
but they're.
Your brain has a number of things that 

1464
01:11:14,391 --> 01:11:15,300
prevent it from using glucose 
effectively,

1465
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:18,810
so in many cases ketones would be the 
preferred source of fuel.

1466
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,840
For example,
there may be like with Alzheimer's 

1467
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,900
disease or maybe if you even if you have
a traumatic brain injury,

1468
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,100
there is an internalization of the glut 
three transporter so that you have cells

1469
01:11:29,101 --> 01:11:34,101
right and glucose was trying to get in,
but the glut three transporter isn't on 

1470
01:11:34,101 --> 01:11:37,311
the membrane or you can have a a 
dysregulation or an inhibition of 

1471
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,930
[inaudible] hydrogenate complex PDH 
complex,

1472
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,390
and that enzyme is really the 
gatekeeper.

1473
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:44,220
It's almost like the.
It's the governor.

1474
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:49,280
It's a throttle that lets the glucose 
into the cell to create the feed into 

1475
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,030
what we call anaplerotic pathway is to 
drive the TCA cycle,

1476
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:56,460
the krebs cycle,
and that makes reduced intermediate that

1477
01:11:56,461 --> 01:12:01,461
drive the electron transport chain to 
make ATP so that it's like a gatekeeper 

1478
01:12:01,461 --> 01:12:03,090
and ketones completely bypass that 
process.

1479
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:05,340
So if you have no glove,
three,

1480
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,420
if you have impaired activity of PDH 
complex,

1481
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:12,330
which a lot of people who are,
you know,

1482
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,340
carbohydrate components say,
well,

1483
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:16,080
you're inhibiting the PDH complex.

1484
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,080
If you're on occasion,
thank diet and I don't think there's 

1485
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,451
evidence of that,
but the key tones essentially bypass 

1486
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:26,191
those steps and can restore and preserve
brain energy metabolism even if those 

1487
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:30,570
things are dysregulated or dysfunctional
in a number of pathologies,

1488
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,950
you know,
make them dysfunctional.

1489
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,500
Uh,
and this is a general state of aging.

1490
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:39,501
It's thought that as we age,
we have a proportional decrease in,

1491
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:45,140
um,
in glucose energy metabolism in the 

1492
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,350
brain,
but that's not the case with ketones.

1493
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:51,351
So as we age,
the data that has been collected so far 

1494
01:12:51,351 --> 01:12:54,830
shows that we have essentially the same 
ketone energy metabolism as from young 

1495
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:55,950
to adults.
Wow.

1496
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:59,560
So that's major implicated.
You can graph it out and you know,

1497
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:04,580
we've had speakers at our conference 
that did that and you can see kind of 

1498
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,420
like a plateauing effect and a decrease 
in brain energy,

1499
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,390
uh,
uh,

1500
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,420
consumption from glucose.
Whereas with the ketones a,

1501
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,760
it bypasses many of the rate limiting 
steps that are associated with impaired 

1502
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,280
glucose metabolism in the brain.

1503
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:22,610
It's almost hard to believe when you 
rattle off the laundry list of benefits 

1504
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,580
of the Ketogenic Diet,
you know,

1505
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:24,860
for a lot of people they're like,
well,

1506
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,360
how is this?
It seems crazy.

1507
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,290
It seems like it.
It will.

1508
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:30,990
If it seems like everyone should be on 
it.

1509
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:36,350
And it seems crazy that so many benefits
are attributable to this fat based fat 

1510
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:37,290
burning diet.

1511
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,390
There's a lot of bands I don't,
you know,

1512
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,560
like my wife does not eat damage.
It's a relatively high carbohydrate diet

1513
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:48,580
with people enjoy it.
That's because she enjoys it and that's 

1514
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,801
because her carbohydrate tolerance is 
really remarkably high and some people 

1515
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:55,650
do really well on high carbs and you say
until you're testing her.

1516
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,540
Uh,
yeah,

1517
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:02,541
like,
well I've tested her blood and are 

1518
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:02,640
ketones to and she can get rapidly into 
a state of ketosis.

1519
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:07,641
I mean,
we're testing some products now for 

1520
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:07,641
ketone technologies or our company and 
uh,

1521
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:08,850
various products.
And she can.

1522
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:13,360
It's the first time I've actually seen 
her ketones levels up where mine are and

1523
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:15,490
sustain it over a period of time.
And she's like,

1524
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:18,820
this is awesome.
This is just from taking a product a for

1525
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:23,821
taking himself,
just the formulation of specific 

1526
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:23,821
products,
uh,

1527
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:26,170
and uh,
so there are a lot of benefits,

1528
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:31,590
but it's just,
I think of it as like one tool in a 

1529
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,590
toolbox,
you know,

1530
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,570
simple carbohydrate restriction,
like it doesn't have to be acutely drank

1531
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:38,580
diet,
but simply restricting your 

1532
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:38,580
carbohydrates is a powerful hammer.

1533
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:42,370
For example,
for type two diabetes and a Virta health

1534
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:47,371
is doing more for the medical management
of type two diabetes than any other 

1535
01:14:47,371 --> 01:14:49,000
entity that I know of.
I mean,

1536
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:54,001
I think their goal is in the next decade
to reverse a $100 million cases of type 

1537
01:14:54,001 --> 01:14:58,801
two diabetes.
Like our government spends way more a 

1538
01:14:58,801 --> 01:15:03,800
like $200,000,000,000
of funding for managing diabetes.

1539
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,430
Uh,
and you know,

1540
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:11,140
NASA's budget is something like a $19 
billion per year or something like that.

1541
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:13,990
So it compare that and the,
uh,

1542
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,190
you know,
we know that type two diabetes,

1543
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:19,840
for example,
which is an obesity,

1544
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:23,500
the major problem for type two diabetes 
is carbohydrate intolerance.

1545
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:28,830
So why would you,
why would a registered dietitian 

1546
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:32,910
administer a carbohydrate based diet to 
a type two diabetes person who has a 

1547
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:36,830
problem with carbohydrate intolerance 
because,

1548
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:39,400
and that's reflected in their elevated 
hemoglobin h,

1549
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,470
one C or glucose levels or insulin 
levels.

1550
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:46,970
Uh,
so the Virta is created a platform of 

1551
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:49,690
people who using an APP will allow you 
to,

1552
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,830
uh,
to follow,

1553
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:55,831
adhere to carbohydrate restriction and 
acute agentic diet to essentially not 

1554
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:59,470
just manage it but just like completely 
reverse it.

1555
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:05,010
And I would,
I think the numbers are something like 

1556
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,590
89,
almost 90 percent of people from the 

1557
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:10,501
data they collected so far and publish 
almost 90 percent of people might be 89 

1558
01:16:10,501 --> 01:16:15,331
or 87 percent can either completely get 
off insulin or like reduce it down to 

1559
01:16:15,331 --> 01:16:20,251
very low levels just simply by using a 
carbohydrate restricted diet.

1560
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,160
And that has,
that's profound.

1561
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:27,070
I mean imagine the number of people that
can get off medication,

1562
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:32,160
you know,
what that can do to the healthcare 

1563
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,810
system,
the healthcare burden of paying all 

1564
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,600
these dollars for drug management of 
type two diabetes,

1565
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:37,300
which is going up to epidemic 
proportions.

1566
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:38,820
So yeah,
so,

1567
01:16:38,821 --> 01:16:41,560
so people are out there and they have 
type two diabetes,

1568
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:46,561
just go to Virta health and you'll see 
an amazing array of clinicians,

1569
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:53,010
basic scientists and registered 
Dietitians that assist people for the 

1570
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,270
medical management of type two diabetes.

1571
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,700
It's just stunning.
The list is.

1572
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:00,180
Oh,
it was good.

1573
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:03,310
Like the low hanging fruit is definitely
type two diabetes,

1574
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:05,800
so I'm glad to see the field go into 
that direction.

1575
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:07,030
But for many,
many years,

1576
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:12,031
many decades,
the only application when I got into 

1577
01:17:12,031 --> 01:17:15,011
this research,
the only application with pediatric 

1578
01:17:15,011 --> 01:17:16,490
epilepsy and then two years after that 
it was like it works for adult epilepsy.

1579
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,350
So it's taken so much time for the 
science to prove kind of what we already

1580
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:22,110
knew.
Right.

1581
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:26,150
That therapeutic ketosis was supplying 
ketones to the brain.

1582
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:31,151
That's an alternative form of energy and
obviously that has more implications 

1583
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:33,170
than just helping your brain for 
epilepsy.

1584
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,700
And there's so many other applications,

1585
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,570
you know,
when you're uncovering all this and when

1586
01:17:36,571 --> 01:17:39,150
you're doing all this research and 
studying it and you're finding all these

1587
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:44,151
benefits,
have you tried to figure out or 

1588
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:47,990
contemplate like what is the cause,
like why is it so beneficial for your 

1589
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:51,240
body to live off fats versus your body 
to live off glucose?

1590
01:17:51,241 --> 01:17:54,990
Is this something that we evolved to 
live off fats?

1591
01:17:54,991 --> 01:17:58,320
Is this like,
is it a better primary source?

1592
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:03,710
Is it something that our body can exist 
off of glucose but really were designed 

1593
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:03,710
to live off fat.
It's like,

1594
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:04,590
what is the cause?

1595
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:07,400
Oh,
it's multi.

1596
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:09,080
I mean there's many answers to that 
question,

1597
01:18:09,081 --> 01:18:14,081
but I'll tell you kind of what I think 
that many people do really well on a 

1598
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:17,210
carbohydrate based with no overt signs 
of,

1599
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,860
you know,
pathology,

1600
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,610
especially really active people in that 
class.

1601
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:25,580
Like I always kind of joke,
like the people that are most interested

1602
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:30,581
in the ketogenic diets are.
Many of them are athletes that contact 

1603
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:30,581
me.
Uh,

1604
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:31,490
but a lot of people have health problems
too.

1605
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:32,660
Uh,
but the.

1606
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,450
But the athletes are typically not the 
ones who necessarily need it,

1607
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,070
but they can benefit of it.
I mean,

1608
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,450
a lot of,
you know,

1609
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:43,451
if there's football players out there 
and people that are predisposed to 

1610
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:47,081
concussion or brain injury,
I think it's really good to be on a key 

1611
01:18:47,081 --> 01:18:48,770
to genic diet.
That's Kinda like a whole nother area we

1612
01:18:48,771 --> 01:18:49,370
can go into

1613
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:54,530
now for athletes when you're talking 
about people that like maybe they don't 

1614
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,070
need it for weight loss or they don't 
need it for a lot of it.

1615
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,190
Is it because the massive amount of 
calories,

1616
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:04,270
the calories that they're burning and 
their nutritional requirements almost 

1617
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,490
mitigates the negative effect of having 
a glucose based diet.

1618
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:11,500
Yeah,
it really does come down to calorie 

1619
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,421
control.
So if you have a surplus amount of 

1620
01:19:13,421 --> 01:19:13,421
calories coming in,
you know,

1621
01:19:13,421 --> 01:19:17,441
even with an athlete,
you're gonna start to get some over 

1622
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:19,580
metabolic effects and negative,
you know,

1623
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,060
biomarkers kind of showing up.
And if you do that chronically,

1624
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:26,720
it'll ultimately lead to chronic 
inflammation.

1625
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,040
Maybe some,
you know,

1626
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:30,460
brain fog and other things.
Uh,

1627
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,360
W,
what I have observed is that,

1628
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:36,020
you know,
I mean you're asking like a why was your

1629
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:41,021
question,
like why aren't people not following 

1630
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:41,021
this or what's the benefit

1631
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:42,360
question was like because you're 
studying this so deeply,

1632
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,940
like have you ever contemplated like 
what is the root cause?

1633
01:19:44,941 --> 01:19:49,230
Like why are we so good at burning fats?
Why is it so beneficial?

1634
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:54,410
There's so many health benefits and it 
seems like there's so many negative 

1635
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,190
consequences of,
of having a high carbohydrate diet,

1636
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,170
especially for sedentary individual.

1637
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,930
Yeah.
I think you really,

1638
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:04,990
to put this into context,
you have to think the negative effects 

1639
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:09,240
from high carbohydrate diet are due to a
calorie surplus.

1640
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:13,470
So I think a carbohydrate based diet 
could work fantastic for a lot of people

1641
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:17,640
who count their macros,
who manage their calories,

1642
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:22,641
but people are horrible predictors or 
estimators of how many grams of 

1643
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:23,950
carbohydrates,
you know,

1644
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,160
they walked into the kitchen and grabbed
some grapes,

1645
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:27,480
they grab a chocolate,
they don't.

1646
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:31,390
So that's why it's really good if they 
want to get a handle on this to optimize

1647
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:36,391
or total health and performance and 
things to really have an app where they 

1648
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:39,550
can calculate their macros and uneasy,
you know,

1649
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:43,320
to do format like avatar nutrition does.
Uh,

1650
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:47,910
so that's.
So I think when you are bolusing glucose

1651
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:50,580
or bolusing carbohydrates,
a couple meals a day,

1652
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,620
you have that scenario that I talked 
about.

1653
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:57,510
You have a spike in glucose and a 
release of insulin and for many people,

1654
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:02,540
which I had was,
is Postprandial dip in blood glucose 

1655
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:06,651
where you'd go hypoglycemic after two or
three hours and that would have me 

1656
01:21:06,651 --> 01:21:07,800
searching for food again.
I would get irritable,

1657
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:13,010
I would get sleepy,
my performance would drop when you go 

1658
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:16,461
on.
Didn't even have to be like a ketogenic 

1659
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:19,101
diet.
Just low carb can completely in many 

1660
01:21:19,101 --> 01:21:22,701
cases if not abolished,
significantly attenuate that rise in 

1661
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:24,220
glucose and that release and insulin.
Uh,

1662
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:24,870
and,
and you know,

1663
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:29,871
with a carbohydrate based Diet you can 
throw in more fat and fiber and buffer 

1664
01:21:29,871 --> 01:21:33,651
that too.
But a purely ketogenic diet is kind of 

1665
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:33,900
non glycaemic.
Like,

1666
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:38,901
you don't have any rise in that.
And the practical effects of that is 

1667
01:21:38,901 --> 01:21:43,071
that it tends to allow the person to 
control their appetite and so they're 

1668
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:48,660
kind of controlling them and appetite 
suppression and just kind of.

1669
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,960
And that's how it's thought that the 
Ketogenic Diet works too,

1670
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:56,961
is that you don't have these spikes in 
glucose and hormones and things like 

1671
01:21:56,961 --> 01:21:57,780
that that could set off a seizure,
is that,

1672
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:02,781
uh,
the leading scientists in this field a 

1673
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:05,280
really believed that it helps put the 
brain into a state of homeostasis better

1674
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:10,281
and if there's less kind of energy 
spikes and less kind of noise in the 

1675
01:22:10,281 --> 01:22:10,660
system,
uh,

1676
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,110
from a physiological standpoint that the
brains,

1677
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,870
uh,
the brain's energy system and the,

1678
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,960
the,
the neuropharmacology of the brain 

1679
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:21,960
itself,
the neurotransmitters,

1680
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,320
the balance of Gaba to glutamate and 
Gaba and Serotonin and other things will

1681
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:29,160
be balanced in a way that would make 
seizures much less likely to occur.

1682
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,890
So,
and I think that's what it does from a,

1683
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:32,630
from a,
uh,

1684
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,160
feeding behavior from a neuroendocrine 
point of view,

1685
01:22:35,161 --> 01:22:38,430
is that it helps to,
when you have all these hormones and,

1686
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:39,480
and,
uh,

1687
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:40,740
metabolites,
you know,

1688
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,400
going all over in the blood,
the ketogenic diet keeps it into a range

1689
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,640
where there's a lot less noise in the 
system and you can see this,

1690
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,740
uh,
by a patient,

1691
01:22:49,741 --> 01:22:51,870
a type one diabetes patient,
for example,

1692
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:57,140
who goes from eating a high carbohydrate
diet to a key to genic diet where their 

1693
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,790
Dexcom continuous glucose measurement is
all over the place.

1694
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,690
If you look at,
you know,

1695
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:04,440
several days of data and if they 
transitioned to a ketogenic diet,

1696
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:08,620
I mean the highest,
there's way few highs and a few lows and

1697
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:13,621
it's within a tight range.
And there they stay within the range 

1698
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:13,690
where they're optimized,
I would say.

1699
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:18,691
So they're in a glucose range where 
they're optimized and that's what 

1700
01:23:18,691 --> 01:23:18,691
happens.
That's,

1701
01:23:18,691 --> 01:23:22,930
you know,
that happens obviously with a type one 

1702
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:22,930
diabetic who's trying to chase the 
glucose with insulin.

1703
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:25,120
But for the average person,
the same thing happens.

1704
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:26,770
And that's why a lot of people feel 
better,

1705
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,790
they have less cravings and there were 
more likely to adhere and stick to their

1706
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:35,500
diet and not kind of fall off the wagon 
and kind of overeat and you have surplus

1707
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:36,130
calories.
So,

1708
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:41,280
so high carbohydrate diet is completely 
manageable and people who knew how to 

1709
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,631
manage their calories,
but that's really hard for most people 

1710
01:23:45,631 --> 01:23:48,251
will do.
So I think the APP based programs that 

1711
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:48,850
are coming out are really,
really handy in there.

1712
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:54,300
Uh,
I think there'll be kind of the wave of 

1713
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:54,300
the future for people who want to 
optimize their,

1714
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,050
their body composition and their 
performance,

1715
01:23:56,051 --> 01:23:59,250
and to have a kito option of that too,
where you can tighten,

1716
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:04,290
titrate and optimize your Keto Diet.
And then there was an ai system that 

1717
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:08,080
tells you how to improve those ratios 
over time to hit your goals.

1718
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:09,340
I think that's really the future.

1719
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,210
The cravings,
uh,

1720
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,990
that,
that's a huge factor.

1721
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:16,170
The not just the energy crash,
but also the lack of hunger.

1722
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,880
It's a,
it's really weird.

1723
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,300
Like I always felt like if you didn't 
eat for a few hours,

1724
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,690
you just started getting,
God,

1725
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:24,900
I got to eat and you have this weird 
feeling,

1726
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:30,140
but that weird feeling is entirely 
connected to glucose when you're on a 

1727
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,860
fat based fat burning diet.
That the,

1728
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:35,460
even knowing that you're hungry is a 
different knowing.

1729
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,760
It's like it's in the other room.
Yeah.

1730
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:41,880
It's not like it's like next to you 
sitting on your shoulder yelling in your

1731
01:24:41,881 --> 01:24:43,050
ear.
Come on man,

1732
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,690
let's eat.
You know,

1733
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,430
there's a frantic feeling that a lot of 
people get.

1734
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:51,010
I've seen my wife,
I've seen it when she's hungry.

1735
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:56,011
We gotta stop.
We gotta pull over when she needs ice 

1736
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:56,011
cream.
I mean it's,

1737
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:56,011
it's,
I just,

1738
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:56,890
you know,
give in and say,

1739
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:57,980
okay,
we're gonna we're gonna.

1740
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,160
Pull over.
Uh,

1741
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:04,180
and I remember feeling that way too when
I would kind of go off the wagon and 

1742
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,350
need a half of a box of toll house 
cookies.

1743
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:10,380
Uh,
but yesterday I three packets of 

1744
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,350
something called Quito cookies and uh,
I put some in your,

1745
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:13,360
your little gift bag there.
Um,

1746
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,670
yeah,
and these Quito cookie.

1747
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:20,671
So I just,
I had never eaten three packets 

1748
01:25:20,671 --> 01:25:20,671
together,
so I was curious.

1749
01:25:20,671 --> 01:25:21,220
Uh,
let me,

1750
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,420
Oh,
that's energy bits.

1751
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:26,440
So energy bits is I think a fantastic 
Selena.

1752
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:31,530
So spirit,
Spirulina has an enormous amount of 

1753
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:35,491
research behind it and uh,
it's one of the products I used on the 

1754
01:25:35,491 --> 01:25:38,611
NASA neemo mission because we didn't 
really have access to fresh vegetables 

1755
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:39,130
or fighter nutrients down there.

1756
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,010
So snickerdoodle Huh?
At the snickerdoodle bar.

1757
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:47,070
And then there was a chocolate chip bar 
and a fudge fudge chip bar where could 

1758
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,800
just go to Quito,
cookie.com.

1759
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:54,610
And so they are,
that's like my Quito comfort food.

1760
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:59,700
So when I travel with that,
I might have another box out there for 

1761
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:02,761
you.
So you have chocolate chip snicker 

1762
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:02,761
doodle.
Yeah,

1763
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:02,761
fledged chip.
Uh,

1764
01:26:02,761 --> 01:26:06,840
so you can eat that typically when,
if I like a toll house chocolate chip 

1765
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:11,171
cookie,
I would have that crash that we were 

1766
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:11,171
talking about and now it'd be ravenous,
you know,

1767
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:12,500
after a.
There you go.

1768
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:14,600
Uh,
so no sugar.

1769
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:17,600
So it's completely like low-glycemic for
me.

1770
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:19,670
They're like non glycaemic.
Uh,

1771
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:20,930
so I measured my,
My,

1772
01:26:20,931 --> 01:26:25,931
uh,
glucose after eating three packets of 

1773
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,140
them because I went to,
yeah,

1774
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:32,141
there was the guys behind it.
So I actually just saw them at the low 

1775
01:26:32,141 --> 01:26:34,811
carb,
a USA conference where a number of 

1776
01:26:34,811 --> 01:26:34,811
speakers there were on the show.

1777
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:37,250
Gary Taubes with their robb wolf was 
there.

1778
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:38,810
I didn't get to speak to them,
uh,

1779
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:43,920
because it was just so busy.
But Quito cookie is one of those food 

1780
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,280
that's evolving out of this,
you know,

1781
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:51,281
this kind of movement.
I would say that the key to genic diet 

1782
01:26:51,281 --> 01:26:54,640
diet is becoming a lifestyle.
So not something that's used for 

1783
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,821
pediatric epilepsy,
but something like the average person 

1784
01:26:57,821 --> 01:26:58,460
can follow to just feel better.
And for me,

1785
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:01,940
I could eat a Keto meal in the morning 
and I can hammer out 12 hours of work in

1786
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:05,780
the lab and not even get any cravings to
eat at all.

1787
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:07,040
And that,
for me,

1788
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:10,490
that translated into more grants,
more publications,

1789
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:15,491
more work done in the lab.
And I kind of attributed in some way 

1790
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:15,491
that,
you know,

1791
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:20,380
my career has gotten a really big boost 
because I'm more cognitively aware and 

1792
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:24,500
resilient even during periods of sleep 
deprivation.

1793
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:29,501
I can just work longer periods and I 
kind of utilized Quito to my advantage 

1794
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:29,501
in that way.

1795
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:34,850
Fascinating.
I really had no idea about exogenous 

1796
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,070
ketones,
improving mental function,

1797
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:40,370
like taking them to actually really like
it would be a good idea to take them 

1798
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:43,281
before anything taxing.
I'm going to try and take a number for 

1799
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:45,561
podcasts and taking them before comedy 
shows or UFC events and see if maybe my 

1800
01:27:45,571 --> 01:27:49,170
brain fires better because I mean that's
just amazing.

1801
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:49,970
Yeah.
Uh,

1802
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,910
my,
my wife was actually a,

1803
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:54,350
she spearheaded a program,
uh,

1804
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,490
looking at absence seizures.
So a lot of people have seizures,

1805
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:02,510
don't have like tonic clonic seizures,
but they'll just look and stare into 

1806
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:05,650
space and then wake up out of it with me
all the seizures champion.

1807
01:28:05,651 --> 01:28:10,280
I didn't even know he's a good man,
but I feel like an illusion and you just

1808
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:11,420
got to try them,
try them.

1809
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:16,421
Raj,
do you have a glucose ketone 

1810
01:28:16,421 --> 01:28:16,610
measurement?
I did have that,

1811
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:18,590
but I have a lot of calluses and I was 
like,

1812
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,750
I had a really stabbed the shit out of 
my fingers.

1813
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,410
Yeah,
you do.

1814
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,750
I thought I had calluses.
I got,

1815
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:26,190
I got pretty bad council.
But um,

1816
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,620
yeah.
So,

1817
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,580
uh,
what was I gonna say?

1818
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:31,490
Oh,
so anxiety other than glucose meter,

1819
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:34,190
the one that stabs you because it wasn't
really working that well,

1820
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:34,940
not really.

1821
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,710
I mean they go in the side of your hand.
I'm like,

1822
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:37,860
fuck,
fuck man.

1823
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:39,670
Yeah.
So we'd go to the fingertips.

1824
01:28:39,671 --> 01:28:44,390
I just take an actual syringe like a 
needle and just plug it in or I have.

1825
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,470
Yeah.
So I just,

1826
01:28:45,471 --> 01:28:47,720
I don't really feel that I've done it so
many times,

1827
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,250
but uh,
but yeah,

1828
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:52,850
taking exogenous ketones can help.
We publish a paper and frontiers.

1829
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:58,130
It reduced anxiety behavior about 25 to 
30 percent in our rats.

1830
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:03,190
So they would go out into what's called 
an elevated plus maze into the open arm 

1831
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:06,960
where they're like on a catwalk and they
could fall off or be exposed environment

1832
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:11,990
typically produce a fear response or 
they could run back into the little 

1833
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:15,410
cave.
And the Beta hydroxybutyrate salt plus 

1834
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:16,800
the medium chain triglyceride 
combination,

1835
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,770
actually reduce that fear behavior.
Uh,

1836
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,700
maybe it would be.
I mean,

1837
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:24,090
I'm sure you're completely comfortable 
being out on front of the stage,

1838
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:29,210
uh,
but for people that have anxiety 

1839
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:32,061
problems,
which is a big part of people who have 

1840
01:29:32,061 --> 01:29:32,061
stress,
it kind of exacerbates anxiety.

1841
01:29:32,061 --> 01:29:32,430
Uh,
I mean,

1842
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:37,431
I felt it early on in my career.
I knew that being in a state of Ketosis 

1843
01:29:37,431 --> 01:29:37,770
just makes me more mellow.

1844
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:38,650
Well,
you know,

1845
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,700
one thing that would help me with is,
um,

1846
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,860
I bow hunt.
Yeah.

1847
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,890
And bowhunting is behind.
Yeah.

1848
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:46,660
Really.
My brother was a,

1849
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,960
he was a big bow hunter.
He writes for Peterson.

1850
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,630
But when a magazine and I saw a tweet,
I saw a.

1851
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,050
yeah,
we had that pro force extreme,

1852
01:29:55,051 --> 01:29:55,640
I think bose.
Yeah.

1853
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:56,880
I grew up in a,
in a boat.

1854
01:29:56,881 --> 01:30:01,881
I grew up in a hunting family.
So I quickly noticed some of the stuff 

1855
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:01,881
out in here.

1856
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:01,930
So,
um,

1857
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,000
that's probably one of the most 
stressful things I do.

1858
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:05,620
Like people think that like doing 
standup,

1859
01:30:05,621 --> 01:30:08,920
a stressful or live podcast or 
broadcast,

1860
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:12,740
those are nothing compared to 
bowhunting.

1861
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,250
Drawing back on a live animal and your 
heart starts racing,

1862
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:21,600
start adrenaline rush,
you have target panic where you can't 

1863
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:26,131
remember what you're doing and you go 
into autopilot and there's all sorts of 

1864
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:30,360
methods to mitigate that by forcing your
brain into a closed loop system instead 

1865
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:33,430
of an open loop system,
repeating mantras,

1866
01:30:33,431 --> 01:30:36,820
going over different facets of your shot
process.

1867
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,510
But maybe I'm ketones and being in an 
acute agentic state,

1868
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:43,090
especially exoticness ketones before you
hunt,

1869
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,310
would mitigate some of those issues.

1870
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:46,410
Definitely help.
I mean,

1871
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,110
I think you've had them on the podcast,
Wim Hoff method.

1872
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:55,250
I'm sure something I'm getting into a 
was talking with a quest ceo last night,

1873
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:57,690
uh,
about Butenko,

1874
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:00,510
uh,
guy in Russia designed some,

1875
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,600
some system that allows you.
It's a,

1876
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:06,420
it's a program of breathing.
I have the APP on my phone.

1877
01:31:06,421 --> 01:31:07,650
I haven't,
I haven't used it yet,

1878
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:11,310
but it allows you to increase your CEO 
to threshold.

1879
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,610
So the drive to breathe actually does 
not come from a lack of oxygen.

1880
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,130
It,
uh,

1881
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,670
through CEO to chemo receptors on the 
ventral surface of your Medulla,

1882
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:19,800
in,
in your brainstem,

1883
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,650
that senscio too,
and when they sent ceo to that,

1884
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,600
that's your urge to breathe.
That's your drive.

1885
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:28,770
And then you have a backup,
a sort of like a redundant mechanism,

1886
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,800
the carotid body that the bifurcation,
the common carotid artery right here 

1887
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,370
will since oxygen and it's kind of like 
more of a fail safe that's,

1888
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,040
I studied these things,
you know,

1889
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:40,380
for my phd and these neurons like Kelly 
sense how they sense things,

1890
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:45,560
but so you can increase your CEO to 
threshold over time using various 

1891
01:31:45,931 --> 01:31:50,931
breathing protocols and that can create 
an enormous effect on kind of reducing 

1892
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:56,580
anxiety in these situations where a big 
buck comes up and you're drawing back on

1893
01:31:56,581 --> 01:31:58,350
it,
or in general,

1894
01:31:58,351 --> 01:32:00,550
just the level oxygenation that you 
have.

1895
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:04,390
So retaining some co two,
if you do it through training,

1896
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:09,660
can actually enhance the vasodilation 
effect and can maybe reverse even in 

1897
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:13,960
hyperoxygenate systems in your body.
So that's the theory.

1898
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,810
And there's some,
there's quite a few studies behind it.

1899
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:19,760
I really have to delve into the studies.
But uh,

1900
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:23,380
the Wim Hoff method is one method.
I've been fascinated with him.

1901
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,110
I really want to meet him.
Actually.

1902
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:30,560
I love that I would go,
I want to bring him to the lab and 

1903
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,710
actually do some research on him.
Okay.

1904
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,310
Connect your guide will be awesome.
Yeah.

1905
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:37,810
These cookies or like a mirage,
it's like you hold them,

1906
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:41,500
they have weight cookie.
You bite into them,

1907
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:43,240
you'll like,
this is going to be like eating a cookie

1908
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:48,510
and then you chewing it and it's almost 
like it vanishes like fairy dust in 

1909
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,690
front of your eyes.
But it's good though.

1910
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,640
It's really good.
Don't get me wrong.

1911
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,580
I'm not saying it's a mirage,
like their bullshit.

1912
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:57,730
I'm saying like I'm there.
It's a very strange texture to them.

1913
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,920
Yeah.
Because obviously there's no grain it 

1914
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:02,920
and there's something about eating and 
maturing them where your body goes,

1915
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:03,510
hey,
uh,

1916
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,040
what'd you fucking lie to us?
Hooky Bro.

1917
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:11,700
Like it tastes good,
but there's something about chewing it 

1918
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:11,700
and eating it.
It's like,

1919
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:11,700
Eh,
it vanish.

1920
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,370
It's pretty substantial to the 
significant amount of fat in it.

1921
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,260
Uh,
so I was a little.

1922
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,540
Yeah,
I was a little skeptical when they came,

1923
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:20,080
I was like,
okay,

1924
01:33:20,081 --> 01:33:24,190
because people send me so many products 
and I vet out what actually impacts,

1925
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:29,191
you know,
my blood glucose and ketone levels and 

1926
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:30,730
then maybe about 10 percent of the 
products that people send me.

1927
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,770
I really liked like the energy bits 
here,

1928
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:38,010
the spirulina tablets,
I can take massive amounts and actually 

1929
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:41,641
get a significant amount of protein and 
there's absolutely no glycemic effect 

1930
01:33:41,641 --> 01:33:43,570
and I'm getting huge amounts of 
phytonutrients in it.

1931
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:48,930
So I brought that on these little snack.
I down like 30 at a time.

1932
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,040
So it's 33 servings a thousand tablets.
Jesus.

1933
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:58,080
Yeah.
So that would be like a month supply and

1934
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:58,960
you know,
you can chew them,

1935
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:02,380
they taste kind of grassy and there's a 
little blip in there.

1936
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:02,710
Yeah.

1937
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,420
Or if you don't shoot them,
if you just swallow them,

1938
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:08,550
you don't taste them.
If they don't.

1939
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,750
There's about.
And that's what I did taste like.

1940
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:13,420
I'm almost like sesame seeds.
Yeah.

1941
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:14,210
I like,
I like it,

1942
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:19,520
I like it actually.
Sunflower seeds don't sort of tastes 

1943
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,051
like the lady Catherine.
She was on a shark tank and actually 

1944
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:27,241
they kind of slammed her because I think
she evaluated the company high or they 

1945
01:34:27,241 --> 01:34:27,690
didn't like the taste.
That was the main reason that,

1946
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:32,780
that they didn't like it,
so I mean guys like you and me and most 

1947
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:35,290
guys would be totally fine with the 
taste and the amount of nutrition that's

1948
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:40,291
in that and the density of that makes it
an awesome food for things like special 

1949
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:45,241
ops guys or even even NASA.
I mean there's a lot of nutrition in 

1950
01:34:45,241 --> 01:34:47,320
that little bag right there.
So stunning to me.

1951
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:51,670
How much like mouth,
pleasure factors into people's lives?

1952
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:52,900
Absolutely.
Don't like the taste.

1953
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:54,900
Well,
something can be fantastic for you.

1954
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:59,920
Like,
like I expect that out of my seven year 

1955
01:34:59,920 --> 01:34:59,920
old,
you know,

1956
01:34:59,920 --> 01:34:59,920
she's like,
Eh,

1957
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,530
taste gross.
I don't like it.

1958
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:02,600
I'm like,
I get it.

1959
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:07,810
Yeah.
We'll get out of a 37 year old Jesus 

1960
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:08,380
Christ.
Ninety percent of people really eat.

1961
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:13,390
It's a pleasurable thing to them and 
they don't want to restrict that in any 

1962
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:13,390
way,
shape or form.

1963
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:18,330
That's crazy to me because you don't 
have to restrict it just for the most 

1964
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:21,200
part taken healthy nutrients and you're 
like this,

1965
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:23,180
like,
this is not bad like Jesus Christ,

1966
01:35:23,181 --> 01:35:25,970
if this is the most suffering you get in
a day,

1967
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,260
talk about first world problems,
you know,

1968
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,560
these little energy bits.
There weren't the best thing I've ever 

1969
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:33,560
had.
I don't know what I'm going to do now.

1970
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:38,530
That's not bad.
I mean I see it from the general 

1971
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:40,640
consumer point of view,
like I could see maybe,

1972
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,920
but once they know the science behind 
it,

1973
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:47,921
like the CEO sent me a stack of research
papers and are all off of pub med and I 

1974
01:35:48,891 --> 01:35:52,640
started looking through them and then 
double checking on pub med and realizing

1975
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:57,641
there's a lot of science behind this.
And actually NASA was interested in 

1976
01:35:57,641 --> 01:35:58,460
algae and making capsules because it's a
super,

1977
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:01,350
it's super high in protein has all these
phytonutrients and uh,

1978
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:04,220
you can grow it,
you could figure out a way to grow it in

1979
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:05,720
space and stuff.
Uh,

1980
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:10,721
so I think really that's a future.
Like things like Quito cookie will be a 

1981
01:36:10,721 --> 01:36:11,390
gateway for people to say,
okay,

1982
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:16,391
maybe I can go on this diet and I can 
have these chocolate chip cookies here 

1983
01:36:16,391 --> 01:36:17,090
too.
But then eventually your palette changes

1984
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,400
over time and you don't crave those 
foods anymore.

1985
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:22,850
Like it never happened to me.
Now it's gotten close.

1986
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:27,851
But man,
I smell some fresh bread or a bowl of 

1987
01:36:27,851 --> 01:36:28,520
pasta,
like linguine with clams.

1988
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:33,540
I'm in man.
But you can maybe control yourself a 

1989
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:33,800
little bit better.
Yeah,

1990
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:36,290
you still crave it?
I don't actually crave that at all.

1991
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:39,140
I'm going to crave sweets and chocolate 
maybe.

1992
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:41,010
Sometimes.
Not,

1993
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:44,170
not so much.
I was a big ice cream guy though.

1994
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,480
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1995
01:36:46,481 --> 01:36:48,980
Yeah.
He was eating some on his instagram.

1996
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,020
So,
uh,

1997
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:55,160
the institute that I'm associated with,
the Institute for Human and machine 

1998
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,170
cognition,
Ihmc it's run by the directors.

1999
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,410
Ken Ford,
he was a former director,

2000
01:36:58,411 --> 01:37:00,980
uh,
in NASA executive and NASA and they have

2001
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:05,981
a James Beard award winning chef that 
they hired into Ihmc and he has a 

2002
01:37:05,981 --> 01:37:10,931
specific,
a Keto ice cream recipe which is using 

2003
01:37:10,931 --> 01:37:14,870
the mct and like a pinch of Stevia.
And when you eat the ice cream,

2004
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,900
I mean,
it just blows your mind that this is ice

2005
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:21,590
cream that you could eat every day,
a big bowl and stay on a ketogenic diet.

2006
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:25,170
So these kinds of editing,
I feel innovative.

2007
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,700
You're reading?
Oh yeah,

2008
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,130
yeah.
It's really legit.

2009
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:29,570
Like my wife,
my wife,

2010
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:34,130
she's really like the litmus test.
So when I get products I give,

2011
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:39,580
uh,
the last product I got was the Quito 

2012
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:39,580
Brownie,
so if you like Google,

2013
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:39,580
Quito,
Brownie,

2014
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,210
it'll,
it'll come up and,

2015
01:37:41,211 --> 01:37:43,190
you know,
I gave it to my wife and she was like,

2016
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,360
yeah,
this is pretty good.

2017
01:37:44,361 --> 01:37:46,520
But it had like a,
a shell in it,

2018
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:49,430
which kind of got caught on her teeth or
whatever.

2019
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,760
And she loved the taste but it was a 
little bit,

2020
01:37:52,761 --> 01:37:55,160
uh,
I think because she's so picky,

2021
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:55,830
it was like,
oh,

2022
01:37:55,831 --> 01:37:57,840
I liked it but just had a shell on it or
whatever.

2023
01:37:57,841 --> 01:38:02,841
But Quito Brownie is like another food 
and I see all these entrepreneurial guys

2024
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,720
kind of emerging on the scene and being 
very innovative in the way.

2025
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,510
I mean,
it takes a long time to develop and test

2026
01:38:09,511 --> 01:38:13,110
a product that you can eat that's low 
carb for one thing,

2027
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,780
and then you could,
allows you to adhere,

2028
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:18,120
to accuse yanked diet.
Have you had a cave shake?

2029
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,020
You know,
those are,

2030
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:24,560
I've heard about it.
Is that company got a bunch of the 

2031
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:24,560
fruit.
Oh,

2032
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:24,600
maybe I can try one.
Oh yeah,

2033
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:25,320
for sure.
Okay.

2034
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,030
I'll give you one right now if you want 
one,

2035
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,010
but uh,
we'll wait till after the show.

2036
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,210
Oh yeah,
I'm forgotten those,

2037
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:34,170
those are giant they're made with um,
a lot of good stuff in there.

2038
01:38:34,171 --> 01:38:36,400
But I think a lot of his coconut coconut
milk.

2039
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:37,760
Yeah.
Um,

2040
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,840
this Keto ice cream company,
was it called again?

2041
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:44,930
Yeah.
Actually there's not a company that I 

2042
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:44,930
know of yet.
It's just,

2043
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:44,930
uh,
uh,

2044
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,350
I told them they needed to create some 
ip around this,

2045
01:38:47,351 --> 01:38:48,030
this formula.

2046
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:49,000
But uh,
it was uh,

2047
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:54,220
the,
the Institute for Human and machine 

2048
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:54,410
cognition that the chef there picked it 
up himself.

2049
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,330
Yeah.
He has a number of recipes because,

2050
01:38:57,370 --> 01:39:00,030
uh,
the CEO there can forward.

2051
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:05,031
I mean,
he's a huge fan of the shank diet and 

2052
01:39:05,031 --> 01:39:06,900
it's how I got hooked up with him 
because he realizes that it enhances his

2053
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:11,930
cognition and performance and has 
actually been a big help in moving 

2054
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:16,551
things into government agencies and 
helping them acknowledge that this is a 

2055
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:21,711
very viable,
a form of a way to fuel the astronaut or

2056
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:27,921
fueled a special ops guy.
So He's been kind of instrumental in 

2057
01:39:27,921 --> 01:39:27,921
that regard.
And he is,

2058
01:39:27,921 --> 01:39:28,230
you know,
hired a,

2059
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:31,800
a chef that cooks ketogenic and in a,
in a gourmet fashion,

2060
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:36,801
a James Beard award winning chef,
which I didn't even know what that was 

2061
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:36,801
until I looked it up.
And I was like,

2062
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:38,400
well,
these are very high level chefs that are

2063
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:43,401
specifically in his expertise,
at least at the institute is to create 

2064
01:39:44,551 --> 01:39:48,900
these key to genic recipes that are like
ultra gourmet and amazing to eat.

2065
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:54,430
What about pasta?
Is there like an almond flour based 

2066
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:54,430
pasta?
And not that I've,

2067
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:55,710
you know,
I've tried a lot of things,

2068
01:39:55,711 --> 01:39:56,460
but,
uh,

2069
01:39:56,490 --> 01:40:01,490
I would hesitate to recommend anything 
just because I have not been impressed 

2070
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:01,490
enough to,
uh,

2071
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:06,510
to really.
There's some protein pasta out there 

2072
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:06,690
that's a little bit low car,
but a lot of times they kind of fill you

2073
01:40:06,691 --> 01:40:10,050
up with a lot of soluble fiber and you 
just become like a gas machine,

2074
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,150
you know,
it might be good for your gut microbiome

2075
01:40:12,151 --> 01:40:12,960
in some ways,
but,

2076
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:14,550
uh,
you're feeding all the bugs in there,

2077
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:15,360
but,
uh,

2078
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:18,300
for a large part like if you get,
you know,

2079
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:23,301
every,
we have a certain threshold for soluble 

2080
01:40:23,301 --> 01:40:24,000
fiber which gets broken down into 
butyrate and other things in the gut.

2081
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,800
Uh,
and if you exceed that,

2082
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:27,170
you just become,
you know,

2083
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:32,180
gas machine.
And so maybe it would be good in like a 

2084
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:32,180
small side dish.
Yeah.

2085
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:36,990
So that's your weakness then pause.
So an ice cream too or.

2086
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:42,050
No,
I mean I can go without ice cream and 

2087
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:42,050
sweets really don't get me that much.
I mean,

2088
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:45,771
it's not that big of a deal.
It's not something that I massively 

2089
01:40:45,771 --> 01:40:45,990
crave,
but I'm a big fan of Spaghetti.

2090
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,680
Yeah,
it's a problem.

2091
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:48,660
Yeah.
You know,

2092
01:40:48,661 --> 01:40:50,340
um,
uh,

2093
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:53,950
I think that it's just one of those 
things

2094
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,670
where I bet if I just stopped taking it 
for a long time,

2095
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:02,910
stop eating it for a long time,
but that's been my cheap food for 

2096
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:05,341
awhile.
So if I just cut it out of my system 

2097
01:41:05,341 --> 01:41:05,950
completely for like six months or 
something like that,

2098
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:06,400
I probably,

2099
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:07,490
you know,
if you,

2100
01:41:07,491 --> 01:41:11,510
there's a book that has ice cream,
there's a recipe.

2101
01:41:11,511 --> 01:41:16,511
Jeff Bullock has a book,
it's called the art and science of low 

2102
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:19,001
carbohydrate performance and this will 
appeal to your crowd because a lot of 

2103
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:23,021
mma guys I refer to the book and they 
say this book was incredibly helpful to 

2104
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:27,251
me.
So the art and science of low 

2105
01:41:27,251 --> 01:41:27,620
carbohydrate performance and there's a 
arrest.

2106
01:41:27,621 --> 01:41:32,621
There may be a pasta recipe in the.
I know there's an ice cream recipe in 

2107
01:41:32,621 --> 01:41:34,070
there that's not unlike the recipe I was
just talking about.

2108
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:36,890
So.
But the pasta thing.

2109
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:38,180
Yeah.
That would be.

2110
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:41,780
If someone can nail that down,
that would be pretty good.

2111
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:45,590
At logical achievement,
it would be filled with some weird stuff

2112
01:41:45,591 --> 01:41:47,150
that it.
You were just in Italy.

2113
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:52,810
I saw some pictures where whereabouts 
and did you have pasta and pizza when 

2114
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:55,030
you went off?
Like a rocket way off.

2115
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:58,130
And I do that when I was in Naples,
I and I got to have pizza.

2116
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,020
That was quite awhile ago.
But you know,

2117
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:03,440
it's moderation too.
Well they also have different flower and

2118
01:42:03,441 --> 01:42:04,910
I talked to.
They do,

2119
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:05,230
that's right.

2120
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:10,020
Maynard maynard Keenan from the band 
tool also has a,

2121
01:42:10,021 --> 01:42:12,890
an Osteria,
a restaurant and a um,

2122
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:16,060
a vineyard that he runs in Arizona.
He's a weird guy,

2123
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:18,550
but uh,
he explained on the podcast,

2124
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:21,610
on the podcast rather than I did with 
him recently.

2125
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:26,700
The difference between the Pasta that we
have today in the bread we have today 

2126
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:29,080
and original heirloom wheat which is 
less,

2127
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:34,190
it's lower yield per acre and it has a 
less complex gluten's in it.

2128
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,400
And he's like,
that is what,

2129
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:41,401
when people are talking about like the 
difference between how your body 

2130
01:42:41,401 --> 01:42:42,760
tolerates like certain gluten,
whether it's gluten sensitivity or not.

2131
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:46,120
He's like just,
it's just a different feel.

2132
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:49,960
And I really noticed that when I was in 
Italy when I would eat their pasta.

2133
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:51,550
I mean,
it just,

2134
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:54,220
it tastes different,
it feels different when it's going down.

2135
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:56,570
And I actually ordered a bunch of it 
from,

2136
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:01,820
from Italy,
and I even cooked it at home and I 

2137
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:01,820
noticed it

2138
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:01,820
Lawrence.
And she.

2139
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:03,750
Did you get any,
you don't have any gi?

2140
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,330
So if I go,
which I don't,

2141
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:11,480
if I go to the movies,
sometimes I'll get popcorn and I'm 

2142
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:11,480
completely okay.
Like eating popcorn and then,

2143
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:13,380
you know,
a day or two later and back into ketosis

2144
01:43:13,381 --> 01:43:15,840
really fast without even exoticness 
ketones.

2145
01:43:15,841 --> 01:43:20,841
But if I do eat pizza or pasta,
which I did in the beginning when I 

2146
01:43:21,271 --> 01:43:23,340
would have like these cheat meals 
occasionally,

2147
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:28,580
uh,
I would have some major gi issues 

2148
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:28,580
because your body is,
you know,

2149
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:30,750
digestion,
assimilation,

2150
01:43:30,751 --> 01:43:35,751
transport of these things.
You're typically eating on a day to day 

2151
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:37,800
and then you go without eating them and 
it's like your body doesn't know what to

2152
01:43:37,801 --> 01:43:41,190
do with it.
But when I did go to Italy and we travel

2153
01:43:41,191 --> 01:43:42,450
around all over the place,
my wife,

2154
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:43,440
you know,
loves to travel,

2155
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:48,770
uh,
and we were in Naples and I ate maybe 

2156
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,441
two or three pieces of pizza.
I had absolutely no problems whereas 

2157
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:53,510
that in the US that would have bothered 
me and maybe it was just a,

2158
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:55,250
it may have been the flower on a 
guarantee.

2159
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:56,270
The flower,
it's a,

2160
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,610
it's just a different kind of flour,
I think what they call it,

2161
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:03,640
it's called double o flour.
See if you can find that jamie flower 

2162
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:07,840
that they use and they'll specify for 
imported wheat flour from Italy that 

2163
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,020
it's a special type of flower and that 
flower is essentially heirloom flour.

2164
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:17,230
So the difference between like when you 
buy a tomato from the grocery store and 

2165
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:21,251
it's Pale and bulletproof and you can 
throw it down a flight of stairs and it 

2166
01:44:21,251 --> 01:44:22,940
doesn't even get bruised versus heirloom
tomatoes,

2167
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:26,520
which are almost like a fruit,
I mean really is essentially a fruit and

2168
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,670
they're juicy and very delicate and 
very,

2169
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:32,090
very fragile as well.
There it is.

2170
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:35,990
Is double o flour worth the price?
Well,

2171
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,940
pull it up.
One that had the right.

2172
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,940
Got It.
Um,

2173
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:42,590
uh,
yeah.

2174
01:44:42,591 --> 01:44:44,090
I don't know man.
I mean that's my,

2175
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,850
that's my big problem.
But if I,

2176
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,590
if someone does do that,
if they save,

2177
01:44:48,591 --> 01:44:52,980
they follow a key to genic diet and they
eat a bowl of pasta,

2178
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:57,530
I can't help it.
And then they take exogenous ketones and

2179
01:44:57,531 --> 01:45:00,290
it knocks them back into ketosis.
Is that,

2180
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:04,220
will it stay that way even though they 
bought the body to digest that pasta and

2181
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:06,200
they'll be in ketosis again tomorrow?

2182
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:07,940
Good question.
It won't.

2183
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:12,941
It'll stay that way based upon the 
Pharmaco kinetic properties of the 

2184
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:17,930
supplement you're consuming.
So a ketone salt product,

2185
01:45:17,931 --> 01:45:19,430
you know the ones that are on the 
market.

2186
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:22,130
If it's mixed with a fat,
like medium chain triglyceride,

2187
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:24,860
a the Quito oms system and the eugenic 
system,

2188
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:27,980
our BHB and MCD,
you'll be sustained for longer.

2189
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:33,220
But if you do choose to try to get the 
benefits of ketones and you're on a 

2190
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:37,121
carbohydrate based diet,
you have to consume obviously more 

2191
01:45:37,121 --> 01:45:39,170
exotic ones.
Ketones to get the benefits of ketones.

2192
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:42,080
And you could do that though,
so someone could theoretically do that

2193
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:45,850
and just take exogenous ketones and 
maintain pretty much the

2194
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,630
exact benefits.
And Yeah,

2195
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:52,960
you can do that.
And a lot of people are kind of 

2196
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:52,960
confused,
or like,

2197
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,961
well,
what's the body going to do with the 

2198
01:45:55,961 --> 01:45:55,961
glucose?
Or what's the same thing?

2199
01:45:55,961 --> 01:45:56,090
You could say the same thing if you eat 
fat,

2200
01:45:56,091 --> 01:46:01,091
you know,
what's the body going to do with the 

2201
01:46:01,091 --> 01:46:01,091
glucose?
Well,

2202
01:46:01,091 --> 01:46:01,091
uh,
well interestingly,

2203
01:46:01,091 --> 01:46:04,751
glucose goes down and we don't actually 
know why we think the liver kind of 

2204
01:46:04,751 --> 01:46:09,160
sends out less and these products are 
not really like a huge amount of 

2205
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:09,160
ketones,
right?

2206
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:14,111
It's just enough to get you maybe into 
the one millimolar range and we know 

2207
01:46:14,111 --> 01:46:15,980
that's enough to give your brain like a 
boost and give.

2208
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:19,010
It's one millimolar of ketones in your 
blood.

2209
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:24,011
Actually,
record represents a pretty significant 

2210
01:46:24,011 --> 01:46:24,890
source of energy that your brain can use
and that your heart can use.

2211
01:46:24,891 --> 01:46:27,230
We know the heart runs more efficiently 
off ketones.

2212
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:32,670
Uh,
and probably more importantly is that 

2213
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:35,600
the key tones function as signaling 
molecules that inhibit anti inflammatory

2214
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:37,070
processes.
Uh,

2215
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:41,260
so deep dixit at Yale University did a 
study actually with one of the captains.

2216
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:44,570
What's his name?
His name is Deep Dixit Jesus Christ.

2217
01:46:45,850 --> 01:46:46,940
I never thought about it.
Yeah.

2218
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:52,470
Now he's got a scientist at a comedian 
right there.

2219
01:46:52,471 --> 01:46:53,040
I'm like,
wait,

2220
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:55,980
hold up.
I always look at his Indian name,

2221
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:59,220
but he always tells me to call him d,
But a deep Dick's,

2222
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:00,170
Dick's,
it,

2223
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,020
sorry.
He,

2224
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:04,080
he's a really good scientists and the 
leader in,

2225
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:09,110
uh,
in studying the effects of calorie 

2226
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:12,261
restriction and a and ketones,
and he observed that ketones elevating 

2227
01:47:12,261 --> 01:47:16,641
ketones has a signaling effect,
completely independent of the metabolic 

2228
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:21,891
effect,
which everybody thinks of ketones are a 

2229
01:47:21,891 --> 01:47:21,891
source of energy,
but they are also like a hormone.

2230
01:47:21,891 --> 01:47:24,600
They're like a drug.
So they hit specific pathways.

2231
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,960
The pathway that he found a at the study
at Yale was the NLRP three inflammasome.

2232
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:33,130
You don't have to know that,
but uh,

2233
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:38,150
when that Amazon is activated,
it releases a lot of inflammatory 

2234
01:47:38,150 --> 01:47:40,150
cytokines in the body which are in that 
inflamma.

2235
01:47:40,151 --> 01:47:43,800
Zoom is linked to a lot of age related 
chronic diseases too.

2236
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:48,860
So as we age,
we have more systemic chronic 

2237
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,351
inflammation.
So I always say the people that have 

2238
01:47:51,351 --> 01:47:52,440
that can benefit most from the ketogenic
diet.

2239
01:47:52,441 --> 01:47:57,441
You tend to be get more insulin 
resistant and more trunk obesity as we 

2240
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:02,541
age,
so they are people that will be a more 

2241
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:03,270
receptive to the benefits of the 
Ketogenic Diet as we age,

2242
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:05,550
we become more carbohydrate intolerant 
as we age,

2243
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:10,910
but anyway,
it's the Beta hydroxy butyrate is 

2244
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:13,020
functioning as an anti inflammatory,
like independent of the energy pathways.

2245
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:18,021
So he established that and uh,
it was actually a diet that I helped him

2246
01:48:18,211 --> 01:48:19,860
formulate with exogenous ketones.

2247
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:25,040
And after that got published a,
I got a number of emails from 

2248
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:29,301
pharmaceutical companies because they 
wanted to sort of reverse engineer 

2249
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:31,680
something that had the same effect as a 
key tone,

2250
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:34,790
but to put it into a drug.
And that was a,

2251
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,930
there,
there is a pretty intense,

2252
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,960
you know,
interest in the signaling properties of 

2253
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:44,601
ketones and pharmaceutical companies,
especially histone deacetylase 

2254
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:45,930
inhibitors.
So Beta hydroxybutyrate ketone,

2255
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:50,960
you measure it from your blood functions
to as what we call this h Jak inhibitor,

2256
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:54,840
which affects the genes.
So you're actually turning on genes that

2257
01:48:54,841 --> 01:48:55,690
are neuro,
neuro,

2258
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,840
protective,
that are cellular protective,

2259
01:48:58,110 --> 01:49:02,760
that are linked to longevity pathways.
So think about the rewards of developing

2260
01:49:02,761 --> 01:49:05,840
a drug that did the same thing,
but the financial reward,

2261
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:10,850
you can't patent Beta hydroxybutyrate 
and well in different forms maybe shows 

2262
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:15,531
you whenever something's good,
someone comes along and tries to fuck 

2263
01:49:15,531 --> 01:49:15,531
with us.

2264
01:49:15,531 --> 01:49:15,531
Yeah,
I mean,

2265
01:49:15,531 --> 01:49:15,540
I,
you know,

2266
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:17,660
you could say it's,
you know,

2267
01:49:17,661 --> 01:49:20,070
probably for the most part driven by 
greed,

2268
01:49:20,071 --> 01:49:22,380
but there is a legitimate,
uh,

2269
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:27,440
impact on human health and longevity.
Wouldn't that just be better suited for 

2270
01:49:28,051 --> 01:49:30,240
the Diet?
Absolutely.

2271
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:35,241
I think it's awesome that our body makes
this natural metabolite.

2272
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,040
So the ketone salt products you buy on 
the market are,

2273
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,870
the ketones are derived from natural 
sources.

2274
01:49:39,871 --> 01:49:42,030
So you are giving,
you know,

2275
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,190
uh,
uh,

2276
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:48,040
you are elevating a bio identical form 
of a ketone that your body a,

2277
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:53,041
there's a little bit of the debate 
because there is a d form of Beta 

2278
01:49:53,041 --> 01:49:56,431
hydroxy butyrate in the l form.
So we call that receive mic if they're 

2279
01:49:56,431 --> 01:49:57,190
together,
they're receive make.

2280
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:59,470
And The d form is kind of what your body
makes,

2281
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:04,590
but it can also convert it to the l in 
certain tissues and it can get really 

2282
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:04,590
complicated.

2283
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:09,030
The important thing is that the salts 
that you consume that are commercially 

2284
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:13,351
available,
the d form is more likely to be broken 

2285
01:50:13,351 --> 01:50:16,171
down and utilized as a source of energy,
whereas the l form probably sticks 

2286
01:50:16,171 --> 01:50:20,701
around more within the cell and we know 
the l form actually also functions in 

2287
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:25,921
these signaling roles.
So the l form has antiinflammatory 

2288
01:50:25,921 --> 01:50:25,921
effects,
the l form,

2289
01:50:25,921 --> 01:50:27,370
you know,
hit these signaling pathways.

2290
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:32,670
So the received make mixtures that are 
in the salts may have extra benefits 

2291
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:36,931
over just a pure deform because the l 
form can kind of hang around and 

2292
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:42,721
stimulate all these pathways we know are
beneficial before it's get broken down 

2293
01:50:42,721 --> 01:50:44,020
into fuel.
So there might be some sort of a benefit

2294
01:50:44,021 --> 01:50:48,350
for people even honest strict ketogenic 
diet taking exogenous ketones.

2295
01:50:48,351 --> 01:50:49,570
Yes,
absolutely.

2296
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:50,740
And I think,
you know,

2297
01:50:50,741 --> 01:50:55,741
we work really closely with uh,
the Charlie Foundation and I think the 

2298
01:50:55,741 --> 01:50:59,821
kidogenic diet should never be replaced 
with exogenous ketones at this point 

2299
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:03,871
because the science,
the research is not there yet to 

2300
01:51:03,871 --> 01:51:06,661
validate it,
but we want to go in that direction 

2301
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:07,090
because there's some kids who really 
like their fat intolerant.

2302
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:12,090
They throw up when they like the 
ketogenic diet because it's too high in 

2303
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:13,000
fat and a proportion of the kids are 
like that.

2304
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:14,980
Most kids can follow it.
But,

2305
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:19,981
uh,
but even for like childhood cancers and 

2306
01:51:19,981 --> 01:51:19,981
stuff,
we,

2307
01:51:19,981 --> 01:51:19,981
uh,
I,

2308
01:51:19,981 --> 01:51:21,070
I met with the,
the,

2309
01:51:21,071 --> 01:51:23,470
uh,
the Max love project.

2310
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:25,600
Uh,
he was on Jimmy Kimmel Max.

2311
01:51:25,601 --> 01:51:29,620
He was a brain tumor,
a child with a brain tumor that is,

2312
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:34,910
his family is treating them with a 
ketogenic diet and they helped many 

2313
01:51:34,910 --> 01:51:37,050
families around the area and they have a
foundation,

2314
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:42,060
just Google Max love project and uh,
and his family is helping a Max adhere 

2315
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:48,400
to and stick to a key to genic diet as 
an adjutant to his standard of care.

2316
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:51,790
So not a replacement.
The huge drank diet does work remarkably

2317
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:56,791
well for some people as maybe a 
standalone therapy for cancer and have 

2318
01:51:56,791 --> 01:52:00,571
the anticancer effects,
but as an adjunct to the standard of 

2319
01:52:00,571 --> 01:52:00,571
care,
it's remarkably effective.

2320
01:52:00,571 --> 01:52:01,810
And they're working with,
um,

2321
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:07,440
I think with Orange County yet.
So they have a lifestyle medicine 

2322
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:11,670
program at Children's hospital in Orange
County where they're helping a wide 

2323
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:14,650
variety of families who have kids with 
cancer,

2324
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:19,920
uh,
stick to and adhere to a key to genic 

2325
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,321
diet as part of a wellness program after
they went through their cancer 

2326
01:52:22,321 --> 01:52:26,431
treatment.
Because if you're a child and you get 

2327
01:52:26,431 --> 01:52:29,640
the standard chemotherapy,
you are kind of left in a situation 

2328
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,020
where you're far more likely to have a 
lot of different health,

2329
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:37,380
a negative health consequences after 
that because the chemotherapy wipes out 

2330
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:39,250
your immune system and can create,
you know,

2331
01:52:39,251 --> 01:52:44,251
additional mutation.
So there's kind of like a fallout from 

2332
01:52:44,251 --> 01:52:45,710
the,
from the standard of care and being on a

2333
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:48,110
ketogenic diet can be cellular 
protected,

2334
01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:52,250
can help you in a neoadjuvant and,
and after,

2335
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:57,300
you know,
before standard of care and even after 

2336
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:59,831
Sandra care help you recover and get 
your body back into like a detoxified 

2337
01:52:59,831 --> 01:53:01,070
state if you want to use that term.

2338
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:06,520
That's amazing.
Now how many cancer research places are 

2339
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:08,090
adopting this?
I mean,

2340
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:11,630
it seems like a,
that would be gigantic and this is a big

2341
01:53:11,631 --> 01:53:15,350
shift over to standard care of just a 
few few years ago.

2342
01:53:15,351 --> 01:53:16,280
Right?
Yeah.

2343
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:21,310
So the idea is,
and we wrote a grant with the Moffitt 

2344
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:22,550
Cancer Institute,
which is a tea,

2345
01:53:22,551 --> 01:53:25,010
like a tier one cancer research center.
I mean,

2346
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:27,160
they essentially reached out to us and 
say there's,

2347
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:30,470
there's significant interest in this 
from the National Cancer Institute,

2348
01:53:30,471 --> 01:53:31,480
National,
uh,

2349
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:34,550
Nih,
national institutes of health to use the

2350
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:39,410
ketogenic diet as an adjective in at 
this point instead of replacing standard

2351
01:53:39,411 --> 01:53:40,370
of care,
which,

2352
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,950
uh,
only in situations where the standard of

2353
01:53:42,951 --> 01:53:45,050
care is not effective should that be the
case,

2354
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:50,410
but as an event to further enhance the 
efficacy of the standard care.

2355
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:54,020
So the cues drank diet,
we know limits glucose,

2356
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:59,021
a beat availability to the tumor which 
requires a glucose for growth and 

2357
01:53:59,021 --> 01:53:59,021
proliferation.

2358
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:04,300
It decreases insulin,
adoptable bell and insulin signaling 

2359
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,540
drives cancer growth.
And it also elevates ketones.

2360
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:08,270
And ketones may have an anticancer 
effect.

2361
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:13,330
And for the most part,
especially in very aggressive tumors 

2362
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:17,291
that have dysregulated Mitochondria,
they can't use the ketones for fuel a 

2363
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:22,660
nearly as well as they do like fuels 
like a glucose and maybe even glutamine 

2364
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:27,641
amino acid.
So it enhances the standard of care and 

2365
01:54:27,641 --> 01:54:27,920
helps them,
uh,

2366
01:54:27,921 --> 01:54:30,680
actually protects them from the healthy 
cells,

2367
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:32,720
from the radiation damage,
from the standard,

2368
01:54:32,721 --> 01:54:36,110
it sensitizes the tumor to radiation and
kills off more tumor.

2369
01:54:36,111 --> 01:54:41,111
And it protects your healthy cells.
So when my colleague Adrian check at the

2370
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:46,270
Barrow Neurological Institute has done 
some remarkable work in animal models 

2371
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:49,001
showing this and that has translated 
into a human study and actually garnered

2372
01:54:49,131 --> 01:54:53,660
more interest in this area to use the 
ketogenic diet as an edge event.

2373
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:58,690
I think in some cases where the standard
of care has failed for Glioblastoma or 

2374
01:54:58,761 --> 01:55:00,230
advanced metastatic cancer.

2375
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:05,290
I think the key to genic diet can kind 
of be a base therapy for a more 

2376
01:55:06,501 --> 01:55:11,180
comprehensive metabolic based program.
And we wrote an article called the press

2377
01:55:11,181 --> 01:55:16,181
pulse where the key to genic diet and 
maybe something like metformin and other

2378
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:20,150
drugs can,
can be used to weaken in the cancer.

2379
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,910
And unlimited fuel source and then you 
can connect,

2380
01:55:22,911 --> 01:55:27,911
come in with more maybe more aggressive 
ways like hyperbaric oxygen therapy,

2381
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:33,580
which can reverse tumor hypoxia or 
various a low dose chemo regimens so you

2382
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:35,930
will weaken the cancer,
you know,

2383
01:55:35,931 --> 01:55:40,931
you put your body into a state of 
Ketosis and then you come in and pulse 

2384
01:55:40,931 --> 01:55:45,070
at predetermined time points maybe every
three weeks of therapy in a much lower 

2385
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:49,551
dosing regimen to gradually knocked down
and reduce the tumor volume over time 

2386
01:55:50,011 --> 01:55:53,340
and you do it in a more gradual way 
instead of going in there,

2387
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:54,390
you know,
with surgery,

2388
01:55:54,391 --> 01:55:57,030
radiation and Chemo,
which is kind of like slash and burn and

2389
01:55:57,031 --> 01:55:57,870
it leaves the patient.

2390
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:00,480
The patient coming out of that therapy 
is much,

2391
01:56:00,481 --> 01:56:05,070
much weaker than when they came in.
So at therapy can be developed that when

2392
01:56:05,071 --> 01:56:07,530
the patient comes in and they come out 
the other side,

2393
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,320
they're actually in more robust health.
We know that they can,

2394
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:12,140
you know,
we could do that doesn't grow.

2395
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:14,490
That's possible from a theoretical 
standpoint,

2396
01:56:14,491 --> 01:56:19,491
you know,
with various research being done in 

2397
01:56:19,491 --> 01:56:21,771
animal models and what we know about 
nutrition and physiology that can be 

2398
01:56:21,771 --> 01:56:26,091
done.
It's just going to take some time to do 

2399
01:56:26,091 --> 01:56:28,521
it.
It's just so interesting when you talk 

2400
01:56:28,521 --> 01:56:28,521
about the shift of information.
I mean when you were in college,

2401
01:56:28,521 --> 01:56:30,060
being fat phobic,
you know,

2402
01:56:30,061 --> 01:56:35,061
to now being like one of the premier 
guys that's out here preaching the 

2403
01:56:35,061 --> 01:56:36,620
benefits of the key to genic die and 
then seeing this,

2404
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:38,520
I mean,
up until really recently,

2405
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:41,340
cancer research always dependent upon 
these,

2406
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:45,120
you know,
chemotherapy and radiation and all these

2407
01:56:45,121 --> 01:56:48,030
different standards that everyone's been
having success with,

2408
01:56:48,031 --> 01:56:53,031
but the idea that you could actually 
make a person healthier through the 

2409
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:55,920
Ketogenic Diet and hyperbaric chambers 
and things along those lines.

2410
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:57,510
That's a,
it's amazing.

2411
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:03,620
Yeah.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy actually is 

2412
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:04,370
FDA approved for things like radiation 
necrosis.

2413
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:06,660
Like when you have radiation,
you know,

2414
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:11,800
on a tumor,
you have a lot of necrotic tissue and 

2415
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,310
patients would undergo hyperbaric oxygen
for radiation necrosis.

2416
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:14,390
And,
you know,

2417
01:57:14,391 --> 01:57:16,010
I would,
I would go to these,

2418
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:21,060
uh,
various conferences over the years and 

2419
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:24,251
talked to these physicians and these 
patients would make remarkable 

2420
01:57:24,251 --> 01:57:24,251
recoveries,
you know,

2421
01:57:24,251 --> 01:57:27,970
even after they have therapy.
And it seemed like something else was 

2422
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:27,970
going kind of going on here.
And,

2423
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:30,770
uh,
and if I go back early in my work,

2424
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,800
I mentioned that we develop these 
technologies through our work with the 

2425
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,310
department of the fence and when the 
officer where we,

2426
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:42,400
we build a hyperbaric chamber and then 
we buy an off the shelf microscope and 

2427
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:46,391
install it inside the chamber.
And then we close it up and then we 

2428
01:57:46,391 --> 01:57:47,450
pressurize it to simulate,
you know,

2429
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:50,850
what a dive would be while we're looking
at the Mitochondria and,

2430
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:51,770
and even the cells.

2431
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:54,710
And I did that with like Kelsey's stem 
cells and neurons.

2432
01:57:54,711 --> 01:57:59,711
And we did it with a Glioblastoma cell 
line and we noticed that the cells were 

2433
01:57:59,711 --> 01:58:03,701
exploding with high levels of oxygen.
I didn't know what I was seeing at the 

2434
01:58:03,701 --> 01:58:07,211
time,
but I looked into it more and started 

2435
01:58:07,211 --> 01:58:07,211
contacting some of the leaders in the 
field.

2436
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:08,450
And,
uh,

2437
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:13,510
and they reported a.
One of them was Thomas Seyfried at 

2438
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:16,060
Boston college and he was a,
a neuro genetics professor at Yale 

2439
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,820
University and then had moved to Boston 
to expand it,

2440
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:22,430
a ketogenic diet program for cancer.
And he told me,

2441
01:58:22,431 --> 01:58:27,431
you know,
what you're observing is damaged 

2442
01:58:27,431 --> 01:58:29,951
mitochondria from cancer cells which 
have damaged Mitochondria and if you 

2443
01:58:29,951 --> 01:58:33,521
give them more oxygen,
it will produce proportionately more 

2444
01:58:33,521 --> 01:58:37,090
reactive oxygen species and that 
oxidative stress would essentially 

2445
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:41,891
trigger a necrosis and a pop ptosis in 
the cell so they would be able cell 

2446
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:46,351
death at a level of oxygen that was 
relatively nontoxic to the healthy 

2447
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:46,351
cells.

2448
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:51,240
So,
and then we did some work with ketones 

2449
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:51,240
and saw that ketones were stopping the 
growth of cancer too.

2450
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,450
So we had this idea of using,
you know,

2451
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:58,560
nutritional ketosis plus hyperbaric 
oxygen and studying that in a mouse 

2452
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,400
model of cancer.
And,

2453
01:59:00,401 --> 01:59:05,401
uh,
and we've got some remarkable results 

2454
01:59:05,401 --> 01:59:05,401
that we published and this is,
uh,

2455
01:59:05,401 --> 01:59:09,781
you know,
patients are doing this kind of a in an 

2456
01:59:09,781 --> 01:59:10,480
off label way.
They're doing the Diet.

2457
01:59:10,481 --> 01:59:15,481
But now we have,
if we go to clinical trials dot Gov and 

2458
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:17,290
you just look up ketogenic diet,
you see more than a dozen studies,

2459
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:19,300
you know.
So when I got into this,

2460
01:59:19,301 --> 01:59:23,680
there was no studies,
so now there's been an interest and even

2461
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:25,840
maybe people like jumping on the 
bandwagon of,

2462
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:27,850
you know,
if they have a particular drug,

2463
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:29,530
will accuse drank diet,
enhance it,

2464
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:32,920
or let's see if it enhance it,
the standard of care or let's see,

2465
01:59:32,921 --> 01:59:34,330
we're standard of care failed.

2466
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:38,620
If we can get these patients on this 
metabolic therapy and see if we can help

2467
01:59:38,621 --> 01:59:41,170
them with quality of life.
It's so exciting.

2468
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:44,020
I mean it's just really amazing,
exciting stuff.

2469
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:49,680
It's so,
so interesting seeing something like 

2470
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,721
this emerge.
It'll relatively late in terms of like 

2471
01:59:51,721 --> 01:59:53,080
medicine and science.
I mean 2017.

2472
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:54,670
We're talking about something that's 
diet.

2473
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Yep.
So just if you google like kidogenic 

2474
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,001
diet and a Google search around 2012,
it's down here and something happened 

2475
02:00:03,001 --> 02:00:06,560
around 2013 or 14 or just skyrocketed it
was that.

2476
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,790
Do you know?
I have no idea.

2477
02:00:07,791 --> 02:00:09,820
I mean,
I was on Tim Ferriss and other things,

2478
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:11,870
but a lot of my colleagues,
so,

2479
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:17,200
uh,
probably dating back to 2014,

2480
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:18,900
20,
that could be,

2481
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:22,170
but it's really my colleagues.
I mean there's so many humble,

2482
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:23,080
so,
well,

2483
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:28,140
you know,
I'm sure your colleagues have a lot to 

2484
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:29,701
do with it,
but as far as the impact of the impact 

2485
02:00:29,701 --> 02:00:32,910
cast,
the impact that a podcast has in terms 

2486
02:00:32,910 --> 02:00:33,190
of the amount of people that are going 
to google something,

2487
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:34,210
it's probably,
yeah,

2488
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:39,270
many,
many magnitudes greater than anything 

2489
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:39,270
that anybody is doing,
you know,

2490
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:40,590
from professor or,
you know,

2491
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:40,990
some.

2492
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,850
I realize that now.
So,

2493
02:00:42,851 --> 02:00:47,851
and I,
I thank you for letting me have this 

2494
02:00:47,851 --> 02:00:47,851
platform.
But,

2495
02:00:47,851 --> 02:00:47,851
uh,
I,

2496
02:00:47,851 --> 02:00:51,960
I almost feel like there's guys like the
guy that got me into this was Dr Jiang 

2497
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:53,890
row and he was at Barrow Neurological 
Institute.

2498
02:00:53,891 --> 02:00:58,891
He mentored my colleague Adrian check 
into looking at ketones for 

2499
02:00:59,411 --> 02:01:04,411
Glioblastoma.
He's runs the pediatric center in 

2500
02:01:04,411 --> 02:01:04,411
Calgary Right now.
Uh,

2501
02:01:04,411 --> 02:01:08,050
but Dr Eric Kossoff from Johns Hopkins 
was a big,

2502
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:10,450
big help to me.
A number of people.

2503
02:01:10,451 --> 02:01:11,920
I feel like they should have this 
platform,

2504
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:12,420
but you know,
they're,

2505
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:17,430
they're so busy they don't do podcasts,
but I realized fairly early on it was 

2506
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:20,641
really important to get the message out 
because it does no good if you're not 

2507
02:01:20,641 --> 02:01:24,811
hitting a big target.
And what I focused on was not just one 

2508
02:01:24,811 --> 02:01:29,161
application,
but I mean we do everything from wound 

2509
02:01:29,161 --> 02:01:29,810
healing to these genetic diseases to 
cancer,

2510
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:31,420
to various seizure disorders.

2511
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:36,430
So I realized this was a lot bigger than
just pediatric epilepsy and uh,

2512
02:01:36,431 --> 02:01:40,300
and it's the only way you should eat it 
is.

2513
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,620
I mean,
I don't know,

2514
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,700
tell everybody they should eat 
ketogenic,

2515
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:48,701
but I definitely feel that they should 
at least go into ketosis a couple times 

2516
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:53,231
a year if not for just longevity effects
for anti inflammatory effects when,

2517
02:01:53,391 --> 02:01:58,391
um,
when things pop up and we're under 

2518
02:01:58,391 --> 02:01:58,391
stress,
like a,

2519
02:01:58,391 --> 02:02:02,470
had an email yesterday,
a person had severe shingles or severe,

2520
02:02:02,651 --> 02:02:05,330
like a outbreaks of a,
even the,

2521
02:02:05,710 --> 02:02:07,970
like a fever blisters or something like 
that,

2522
02:02:07,971 --> 02:02:12,971
or cold sores.
And if they just fast and do the 

2523
02:02:12,971 --> 02:02:13,400
ketogenic diet,
it suppresses that.

2524
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:18,440
Or when they had.
Since they've been on the Ketogenic 

2525
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:21,130
Diet,
they had profound suppression of some 

2526
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:25,631
viral disorders that when the virus,
when there's viral shedding and there's,

2527
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:27,260
you know,
you're affected by the virus,

2528
02:02:27,261 --> 02:02:29,780
it causes profound,
uh,

2529
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:33,230
in inflammation and neuroinflammation,
so it kind of starts with a headache and

2530
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:38,231
then it will kind of lead to the 
itchiness or whatever associated with 

2531
02:02:38,231 --> 02:02:39,230
shingles,
but they described it very elegant,

2532
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:44,320
you know,
elegantly in an email and it was very 

2533
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:44,320
clear,
you know,

2534
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:47,921
before and after,
since they've been doing the ketogenic 

2535
02:02:47,921 --> 02:02:47,921
diet had a profound effect even more so 
than the drugs,

2536
02:02:47,921 --> 02:02:49,250
anti viral drugs that they're taking.

2537
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:54,640
So even something like HIV,
which contributes to neuroinflammation 

2538
02:02:56,631 --> 02:03:00,950
and even different types of cancers,
like a Kaposi Sarcoma,

2539
02:03:00,951 --> 02:03:02,060
I think,
uh,

2540
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:07,090
being being in a state of nutritional 
ketosis could probably offer a lot of 

2541
02:03:07,090 --> 02:03:09,260
benefits to HIV patients that really 
struggle,

2542
02:03:09,650 --> 02:03:14,650
you know,
with some symptoms that are associated 

2543
02:03:14,650 --> 02:03:16,280
with inflammation and other things 
associated.

2544
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:18,500
So this is another path we're going into
it.

2545
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:21,470
So some of those researchers has reached
out to us and say,

2546
02:03:21,471 --> 02:03:23,420
hey,
the NIH has a proposal for this.

2547
02:03:23,421 --> 02:03:26,030
Let's write a grant together.
So I'm in the like,

2548
02:03:26,031 --> 02:03:31,031
it's been,
it's crazy because I only have such so 

2549
02:03:31,031 --> 02:03:34,031
much of a bandwidth,
but people from Ivy League institutions 

2550
02:03:34,031 --> 02:03:34,580
are reaching out to me and saying,
Hey,

2551
02:03:34,581 --> 02:03:39,581
can you help us formulate a ketogenic 
diet or can we use your ketone 

2552
02:03:39,581 --> 02:03:41,390
supplement to do a study on things I 
never thought,

2553
02:03:41,391 --> 02:03:46,391
you know,
a nutritional ketosis would be applied 

2554
02:03:46,391 --> 02:03:46,391
to.

2555
02:03:46,391 --> 02:03:47,060
Now what about wound healing?
You brought up wound healing.

2556
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:48,140
Yeah,
that's the big one.

2557
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,340
Uh,
one of my students,

2558
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:51,050
uh,
Dr Shannon Kessel,

2559
02:03:51,051 --> 02:03:56,051
she actually works for the epigenics 
foundation now helping the dogs at the 

2560
02:03:56,051 --> 02:04:00,191
Quito pet sanctuary.
She did her phd on the effects of 

2561
02:04:00,711 --> 02:04:05,570
ketones on a wound healing model.
And the model that we use was,

2562
02:04:05,950 --> 02:04:07,280
uh,
essentially,

2563
02:04:07,281 --> 02:04:08,720
you know,
the back of a rat.

2564
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:10,070
Hopefully there's,
you know,

2565
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,540
animal protection people.
But,

2566
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:16,720
but in describing what we do,
we basically have a wound that's a 

2567
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:20,321
pretty,
pretty nasty wound on the back of a rat 

2568
02:04:20,321 --> 02:04:23,290
where one side is a schemic,
it lacks significant blood flow and the 

2569
02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:26,810
other side is non ischemic.
And then which has normal blood flow and

2570
02:04:26,811 --> 02:04:31,811
there's like a chunk of tissue kind of 
taken out and then we look to see how 

2571
02:04:31,811 --> 02:04:35,201
fast that wound closes up right over 
time and we do it in young animals and 

2572
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:40,331
we do in aged animals and we take 
animals and then we feed them a standard

2573
02:04:40,441 --> 02:04:43,350
road in Chow,
which is high carbohydrate Roden Chow,

2574
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:48,500
and then we have a number of different 
groups where we give them various types 

2575
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:48,500
of ketone supplements.

2576
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,230
And we found that,
uh,

2577
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:55,670
admitted that the ketone supplements 
enhance the wound healing not only in 

2578
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:59,721
the aged,
which was pretty remarkable and 

2579
02:04:59,721 --> 02:04:59,721
ischemic,
but also in the young had event.

2580
02:04:59,721 --> 02:05:04,671
So it was like for the young healthy guy
that has a cut or a wound on the 

2581
02:05:04,681 --> 02:05:08,070
battlefield or something like that,
it can help that wound heal up faster.

2582
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,800
And it's doing it through a variety of 
mechanisms.

2583
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:15,890
Probably a,
the wound itself is often the,

2584
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:21,280
the wound tissue is deficient in ATP.
The energy source because the blood 

2585
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:21,630
can't get to it.
Right?

2586
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:26,810
So the ketones can restore like 90 
percent of it has 90 percent less atp in

2587
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:31,971
some cases we have ischemic wounds.
The ketones have the ability to like we 

2588
02:05:31,971 --> 02:05:34,260
think,
thin out the blood and be able to get to

2589
02:05:34,261 --> 02:05:39,261
that wound tissue that's lacking oxygen 
and blood flow and not only does it 

2590
02:05:39,301 --> 02:05:44,301
restore the energy to the wound healing 
which can allow cells to replicate and 

2591
02:05:45,091 --> 02:05:48,210
heal up the wound faster,
but I talked about the anti inflammatory

2592
02:05:48,211 --> 02:05:48,630
effects.

2593
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:53,900
So persistent chronic inflammation can 
prevent the wound from healing up and by

2594
02:05:54,601 --> 02:05:59,601
suppressing some of the inflammatory 
pathways that can kind of open the gate 

2595
02:05:59,601 --> 02:06:03,980
on the activity of Eris growth factors 
and healing processes that can heal the 

2596
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:06,960
wound up and it seems to be pretty 
profound in the age,

2597
02:06:06,961 --> 02:06:11,961
but also happens in the young.
Now this is just taking exotic Pr Jones 

2598
02:06:11,961 --> 02:06:14,820
and not even entered Chow from rodents,
standard child.

2599
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:19,470
So we didn't want to kind of messy up 
the the data in any way.

2600
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:21,900
We actually should've done a well if we 
had the funding,

2601
02:06:21,901 --> 02:06:25,320
we could have done a key to genic diet 
plus keynote and supplementation.

2602
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:27,210
And you think that would be been better?
Yeah,

2603
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:32,270
I definitely think it would because the 
ketogenic diet alone suppresses some of 

2604
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:36,111
these inflammatory components that,
that is associated with impaired wound 

2605
02:06:36,111 --> 02:06:40,401
healing,
especially impaired wound healing in 

2606
02:06:40,401 --> 02:06:40,401
like a diabetic model.

2607
02:06:40,401 --> 02:06:42,030
So I talked about hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy,

2608
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:47,060
the main applications that is for 
diabetic wounds that don't heal up 

2609
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:48,060
because the oxygen and glucose doesn't 
get to it.

2610
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,270
Uh,
so in the diabetic wound,

2611
02:06:51,271 --> 02:06:53,030
the problem is that,
uh,

2612
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:58,580
it's really a blood flow problem and we 
did to answer that question that 

2613
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:02,961
determine if it was blood flow.
We did a doppler blood flow analysis of 

2614
02:07:02,961 --> 02:07:07,131
the blood flow into wound and showed 
that it was something like a 25 or 30 

2615
02:07:07,131 --> 02:07:11,391
percent increase in blood flow to the 
wound when we induced acute ketosis.

2616
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,450
So we'd given jd incredible,
we stimulate,

2617
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:19,480
you know,
ketosis that would mimic Qj diet or 

2618
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,801
fasting.
And then we do a doppler blood flow 

2619
02:07:21,801 --> 02:07:23,100
analysis and we show a pretty remarkable
increase in.

2620
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,290
That's a huge increase.
Yeah.

2621
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:30,440
That's being.
That seems like that would be the move 

2622
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:30,490
for someone who's recovering from some 
sort of research or something,

2623
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:35,580
a hyperbaric chamber combined with 
Ketosis mutagenic and for the Va.

2624
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:41,260
My collaborator on this project,
dr lisa gold at one time,

2625
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:46,261
she was the,
she was the president of the wound 

2626
02:07:46,261 --> 02:07:46,870
healing society.
And even she was like,

2627
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:48,510
this is really reMarkable.
I mean,

2628
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:51,320
to have someone of her stature,
she's an md phd,

2629
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:54,910
a really comment that this is profound,
you know,

2630
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:58,990
effect on wound healing really motivated
us to follow up on this.

2631
02:07:58,991 --> 02:07:59,720
but,
uh,

2632
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:04,740
we have not gotten funding after that,
so we really need to keep working 

2633
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:05,740
because we need to follow up on this 
study,

2634
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:10,830
uh,
and get this as a legitimate wound to a 

2635
02:08:10,830 --> 02:08:13,701
lot of people are trying to enhance the 
wound healing process by putting things 

2636
02:08:13,701 --> 02:08:14,120
on the wound,
you know,

2637
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:19,200
but we're wound healing is enhanced if 
you alter and optimize your metabolic 

2638
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:21,450
physiology that promotes,
you know,

2639
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:24,550
substrate and oxygenation to the wound,
you know,

2640
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:25,630
and that's what ketones do.

2641
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:27,640
I mean,
you have a vasodilation effect.

2642
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:31,000
There is a big increase in a denison.
Denison is a pretty profound vasodilator

2643
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:36,020
dilator,
so you have a vasodilation that's 

2644
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:38,350
improving blood flow to the area where 
there's not only glucose in there,

2645
02:08:38,351 --> 02:08:43,060
but there's ketones and ketones help 
restore the energy in that wound that is

2646
02:08:43,061 --> 02:08:48,061
sufficiently depressed from lack of 
blood flow and it's promoting or 

2647
02:08:48,061 --> 02:08:52,231
reducing a lot of the inflammatory 
things that are preventing it from 

2648
02:08:52,231 --> 02:08:52,390
healing in the first place.
So,

2649
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:53,410
uh,
yeah,

2650
02:08:53,411 --> 02:08:58,411
I mean this was really like it was 
presented at the wound healing society 

2651
02:08:58,411 --> 02:08:59,020
and they were,
a lot of people were floored by it.

2652
02:08:59,021 --> 02:09:00,560
So it's.
Shannon has a,

2653
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:05,640
my student has went and moved on and 
doing postdoctoral work at another 

2654
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:06,490
place,
but I really need to follow up on that.

2655
02:09:06,491 --> 02:09:08,520
We have a lot of projects,
you know,

2656
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,470
we're trying to process in parallel 
right now,

2657
02:09:11,770 --> 02:09:13,510
but yeah,
I neeD another student to,

2658
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:15,280
to,
because that may have been,

2659
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:16,330
you know,
that.

2660
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:19,030
And you know,
some of the motor function,

2661
02:09:19,031 --> 02:09:24,031
gLucose lowering and antianxiety effects
are all thinGs that kinda jumped out of 

2662
02:09:24,191 --> 02:09:27,490
the data from us that I like never would
have expected,

2663
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:32,520
you know,
is I came in this to look at seizures 

2664
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,590
now.
What was the hard data in terms of like 

2665
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:34,930
what is the percentage of increase in 
healing across the board with the,

2666
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:39,960
with the routes.
So if we look at time time for that 

2667
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,620
wound to close and heal up,
it's about 20,

2668
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:45,240
20 to 25 percent.
That's significant mirrors.

2669
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:46,750
The amount of blood flow that you were 
talking about,

2670
02:09:46,751 --> 02:09:49,450
the increase in blood flow big about 20 
percent does.

2671
02:09:49,451 --> 02:09:52,180
I don't know if you could draw a direct 
correlation to that,

2672
02:09:52,181 --> 02:09:57,181
but obviously if you have improved blood
flow that's getting nutrition to the 

2673
02:09:57,181 --> 02:09:58,300
wound,
uh,

2674
02:09:58,301 --> 02:10:03,301
and we know that that blood has ketones 
in it which have anti inflammatory 

2675
02:10:03,301 --> 02:10:04,810
effects and things like,
you know,

2676
02:10:04,811 --> 02:10:07,310
it stimulates a,
the h deck,

2677
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:10,960
each tech one and two,
which stimulates superoxide dismutase,

2678
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:14,300
another antioxidant enzymes which are 
often dysregulated,

2679
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,310
you know,
at the wound site.

2680
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:20,580
So it's doing a lot of,
not only just restoring oxygenation and 

2681
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,810
blood flow,
but it's having like a drug like effects

2682
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:26,230
these metabolites are really like 
signaling and it makes sense like,

2683
02:10:26,231 --> 02:10:28,000
you know,
if we're in a state of starvation,

2684
02:10:28,001 --> 02:10:30,340
ketosis,
the ketones would have,

2685
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:35,400
you know,
be telling the brain to do certain 

2686
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,351
things and different neuro 
pharmacological pathways that it should 

2687
02:10:37,351 --> 02:10:39,470
be altering our behavior in ways you 
don't want to.

2688
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:44,740
The person that is deprived of food and 
becomes tired from hypoglycemia and qa 

2689
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:50,590
is the person that's going to die.
So the people that survived in the 

2690
02:10:50,590 --> 02:10:53,771
absence of food availability were the 
ones that became more lucid and clear 

2691
02:10:53,771 --> 02:10:57,140
and we were able to go and forage or 
hunt down the animal and kill it and eat

2692
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:59,270
it.
So we Are hardwired.

2693
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:00,380
I mean,
to answer your question,

2694
02:11:00,381 --> 02:11:02,080
I think a while back you asked,
you know,

2695
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:03,950
why,
why do we have ketones?

2696
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:06,920
Why?
I think it's an evolutionarily hardwired

2697
02:11:06,921 --> 02:11:09,000
system that,
uh,

2698
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:12,650
is just built into our dna.
And,

2699
02:11:12,651 --> 02:11:13,850
uh,
you know,

2700
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:18,260
with the advent of carbohydrates and 
frequent feedings and you know,

2701
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:23,280
a deli on every corner here,
we've largely silenced that genetic 

2702
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:27,581
program that becomes activated upon food
deprivation that can stimulate a host of

2703
02:11:28,041 --> 02:11:31,820
beneficial things from extension of 
longevity to autophagy.

2704
02:11:31,821 --> 02:11:32,450
And no,
rhonda,

2705
02:11:32,451 --> 02:11:33,710
patrick,
you know,

2706
02:11:33,711 --> 02:11:38,711
and I'm a big fan of her,
she's talked about this a quite a lot 

2707
02:11:38,711 --> 02:11:38,711
and she's awesome.
And uh,

2708
02:11:38,711 --> 02:11:39,560
yeah,
she's super awesome.

2709
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:42,990
She actually visited the lab and we did 
a podcast with her at our lab.

2710
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:43,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2711
02:11:43,641 --> 02:11:46,250
She's just scares the shit out of me.
Every time I talked to her I'm like,

2712
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:49,430
basically a monkey knows the same 
languages.

2713
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:54,431
Her,
she's like an encyclopedia of 

2714
02:11:54,431 --> 02:11:54,431
information.
Uh,

2715
02:11:54,431 --> 02:11:54,920
and she always come prepared.
So I came prepared.

2716
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:55,430
I was like,
yeah,

2717
02:11:55,431 --> 02:11:56,430
I should do it.
Rhonda does.

2718
02:11:56,431 --> 02:11:58,430
So I wrote down some notes here.
I probably,

2719
02:11:58,431 --> 02:12:00,410
there's probably things I'll forget,
but um,

2720
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,650
but yeah,
so yeah,

2721
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:08,700
it's,
it's a system that typically was 

2722
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:10,010
activated in the normal person,
you know,

2723
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:12,290
uh,
during periods of millennia ago.

2724
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:17,500
Yeah.
And actually enhanced your 

2725
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:17,500
concentratIon.
Absolutely.

2726
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:19,640
That's one of the things,
to go back to the hunting thing,

2727
02:12:19,641 --> 02:12:22,730
my friend remy warren,
who's a pretty famous,

2728
02:12:22,731 --> 02:12:25,730
a hunter and one of them,
one of the things that he says,

2729
02:12:25,731 --> 02:12:30,731
and he's always said this,
that he likes to hunt hungry and one of 

2730
02:12:30,731 --> 02:12:34,361
the things he does,
he does these back pump back country 

2731
02:12:34,361 --> 02:12:38,120
hunting trips solo and he purposely 
brings to little food.

2732
02:12:38,790 --> 02:12:43,790
Yeah.
On one of the things that he's found 

2733
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:46,451
over his many years is that when he is 
actually hungry is more tuned in and he 

2734
02:12:46,451 --> 02:12:48,230
does a better job of understanding 
what's going on.

2735
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:49,520
Yeah.
It's amazing.

2736
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:54,550
Like the first time I actually started 
experimenting with fasting or even a 

2737
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:58,660
calorie restricted diet.
I took a walk around my neighborhood at 

2738
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:01,490
the time and it's like my whole nostrils
opened up.

2739
02:13:01,491 --> 02:13:03,500
I could smell things.
I could hear things.

2740
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:06,170
I was more lucid in ways I had not been 
before,

2741
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:11,560
uh,
even fasted for seven days and was able 

2742
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:14,471
to give a lecture and train in the gym 
and lift weights that were not hardly 

2743
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:17,570
much lower than what I typically do.
So I probably couldn't.

2744
02:13:17,571 --> 02:13:20,630
Do you know,
it was just at seven day per point after

2745
02:13:20,631 --> 02:13:22,680
no calories.
I was starting to freeze at all,

2746
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:25,310
no galleries after seven days,
just water,

2747
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:27,380
water and some,
uh,

2748
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:32,410
like a bullying cube,
so some electrolytes like sodium 

2749
02:13:32,410 --> 02:13:34,890
potassium and lots of water and I allow 
myself a,

2750
02:13:34,891 --> 02:13:37,410
about a third of the coffee that I would
typically drink.

2751
02:13:37,410 --> 02:13:42,410
So I'd have a small cup of coffee in the
morning and I got a ton of stuff done 

2752
02:13:42,410 --> 02:13:42,990
during that week.
Like I had,

2753
02:13:42,991 --> 02:13:44,210
you know,
because I didn't have to,

2754
02:13:44,590 --> 02:13:47,250
to make my food,
I didn't have to clean up my food,

2755
02:13:47,251 --> 02:13:50,190
I didn't have time eating the food.
So I saved a lot of time.

2756
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:55,850
Uh,
I think I lost eight to nine pounds and 

2757
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:58,000
then within a week or two it,
it all came back again.

2758
02:13:58,030 --> 02:13:59,000
You know,
a lot of it's new,

2759
02:13:59,010 --> 02:14:01,610
you're holding glycogen and,
and you lose like a.

2760
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:03,720
But uh,
in regards to,

2761
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:06,660
you know,
at the time I'm like,

2762
02:14:06,661 --> 02:14:10,980
my deadlift strength was maybe eight 
reps for eight or 10 reps with like five

2763
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:16,010
65.
and I was able to do 10 easy reps with 

2764
02:14:16,010 --> 02:14:16,680
five plates on each side,
which is about 500.

2765
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:18,570
Uh,
and you know,

2766
02:14:18,571 --> 02:14:22,110
typically going into this,
I was parenthood when I was,

2767
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:23,250
you know,
I followed,

2768
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:28,500
I listened to [inaudible] podcast and I 
was a huge follower during aids in 1994.

2769
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:34,220
And I was eating.
So I was eating four to six meals a day 

2770
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:38,091
with shakes in between.
And I remember even having like 

2771
02:14:38,091 --> 02:14:39,140
nightmares,
I would wake up in the middle nightmare.

2772
02:14:39,150 --> 02:14:44,150
Like the nightmare would be.
I didn't have like food on me after two 

2773
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:44,640
hours.
Like I would have to eat like every two.

2774
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:46,620
I was so obsessed with getting bigger 
and stronger.

2775
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:51,480
And so for me to fast seven days and to 
be out of my comfort zone,

2776
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:56,600
that was like a big step for me.
So I kinda just did it to mentally 

2777
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:00,360
liberate myself from chronic overfeeding
and things.

2778
02:15:00,361 --> 02:15:05,361
And because I was,
I had just read and studied george 

2779
02:15:05,361 --> 02:15:08,391
cahill and the harvard medical school 
study where they fasted for 40 days and 

2780
02:15:08,391 --> 02:15:08,480
I'm looking at,
you know,

2781
02:15:08,481 --> 02:15:10,410
all the parameters on that.
And I was like,

2782
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:12,480
it's not going to kill me,
it's probably going to do me well.

2783
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,520
And uh,
the more I did it,

2784
02:15:14,521 --> 02:15:17,160
the second and third day we're,
we're kinda hard for me.

2785
02:15:17,161 --> 02:15:20,580
But after like the fifth day it became,
it was bizarre.

2786
02:15:20,581 --> 02:15:24,460
It became like really easy and I was 
just kind of like floating around like,

2787
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:27,750
like my body had no inflammation.
Uh,

2788
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:32,751
I wasn't buzzing with energy,
but I was very lucid and I didn't feel 

2789
02:15:32,751 --> 02:15:36,120
like I need it to be buzzed.
Like I realized I'm so much,

2790
02:15:36,121 --> 02:15:39,570
but a lot of times I feel like I need to
drink coffee to amp up to be my best.

2791
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:44,900
But I was my best when my brain was 
really calm and I was able to put 

2792
02:15:45,211 --> 02:15:50,211
thoughts together.
And I wrote a whole lot of research 

2793
02:15:50,211 --> 02:15:50,400
proposals which later became funded,
you know,

2794
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:52,800
and I got probably of the proposals I 
really worked on.

2795
02:15:52,801 --> 02:15:55,410
It probably got over a million dollars 
of funding during that time.

2796
02:15:55,410 --> 02:16:00,410
I really intensely worked on,
on various proposals because I just 

2797
02:16:00,410 --> 02:16:01,110
transitioned into like a tenure track 
position.

2798
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:06,380
So it allowed me to work on manuscripts 
and proposals and just put thoughts 

2799
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:09,801
together that maybe I otherwise either 
wouldn't have the time to or the mental 

2800
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:14,960
kind of resources to get into that 
counter intuitive that you have more 

2801
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:17,160
resources with less calories.
It does.

2802
02:16:17,161 --> 02:16:18,060
I mean,
you know,

2803
02:16:18,061 --> 02:16:21,690
I was burning my body fat for fuel 
primarily.

2804
02:16:21,691 --> 02:16:24,240
Probably lost a little bit of muscle,
but that fuel,

2805
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:27,660
that fat was becoming ketones and that 
my brain had switched over.

2806
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:31,390
I was doing low carB but not really full
full quito at the time.

2807
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:35,440
But it really,
it's like quieted my brain in a way that

2808
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:40,441
I was able to really.
Maybe I have like mild adhd because I 

2809
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:44,740
like to do so many different things.
But it quieted my mind and I was able to

2810
02:16:44,741 --> 02:16:47,950
wake up like every morning I was waking 
up a lot earlier than normal,

2811
02:16:47,951 --> 02:16:50,620
like 4:35
and I typically sleep till like seven.

2812
02:16:50,890 --> 02:16:55,890
But I was able to like wake up and just 
focus and get a ton of work done the 

2813
02:16:55,890 --> 02:17:00,361
first three or four hours.
and then then I would go into work 

2814
02:17:00,361 --> 02:17:00,361
actually.
And just,

2815
02:17:00,361 --> 02:17:04,261
you know,
meet with my students or teach or do 

2816
02:17:04,261 --> 02:17:06,001
whatever I had to do,
but I just remember getting a ton of 

2817
02:17:06,001 --> 02:17:06,001
work done during that period.
I've never reproduced it.

2818
02:17:06,001 --> 02:17:09,280
I never went back and,
but I did a whole bunch of blood work on

2819
02:17:09,281 --> 02:17:11,280
me to give,
you know,

2820
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:14,410
a little bit of insight as to what's 
going on during,

2821
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:19,440
uh,
during the fasting stage and everything 

2822
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:19,440
was really positive.
You know,

2823
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:20,020
there was a big,
uh,

2824
02:17:20,021 --> 02:17:23,890
my insulin was really low at the time.
My glucose was really low.

2825
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:27,400
I got down to like 25 at one point 
because I,

2826
02:17:27,401 --> 02:17:32,401
I've experimented with a couple of 
different things and my ketones were 

2827
02:17:32,401 --> 02:17:32,401
really high.

2828
02:17:32,401 --> 02:17:35,940
My ketones were like double what my 
glucose was at a couple time points 

2829
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,550
during that.
So it's an edge.

2830
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:38,050
I would,
I would encourage people,

2831
02:17:38,051 --> 02:17:43,051
especially maybe people that are prone 
to cancer or people who have had cancer 

2832
02:17:43,051 --> 02:17:45,820
in the past and maybe had treated and 
are kind of in a state of remission.

2833
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,650
Uh,
if you go,

2834
02:17:47,651 --> 02:17:51,340
if you get your body into that,
what we call the metabolic zone,

2835
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:54,250
where the level of ketones are higher 
than the level of glucose,

2836
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:59,280
that puts tremendous metabolic stress on
cancer cells or precancerous cells that 

2837
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:03,160
have a huge appetite for glucose,
so,

2838
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:06,880
and that contribute can,
can initiate autophagy.

2839
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:11,940
So even people who do not have cancer,
but perhaps you want to just make sure 

2840
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:13,900
they're holding off of it as a 
preventative maintenance.

2841
02:18:13,930 --> 02:18:18,930
Yup.
And I think it can stimulate almost 

2842
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:21,961
purge your body of cancer cells that are
weakened by in this fasted state and 

2843
02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:26,470
also precancerous cells that may be in 
the transition of trends,

2844
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,570
you know,
d differentiating into this.

2845
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:32,020
No cancer like cells.
These cells are very energy demanding,

2846
02:18:32,021 --> 02:18:36,400
especially if they're replicating.
And if you deprive them of energy,

2847
02:18:36,401 --> 02:18:41,010
the quote unquote energy crisis signal 
that these cells receive can,

2848
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:46,040
can initiate a program,
cell death we call apoptosis and 

2849
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:48,760
autophagy.
And that's the benefit of this.

2850
02:18:48,761 --> 02:18:50,950
It's almost like housekeeping.
So think about it,

2851
02:18:50,951 --> 02:18:55,951
you know,
you accumulate a lot of dead cells that 

2852
02:18:55,951 --> 02:18:55,990
are kind of sluggish or mitochondria 
kind of sluggish.

2853
02:18:55,991 --> 02:18:58,330
And then you fast for a week and it's 
like reboot.

2854
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:00,700
It's like a setting.
It's like a reset button.

2855
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,850
So did you,
um,

2856
02:19:03,851 --> 02:19:04,440
I,
I had,

2857
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:07,390
I did a podcast with robb wolf or he was
talking about this morning,

2858
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:11,140
god who went for a whole year without 
eating.

2859
02:19:11,270 --> 02:19:12,790
Did you,
if you pay attention to that?

2860
02:19:12,950 --> 02:19:14,830
Not,
not only did I pay attention to it,

2861
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:18,610
I've presented that at a number of 
different meetings and people,

2862
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:19,660
people say bullshit.

2863
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:23,380
But this is actually a,
it's in a.

2864
02:19:23,410 --> 02:19:24,350
oh man.
I think I,

2865
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:27,740
I may have had it.
I was going to actually show it at this,

2866
02:19:27,741 --> 02:19:29,720
uh,
at this meeting.

2867
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:32,420
But I think I took the slide out.
I had it in his back.

2868
02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:37,421
people with this guy did 382 days.
Not only did he lose a tremendous amount

2869
02:19:38,301 --> 02:19:43,301
of weight,
he went from being morbidly obese to 

2870
02:19:43,301 --> 02:19:43,940
being like a normal sized person.
But here's the big one.

2871
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:46,510
The skin shrink.
Yeah.

2872
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:48,750
That's normally one of the most part.
Yeah,

2873
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:51,230
for the most part.
I mean significantly.

2874
02:19:51,231 --> 02:19:52,880
We're,
most people have to.

2875
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:56,150
When you're that big and you shrink down
to a normal sized person,

2876
02:19:56,151 --> 02:20:01,151
they have to cut your skin or you just 
walk around like a flying squirrel and 

2877
02:20:01,151 --> 02:20:02,630
when you have like this crazy extra 
skin,

2878
02:20:02,631 --> 02:20:03,210
right?
Yeah.

2879
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:06,890
Well this guy,
somehow or another through this 380 plus

2880
02:20:06,891 --> 02:20:11,120
days of fasting,
his body shrank accordingly.

2881
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:11,990
Yeah.
Yeah,

2882
02:20:11,991 --> 02:20:14,660
that's right.
So he was about 500 pounds,

2883
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:18,290
actually,
travis christofferson and I wrote a blog

2884
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:21,140
article and it was part one,
two and three,

2885
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:23,570
the history of the key to genic diet,
part one,

2886
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:25,910
two and three.
And it's on rob wolf website.

2887
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:31,180
So if you just googled the history of 
the ketogenic diet and land on rob's 

2888
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:31,220
website,
you'll have,

2889
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,380
I think we talk about the story in 
there.

2890
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:35,270
Uh,
it's a remarkable story.

2891
02:20:35,271 --> 02:20:40,271
Yeah.
The guy was like 500 pounds and he 

2892
02:20:40,271 --> 02:20:42,491
fasted for like 381 days or 82 days and 
he went down to 190 pounds.

2893
02:20:44,421 --> 02:20:48,380
And the remarkable thing is that he 
sustained that over.

2894
02:20:48,381 --> 02:20:49,880
I mean,
he maybe went back,

2895
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:54,020
went back up like five or six pounds,
but largely sustain that weight loss,

2896
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:57,350
that's the quarter time.
So he was running completely all fat,

2897
02:20:57,380 --> 02:21:02,380
the fat that he had stored up and uh,
and he was studied pretty intensely and 

2898
02:21:02,691 --> 02:21:05,870
the thing that came out of the data was 
a,

2899
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,940
it was a pretty significant drop in 
magnesium.

2900
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:09,620
So that actually convinced me.
Yeah,

2901
02:21:09,621 --> 02:21:14,621
I definitely should probably maybe 
supplement magnesium was fasting 

2902
02:21:14,621 --> 02:21:18,790
anything,
any vitamins or they did give him an 

2903
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:20,090
electrolyte.
So it's in the medical records and I dug

2904
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,490
into this as much as we could.
Uh,

2905
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:27,520
his glucose levels got down to like 20 
or 25 a couple times and maintained it 

2906
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:34,080
was given potassium tablets to keep his 
heart healthy and multivitamins every 

2907
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:34,080
day.
Yep.

2908
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,830
I'm just rough.
You have done is it robs?

2909
02:21:38,390 --> 02:21:38,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

2910
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,280
I think I've seen this,
but yeah,

2911
02:21:40,281 --> 02:21:41,960
fast at 300,
82 days.

2912
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:46,990
A incredible last 275 point five pounds 
now.

2913
02:21:47,031 --> 02:21:49,430
Who was calling bullshit on this?
Well,

2914
02:21:49,431 --> 02:21:52,910
I did present it to a,
like a mainstream,

2915
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:54,980
you know,
clinicians even just coughing.

2916
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:57,440
Well,
it's actually really fun,

2917
02:21:57,460 --> 02:22:02,460
like the first it might've been the 
american epilepsy society where they 

2918
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:04,580
kind of marginalized the ketogenic diet 
or it may have been another,

2919
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:08,840
it might've been neurology and epilepsy 
society at the time.

2920
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:11,030
They're warming up to it just because 
the data,

2921
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:16,031
they can't,
they can't turn their back on the data 

2922
02:22:16,031 --> 02:22:18,131
because data is data.
So there's a massive amount of data 

2923
02:22:18,131 --> 02:22:18,131
emerging that this should,
uh,

2924
02:22:18,131 --> 02:22:22,040
this is grossly underutilized and should
be really the standard of care.

2925
02:22:22,041 --> 02:22:25,010
Even the frontline therapy,
like we all kind of realized,

2926
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:30,350
but neurologists would have to have a 
sidekick registered dietician or 

2927
02:22:30,350 --> 02:22:30,400
whatever.
But,

2928
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:35,460
but so during the time one of my first 
presentations was to a medical doctors,

2929
02:22:35,490 --> 02:22:40,490
you know,
that we're in it for cme credits and 

2930
02:22:40,490 --> 02:22:40,490
things like that.
Like just standard conventional.

2931
02:22:40,490 --> 02:22:41,490
And I talked about,
you know,

2932
02:22:41,491 --> 02:22:42,480
towards the end I was like,
well,

2933
02:22:42,481 --> 02:22:45,210
I followed the ketogenic diet myself and
they're like,

2934
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:46,560
they're like gas or like,
oh,

2935
02:22:46,561 --> 02:22:51,561
what's wrong with you?
It's like when I explained to them that 

2936
02:22:51,561 --> 02:22:51,680
I was normal in the question answering 
after were like,

2937
02:22:51,690 --> 02:22:52,830
well why do you do it?

2938
02:22:53,170 --> 02:22:54,510
And was like,
are you okay?

2939
02:22:55,170 --> 02:23:00,170
This is going back like 2009 or 10 years
ago.

2940
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:06,200
It was really bizarre to them that 
someone would actually fall the 

2941
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:07,020
ketogenic diet.
And I was doing like the classical,

2942
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:08,310
I was trying to do like the,
you know,

2943
02:23:08,490 --> 02:23:09,260
the,
the,

2944
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:12,090
the hopkins protocol or was using eric 
kossoff spoke on the,

2945
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:14,620
on the op 98 and two.
Uh,

2946
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:16,340
I was,
I was about 80,

2947
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:22,140
I was a three to one,
so it was like 85 to 88 percent fat and 

2948
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:23,550
I was sticking to it.
And uh,

2949
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:29,060
yeah,
so people really just think it's a 

2950
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:31,701
really bizarre,
if you don't have a severe neurological 

2951
02:23:31,701 --> 02:23:35,151
problem to be at the time and now that's
just evidence of how mainstream because 

2952
02:23:35,371 --> 02:23:35,790
you,
you know,

2953
02:23:35,791 --> 02:23:38,190
you see it in mass media,
you know,

2954
02:23:38,191 --> 02:23:40,530
athletes going on quote unquote the 
ketogenic diet.

2955
02:23:40,531 --> 02:23:42,260
I'd question whether they're actually 
ketogenic.

2956
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:47,460
Uh,
they need another measure of their 

2957
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:47,460
ketones to really.
So the ketogenic diet,

2958
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:51,680
you're in ketosis by virtue,
by the definition that your blood 

2959
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,580
ketones are elevated above zero point 
five millimolar.

2960
02:23:53,581 --> 02:23:56,130
And typically most people,
that's pretty hard to achieve.

2961
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,790
If you're up to one millimolar,
which is mild ketosis,

2962
02:24:00,570 --> 02:24:02,370
you take a hundred people out of the 
population,

2963
02:24:02,371 --> 02:24:04,800
they eat the standard american diet,
maybe one,

2964
02:24:04,801 --> 02:24:09,801
maybe two people will achieve that if 
they like go all day without eating or 

2965
02:24:09,801 --> 02:24:10,770
something like it really takes a while 
to achieve.

2966
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:15,840
So you have to be doing something pretty
radical to achieve that blood 

2967
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,590
measurement of a state of ketosis and 
not seeing that in pro athletes.

2968
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:23,130
So I know there's a few fighters we 
should take before she retired.

2969
02:24:23,131 --> 02:24:24,550
She went ketogenic,
uh,

2970
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:26,190
her boyfriend,
brian caraway.

2971
02:24:26,191 --> 02:24:30,090
I know he was key to genic for awhile.
That's just my experience with athletes,

2972
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:32,910
but I know that there was a lot of 
people that are looking at it.

2973
02:24:33,090 --> 02:24:33,840
Yeah,
I would,

2974
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:38,900
you know,
kind of questioned whether they were 

2975
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:38,900
like kidogenic.
I'm sure they did low carb,

2976
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:41,430
but if you eat too much protein that 
converts to glucose,

2977
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:42,610
it can kick you out.
But,

2978
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,820
but then again,
I mean I,

2979
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:45,840
some,
some athletes that contact me,

2980
02:24:45,841 --> 02:24:50,841
their output is really high so they're 
actually giving like five or six hours 

2981
02:24:50,841 --> 02:24:54,711
of output a day and they're eating like 
two or three chocolate bars and they're 

2982
02:24:54,711 --> 02:24:56,790
getting like 250 grams of carbs a day,
some of them.

2983
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:59,880
And there's maintaining a mild state of 
ketosis,

2984
02:24:59,910 --> 02:25:04,910
especially post exercise ketosis.
Even with drinking suddenly something 

2985
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:07,080
like that,
you can start like a slow burning like a

2986
02:25:07,081 --> 02:25:08,310
soup,
like a slow carb,

2987
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:10,970
like a tim ferris advocates,
uh,

2988
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:13,860
and they stay in ketosis and if they 
back off more,

2989
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:17,130
if they back their carbohydrates down to
like 50 grams a day,

2990
02:25:17,131 --> 02:25:19,440
they start to lose performance on that.

2991
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,720
I mean these are people with very high 
output though.

2992
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,050
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

2993
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:26,270
We talked about five hours of exercise a
day plus,

2994
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:31,290
and they went from a thousand grams of 
carbs a day to 250 and better.

2995
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:35,500
Fifty grams of carbs for the standard 
average person.

2996
02:25:35,501 --> 02:25:38,470
This is not applicable for an mma 
fighter is two and three days.

2997
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:39,900
Uh,
I think,

2998
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:45,020
I think you could,
especially the older guys like older 

2999
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:45,550
guys,
I think you could readily adapt them.

3000
02:25:45,580 --> 02:25:50,580
Like I said though,
I think that adaptation should probably 

3001
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:53,251
occur during training in the off season 
and give themselves a buffer zone of 

3002
02:25:53,251 --> 02:25:56,890
three months and actually work with a 
coach or work with an app,

3003
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:00,310
uh,
like avatar nutrition or something where

3004
02:26:00,311 --> 02:26:05,311
they calculate the macros and they 
actually know they're hitting the 

3005
02:26:05,311 --> 02:26:05,311
macros.
And the body is amazing.

3006
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:08,260
If you actually hit the macros that are 
calculated,

3007
02:26:08,410 --> 02:26:10,000
your body will go into ketosis.

3008
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:15,000
I've never seen.
There's very few people that you can't 

3009
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,971
get into quito,
especially if you use things like mct 

3010
02:26:17,971 --> 02:26:20,890
and really adjust the macros.
And you could also do key to key to 

3011
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:23,200
genic intermittent fasting where you 
kind of don't eat throughout the day but

3012
02:26:23,201 --> 02:26:27,580
then eat through a window or time 
restricted eating as a rhonda.

3013
02:26:27,581 --> 02:26:30,790
patrick calls it where you basically 
just eat within,

3014
02:26:31,150 --> 02:26:32,040
you know,
a,

3015
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,940
a six hour window.
And I like to do that.

3016
02:26:33,941 --> 02:26:37,240
I'll eat from 5:00
PM to 11:00

3017
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:42,240
PM and just kind of eat a big meal and 
just kind of graze a little bit 

3018
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:42,240
throughout and then I get,
you know,

3019
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:47,220
a pretty good chunk of the time fasting.
And then after I'm done with work,

3020
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:52,620
you know,
I'm not frantically running around 

3021
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:54,331
trying to get stuff done so I can relax 
with my wife and just kind of kicked 

3022
02:26:54,331 --> 02:26:54,520
back and eat and just,
you know.

3023
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:56,560
And that's kinda what I wanna eat 
anyway.

3024
02:26:56,890 --> 02:27:01,890
So you feel like there's more of a I'm 
doing a 14 hour thing you think is even 

3025
02:27:01,890 --> 02:27:03,280
more benefit doing an 18?
I do.

3026
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:04,180
I think,
you know,

3027
02:27:04,181 --> 02:27:05,890
I don't,
uh,

3028
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:08,170
I do uh,
for,

3029
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:13,210
for me I definitely think I do a because
there's something about like a couple 

3030
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:19,740
hours extra where like if I fast for 14 
hours but then go like my ketones really

3031
02:27:21,911 --> 02:27:25,150
start to go up from 14 to 18 hours and 
then.

3032
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:30,270
And then I could actually stay in 
ketosis if I eat key to genic during 

3033
02:27:30,270 --> 02:27:32,950
that six hours of eating.
If I kind of pay attention to,

3034
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:38,250
you know,
eating really low carb like I can eat 

3035
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:38,250
and before I go to bed I test my ketones
and bam,

3036
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:39,760
I'm hitting like two point two or 
something,

3037
02:27:39,761 --> 02:27:43,480
so I continued to get the benefits of 
having ketones,

3038
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:48,070
but when it comes to like things like 
rhonda talks about like autology,

3039
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:52,030
I think you can even get more benefits 
with an 18 hour fast and you do that and

3040
02:27:52,031 --> 02:27:53,020
you'll have to do it every day.

3041
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:56,260
I think you could just do it.
Like you could actually do it just once,

3042
02:27:56,261 --> 02:27:58,480
maybe twice a week and get a lot of 
benefits from that.

3043
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:02,020
Like if you do that over the course of a
year and that's not hard to do,

3044
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:04,210
right?
If you could just convince people,

3045
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:09,360
hey,
take the breads and pastas out and just 

3046
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:09,640
put in more vegetables and just do 
intermittent fasting.

3047
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:11,140
You know,
every,

3048
02:28:11,141 --> 02:28:16,141
every tuesday and thursday.
And if they do blood work after like 

3049
02:28:16,141 --> 02:28:17,710
three months,
they're going to see a profound effect.

3050
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:19,810
Probably not even changing the diet.
They're going to see.

3051
02:28:19,811 --> 02:28:24,811
A profound effect now is someone told me
that there is an effective way to 

3052
02:28:24,811 --> 02:28:28,100
measure ketones through breathing.
There's some sort of a breath monitor.

3053
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,450
Is that,
is that real or?

3054
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:30,990
Yeah,
there's a couple of,

3055
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:33,680
uh,
some of them were being showcased at the

3056
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:35,990
conference.
I was at the low carb usa.

3057
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:41,200
I'm the one that I have the most 
experience with is a product called 

3058
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:44,780
ketone x and uh,
and now they have a bluetooth device out

3059
02:28:44,781 --> 02:28:48,030
where you can blow into it and it 
reports to your phone and it shows you,

3060
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:53,110
shows you the parts per million of 
acetone in there and acetone.

3061
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:58,400
So you make beta hydroxybutyrate nsc to 
acetate as the two primary ketone bodies

3062
02:28:58,401 --> 02:29:03,401
that are used for fuel.
And also they have signaling properties 

3063
02:29:03,401 --> 02:29:06,430
and acetoacetate can break down a 
spontaneously decarboxylates to 

3064
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:08,720
something called acetone,
which you knows,

3065
02:29:08,721 --> 02:29:09,950
nail polish remover.
Right?

3066
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:15,220
So a acetone actually has some really 
interesting a brain effects that calms 

3067
02:29:16,671 --> 02:29:19,490
the brain down a sub narcotic levels of 
acetone,

3068
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:24,820
a open potassium channels that when 
potassium channels are opened that 

3069
02:29:24,951 --> 02:29:29,951
hyperpolarizes the membrane potential 
for neurons and makes them kind of more 

3070
02:29:29,951 --> 02:29:32,130
like charged batteries and it also kinda
calms your,

3071
02:29:32,430 --> 02:29:33,410
your brain down.

3072
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:36,560
So iT's not firing action potentials as 
much and that's a good thing.

3073
02:29:36,770 --> 02:29:40,340
So instead of all this kind of 
fluttering of activity,

3074
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:44,690
it helps to kind of synchronize your 
brain in a way by elevating.

3075
02:29:44,691 --> 02:29:46,850
And this goes back to homeostasis,
right?

3076
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:51,800
So that acetone has,
can correlate with seizure control.

3077
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:56,410
So parents who have kids who do not like
to get their fingers pricked,

3078
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:58,370
have used the breath.
Acetone,

3079
02:29:58,380 --> 02:30:00,320
you blow into it,
you get a pretty color,

3080
02:30:00,380 --> 02:30:01,820
you know the kids like it and 
everything.

3081
02:30:02,350 --> 02:30:05,300
It is kinD of hard to like set it up,
you've got to calibrate it.

3082
02:30:05,301 --> 02:30:10,301
And so it's a little bit clunky to work 
with but it does pretty good indicator 

3083
02:30:10,301 --> 02:30:13,700
if you're registering like orange or red
on that,

3084
02:30:13,790 --> 02:30:15,500
you are definitely in a state of 
ketosis.

3085
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:18,770
So.
But I call it only semi quantitative,

3086
02:30:18,830 --> 02:30:23,830
so they need to work out some of the 
bugs and if you just look up breath 

3087
02:30:23,830 --> 02:30:27,761
acetone meters,
there's probably about five on the 

3088
02:30:27,761 --> 02:30:27,761
market now.

3089
02:30:27,761 --> 02:30:30,740
And the one that I have experienced with
is called a key tonics.

3090
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:34,280
And if you're acetone is high and you're
not taking ketone supplements,

3091
02:30:34,310 --> 02:30:36,920
you are burnt.
You are cranking your fat metabolism,

3092
02:30:37,230 --> 02:30:38,490
you are really,
you know,

3093
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:40,880
mobilizing fat and burning fat for 
energy.

3094
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:44,390
So it's a pretty valid indicator for 
burning fat for energy.

3095
02:30:44,391 --> 02:30:49,391
Blood is the best.
Bloods of gold standard probably will 

3096
02:30:49,391 --> 02:30:51,080
always be.
there's technologies emerging out now at

3097
02:30:51,081 --> 02:30:56,081
least you know,
small companies that are a essentially 

3098
02:30:56,081 --> 02:30:59,590
a,
you put a like a bandaid like thing on 

3099
02:30:59,590 --> 02:31:00,440
your skin and it's measuring glucose.
It's measuring a,

3100
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:06,220
you know,
potentially beta hydroxybutyrate 

3101
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:07,160
acetoacetate and things like lactate.
And then it'll go to your smartphone.

3102
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:10,010
So you can look at your smartphone and 
see your glucose levels,

3103
02:31:10,011 --> 02:31:11,510
your,
your ketones,

3104
02:31:11,511 --> 02:31:16,511
your lactate,
and maybe some potentially other things 

3105
02:31:16,511 --> 02:31:19,040
you could adjust your diet or drink a 
supplement to optimize you into a,

3106
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,720
you know,
maximizes your strength,

3107
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:26,780
maximize your performance,
or maximizes your brain protection in 

3108
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:31,800
extreme environment like high pressure 
oxygen or a navy seal or something like 

3109
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:35,241
that.
That technology is in development now 

3110
02:31:35,241 --> 02:31:37,260
and will probably surface sometime in 
the next year or two.

3111
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:40,080
And I think it will be pretty cool.
So think of a dexcon,

3112
02:31:40,110 --> 02:31:45,110
but instead of just glucose,
it'll give you like a metabolomic 

3113
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:46,980
profile of your blood.
And then there'll be,

3114
02:31:47,130 --> 02:31:52,130
you know,
you can augment it in with your diet or 

3115
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:52,130
with various supplements.

3116
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:54,580
Now I've got two other important 
questions.

3117
02:31:54,581 --> 02:31:57,640
One physical performance.
Um,

3118
02:31:57,670 --> 02:32:02,670
have there been studies on reaction time
on all sorts of different variables that

3119
02:32:03,521 --> 02:32:05,140
I think,
I mean if you're looking at all of this,

3120
02:32:05,141 --> 02:32:08,170
increase in blood flow,
decrease in inflammation,

3121
02:32:08,590 --> 02:32:13,590
all those things are what you would want
out of a body that you want to perform 

3122
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:17,611
better.
It seems like things would fire better 

3123
02:32:17,611 --> 02:32:17,611
as it will,
for lack of a better word,

3124
02:32:17,611 --> 02:32:21,690
what have there been studies on putting 
athletes through variety,

3125
02:32:21,710 --> 02:32:23,830
stress tests,
reaction times,

3126
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:25,320
things along those lines,
those

3127
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:28,530
studies need to be done.
And I think at some of the marketers out

3128
02:32:28,531 --> 02:32:33,531
there that are promoting ketone 
supplements are based on some animal 

3129
02:32:33,531 --> 02:32:36,990
data and I think they're extrapolating 
some of the effects.

3130
02:32:36,991 --> 02:32:39,270
Will ketones offer a metabolic 
advantage?

3131
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:40,170
You know,
they can,

3132
02:32:40,171 --> 02:32:42,840
you can generate more atp.
You can,

3133
02:32:42,841 --> 02:32:46,290
it gives your brain resilience under 
inflammation or hyperglycemia.

3134
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:48,380
uh,
but the,

3135
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:53,680
the bottom line is that these studies 
need to be done and they need to be 

3136
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:57,471
funded.
Some of them are going on right now and 

3137
02:32:57,471 --> 02:32:57,471
some of them are.
I'm kind of involved in a.

3138
02:32:57,471 --> 02:33:00,720
And probably most important is,
you know,

3139
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,980
what are they actually studying?
Like what,

3140
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,490
what key to genic diet are they actually
studying?

3141
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:09,480
Like what are the macronutrient ratios,
not only the ratios,

3142
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:12,090
but what types of fats are they using,
you know,

3143
02:33:12,091 --> 02:33:13,590
what type,
what's their protein source,

3144
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:14,150
you know?

3145
02:33:14,230 --> 02:33:15,330
Uh,
and that's really important.

3146
02:33:15,331 --> 02:33:20,331
And when it comes to ketone supplements,
like that's a whole nother box of worms 

3147
02:33:20,331 --> 02:33:20,331
are,
I mean,

3148
02:33:20,331 --> 02:33:21,130
are they using,
you know,

3149
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:23,190
just pure sodium,
beta hydroxy butyrate,

3150
02:33:23,191 --> 02:33:28,191
are they using like sodium potassium,
magnesium combination which would offer 

3151
02:33:28,191 --> 02:33:29,610
more benefits?
Uh,

3152
02:33:29,611 --> 02:33:34,611
are they really using [inaudible] for if
the dna or are they using a ketone 

3153
02:33:34,611 --> 02:33:35,850
ester?
So there's like lots of these,

3154
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:37,530
uh,
considerations.

3155
02:33:37,531 --> 02:33:39,330
There's lots of nuances,
you know,

3156
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:44,331
in the way these things are formulated 
in the way they're dosed and in what 

3157
02:33:44,331 --> 02:33:47,820
type of application,
whether it's a pure strength application

3158
02:33:47,850 --> 02:33:52,850
or what I call strength performance,
like pushups and chin ups and things 

3159
02:33:52,850 --> 02:33:57,051
like that,
like a or endurance or ultra endurance 

3160
02:33:57,051 --> 02:34:01,761
or things like that.
So do a lot of research needs to be 

3161
02:34:01,761 --> 02:34:01,800
done.
So I didn't really give you an answer,

3162
02:34:01,801 --> 02:34:05,280
but I think the guy who's done the most 
research on this clearly,

3163
02:34:05,281 --> 02:34:10,281
at least with the ketogenic diet,
is Jeff Bullock from Ohio state 

3164
02:34:10,281 --> 02:34:10,281
university.

3165
02:34:10,281 --> 02:34:14,240
His faster study clearly showed that 
athletes in a state of nutritional 

3166
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:14,850
ketosis burn like,
you know,

3167
02:34:14,851 --> 02:34:17,140
almost twice the amount of fat,
you know,

3168
02:34:17,141 --> 02:34:19,150
and they maintain that,
which is remarkable.

3169
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:24,180
I mean,
does some elegant studies to show fat 

3170
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:26,611
oxford vaccination rates are like double
of what we even thought were achievable 

3171
02:34:26,611 --> 02:34:31,590
when guys follow a well formulated 
ketogenic diet and he recently did a 

3172
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:36,031
study,
a using a ketone salt product showing 

3173
02:34:36,031 --> 02:34:39,760
that there was an enhancement of eight 
percent performance in workout.

3174
02:34:39,770 --> 02:34:44,170
Put a with a cyclist.
So big number.

3175
02:34:44,310 --> 02:34:48,050
April is pretty big for cyclists.
Yeah,

3176
02:34:48,450 --> 02:34:51,340
it might've been time to exhaustion.
He just presented it here.

3177
02:34:51,350 --> 02:34:52,960
I didn't even know he had the data 
actually,

3178
02:34:52,961 --> 02:34:57,961
but I mean jeff volek is the leading 
researcher on and he wrote the book the 

3179
02:34:57,961 --> 02:34:59,620
art and science of low carbohydrate 
performance,

3180
02:34:59,621 --> 02:35:03,220
which a lot of mma guys have benefited 
from because they emailed me.

3181
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:04,780
Uh,
but these,

3182
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:06,700
these are studies that I'm really 
interested.

3183
02:35:06,701 --> 02:35:11,701
I mean we've done a lot of work in 
animal models and now we're 

3184
02:35:11,701 --> 02:35:14,821
transitioning to a human studies.
We have a study at duke university,

3185
02:35:15,490 --> 02:35:18,580
so I mentioned a oxygen toxicity to 
study this,

3186
02:35:18,730 --> 02:35:23,730
you know,
in humans in these big environmental 

3187
02:35:23,730 --> 02:35:26,371
chambers at duke.
And then we do some stuff with nasa and 

3188
02:35:26,371 --> 02:35:27,820
the nasa neemo mission.
I was on a,

3189
02:35:27,821 --> 02:35:32,470
but we're really interested in moving a 
lot of these animal studies,

3190
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:34,930
which we've done.
Now we're ready to move into humans,

3191
02:35:35,050 --> 02:35:40,050
but we still don't know what the optimal
supplement is and that's why a ketone 

3192
02:35:40,050 --> 02:35:45,050
technologies,
a company we developed this really 

3193
02:35:45,050 --> 02:35:46,801
focused on identifying not the 
supplement that gives us the best 

3194
02:35:46,801 --> 02:35:50,851
margins for sales,
but the supplement that's super 

3195
02:35:50,851 --> 02:35:53,881
optimized for particular applications.
Now another question I wanted to ask you

3196
02:35:53,950 --> 02:35:55,690
was about migraines.

3197
02:35:55,990 --> 02:35:58,150
Now I would assume that people with 
headaches,

3198
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:03,360
headaches,
you take nonsteroidal anti 

3199
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:03,440
inflammatories.
Someone with migraines mean it would,

3200
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:08,580
it would seem to me that that would be 
something that might be able to help 

3201
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:08,580
mitigate.
Yeah.

3202
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:08,780
Yeah.
Um,

3203
02:36:08,860 --> 02:36:11,200
there's a student,
I'm on her dissertation committee,

3204
02:36:11,201 --> 02:36:13,720
uh,
elena gross and she was a student,

3205
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:18,750
uh,
graduated from oxford university and is 

3206
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:21,091
now doing a clinical trial on a ketone 
salts for migraine.

3207
02:36:21,881 --> 02:36:26,881
So what motivated her to even pursue 
this as a phd project is that she had 

3208
02:36:26,881 --> 02:36:31,450
crippling cluster migraine headaches and
she reached out to me and,

3209
02:36:31,930 --> 02:36:36,930
uh,
she actually presented at our metabolic 

3210
02:36:36,930 --> 02:36:37,750
therapeutics conference and that's her 
area of expertise.

3211
02:36:37,751 --> 02:36:39,850
Like when it's happening to you 
personally,

3212
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:44,380
it motivates you in a way that you just 
immerse yourself in the research and you

3213
02:36:44,381 --> 02:36:47,260
become like a leading expert and I think
at the,

3214
02:36:47,261 --> 02:36:52,261
at the very young age that elena is,
and she's got a great background of 

3215
02:36:52,261 --> 02:36:53,050
education behind her.

3216
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:57,520
She's kind of the leading authority on 
nutritional ketosis for,

3217
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:02,790
for migraines,
which is a growing field because a lot 

3218
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:05,911
of people who had migraines that have 
contacted me and tried either of the 

3219
02:37:05,911 --> 02:37:09,220
ketogenic diet or ketone supplementation
have benefited from it when nothing else

3220
02:37:09,221 --> 02:37:11,590
worked for them.
It doesn't work for everybody,

3221
02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:14,560
but in some people that have these 
crippling headaches,

3222
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:18,110
it better than anything that they've 
tried so far.

3223
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:20,210
Um,
and migraines,

3224
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:22,280
uh,
some of the data coming out,

3225
02:37:22,830 --> 02:37:27,830
there's two sets of data that I've seen 
showing that migraines are linked to 

3226
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:29,780
neuroinflammation.
Uh,

3227
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:32,840
for example,
if it's caused by a viral etiology,

3228
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:38,110
there's kind of swelling of the brain 
that leads to this kind of low systemic 

3229
02:37:39,470 --> 02:37:44,470
neuroinflammation.
and maybe the ketones are working 

3230
02:37:44,470 --> 02:37:45,350
through an anti a and anti inflammatory 
effects.

3231
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:47,090
Uh,
sometimes like I said before,

3232
02:37:47,091 --> 02:37:52,091
people get shingles or like a cold list 
or they'll get like a headache 

3233
02:37:52,091 --> 02:37:54,791
throughout the day and that's probably 
neuroinflammation and then there's other

3234
02:37:54,831 --> 02:37:58,760
data to show that these migraines 
actually may be like a mini seizure,

3235
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:04,090
like your brain is actually having a 
mini seizure that's not manifesting as a

3236
02:38:04,791 --> 02:38:07,670
grand mal or tonic clonic seizure or 
even an absence seizure,

3237
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:12,880
but it's,
but it's presenting as a migraine and 

3238
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:12,880
it's seizure.

3239
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:17,620
Like I would say some of the data is 
indicating that and ketones seem to be a

3240
02:38:17,661 --> 02:38:20,240
viable strategy for,
uh,

3241
02:38:21,010 --> 02:38:22,940
you know,
for migraines from what I've seen.

3242
02:38:22,941 --> 02:38:24,380
and that's why it's being studied right 
now.

3243
02:38:25,010 --> 02:38:30,010
The other question is,
what about someone who's on a vegan 

3244
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:30,010
diet?
Yeah,

3245
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:31,310
I get to a lot.
I have a really close friend.

3246
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,340
Uh,
she's vegetarian.

3247
02:38:33,650 --> 02:38:38,650
I'm dr don carnegie as a ihmc.
We've talked about this a lot for a 

3248
02:38:39,261 --> 02:38:40,970
vegetarian,
it's relatively easy,

3249
02:38:40,971 --> 02:38:45,971
right?
Because you had a dairy and you have 

3250
02:38:45,971 --> 02:38:45,971
eggs and eggs are a huge staple.
I buy the happy eggs,

3251
02:38:45,971 --> 02:38:49,330
which actually tastes a lot better.
They're like the free range egg a,

3252
02:38:49,370 --> 02:38:51,380
but a vegan diet is a little more 
challenging.

3253
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:55,060
The charlie foundations,
a dietitian beth zoo pack,

3254
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:56,810
Kenya is her name.
Uh,

3255
02:38:56,811 --> 02:38:58,580
if you go to the charlie foundation 
website,

3256
02:38:58,581 --> 02:39:02,720
I think you may be able to find some 
information or a pamphlet that describes

3257
02:39:02,721 --> 02:39:07,721
how to put together a vegan,
a kidogenic diet.

3258
02:39:08,210 --> 02:39:12,710
So there's no way that you can hit the 
macronutrient ratios,

3259
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:17,810
have a key to genic diet that's vegan 
unless it's in a shake form.

3260
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:20,000
So in this case,
you know,

3261
02:39:20,001 --> 02:39:25,001
formulating a product that's more of an 
illiquid form that you can drink is 

3262
02:39:25,611 --> 02:39:30,590
probably the way to go.
If you do do a vegan ketogenic diet,

3263
02:39:30,591 --> 02:39:35,591
whole food,
the best that you could do Is really 

3264
02:39:35,591 --> 02:39:37,250
about maybe 60 percent fat,
maybe 70 percent fat,

3265
02:39:37,550 --> 02:39:40,460
and if you formulate the diet with 
coconut oil and mct,

3266
02:39:40,461 --> 02:39:43,640
that'll get your ketones up.
And then if you consume,

3267
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:45,130
you know,
one of these,

3268
02:39:45,131 --> 02:39:50,131
uh,
various products on the market that are 

3269
02:39:50,131 --> 02:39:50,131
essentially medical foods or drinks that
you can drink,

3270
02:39:50,131 --> 02:39:51,680
you know,
you can stay in nutritional ketosis.

3271
02:39:52,370 --> 02:39:53,510
So it's a,
it's a struggle.

3272
02:39:53,511 --> 02:39:54,470
It's,
it's possible,

3273
02:39:54,471 --> 02:39:56,510
but it's way much,
much harder.

3274
02:39:56,870 --> 02:40:01,870
People do do it though,
then they follow a vegan for ethical 

3275
02:40:01,870 --> 02:40:03,260
reasons or for a cultural reasons and 
they've been able to do it.

3276
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:08,330
But vegetarian is doable of vegetarian 
is very doable with eggs.

3277
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:13,600
If you can use eggs and dairy.
I tend to minimize dairy in my diet but 

3278
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,360
yeah,
so eggs are huge.

3279
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:20,420
So you minimize dairy because of the 
effect it has on you or like a lot of 

3280
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:23,901
dairy protein like way it kinda started 
with whey protein and I drank it for 

3281
02:40:23,901 --> 02:40:26,070
years and maybe I just built up an 
allergy to it.

3282
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:31,190
But if I were to drink like a full shake
of whey protein right now it would make 

3283
02:40:31,190 --> 02:40:32,490
it wouldn't agree with nigga.
Uh,

3284
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:36,510
although I can,
I can eat butter and sour cream a fine,

3285
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:38,670
no problem.
And a lot of dairy proteins,

3286
02:40:38,671 --> 02:40:43,671
especially casing if I eat a sour cream 
or cottage cheese.

3287
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:46,290
Cottage cheese.
Yeah.

3288
02:40:46,291 --> 02:40:49,860
So something about that can start to 
irritate my gut a little bit.

3289
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:51,510
So I generally just minimize it.

3290
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:53,610
I do like cheese is kind of a weakness 
for me.

3291
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,710
So I might get a little bit of cheese 
here and there,

3292
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:58,050
like almost every day even when I'm 
home,

3293
02:40:58,110 --> 02:41:03,110
but uh,
but I know dairy really was the 

3294
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:07,280
cornerstone of the cute agentic diet 
with the original ketogenic diet with 

3295
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:11,041
the,
like what johns hopkins was formulating 

3296
02:41:11,041 --> 02:41:11,041
because it's been so easy and it tastes 
good,

3297
02:41:11,041 --> 02:41:11,041
right?
Uh,

3298
02:41:11,041 --> 02:41:16,040
but I do find that when people are 
following the qj diet for weight loss 

3299
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:19,170
and they kind of pulled out the dairy,
their fat loss increases.

3300
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:21,930
So I've observed that kind of 
anecdotally,

3301
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:24,600
I'm not sure if people have studied it,
but if they just,

3302
02:41:24,601 --> 02:41:29,601
for example,
pull out the heavy cream and put in a 

3303
02:41:29,601 --> 02:41:31,800
concentrated coconut milk,
which I use for my heavy cream,

3304
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:36,890
which almost has a same cream,
like consistency and they take out the 

3305
02:41:37,291 --> 02:41:39,320
butter,
maybe use more coconut oil and just kind

3306
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:44,380
of switch out dairy for other things,
their fat loss and something about dairy

3307
02:41:45,631 --> 02:41:46,440
in some people.

3308
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:48,170
Not everybody,
uh,

3309
02:41:48,270 --> 02:41:51,810
maybe caused them to retain water.
Might be like a mild allergan.

3310
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:57,260
So for me,
I'm okay with it as long as I kind of 

3311
02:41:57,260 --> 02:41:57,480
minimize it,
but I've just heard so many stories.

3312
02:41:57,700 --> 02:41:58,610
One,
uh,

3313
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:04,100
there was a case report,
now have a mother who had an autistic 

3314
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:06,300
child and put them on a ketogenic diet 
and did remarkably well and then made it

3315
02:42:06,390 --> 02:42:11,390
dairy free and it was really the dairy 
that was contributing to some of the 

3316
02:42:11,390 --> 02:42:12,840
symptoms.
So I think,

3317
02:42:12,841 --> 02:42:14,820
and this went,
this is in the medical literature,

3318
02:42:14,821 --> 02:42:19,821
it's like on pub med,
she use a dairy free ketogenic diet and 

3319
02:42:19,821 --> 02:42:22,740
had quote unquote remission in an 
autistic child.

3320
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:25,980
I firSt saw it,
presented an abstract at a meeting and I

3321
02:42:25,981 --> 02:42:26,650
was like,
wow.

3322
02:42:26,651 --> 02:42:31,651
It was really blown away.
And then about a year later it came out 

3323
02:42:31,651 --> 02:42:31,651
and it was in a pretty good,
uh,

3324
02:42:31,651 --> 02:42:36,500
pretty good journal as a peer reviewed 
publication and pretty well documented 

3325
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:39,990
case report of putting an autistic child
into remission with acute junk dot.

3326
02:42:40,170 --> 02:42:44,130
so we talk about emerging applications.
I know my colleagues,

3327
02:42:44,131 --> 02:42:49,131
uh,
dr jiang roe and dr susan massino are 

3328
02:42:49,131 --> 02:42:49,710
studying,
and I mentioned this because they get so

3329
02:42:49,711 --> 02:42:52,380
many emails about it.
The ketogenetic diet for autism,

3330
02:42:52,530 --> 02:42:55,520
so I think many things are.
Could be the next frontier formation.

3331
02:42:56,010 --> 02:42:56,700
Yeah,
yeah,

3332
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:59,370
yeah.
It could be lending if diet,

3333
02:42:59,540 --> 02:43:02,850
you know,
reduces inflammation and if diet without

3334
02:43:02,851 --> 02:43:07,851
dairy reduces inflammation further that 
I know a lot of people are having some 

3335
02:43:07,851 --> 02:43:09,150
great effects with cbd oils,
which again,

3336
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:12,250
reduce inflammation.
Something I'm very interested in.

3337
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:13,590
Yeah.
I've talked to a nation.

3338
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:17,860
It's just such a giant factor in,
in negative health consequences.

3339
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:23,340
Ketogenic diet plus a cbd,
a plus hyperbaric oxygen therapy plus 

3340
02:43:24,731 --> 02:43:29,731
ketones supplementation is something 
that I wanted to study in a brain tumor 

3341
02:43:29,731 --> 02:43:29,731
model.
A,

3342
02:43:29,731 --> 02:43:33,760
I've just gotten too many emails from 
parents that have kids with epilepsy and

3343
02:43:33,761 --> 02:43:38,761
also people who have cancer who use cbd 
oil and they felt it was remarkably 

3344
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:40,630
effective for them.

3345
02:43:40,630 --> 02:43:41,990
So,
uh,

3346
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:47,010
I've talked with the ceo of charlotte's 
web and other cbd right here.

3347
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:49,780
Yo,
I've never actually tried.

3348
02:43:49,830 --> 02:43:51,460
Is that the charlotte?
Their brand.

3349
02:43:52,340 --> 02:43:57,340
So is this a standardize for a certain 
level of thc?

3350
02:43:57,971 --> 02:44:00,790
It's below a certain level.
Is each batch and standardized.

3351
02:44:00,890 --> 02:44:02,410
It doesn't get you high.
That's what you mean?

3352
02:44:02,650 --> 02:44:03,280
Yeah.
Okay.

3353
02:44:03,281 --> 02:44:08,281
So that was sort of the problem I tried 
to do is work with our university and 

3354
02:44:08,281 --> 02:44:12,931
then I need a dea number and it was like
all the students had to have a d and it 

3355
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:18,050
became so much red tape,
but I'm going to revisit this project 

3356
02:44:18,050 --> 02:44:20,480
and I'm sure you reconnect with them,
try to connect you if you like,

3357
02:44:20,920 --> 02:44:24,100
because they're actually a sponsor of 
the podcast real and yeah,

3358
02:44:24,101 --> 02:44:29,101
they sent me a bunch of it and I tried 
it out for awhile before I took them on 

3359
02:44:29,101 --> 02:44:29,101
as a sponsor.

3360
02:44:29,101 --> 02:44:29,101
I'm like,
this stuff's legit.

3361
02:44:29,110 --> 02:44:30,220
yeah.
Read up about it.

3362
02:44:30,430 --> 02:44:30,870
You know,
they,

3363
02:44:30,871 --> 02:44:33,980
they use the whole plant as well.
So it has all the canals,

3364
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:35,290
the other cannabinoids.
Yeah.

3365
02:44:35,380 --> 02:44:36,980
Which I think is important.
Uh,

3366
02:44:37,420 --> 02:44:40,150
you know,
there's companies that have patented the

3367
02:44:40,180 --> 02:44:43,600
specific can have a dial on there and 
that's kind of,

3368
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:44,990
I was going to use that and there's a 
lot of,

3369
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,680
you know,
da regulation even on that I think.

3370
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:48,660
But yeah,
I will.

3371
02:44:48,730 --> 02:44:51,520
I'm going to revisit that project 
because I really think,

3372
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:56,880
uh,
some of the things that we do with the 

3373
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:57,460
diet and supplementation will synergize,
uh,

3374
02:44:57,700 --> 02:45:01,900
either be additive or synergistic with 
cbd and I mean,

3375
02:45:01,901 --> 02:45:06,901
I love this idea of developing very 
powerful therapies that make the patient

3376
02:45:07,211 --> 02:45:12,211
come out more healthy or does not 
cripple their immune system or their 

3377
02:45:12,211 --> 02:45:12,850
general health when they come out the 
other side,

3378
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:13,870
especially with cancer.

3379
02:45:14,170 --> 02:45:17,470
It's just absolutely incredible that you
could have a more robust person.

3380
02:45:17,730 --> 02:45:18,580
Yes.
Therapy.

3381
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:20,230
Absolutely.
I think it's possible.

3382
02:45:20,860 --> 02:45:22,540
Yeah.
So With cancer it is tricky,

3383
02:45:22,541 --> 02:45:27,541
like every person is different,
but if you get a robust like healthy 

3384
02:45:27,641 --> 02:45:32,641
person to begin with and you can develop
a therapy that manages their tumor.

3385
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:38,880
Uh,
and I've seen very healthy per people 

3386
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:39,670
come out severely crippled after rounds 
of chemo.

3387
02:45:39,671 --> 02:45:41,290
I've seen people killed with chemo.
I mean,

3388
02:45:41,291 --> 02:45:43,240
I know quite a few people actually,
sadly,

3389
02:45:43,241 --> 02:45:45,910
that have been killed literally by the 
standard of care.

3390
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,830
And this,
uh,

3391
02:45:48,490 --> 02:45:50,380
you should really have my colleague on 
here.

3392
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:55,440
He's a very dynamic speaker,
a little bit controversial in some ways,

3393
02:45:55,841 --> 02:46:00,841
but dr.
Professor thomas seyfried from boston 

3394
02:46:00,841 --> 02:46:03,481
college,
he wrote the book cancer as a metabolic 

3395
02:46:03,481 --> 02:46:04,870
disease and uh,
it's a fantastic book that,

3396
02:46:05,330 --> 02:46:10,330
you know,
elegantly documents the theory of cancer

3397
02:46:10,671 --> 02:46:12,470
as a metabolic disease,
uh,

3398
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:13,610
with a lot of hard data.

3399
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:19,180
And travis christofferson,
I wrote a book called tripping over the 

3400
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:22,751
truth and I wrote the foreword to the 
book which discusses a why we view 

3401
02:46:23,151 --> 02:46:28,151
cancer as a genetic disease and kind of 
lays out the data and um,

3402
02:46:29,690 --> 02:46:34,690
you know,
all the evidence to support cancer as a 

3403
02:46:34,690 --> 02:46:36,911
metabolic disease and what we should 
most importantly like what we can do 

3404
02:46:36,911 --> 02:46:40,271
about that in regards and that has major
implications for not only how we treat 

3405
02:46:40,271 --> 02:46:40,910
cancer,
but how we prevent cancer.

3406
02:46:41,030 --> 02:46:41,880
so I talked about,
you know,

3407
02:46:41,960 --> 02:46:45,800
fasting to purge your body,
have precancerous cells so it would fall

3408
02:46:45,801 --> 02:46:50,801
in line with that.
But there's really good hard data 

3409
02:46:50,801 --> 02:46:51,220
behind,
you know,

3410
02:46:51,230 --> 02:46:55,730
this idea that cancer is not,
maybe not necessarily all cancers are,

3411
02:46:55,790 --> 02:46:57,410
you know,
metabolic and origin,

3412
02:46:57,500 --> 02:46:59,570
but a large majority of them appear to 
be.

3413
02:46:59,870 --> 02:47:04,870
And uh,
and I think the national cancer 

3414
02:47:04,870 --> 02:47:05,720
institute and other organizations are 
aware of this.

3415
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:10,720
And now they're funding more grants that
actually target cancer metabolism and 

3416
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:13,940
even developing metabolic therapy 
clinics for,

3417
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,980
you know,
targeting tumor metabolism.

3418
02:47:16,190 --> 02:47:17,360
So this,
this was never,

3419
02:47:17,361 --> 02:47:18,890
this never happened,
you know,

3420
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:21,080
a seven,
eight years ago when I got into this,

3421
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:26,100
it was kind of unheard of,
but there's a lot of interest now in 

3422
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:30,581
pharmaceutical companies developing 
these target molecules that inhibit 

3423
02:47:30,581 --> 02:47:33,350
specific glycolytic sugar consuming 
pathways.

3424
02:47:33,770 --> 02:47:35,960
So as evidence.
So the [inaudible] diet is great,

3425
02:47:35,961 --> 02:47:40,961
right?
because it hits many pathways and 

3426
02:47:40,961 --> 02:47:42,320
synergy,
like one of my slides,

3427
02:47:42,321 --> 02:47:47,321
you know,
that I have and my conversation or a in 

3428
02:47:47,321 --> 02:47:50,501
the presentations that I do is clearly 
shows like it could see all the boxes 

3429
02:47:51,021 --> 02:47:56,021
there.
So this is the key to drink diet and 

3430
02:47:56,021 --> 02:47:56,450
these are all the different signaling 
pathways that is working through.

3431
02:47:57,050 --> 02:48:02,050
And I would say pharmaceutical companies
may put billions of dollars just into 

3432
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:03,230
one of those little boxes.

3433
02:48:03,650 --> 02:48:05,660
You know,
the key to genIc diet works.

3434
02:48:05,690 --> 02:48:07,850
It's so powerful because it's many 
different,

3435
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:10,020
as many different,
uh,

3436
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:15,040
signaling is many different pathways.
Kind of working in synergy for a common 

3437
02:48:15,111 --> 02:48:20,111
output in this particular slide was the 
neuro pharmacological effect that it has

3438
02:48:20,601 --> 02:48:23,450
on suppressing seizures.
the anticonvulsant effect.

3439
02:48:23,690 --> 02:48:24,470
Wow.
So,

3440
02:48:24,471 --> 02:48:29,471
and each one of these is validated with 
a number of peer reviewed publications 

3441
02:48:29,471 --> 02:48:34,091
that you can bring up on pub med.
So it's not like something some guy put 

3442
02:48:34,091 --> 02:48:37,091
together,
I mean it's published and it's like you 

3443
02:48:37,091 --> 02:48:37,091
go to pub med o hdac activity.
Okay.

3444
02:48:37,091 --> 02:48:41,681
But you knew it was like a half dozen 
publications to support each one of 

3445
02:48:41,681 --> 02:48:44,261
these.
So that's what's really exciting to me 

3446
02:48:44,261 --> 02:48:46,970
because there's just so much to be kind 
of discovered and so many different 

3447
02:48:47,001 --> 02:48:49,730
applications and like I said,
it feeds back to nutrition,

3448
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:52,430
which was like one of the main things 
that motivated me,

3449
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:53,930
you know,
early on in college.

3450
02:48:53,930 --> 02:48:56,120
So I can do,
you know,

3451
02:48:56,270 --> 02:48:58,280
go back to something I'm really 
passionate about,

3452
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:00,530
but it's all fascinating,
man across the board.

3453
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:02,960
Uh,
and thank you for sharing this man.

3454
02:49:02,990 --> 02:49:04,940
Thank you.
Thanks for giving me the platform.

3455
02:49:05,150 --> 02:49:06,830
Thanks for going on the tim ferriss 
show.

3456
02:49:06,831 --> 02:49:09,630
And without that I would've probably 
been her for that.

3457
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,280
Yeah.
Thanks.

3458
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:15,440
Thanks tim,
and if somebody wanted to get started 

3459
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:15,690
with this,
what's the best resource,

3460
02:49:15,691 --> 02:49:19,230
like what do you think would be the best
way to do it?

3461
02:49:19,231 --> 02:49:22,680
And I got a few,
so I would say just go to our website.

3462
02:49:22,681 --> 02:49:23,700
I have a website,
quito,

3463
02:49:23,701 --> 02:49:26,370
nutrition,
all one word.org.

3464
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:31,410
And on that website I have a list of 
resources from ebooks to.

3465
02:49:31,500 --> 02:49:34,880
I mean there's ketogenic pizza,
there's a link.

3466
02:49:36,030 --> 02:49:38,140
Make cute agentic pizza.
What's a.

3467
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:39,420
yeah,
I mean the almond flour,

3468
02:49:39,870 --> 02:49:44,870
the crust is essentially like a,
like chicken and parmesan cheese pounded

3469
02:49:44,881 --> 02:49:47,100
into like a cross where they put,
you know the,

3470
02:49:47,490 --> 02:49:50,640
the cheese and the sauce on a low carb 
sauce on top of that.

3471
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:51,630
Yeah,
I love this stuff.

3472
02:49:51,631 --> 02:49:54,210
It's real foods.
A company is.

3473
02:49:54,211 --> 02:49:56,370
I think someone told me that they're in 
ralph's here,

3474
02:49:56,371 --> 02:49:58,710
so I guess they're really doing.
They're doing really well,

3475
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:02,250
but I'll have like one or two of those 
for breakfast in the morning,

3476
02:50:02,251 --> 02:50:05,010
especially if I'm kind of on the go.
They taste,

3477
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:06,270
they're legit,
they're really,

3478
02:50:06,271 --> 02:50:06,840
really good.
Like,

3479
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:12,200
I vetted out a lot of things and just 
kind of very particular towards things 

3480
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:15,711
that I really like and actually tested.
So this is something that I've kind of 

3481
02:50:15,711 --> 02:50:15,810
tested with blood work.
Uh,

3482
02:50:15,811 --> 02:50:18,210
so kiddo nutrition.org
at a link there.

3483
02:50:18,211 --> 02:50:19,600
If you click on that link,
it's,

3484
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:21,080
you get a discount on,
uh,

3485
02:50:21,630 --> 02:50:22,500
on the,
on the,

3486
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:23,640
uh,
product.

3487
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:26,520
Uh,
max love project is really,

3488
02:50:26,521 --> 02:50:28,530
I mean,
if there's families out there,

3489
02:50:28,531 --> 02:50:30,800
parents out there that have kids that 
have cancer,

3490
02:50:30,810 --> 02:50:35,810
please contact the max love project and 
they are helping so many families 

3491
02:50:35,810 --> 02:50:39,741
through innovative application of the 
key to genic diet for childhood cancers.

3492
02:50:39,860 --> 02:50:41,700
Uh,
virta health.

3493
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:46,760
So type two diabetes is like the 
elephant in the room is a massive 

3494
02:50:46,760 --> 02:50:50,421
project.
Virta health is basically tackling this 

3495
02:50:50,421 --> 02:50:50,421
project,
uh,

3496
02:50:50,421 --> 02:50:53,730
by curing literally quote unquote 
reversing type two diabetes,

3497
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:59,330
uh,
in up to 100 million people in the next 

3498
02:50:59,330 --> 02:50:59,910
decade.
I think that's really.

3499
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:05,400
And I talked about people who are just 
embarking on diet alone or the ketogenic

3500
02:51:05,401 --> 02:51:09,180
diet avatar.
Nutrition is a way that allows people to

3501
02:51:09,210 --> 02:51:12,240
not only calculate their macros because 
people are horrible.

3502
02:51:12,300 --> 02:51:17,300
Calculating what they eat,
but it has an algorithm in it that if 

3503
02:51:17,300 --> 02:51:19,770
you put in body composition changes on a
weekly basis,

3504
02:51:19,771 --> 02:51:21,420
it will tell you,
you know,

3505
02:51:21,421 --> 02:51:24,840
it will guide you step by step to your 
ultimate goal.

3506
02:51:24,900 --> 02:51:27,300
And as far as I know,
there's another system like that.

3507
02:51:27,301 --> 02:51:29,380
I mean,
it's like think of weightwatchers,

3508
02:51:29,490 --> 02:51:31,890
but like a version like five point.
Oh,

3509
02:51:31,891 --> 02:51:34,290
in weightwatchers that actually works 
with you.

3510
02:51:34,890 --> 02:51:39,890
Uh,
so I think I'm going to have all these 

3511
02:51:39,890 --> 02:51:41,070
resources on kido nutrition.org,
but if you google any of those terms,

3512
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:46,400
a kito pet sanctuary for people who have
dogs that have epilepsy or dogs that 

3513
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:47,880
have cancer,
look up quito,

3514
02:51:47,881 --> 02:51:51,030
pet sanctuary.com.
There's an ebook on there.

3515
02:51:51,031 --> 02:51:56,031
It's completely free.
You can download it and get the recipe 

3516
02:51:56,031 --> 02:51:56,880
on how to put your dog food together,
uh,

3517
02:51:56,881 --> 02:52:01,440
that can not only prevent or help treat 
cancer or seizures,

3518
02:52:01,441 --> 02:52:03,900
but also just get your dog as healthy as
possible.

3519
02:52:03,901 --> 02:52:05,770
And you know,
uh,

3520
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:07,780
the charlie foundation,
I really have to give.

3521
02:52:07,810 --> 02:52:12,810
I acknowledged the charlie foundation in
my tedx talk and they were probably one 

3522
02:52:13,091 --> 02:52:18,091
of the leading foundations that really 
convinced me and talking with hollywood 

3523
02:52:18,131 --> 02:52:20,140
producer,
jim abrams and,

3524
02:52:20,141 --> 02:52:25,141
uh,
really convinced me that the diet was 

3525
02:52:25,141 --> 02:52:25,141
legitimate,
uh,

3526
02:52:25,141 --> 02:52:27,430
outside of the peer reviewed papers that
I was reading and,

3527
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:32,850
uh,
and there's a movie by meryl streep 

3528
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:32,850
actually called first do no harm.

3529
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:37,470
So meryl streep did a movie on the 
ketogenic diet that most people look it 

3530
02:52:37,470 --> 02:52:39,010
up.
It's called a first do no harm.

3531
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:42,130
So meryl streep start in a ketogenetic 
diet movie.

3532
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:42,940
That's incredible.
And,

3533
02:52:42,941 --> 02:52:44,170
uh,
and it was,

3534
02:52:44,171 --> 02:52:48,280
that movie really floored me because I 
had no idea that she did it actually.

3535
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:49,150
But,
uh,

3536
02:52:49,180 --> 02:52:54,180
it's that movie and meeting jim,
meeting jim abrams and what the charlie 

3537
02:52:54,761 --> 02:52:59,761
foundation is doing through a global 
education is really inspired me to 

3538
02:53:01,780 --> 02:53:03,820
pursue this path,
all the people that they're helping.

3539
02:53:03,821 --> 02:53:08,821
So it was so cool that I could,
I feel really blessed to be able to get 

3540
02:53:08,821 --> 02:53:12,210
into a field of research that is in line
with what was funded to do,

3541
02:53:12,250 --> 02:53:15,640
which was enhance safety performance and
resilience in the warfighter.

3542
02:53:15,820 --> 02:53:18,670
But apply it to so many other things and
uh,

3543
02:53:18,690 --> 02:53:20,600
and also apply it to myself,
which is,

3544
02:53:20,650 --> 02:53:23,730
has been kind of a journey in and of 
itself that I've really enjoyed.

3545
02:53:24,420 --> 02:53:25,340
Amazing stuff,
man.

3546
02:53:25,370 --> 02:53:26,520
And again,
thank you very much.

3547
02:53:26,521 --> 02:53:27,090
Thank you.
Really.

3548
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:27,960
Thanks for having me.
Just,

3549
02:53:27,980 --> 02:53:30,300
I can't thank you enough for being here.
It just blew me away.

3550
02:53:30,301 --> 02:53:31,290
It was awesome.
Thank you.

3551
02:53:31,291 --> 02:53:32,700
Thank you.
All right everybody.

3552
