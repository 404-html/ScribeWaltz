00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,910
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,880
day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,110
Rhonda,
I presume.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,480
Good to see you again.
Good to see you too.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,570
Last time I saw you,
I introduced you to the wonderful world 

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:24,570
of head trauma.
Indeed,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Dr Rhonda got her first experience of a 
live UFC event and just to preface it,

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,390
you really didn't know much about the 
UFC at all before you went to this thing

9
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,380
with your husband and it was.
Well,

10
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,250
I'll put you.
You were pretty shocked.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,010
Yes.
I mean to be honest,

12
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:49,011
I had no clue until the morning of or 
the day before and that was like the 

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:55,551
morning of the day before it's blank 
that I looked it up and it was like I 

14
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:57,120
saw people were like in a cage fighting 
and I was like,

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,910
holy crap.
I thought it was,

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,960
you know,
totally.

17
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,340
I don't know even know what I was 
expecting.

18
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,080
It was just some kind of wrestling thing
or something,

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,050
you know?
I think I was confusing it with the w.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,530
w e e is that what?
Wrestling the ww something wrestling.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,880
So Ufc,
I mean just these little three letter 

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:19,880
acronyms,
acronyms.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,000
So you had really never been exposed to 
any sort of mixed martial arts.

24
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,370
That's so funny.
Not Mixed martial arts.

25
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:27,960
I mean I was,
you know,

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,810
aware of things like taekwondo and all 
that,

27
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:33,900
but I just know that they exist and that
they're kind of cool.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,460
And that's,
that's about it.

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,880
Had you ever been to a boxing match 
before?

30
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,030
No,
I had never been to a boxing match and 

31
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,360
I've really never really watched when 
I've seen probably clips or pieces of 

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,810
it,
like throughout my life at some point,

33
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:53,811
but I'm just no exposure in general.
I don't have a sports gene in my body 

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,650
while I love to like work out and 
exercise and you know,

35
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:06,651
I'm very addicted to the brain benefits 
and other benefits I have never really 

36
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:12,720
like watched sports or been interested 
in it like in general.

37
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,170
And I try really hard because my dad is 
a huge sports fan.

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,240
Oh love.
He plays baseball.

39
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:22,170
I mean he's 65 and he still plays 
baseball on like a men's league.

40
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:24,060
So anyone watches football,
basketball,

41
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,220
any sport,
any like manly sport,

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,880
you know,
he,

43
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,500
he watches,
he knows everything about.

44
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,510
And he's not a big science guy,
so I try really hard to bond with him 

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,150
when I'm with him.
I'm like trying really hard to be 

46
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,760
interested or like he'll take me to a 
padres game,

47
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,830
you know,
in San Diego and I'm like,

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,440
I try to like understand,
you know,

49
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,950
the,
like what's happening.

50
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,130
But it takes a little work for me.
Um,

51
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,540
with that said,
that whole,

52
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,770
that mma experience was very unique 
because I've been to a baseball game.

53
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,870
I've been to a football game,
basketball game.

54
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:58,800
So those are the sports that I've 
actually spectated live at some point in

55
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:03,801
my life.
But the MMA was a very different 

56
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:03,801
experience.
Um,

57
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:08,130
I've,
it felt very like there was kind of a 

58
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,311
tribal component to it where you've got 
people cheering when the fighters are 

59
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:15,460
coming down the aisle and I don't know 
the way the music,

60
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,900
like drums and stuff,
we're going,

61
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,670
I something beating and then this,
the whole people fighting in a cage made

62
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,170
me feel like this,
you know,

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,780
times back in the Roman colosseum where 
they'd go and watch people fight.

64
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,840
And there's a lot of that in it.
You know,

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,240
there's definitely a lot of tribal,
the tribal element of the music.

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,090
Yes.
Different people from different cultures

67
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:42,091
have different music,
like a lot of the country music guys or 

68
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:45,150
country guys will come out to like 
country songs and guys who were like a 

69
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,470
more urban will come out to the rap 
songs.

70
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,060
A lot of white guys come up with a rap 
songs too,

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,380
but,
you know,

72
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,170
some guys would come out to like classic
rock and everyone's like,

73
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:54,550
Yay,
I love that song.

74
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,310
I'm going to root for this dude.
You know,

75
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:58,960
but it's uh,
there's definitely an element of that in

76
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:02,160
it.
The music was cool and that,

77
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,870
that I think that also gave that tribal 
feeling,

78
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,300
but then the cheering and how people 
were like,

79
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:12,301
I had it just,
there is something moving inside of me 

80
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:12,301
that I was not expecting.

81
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:15,700
And then so it was cool.
And in that regard where it was like,

82
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,730
oh,
this feels like some unique experience 

83
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:20,730
that I wouldn't get at.
You know,

84
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,280
they haven't ever experienced any sort 
of other sport event that I've attended.

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,250
So when you said something was moving 
inside of you,

86
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,410
you mean like you were emotionally 
moved,

87
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,390
like you got excited,
your heart raced.

88
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,460
It was part of the community that you 
know,

89
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,020
was like,
wow,

90
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:39,610
this is some kind of community that I 
get to experience for a day.

91
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,300
Yeah,
it was,

92
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:45,670
it was some sort of unique event where I
felt like I was just,

93
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,340
you know,
connecting with these people that are 

94
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,340
around me.
It's a very addictive community too.

95
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,620
I can imagine.
It was a lot of fun.

96
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,850
You know,
it was a lot of fun.

97
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,760
Aside from the me,
you know,

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,800
looking at the effects on the brain and 
stuff a lot of these fighters are 

99
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,010
experiencing.

100
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,000
Aside from that,
it was,

101
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,590
it was a lot of fun.
I really,

102
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,850
really liked it.
That was the thing.

103
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:11,851
We all went out afterwards.
A giant group of US afterwards went out 

104
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,810
to eat and you just were wide eyed.
You had like,

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,880
like saucer eyes and you were like the 
amount of damage that you just couldn't.

106
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,340
I couldn't stop calculating the amount 
of damage that was going on to these 

107
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,590
people's brains.
Irreversible damage.

108
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:29,591
Like yes,
well that and coupled with our 

109
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,910
conversation the night before where,
you know,

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,910
denny was talking about friends that 
were fighters that,

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,480
you know,
having memory problems and immediately 

112
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,190
when he started describing some of those
characteristics,

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I was like,
that sounds just like an Alzheimer's 

114
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,620
patient and just because I wasn't really
aware of any of the MMA,

115
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,180
you know,
community,

116
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,440
what it involves,
what sort of,

117
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,630
you know,
it seems like there's a lot of,

118
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,860
you know,
there's not a lot of rules.

119
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,690
Like you know,
you can,

120
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,970
you can punch someone in the head and 
you can kick,

121
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,020
you can choke,
you can,

122
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,220
you know,
boxing,

123
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,280
I don't think they can kick.
And so it seems like there was a lot of 

124
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,990
other stuff going on that was very 
traumatic.

125
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,460
It's so funny.
Listen to you describe it because 

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,990
you're,
you're so educated in science and the 

127
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,060
human body and the effects of vitamins 
and various nutrients in the human body.

128
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
So to see you get your first exposure to
what's like a normal part of my life.

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,280
It's like a daily part of my life 
essentially is being exposed to this 

130
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,280
stuff.
So it's,

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,170
it's fascinating to watch you,
like,

132
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:40,630
I don't think they can kick in boxing.
You're so removed now.

133
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:45,631
It's like you're an alien from another 
planet and landed in the world of MMA 

134
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:46,280
for a day.
Yes.

135
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,850
That,
that,

136
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,830
that is kind of how I felt.

137
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,260
Wow.
But I'm right.

138
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:54,480
Right.
You're right,

139
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,070
you're right.
You're right.

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,890
Well,
there is a thing called kickboxing A.

141
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,300
There's a company called glory and they 
hold these events on Spike TV,

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
which is a American cable channel and 
they're allowed to kick that kick and 

143
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,180
they can need,
they can't elbow though.

144
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,410
Um,
it's like a modified version of what's 

145
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,900
called [inaudible] Thai and Moitai is 
Thai boxing and in Thailand,

146
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,980
um,
they are the experts in this very 

147
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,140
particular type of kickboxing where they
do a lot of clenching.

148
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:26,170
They grab a hold of each other and need 
each other in the body and the head and 

149
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,680
the elbow from the clench and they,
they throw a lot of leg kicks.

150
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,720
They're known for their,
they're kicking ability.

151
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,550
I've seen Muy Thai,
like on twitter and like,

152
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,900
you know,
tweeting at me and stuff.

153
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:39,770
But I really didn't know exactly what it
was and monetize pretty wild.

154
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Actually.
I didn't even realize people used 

155
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,261
kickbox.
I thought kickboxing was like a way to 

156
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:47,261
work out.
Like I didn't realize there was actually

157
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,570
people fighting seriously.
Like I really,

158
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,520
really thought that it was just a way to
work out until just now,

159
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,040
wow,
that's so crazy.

160
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,410
I'm in another world.
I do a lot of.

161
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,380
I was telling my husband the other day,
like,

162
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,090
you know,
people on weekends,

163
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:07,091
they go out and they think they go 
camping and they hike and they go and 

164
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:08,570
they go to the woods and a fight,
you know,

165
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,020
see all these new things in the forest,
which I love to do by the way.

166
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:17,021
But every day what I did was I'm like 
hiking and foraging through the human 

167
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:21,791
body.
And it's like everyday I'm doing this 

168
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,680
constantly and I do get a little,
um,

169
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,440
you know,
I'm,

170
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,410
I'm sort of sheltered from a lot of 
other things because I'm just like,

171
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,440
oh,
he's reading about science and health 

172
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,711
and mechanisms.
And so at times I am with other things 

173
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:41,861
that are so common knowledge to people.
I'll kind of like blow people's minds 

174
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:42,710
around like no,
I didn't know.

175
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,770
Like what other things are you 
completely cultural norms that you're 

176
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,370
completely unaware of?
Well,

177
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,190
a lot of sports things,
definitely at television stuff.

178
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,390
Um,
you know,

179
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,280
just any of that television world

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,280
and people always relate to commercials 
and like I nothing,

181
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,420
it's like yours without a TV's

182
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,920
CV and I still don't relate to.
Someone just explained to me that the 

183
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,841
show bones on Fox has been on for like 
six years or something like that was on 

184
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,440
the other day in a hospital waiting 
room.

185
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:20,590
I was watching it and I was like,
what this show is,

186
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,990
how long it's been on and like spend on 
forever.

187
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:23,770
I was like,
what?

188
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,320
Come on,
like there's so many shows.

189
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,780
I have no idea what they are.
I'll pass by US weekly.

190
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,530
And with someone on the cover,
you know,

191
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,960
she's leaving him.
She started like,

192
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,760
who the fuck is she?
Who's he?

193
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,080
Who apparently they're huge celebrities.
I have no idea who they are.

194
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,840
Yeah,
that's,

195
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,950
that's.
So I'm,

196
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,110
I'm in that sort of a mindset mindset,
so,

197
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,440
um,
but you know,

198
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,260
back to the,
to the UFC event,

199
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,840
um,
yes.

200
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,850
So the watching the event was really 
exciting,

201
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,880
but I'm starting to look at,
you know,

202
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,930
these blows that people were taken to 
their head and the choking,

203
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:04,620
there seems to be a lot of choking going
on and you know,

204
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,750
some of those sort of.
I was just from what little I knew at 

205
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,390
the time it was already like,
wow,

206
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,920
this seems like,
you know,

207
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,790
some stuff's going down.
Basically smoking

208
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,000
though is not as dangerous as the,
the,

209
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,720
the issue with choking is annie 
grappling.

210
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,080
You're gonna develop microtrauma,
you're gonna have disc issues.

211
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:28,510
As you get older you're going to have 
the just a lot,

212
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,410
a lot going on with the spine,
you know,

213
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,270
and so there's some trauma,
but for the most part the choking is not

214
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,540
too dangerous.
There's one repeated issue that's been 

215
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,600
happening a lot lately.
Never happened in the UFC,

216
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,400
but it's been happening in smaller 
organizations and it's a very particular

217
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:49,040
move where someone will go for a take 
down,

218
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,030
which is to the guy there standing up.
You try to take the guy down and then 

219
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,731
the person who they're trying to take 
down gets the guy in what's called a 

220
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:03,400
guillotine choke and a good team choke 
is your head is trapped under the armpit

221
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,580
and you have your forum or anything neck
and you're pulling up on the neck and 

222
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,971
then the person who's caught in the good
team tries to take the person down by 

223
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,830
like picking them up and trying to throw
them and they land on the guys head and 

224
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,820
that people are becoming paralyzed from 
it.

225
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,710
It's happened several times.
It's happened in training a couple of 

226
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,420
times and tapping a couple times in 
fights,

227
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,710
but it's enough of an issue where it's 
starting to scare the shit out of me.

228
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,990
You know that guys who get caught and 
good teams try to slam their way out of 

229
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,551
it.
They try to pick a guy up and slammed 

230
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:39,520
their way out of it instead of trying to
be technical and grab a hold of the hand

231
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:44,521
and try to work your way out of it.
It's just [inaudible] that choke is so 

232
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:47,840
sudden when you get caught in it,
it's such a nasty joke that the,

233
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:52,841
the,
there's like one or two seconds where 

234
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,310
you had with a guy who's really good,
where you have to breathe,

235
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,230
where you know,
otherwise you're,

236
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:01,231
you're,
you're pretty much going to go 

237
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:01,231
unconscious.
So that's one thing I was wondering with

238
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,640
the choking specifically was,
you know,

239
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,750
because choking,
you know,

240
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,770
you can to some degree cause some 
hypoxia in the brain so you know,

241
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,140
you're not causing ischemic damage,
which is like no oxygen getting into the

242
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:19,141
brain,
but you may have reduced oxygen in the 

243
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:22,141
body compensates for that.
They know the body will because it 

244
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:22,270
senses that less oxygen is getting the 
brain.

245
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:24,850
It increases blood flow as a 
compensation.

246
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,420
But if that can't,
if it can't compensate what happens,

247
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,710
you know,
you'll start to,

248
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:34,711
um,
eventually like your motor control will 

249
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:37,231
get affected.
And I was wondering if they use that as 

250
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:39,391
a technique like because then that the,
because they're choking their opponent,

251
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:42,740
now their opponents,
motor control gets effected.

252
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,310
No goals,
just put the guy of sleep,

253
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,890
which is even worse because that's the 
next step,

254
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,380
which then you become the top.

255
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,550
Yeah.
So,

256
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,670
and there is that,
that hypoxic damage,

257
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,290
you know,
there is damage occurring,

258
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,690
what kind of damage has occurred and 
when the going gets choked out,

259
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,480
completely asleep,
completely asleep.

260
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,980
So you're talking about,
you know,

261
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,850
not enough oxygen getting the brain for 
just a couple of seconds,

262
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,300
a few seconds.
I'm one of the thing that can happen is 

263
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,230
that you can have a lactate buildup.
So,

264
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,940
um,
the,

265
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,150
so your brain,
so you have a neurons and you have 

266
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,110
supporting cells in your brain called 
astrocytes and glial cells.

267
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:27,940
But astrocytes are a specific type of.
Glial cells are really important.

268
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:32,941
They do a lot of things for the brain 
and they make up like 50 percent of the 

269
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,540
human brain volume.
They actually,

270
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,140
um,
they use glucose and they use glucose in

271
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,420
a way where they don't need their 
mitochondria.

272
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:45,421
So they use glucose through something 
called glycolysis and the byproduct is 

273
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,390
they make lactate.

274
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,900
And the reason they do this is because 
the lactate then goes into the neuron 

275
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,310
and it goes right into the Mitochondria 
and is used to produce energy,

276
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,920
but that isn't needs to be coupled to 
oxygen.

277
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,810
So lactate is,
um,

278
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:04,710
a really great source of energy for 
neurons because it's,

279
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,910
it's not for the Neuron to convert 
glucose into Piru,

280
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
um,
which then gets used as energy costs 

281
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,390
energy,
but for lactate to get converted into 

282
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,350
Piru Bait to then be used as energy,
it's thermodynamic dynamically favorable

283
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,720
because it doesn't cost any energy to do
that.

284
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,070
So,
um,

285
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,460
but this requires oxygen.
This is this oxidative phosphorylation 

286
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,930
mechanism that I've talked about before.
Um,

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
but when you don't have oxygen there,
then the lactate can't be used by the 

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,150
neurons.
And uh,

289
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:40,000
so lactate will then build up and can,
cause,

290
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,360
you know,
it can cause cell death when you have 

291
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,430
too much lactic acidosis building up in 
their brain.

292
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,050
Now that I don't,
you know,

293
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:52,051
with the amount of choking,
I don't think that's much of an issue 

294
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,380
because this is more for like a real,
like real trauma,

295
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,430
like intense trauma,
more like a head trauma blow to the head

296
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,690
or um,
you know,

297
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:04,691
even like the rapid acceleration and 
deceleration that occurs like car 

298
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,780
accidents mostly.
Yeah.

299
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,720
I don't think that,
you know,

300
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,240
the blows to the head,
you know,

301
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,880
people's heads are moving,
but it's not as,

302
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,580
it's not like a car hitting you where 
it's like really,

303
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:16,670
really rapid acceleration deceleration.
That's a real problem.

304
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,890
Um,
so I think,

305
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,750
you know,
once I started to dive into this,

306
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,480
I start to read about traumatic brain 
injury.

307
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,570
Um,
and specifically I became interested in 

308
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,361
that,
in it because of the Alzheimer's 

309
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:31,361
connection and was like,
Whoa,

310
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:35,081
wait a minute.
Why are these young people coming down 

311
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:35,081
with symptoms of Alzheimer's?

312
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,400
Like in like early,
early age like that,

313
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,560
there's,
there's some,

314
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,580
some connection between the way the 
normal brain ages and something that's 

315
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,320
happening with traumatic brain injury.
So I became really interested in,

316
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,590
started reading about it,
you know,

317
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,640
since I went to that a UFC event and I'm
really a fascinating,

318
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,480
you know,
I've been reading a lot about it and you

319
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:56,860
know,
these,

320
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,280
these fighters,
fighters,

321
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,390
nfl players,
you know,

322
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,150
people,
boxer boxing,

323
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:05,450
anyone that's taking blows to the head,
you know,

324
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,590
whatever sport,
you know,

325
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,120
that that's some,
you know,

326
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,340
in some regard,
I think even rugby,

327
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,570
things like that.
Um,

328
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,440
you know,
these,

329
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,470
these people have a uh,
increased incident of Alzheimer's in 

330
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:17,470
some cases just,
you know,

331
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,550
two to three fold increased case if 
Alzheimer's.

332
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,900
Um,
and,

333
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,370
and it's an earlier onset,
you know,

334
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,390
and it's very like indistinguishable,
indistinguishable in terms of like some 

335
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:32,060
of the pathology that occurs in their 
brain compared to like someone who's,

336
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,200
you know,
75,

337
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,780
80,
85 years old and getting Alzheimer's.

338
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,120
So,
um,

339
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,730
I started reading about this like,
what's going on?

340
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Um,
and what happens is like even just a 

341
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,160
single blow to the head,
um,

342
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,700
can cause,
you know,

343
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:51,701
it can increase the risk for Alzheimer's
and when you're having multiple 

344
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:51,701
repetitive injuries that's,
you know,

345
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:53,410
increases the risk even more.
Um,

346
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,380
and so initially like there's a lot of 
changes that happened,

347
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,120
but when you have a blow to the head,
you know,

348
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,100
you've got the acute damage that 
happens.

349
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,150
So,
you know,

350
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,700
um,
tissue damage you can get,

351
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,520
like diffuse axonal injury,
things like that.

352
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,650
And that's from like a real trauma to 
the head.

353
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,420
But you know,
even just like re mild repetitive trauma

354
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:18,421
is what happens is you get tissue damage
and you release a lot of reactive oxygen

355
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:21,410
species,
which I've talked about before which are

356
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,330
released every,
every day.

357
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:28,331
We're releasing that in our brains and 
our other cells through just normal 

358
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:28,520
metabolism.

359
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Um,
it's kind of like a byproduct of normal 

360
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,681
metabolism.
So people that are not getting brain 

361
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:35,681
injury,
it's happening in a little bit each day.

362
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
But with a brain injury,
when you're,

363
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,940
when you're getting a blow to the head,
it induces a massive,

364
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:45,470
massive amount of release of it and it 
starts to damage the manichees.

365
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,670
So which,
which,

366
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,980
uh,
form of protective membrane,

367
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,470
the brain and those cells start to die.
A reactive oxygen species as a 

368
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,470
protective mechanism.
It causes cells to die.

369
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:03,471
And the reason it does,
I've talked about reactive oxygen 

370
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,931
species before in the context of cancer.
When you get a little bit of reactive 

371
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,530
oxygen species such as like normal 
metabolism you can do,

372
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,840
you can cause damage to DNA.
And when you damage the DNA,

373
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,790
you can either repair that damage.
If you don't,

374
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,340
you can get a mutation eventually that 
builds up and leads to cancer.

375
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,670
But if you have a huge burst of it,
like in the case where you're getting an

376
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:25,671
injury,
then you're talking about a protective 

377
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:25,671
mechanism that kicks in,
which is like,

378
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,140
okay,
I need to kill the cell and the 

379
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,360
reasoning to kill cells because I don't 
want to get all that damage that's going

380
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:32,280
to cause me cancer.
So it's.

381
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,710
So it's a protective mechanism.
So it's killing cells to protect itself.

382
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,870
Yes,
that's,

383
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
that's the,
uh,

384
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,930
biological mechanism as to why this huge
burst of reactive oxygen species does 

385
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,860
kill cells.
It's a,

386
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,230
you know,
it's a conserved and evolutionary 

387
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,230
conserved mechanism and it really is 
important,

388
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,500
like if you're,
if you stand,

389
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,080
that's why part of the,
you know,

390
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,120
underlying mechanism for radiation in 
terms of like treating cancer radiation 

391
00:18:59,161 --> 00:18:59,800
is,
you know,

392
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,450
you're,
you're,

393
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,790
you're causing double stranded breaks in
DNA.

394
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,870
It's just like you're,
you know,

395
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,930
you're,
you're damaging the DNA and it's a huge 

396
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:08,930
amount of damage.

397
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,570
So it causes cells to die.
Um,

398
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,860
so this is happening in the brain and 
it's really not a good thing because in 

399
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:16,990
the sense for this,
you know,

400
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,250
on the acute injury,
you've got these energy cells that start

401
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,290
to die and then astrocytes,
which like,

402
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,070
you know,
they are part of them like help form 

403
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,711
some of the blood brain barrier.
They start to die and when those 

404
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,860
astrocytes start dying,
that form the blood brain barrier,

405
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,290
what happens is the blood brain barrier 
gets leaky.

406
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,740
And now you have things like,
um,

407
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,150
you know,
potassium chloride,

408
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:43,110
sodium leaking into the brain and 
causing astrocytes to swell,

409
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:46,050
causing water to flow in and you get,
you know,

410
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,760
a Dema and the brain,
like I looked at this guy mark comic,

411
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,830
I think if you could go and you can see 
like a picture of his swollen Dema like 

412
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,970
head and it's just like unbelievable.

413
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,090
So that's part of the,
the cause of this edema.

414
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,420
So you've now what happens is that 
reactive oxygen species,

415
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,060
those dead cells,
the blood brain barrier gets compromised

416
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,300
immediately when that happens,
these immune system and the brain gets 

417
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,781
activated.
So you have another part of glial cells 

418
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:18,111
called Microglia,
which are like the immune cells in the 

419
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,451
brain.
They get activated when the blood brain 

420
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,380
barrier gets damaged and they migrate up
and they're trying to plug up the hole.

421
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,980
So they're like,
oh my God,

422
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,070
you know,
the blood brain barrier has been 

423
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,070
compromised.
So they might get up and start trying to

424
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,960
plug up the hole.
The problem is now you've activated,

425
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,080
activated this whole immune response 
where it starts to.

426
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:38,410
Cause.
Yeah,

427
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,770
look at that.
I mean,

428
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:45,771
that's just so awful when you see a lump
like that fight should be stopped 

429
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:46,890
immediately.

430
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,110
Yeah.
I would say was,

431
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:55,111
did he keep fighting after that fall,
another round and one won the final 

432
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:59,470
round with a,
with a big injury like that.

433
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,930
That's just unbelievable honestly.
Um,

434
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,330
so in your opinion as a medical 
professional,

435
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:10,690
when you see that kind of swelling,
um,

436
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,870
this is,
this is not a guy who should be hitting 

437
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:15,870
the head again.
And I would,

438
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,980
I would say definitely not.
There's a lot of consequences that can 

439
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,301
occur when you're sick,
when you already have this type of 

440
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:26,140
damage where your immune system has been
activated.

441
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:26,860
I mean,
you're getting.

442
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,860
So that's not just A.
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

443
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:33,010
but that's not just a wound that's 
bleeding under the skin.

444
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
That's part of the thing that's 
happening.

445
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,420
But in addition to that,
you're,

446
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,060
you've got all sorts of cellular changes
that are occurring.

447
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,410
You're getting,
you know,

448
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:43,960
like I said,
damage to the damage.

449
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,960
These astrocytes that are forming the 
blood brain barrier and then you start 

450
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:54,871
getting those,
they start dying and when they start 

451
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:54,871
dying at dead cell,
you know,

452
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:56,690
in addition to the,
the Microglia,

453
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,620
the immune system in the brain getting 
activated to try to plug up the damage.

454
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,020
It also,
as soon as you have cells dying,

455
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,760
which in a case like this,
when you're.

456
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,300
We've got massive damage.
It's happening on a huge scale.

457
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,810
These microglia,
they try to like eat up and get rid of 

458
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,810
all the cellular debris.
I mean that's part of what they do their

459
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:16,540
program to do these.
They get activated when you have a bunch

460
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,720
of dead cells and they try to go eat 
away this damage.

461
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,440
And the problem is,
is that when that starts to happen,

462
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,600
you're getting a starting a cycle of 
neuroinflammation in the brain,

463
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,620
which is very bad.

464
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,160
And you know,
what happens even within like hours of 

465
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,530
an injury like that is you start to get 
accumulation of something called amyloid

466
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,680
Beta plaques in the brain.
So,

467
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,310
you know,
traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's,

468
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,860
they have a lot in common in the sense 
where,

469
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:52,861
you know,
traumatic brain injury is a massive 

470
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,231
amount of damage and it's happening in 
one instance or even just mild 

471
00:22:55,231 --> 00:23:00,030
repetitive injuries.
You may not get someone that has a 

472
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,030
swollen head like mark,
but you know,

473
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,720
just taking repetitive blows to the 
head.

474
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,080
Also,
you're causing your activating,

475
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
you know,
reactive oxygen species are causing 

476
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,740
cells to die and you are activating the 
immune system even with a mild injury.

477
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,130
And what happens is that,
um,

478
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,530
you know,
in addition to start activating this 

479
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,271
immune system,
then this also causes the accumulation 

480
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:22,510
of these amyloid Beta plaques accumulate
in the brain.

481
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,810
So amyloid Beta plaques is one of the 
major pathologies associated with 

482
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,520
Alzheimer's.
What happens is as we age,

483
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,800
we have a little bit of inflammation 
going on in our brain.

484
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,200
Know we have cells dying.
We have,

485
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,130
you know,
this is,

486
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,680
this is a little bit by bit scale every 
day.

487
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,040
And so by the time,
you know,

488
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,670
seven,
eight decades go by,

489
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,280
you know,
we've accumulated enough damage,

490
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,910
stuff starts getting messed up.
So amyloid Beta plaques,

491
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:54,911
they form outside of neurons in between 
glial cells and neurons and what they 

492
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:59,411
do.
If you can even Google amyloid Beta 

493
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:02,831
plaques,
you'll see they form these little 

494
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:04,631
plaques outside of the neurons and this 
disrupts like glucose metabolism and 

495
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:10,611
neurons and astrocytes.
It causes even more reactive oxygen 

496
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:13,811
species to be generated.
So now you're generating even more and 

497
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,560
more on a daily basis.
And the microglia cells,

498
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:20,561
the immune cells of the brain get 
activated when there's a plaque just 

499
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:20,561
like they do when there's a dead cell.
They're like,

500
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,620
oh my God,
what is this?

501
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:24,530
I need to get rid of it.
So they get activated.

502
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:28,040
They secrete proinflammatory cytokines.
They're doing all this firing,

503
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:33,041
firing and the trying to eat the plaques
and so you know that it causes this 

504
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:37,901
vicious cycle of neuroinflammation where
then that causes more plugs to be 

505
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:37,901
formed.

506
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:39,080
So you have.
It's a terrible,

507
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:44,081
terrible cycle of neuroinflammation.
This amyloid Beta plaques form in in 

508
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,870
fighters and also in like NFL player 
that they've looked at these plaques 

509
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,551
that are in the brains and they've.
They've even shown by like pet scans 

510
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:55,490
that they form immediately,
like within hours,

511
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:57,800
and this even happens in children that 
have undergone trauma,

512
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,930
you know,
so there's something,

513
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,370
it's almost like the traumatic brain 
injury is like accelerated aging,

514
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,220
like,
like it's just instead of seven decades,

515
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,960
boom,
it's like it's happening,

516
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:10,010
you know,
in an instant,

517
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:15,011
in like in the course of hours,
and then you keep it and then it causes 

518
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:19,940
this huge cycle of neuroinflammation.
So in addition to that,

519
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Tau tangles start to form.
This is another thing that happens in 

520
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,780
response to the activation of these 
microglia cells in the brain.

521
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,980
We're now you've got something like 
inside your neuron,

522
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,010
you,
you've got a protein called tau and it's

523
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:39,011
really an important protein because 
basically what it does is it's like it's

524
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:44,441
transporting cargo all like a down the 
long Axon to the snapchat cleft where 

525
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:49,661
neurotransmission occurs,
where do you form synopsis to learn 

526
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:49,661
memory?

527
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:49,910
Those things are happening.
It's taking,

528
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:52,730
it's transporting lipids,
it's transporting glucose,

529
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:55,070
it's transporting mitochondria that,
you know,

530
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,220
need to get to that synaptic cleft to 
produce energy.

531
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,450
Um,
so it's like,

532
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,110
it's,
you know,

533
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:05,111
it's transporting all this cargo to get 
there to do all this really important 

534
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:05,600
stuff for your brain to function.
But what happens is,

535
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,140
you know,
traumatic brain injury and also just 

536
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,791
normal brain aging when you have this 
activation of the immune system and 

537
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:16,871
reactive oxygen species,
it causes this thing aggregate and it 

538
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:19,560
screws up its function and now it can't 
transport any of that cargo.

539
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,040
It's like the train became derailed.
It can't get there.

540
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,430
So now you can't get,
you know,

541
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,140
nutrients to the,
to the part of the neuron where it needs

542
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,000
to get.
You can't get Mitochondria there,

543
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,980
you know,
which are making energy.

544
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,020
And so you start to have things breaking
down.

545
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,280
You start to have synopses dying.
Um,

546
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,690
you know,
that's part of the reason.

547
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,190
So to neurons,
they,

548
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,390
when you learn something,
you form a synaptic connections between 

549
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:43,500
the neurons.
And that's the whole purpose of neurons.

550
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,540
They,
they want to form connections with other

551
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,250
neurons.
And that's,

552
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:47,490
you know,
that's what they're there for.

553
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And when you can't do that,
if there's not enough energy and it 

554
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,180
starts breaking down,
the neurons have no purpose,

555
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,740
they,
they can't,

556
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,220
so they die.
And so this,

557
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:01,110
this causes brain atrophy.
And it happens,

558
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,240
you know,
in normal brain aging over the course of

559
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:08,241
several decades where you can look at an
Alzheimer's brain and it's just gotten 

560
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,660
massive atrophy.
Well,

561
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,760
the same thing happens with traumatic 
brain injury.

562
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,090
You know,
these people are,

563
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,260
are losing a lot of cells,
glial cells and neurons in their brain 

564
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,680
and it's causing brain atrophy.
So,

565
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,140
you know,
these,

566
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,310
the accumulation of amyloid Beta and tau
tangles are two prominent features of 

567
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,180
Alzheimer's that are disrupting all 
sorts of,

568
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,400
there causing,
like I said,

569
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,080
Immuno Neuro inflammation.

570
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,810
They're causing a reactive oxygen 
species to be generated and does it.

571
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,280
It causes a cycle where it just won't 
stop because whenever there's an amyloid

572
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,930
plaque,
you activate more microglia,

573
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,630
the Microglia get activated and makes 
more plaques.

574
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,110
You know.
So it's,

575
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,140
it's just this horrible cycle that 
doesn't get broken and not something 

576
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,190
that's,
that's really,

577
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,250
uh,
they found both of these things very 

578
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,250
prominently in brains of people that 
have undergone Tbi.

579
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,850
I have a question about repeated trauma.
So if you are in a fight and you get hit

580
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,570
and hurt and you get in trouble,
but you survive and then you make it to 

581
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,500
the next round,
do the,

582
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,530
the impacts that you take after that,
are they even more devastating because 

583
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:17,610
of the initial impact?
Yes.

584
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,500
So what happens is,
because of the initial,

585
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,900
the initial injury,
your cells and because of the,

586
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,920
the,
the production of reactive oxygen 

587
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:30,920
species and inflammatory response and 
these things that are happening,

588
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,450
that is all a stress to the cell.

589
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:38,130
So the cell is already stressed and when
a cell is stressed,

590
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,450
it is more susceptible to death.
Um,

591
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,830
this is,
this is kind of part of the mechanism by

592
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:51,831
which cancer cells are primed to die in 
a sense where cancer cells are stressed 

593
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:58,011
because all sorts of stuff is going 
wrong in them and they are primed to 

594
00:28:58,591 --> 00:28:59,700
die.
Like they,

595
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,090
the cell is expressing what's called pro
apoptotic proteins in cells that are 

596
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,130
proteins that are going to make the cell
die,

597
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,700
but the cancer cells found a way to 
overcome that by expressing these 

598
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,130
antiapoptotic proteins,
and so it's a good balance between,

599
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:19,131
okay,
how much do I have that's gonna make me 

600
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:21,381
die or not make me die?
So that's happening when you have a 

601
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:22,110
stressed cell from injury and then like 
for example,

602
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,970
brain injury,
they're also,

603
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,380
you know,
the,

604
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,650
the reactive oxygen species causes those
cells to make more of those proteins 

605
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:29,650
that are saying,
okay,

606
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,310
di Di di,
so they're already primed to die.

607
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,440
Even if they,
some of them die immediately,

608
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,630
but even the ones that haven't died 
immediately,

609
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,140
they may not be dead because there's 
enough of those ones that are saying,

610
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:40,830
no,
don't die,

611
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,560
don't die.
Yet.

612
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,140
There's enough of that protein there to 
sort of balance it out.

613
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,660
But then when you take another stress 
boom,

614
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,880
it just tips it.
It tips it towards death.

615
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,300
So stress plus stress is additive in 
that stress can sensitize you to death.

616
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Stress Plus stress will definitely cause
death.

617
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,160
So that's,
that's something that,

618
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:00,910
you know,
taking,

619
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,270
you know,
having repetitive injuries specimen,

620
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,960
especially in a short timeframe like 
that,

621
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,350
um,
you know,

622
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,480
sensitizes them to death.
So plus it's also,

623
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:10,910
you know,
you're,

624
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:14,480
you're making more of these amyloid Beta
plaques in your brain,

625
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:14,870
you know,
these,

626
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,880
this is like,
like I said,

627
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:20,881
it's happening within our.
So like the more injury that's 

628
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:20,881
happening,
the more this is occurring.

629
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:25,620
So it's,
it's really a nasty thing and I'm with 

630
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,080
fighters just from watching the one 
event that I went to.

631
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:34,081
I mean it was clear that Mo,
pretty much all of them were taking 

632
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,080
injuries to the head.
Um,

633
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,490
and so something that people may not be 
aware of.

634
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,580
When I say people,
I mean people in the mma community is 

635
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:49,861
that there's something else that really 
predisposes these fighters to nerve 

636
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,110
degenerative diseases.
Um,

637
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,180
so there's,
they categorize them as there's 

638
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,581
different ones like pugilistic dementia,
and then there's chronic traumatic 

639
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:01,630
encephalopathy.
And these are all,

640
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,390
if you look pathologically,
they all have,

641
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,420
they all share characteristics with 
Alzheimer's disease.

642
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:10,810
They all have these amyloid Beta plaques
that have accumulated in the brain.

643
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,810
They have Taupe,
protein aggregating,

644
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,210
there's,
you know,

645
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,700
inflammation,
massive atrophy happening because these 

646
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,091
things caused cell death.
These are all very common in their 

647
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,350
shared pathological features and all 
these neurogenic diseases.

648
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,130
I'm not sure what exactly if they see,
if they can't call it Alzheimer's 

649
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,040
because Alzheimer's is an age related 
disease,

650
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:38,041
so it's like calling someone who's 45 
and has massive amyloid plaques in their

651
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,360
brain and it's affecting their memory 
and it's affecting their behavior.

652
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,020
Calling that Alzheimer's is kind of 
weird because Alzheimer's,

653
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,940
just a limiting word.
Do you think you're winning because when

654
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:53,941
you're dealing with the exact same 
situation but brought on by trauma?

655
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,080
I don't know.
I,

656
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:01,090
I.
it's hard for me to definitively say 

657
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,090
that.
It's a speculation.

658
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,900
I think that looking at,
like I said,

659
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:06,490
I think these pugilistic dementia and 
these chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

660
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,150
it's like Alzheimer's,
but on an accelerated rate and it 

661
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,830
happened specifically as a consequence 
to traumatic injury to the head.

662
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,890
I've seen it happen in a fight like I've
seen a guy be one way and then have a 

663
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:25,981
fight and see noticeably diminished 
ability to communicate.

664
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,040
Yes.
Yeah.

665
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,210
That's one of the features of lack of 
oxygen to the brain because now you 

666
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:36,150
can't have energy,
you know,

667
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,800
be energy's not being made to have,
you know,

668
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:44,801
to,
to facilitate neurotransmission and 

669
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:47,861
memory,
like learning and things and 

670
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:49,511
communication.
Like what happens when you have inner 

671
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,460
injury is that everything gets diverted 
to repair its energy.

672
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,730
You only make so much energy and you 
know,

673
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,770
so it's a constant battle and this is 
the same for people that are obese type 

674
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,241
two diabetics,
whatever type of chronic injury that's 

675
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,110
happening in the body,
gut inflammation,

676
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:06,830
you know,
there's,

677
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,330
there's a lot of energy that need that's
required to repair that injury.

678
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,570
And so it's,
it's,

679
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,640
it's energy gets diverted to repairing 
that injury.

680
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:21,641
And what happens when you have all the 
energy that the cells are making go to 

681
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,400
repair well,
things that are,

682
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,600
you know,
normal function,

683
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,810
don't get it.
So your metabolism is kind of screwed 

684
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:28,810
up.
You're thinking,

685
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:28,810
you know,
these things are,

686
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:33,100
it's like a,
a triage almost where you're triaging 

687
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,560
this to the essential like I need to 
repair this damage.

688
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:35,540
If I don't repair this damage,
I might die.

689
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,460
So it's like you're shutting the energy 
to that repair process.

690
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:43,970
So things like short term memory,
communication,

691
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,300
all that sort of gets screwed up in a 
way.

692
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,570
So that makes perfect sense that,
that would happen.

693
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,660
Yeah.
Because I've literally seen guys in,

694
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,190
um,
it's,

695
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
it's,
it's so nonscientific to judge them by 

696
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,200
the standard because,
you know,

697
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,630
just my perceptions.
But I've seen a guy be one way and then 

698
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,820
have a couple of really brutal fights 
and then there's a noticeable dimness to

699
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:10,880
the way they look,
the way they talk.

700
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,370
They just,
there seems to be like a,

701
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,490
like a loss.
What timeframe are we talking about 

702
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:18,490
here?
A couple months.

703
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,440
Yeah.
Wow.

704
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,400
So,
I mean they've,

705
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,460
they've been shown that this injury,
the acute effects that I was describing 

706
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,780
in terms of like,
you know,

707
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:30,720
the immune system,
the immune cells in the brain,

708
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:35,721
the microglia getting aggravated and 
amyloid Beta plaques forming and all 

709
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:36,930
that stuff happens and they showed that 
this continues to happen for months,

710
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,840
even years later,
even with just a single,

711
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,470
like traumatic brain injury.
So

712
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,470
one rough fight can potentially effect 
of a person other than negative impacts.

713
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,340
Compounds

714
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,680
four years,
yes,

715
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,740
yes.
They have shown a dose dependent effect 

716
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,891
in terms of even multiple mild traumatic
injuries they compound over years and 

717
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,250
they cause pugilistic dementia.
They cause,

718
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,300
you know,
these types of neurodegenerative 

719
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,300
diseases that are very,
very similar to Alzheimer's.

720
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,500
And something that I want to point out 
that may predispose people to them more 

721
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,400
is genetics.
So this is something that's very,

722
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,120
very similar to Alzheimer's as well.
There's,

723
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:27,210
there's,
so we have different variations of genes

724
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,590
and these are called polymorphisms.
Really all a polymorphism is it's,

725
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,610
it's a gene,
but it's like it's,

726
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,810
there's a slight variation in the 
sequence of DNA and that slight 

727
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,701
variation in the sequence of DNA can 
change the function of that gene 

728
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:44,010
somewhat.
Um,

729
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,900
I think if we were to really look deeply
at polymorphisms,

730
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,960
we'd find there's gotta be a selective 
reason why we've acquired these sort of 

731
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,630
changes.

732
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:59,630
Like there's gotta be an advantage.
The polymorphisms aren't mutations in 

733
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,050
the sense where like a mutation is 
random,

734
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,580
you know,
that just happens.

735
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:05,560
Polymorphisms are selected for and they 
occur in a,

736
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:09,810
in a decent percent of the population.
So you know,

737
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,420
there seems to be like you can always 
find,

738
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,950
even if the gene changes the gene in the
sense where it seems like it's not doing

739
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:20,400
something as well as it should be doing.
If we look hard enough,

740
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:23,610
we might find there's actually a reason 
why there's sort of like a trade off,

741
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,950
right?
So anyway,

742
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:27,080
so gene polymorphisms or we've got,
you know,

743
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,720
these are very common ones.
People are always looking at things like

744
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,350
the breast cancer related genes like 
Brca one,

745
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,460
Brca two,
where it's like,

746
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,490
Oh,
if you have a certain variation of this 

747
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,400
gene,
you have a dramatic increase in possibly

748
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,240
getting breast cancer.

749
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,990
Well we've got a lot of different 
variations in genes and one of them is 

750
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,020
associated with a dramatic increased 
risk for Alzheimer's disease.

751
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,600
It's an engine called [inaudible] and 
this,

752
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,630
this gene is polymorphic in the sense 
where there's actually multiple bearing 

753
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,291
inside,
but there's three different isoforms of 

754
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:04,291
it that are common in the human 
population.

755
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,950
It's called [inaudible] two [inaudible],
three and April before.

756
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:13,450
And essentially what it's a,
it's a light bulb protein and it's,

757
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,650
it's made in the liver.
And also in the brain and the liver,

758
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,240
what it,
what its main function is.

759
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:23,241
It's actually transporting cholesterol 
like dietary cholesterol and it's making

760
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:26,880
sure it gets to your cells that need it 
and bringing it back to the liver to get

761
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:31,881
recycled.
So plays a very important role in 

762
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:32,730
cholesterol.
Transport turns out in the brain,

763
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,910
in our astrocytes are astrocytes,
make cholesterol.

764
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,600
We have,
we produce apo e in the brain and it 

765
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,721
plays a very important role in 
transporting this cholesterol made from 

766
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,720
astrocytes to neurons.

767
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,200
And it's it,
it's doing other things also involved 

768
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,670
with amyloid Beta.
But the point is is that there are,

769
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,140
like I said,
there are three variations.

770
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,950
The main one is apo e three and that's 
what the majority of population has.

771
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,370
So you get one every gene you have,
you get one copy from your mom and you 

772
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,780
get one copy from your dad.
So you have two copies of every gene.

773
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:12,290
And so that's when an illegal is.
So most people have two copies of April,

774
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:17,961
we three,
which is good because it's considered 

775
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:21,621
the normal one like but 25 percent of 
the population has one illegal of April.

776
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:27,900
We four.
And so April we four,

777
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,520
so 25 percent.
That's one in four.

778
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:34,521
People just have the general population 
has one of these illegals that they 

779
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,690
either got from their and their dad.
People that have to.

780
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,100
So they got one from this.

781
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,130
It's much more rare.
It's like two percent of the population 

782
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,130
actually have two copies of the apoe e 
four.

783
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,990
So 25 percent of population has one copy
of April before.

784
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,940
And what happens is April we for 
increases the risk of Alzheimer's by two

785
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,050
to three fold.
Okay.

786
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,740
So people that have April before have an
increased risk of just two to three 

787
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,431
fold.
And this is recognizable in the DNA 

788
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:02,740
tests.
So you could potentially scan athletes.

789
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,630
Yeah.
So I'm getting to that.

790
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,280
Yeah.
So exactly.

791
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,930
So people that are fighters that are,
or nfl players,

792
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,930
people that are any sort of trauma to 
the brain,

793
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,800
if they're getting this,
you know,

794
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,550
as a part of their sports curriculum or 
whatever,

795
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:24,090
those people that have won a but we for 
so traumatic brain injury itself 

796
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,980
increases the risk of Alzheimer's by two
to three fold,

797
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,130
just like people that don't have 
traumatic brain injury but have this 

798
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:32,130
April.

799
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,490
We for people that have Tbi and April 
before increase their risk by like 

800
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:39,280
tenfold.
So having just one Leo,

801
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:44,281
you'd have something,
you have a guy who's getting blows to 

802
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,501
the head and he has an April before he's
had taken his risks from two to three 

803
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,690
fold to tenfold to get.
Yes.

804
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:52,360
And we're talking 25 percent of the 
population has this.

805
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,840
So they've shown,
they've shown they've done studies and 

806
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:57,840
they've shown,
you know,

807
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,290
traumatic brain injury dramatically 
increases the risk of neurodegenerative 

808
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,050
disease.
It's also stroke people with a stroke,

809
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,200
stroke and have April before you're 
talking about a tenfold increase risk of

810
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,090
having a neurodegenerative disease.
So the problem is,

811
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:17,091
is that you're having before is you 
can't repair damage as well.

812
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,210
Uh,
you know,

813
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,160
when you're,
when you have damage that occurs,

814
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,400
you know,
there's a lot of repair mechanisms that 

815
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,700
can happen so you can have what's called
like if you lose,

816
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,190
like the synapses that are formed 
between the two neurons,

817
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:33,970
amyloid Beta screws that up,
but you can repair that damage by having

818
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,740
what's called neurite outgrowth.

819
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,290
So you grow new projections to that 
neuron.

820
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,860
That's one way to repair the damage and 
Aicpa we plays a very important role in 

821
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,920
that because it brings cholesterol and 
fatty acids to the neuron,

822
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,950
the membrane and that,
that's really important to be able to 

823
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,891
grow new synopsis.
You need that April before doesn't do 

824
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:56,860
that as well.
And also not only does April,

825
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:59,410
we've worn out do that as well.
There's also bad effects.

826
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:01,460
April we for itself,
um,

827
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,320
is,
it's the polymorphism that happens,

828
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:10,321
it changes the structure of it.
And so it's like getting degraded a lot 

829
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:13,651
so you don't have enough of a around and
it chops it up and starts aggregating 

830
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,760
and doing bad stuff itself.
So it's like,

831
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,850
it's just terrible because what happens 
when you have Tbi,

832
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:24,270
when you have an injury,
the brain actually increases a bowie 

833
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,270
because it's like,
oh,

834
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,630
I got to repair some damage,
but if you have that April week four,

835
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,210
it's increasing the bad part.

836
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,290
It's increasing,
you know,

837
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:33,530
the bad stuff.
So you can actually test for this,

838
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,010
this variant using 23 and me for 
example.

839
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,370
So I actually recently did a,
did a 23 and me test.

840
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:45,371
It's $99 and you spit and like a little 
tube and you send it off to the,

841
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,990
to the 23 and me and they,
you know,

842
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:52,490
isolate Dna from your saliva and then 
they look for very common polymorphisms.

843
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,060
So they look for April,
we,

844
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,410
they look for Parkinson's related ones 
are in cancer and all that.

845
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,340
So,
uh,

846
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,850
you know,
unfortunately the FDA shut down part of 

847
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,990
their ability to,
to inform you whether or not you have.

848
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,240
Yeah.
So that happened recently.

849
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:13,241
I think it was sort of a consequence to 
Angelina Jolie getting her boobs cut off

850
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,170
essentially.
Yeah.

851
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:19,540
So was that misinformed what she did?
Um,

852
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,060
so I'm unfortunately,
I haven't really read exactly how 

853
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,060
everything went down.

854
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,990
I just know that she did 23 and me and,
you know,

855
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,210
found out she had some,
she had a polymorphism and one of the 

856
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,210
genes,
but she didn't have cancer.

857
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,650
No,
no.

858
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,320
So yeah,
so that's a pro.

859
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,050
I think that sort of precipitated the 
FDA.

860
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,740
So the way they test for these genes is 
by something called PCR and it's,

861
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,720
it's,
it's not infallible,

862
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,740
so you can,
you know,

863
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,280
they can give you back your results and 
say oh look,

864
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:52,130
you've got this polymorphism is 
associated with x disease,

865
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:57,131
which increases your risk for cancer by 
tenfold and it could have just spend a 

866
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:58,430
little air in the methods.
So,

867
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,690
you know,
it's not like a full proof proof 

868
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,771
technique.
And I think that's also part of the 

869
00:43:05,771 --> 00:43:08,141
problem where it's like you're giving 
people back this genetic data and it's 

870
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:09,050
like they're taking it very seriously 
and obviously taking,

871
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:11,430
going to extreme measures to do things,
you know,

872
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,180
like,
like getting their boobs removed.

873
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,490
Um,
but you still can 23 enemies not shut 

874
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,491
down like you can.
Like I did it when they were already 

875
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:25,120
unable to give you,
I'm tell you exactly what polymorphisms 

876
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,610
you have.
Well,

877
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:29,330
I'm a scientist so I didn't really care 
because they'd give you the raw data and

878
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:34,331
I can actually go through the raw data,
which I did and see what polymorphisms I

879
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:39,050
have and I found out that I actually 
have one illegal of April before.

880
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,100
So,
so funny because it's really the only,

881
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,130
the only gene I cared about,
like all the other stuff.

882
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Like I,
I did 23 in me because I was terrified 

883
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,480
of having April before and um,
so I have it and if it turns out my dad 

884
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:57,650
gave it to me and my dad has it.
So,

885
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,610
uh,
you know,

886
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,070
like I said,
having a.

887
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:05,071
But we for just one to Lille of it is 
already you have a two to three fold 

888
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:05,690
increase risk for Alzheimer's.

889
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,960
If you look at people with Alzheimer's,
between 65 and 80 percent of them have 

890
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,660
one,
we'll have eight.

891
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,710
But we've for a.
So basically any person walking around 

892
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:20,450
with one Leo has about a 30 percent risk
of getting Alzheimer's.

893
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,230
And it really,
really has to do with your,

894
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,240
your environment,
the way you interact with,

895
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,330
with your environment,
that that's going to shift you either 

896
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,010
into getting it or not.
In what way?

897
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,050
Multiple ways.
Um,

898
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,580
so,
you know,

899
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,610
the,
the,

900
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,900
the April before is,
like I said,

901
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,480
it's not working well and one of the 
ways.

902
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,970
So amyloid Beta plaques building up in 
the brain,

903
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:48,180
whether you're talking about at an 
exponential rate because of injury,

904
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:53,181
traumatic injury to the brain.
We're talking about just normal brain 

905
00:44:53,181 --> 00:44:54,420
aging decades and decades and decades.
There's April,

906
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:59,421
we plays an important role in taking 
that amyloid Beta that's built up and 

907
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,990
bringing it to get degraded.

908
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,080
It gets rid of it.
But if you have ap,

909
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:09,081
we for it,
it just for some reason can't bind to 

910
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:09,081
the,
a Beta plaque as well.

911
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,240
And so it can't remove it.
So you're,

912
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:15,780
you're talking about people that are not
only accumulating more of it because,

913
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,010
uh,
you know,

914
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,540
of other things that we for is doing,
but they can't remove it as well.

915
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,430
So you know,
people that have to April,

916
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:28,431
we three's,
they've got a better mechanism of 

917
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:28,860
removing that amyloid Beta.
Well,

918
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,190
there's another way you can remove 
amyloid Beta from the brain and that's 

919
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,400
from getting sleep.
I'm literally so sleep when you sleep,

920
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:42,690
uh,
what happens is your brain actually 

921
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,801
swells because cerebral spinal fluid 
gets pushed up into the brain.

922
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:49,230
Your brain,
you have this whole glymphatic system,

923
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,660
you lymph vessels and things that are 
surrounding neurons and astrocytes and 

924
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:00,350
cerebral spinal fluid gets pushed into 
the brain when you sleep and it 

925
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,330
literally physically pushes out amyloid 
Beta plaques.

926
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,070
It removes amyloid Beta plaques and 
other dead debris.

927
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:10,710
Things like that just trashed.
That's building up in the brain.

928
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,890
Um,
and this is happening when you sleep.

929
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,670
So if you don't sleep,
if you're not getting enough sleep,

930
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,430
then you know,
people have this April we three,

931
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:22,020
that's another way they can clear it out
of the brain.

932
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:27,021
But me,
I really need to make sure I get enough 

933
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:27,021
sleep because,
you know,

934
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:30,780
I don't have that other repair mechanism
to get rid of the amyloid Beta plaques.

935
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:36,290
Has there been anything else?
Does it meditation or anything along 

936
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:36,290
those lines?
Um,

937
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,820
in terms of the glymphatic system,
I don't think that,

938
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:43,821
you know,
that seems to be a unique feature to 

939
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:43,821
sleep.
Um,

940
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:45,810
something that's happening when your,
you know,

941
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,790
especially particularly in when you're 
in rem sleep.

942
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,090
Um,
but you know why it's,

943
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,530
it's rem sleep is triggering it.

944
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:54,930
Yeah.
No,

945
00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:00,180
this is a new relatively new finding and
I think we're going to in this decade.

946
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,270
Oh yeah,
like new as in just a couple of years 

947
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:06,530
ago.
So it sounds so fascinating.

948
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,930
There's something so significant and 
important is 2012,

949
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,000
right?
It's,

950
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,260
there's,
the human brain is very complicated and 

951
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,260
there's lots of little,
you know,

952
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,300
people that are doing research.
They're looking at just little tiny 

953
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:22,300
aspect of this and this little,
you know,

954
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,570
because there's so many little details 
that you have to sort of interrogate to 

955
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,140
figure things out and how they're 
working.

956
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,840
But the glymphatic system is something 
that's really cool because it gives a 

957
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:38,050
mechanistic explanation as to why.
Another reason why sleep is so

958
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,380
important now.
Does nutrition play any part in your 

959
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,660
brain's ability to do this or to do to 
mitigate this issue?

960
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,190
Yeah,
so there's.

961
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:54,220
I mean nutrition plays a huge factor.
I mean if you look at people that are 

962
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,440
obese,
you know,

963
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,270
and slash or insulin resistance type two
diabetic,

964
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,530
these people also have an increased risk
for Alzheimer's disease and they have an

965
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:07,880
increased risk for a lot of age related 
disease.

966
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:12,881
I mean they're,
it's like they're accelerating their 

967
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:15,461
aging process in general,
but the fact that they also have an 

968
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:19,670
increased risk for Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's is very,

969
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,780
you know,
it's interesting because it suggests 

970
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,530
something about not having the right 
diet is also involved.

971
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,940
And there's multiple things going on 
here and you know,

972
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,860
I can't figure all of them out,
but you know,

973
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,920
part,
part of the reason is they've shown that

974
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,560
inflammation,
so obesity,

975
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:44,561
you've got chronic inflammation going on
also with type two diabetics and that 

976
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:49,541
inflammation actually causes a secretion
of like proinflammatory cytokines,

977
00:48:50,331 --> 00:48:51,520
which are,
you know,

978
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,650
the activate the immune system,
you know,

979
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,520
because that's what happens when the 
body is like,

980
00:48:55,521 --> 00:48:56,420
wait,
something's here.

981
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,510
That's not supposed to be.
Get rid of it and this is the same thing

982
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:04,511
that happens in the brain that causes 
the amyloid Beta plaques to start 

983
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:04,511
getting built up.
Well,

984
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,920
those things cross over at the blood 
brain barrier,

985
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,160
inflammatory cytokines,
crossover,

986
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,410
get into the brain and start causing 
neuroinflammation.

987
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,790
So it's really like they've even shown 
like if you inject,

988
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:22,450
you can inject people with endotoxin.
Endotoxin is what's like a part of the 

989
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,270
bacterial cell wall.
It's released,

990
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,630
you know,
when bacteria are dying and it happens 

991
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,211
in the gut a lot,
but it causes massive inflammation and 

992
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:37,900
you can inject people with endotoxin and
it causes learning and memory deficits 

993
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,450
and it causes depressive symptoms.
Um,

994
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:44,930
also you can inject them with a pro 
inflammatory cytokines,

995
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,960
interferon.
And that interferon also causes 

996
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,801
depressive symptoms because you know,
inflammation is being more and more 

997
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:58,031
linked to depression as well.
But also inflammation in the brain is 

998
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:02,610
actually causing the aggregation of 
these amyloid Beta plaques to occur.

999
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:07,730
So that's very interesting.
How literally inflammation in your body,

1000
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:08,960
in your gut,
you know,

1001
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,370
in the,
in the peripheral part of your body,

1002
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,550
your body can affect your brain.
It's your will.

1003
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:14,770
There's

1004
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,380
I there been sorted in revenue again,
but it haven't.

1005
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:22,390
There been some recent studies that have
shown that the gut bacteria have kids 

1006
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:25,030
that have Alzheimer's.
Is,

1007
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,780
is usually an issue that a lot of 
children that have Alzheimer's also have

1008
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:34,100
issues with gut bacteria like autism or.
What did I say?

1009
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,020
Alzheimer's.
I'm sorry.

1010
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:35,740
Yeah,
autism.

1011
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,400
We really,
you know what I'm saying?

1012
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,820
Literally where's it coming out?
Maybe I've been hitting the head too 

1013
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:42,820
many times.
Um,

1014
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,300
but yeah,
autism spectrum disorders and even 

1015
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,910
asperger's that there's been some sort 
of a connection to gut bacteria.

1016
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,780
Yeah,
yeah,

1017
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,790
definitely.
I mean these people with autism do have 

1018
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,440
a lot of inflammation in their gut and 
you know,

1019
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,810
having inflammation in your gut,
what's going to happen?

1020
00:50:56,811 --> 00:51:01,811
It's going to get into your brain and 
it's going to cause neuro inflammation 

1021
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:04,181
in your brain.
And another thing that inflammation in 

1022
00:51:04,181 --> 00:51:07,130
the brain does is it activates,
you know,

1023
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,520
the.
You've got prostoglandins that are being

1024
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:13,340
generated specifically eat two series 
prostoglandins.

1025
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:18,790
And the reason why that's bad in the 
brain is because generating [inaudible] 

1026
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,570
series prostoglandins inhibits the 
brain's ability to release serotonin.

1027
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,940
So you basically can't release serotonin
from like a presynaptic neuron,

1028
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:31,310
which is important and you want it,
you need to release Serotonin,

1029
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,940
serotonin during a lot of things in 
addition to regulating mood,

1030
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,050
regulating behavior,
regulating impulsive behavior,

1031
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,370
things like that,
social behavior,

1032
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:45,610
but you know this,
this inflammation that gets into the 

1033
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,060
brain literally stop Serotonin from 
being released from the brain by,

1034
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,490
by inhibiting this,
this.

1035
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,920
Sorry,
by activating the two series and they've

1036
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:56,921
even shown like that study I was talking
about people where they injected a pro 

1037
00:51:56,921 --> 00:52:00,461
inflammatory cytokine and they bake.
They had came down with depressive 

1038
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:05,000
symptoms if they gave those people epa 
like a very high dose of EPA.

1039
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,050
So I cone up Penta eicosapentaenoic 
acid,

1040
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:14,051
which is one of the Omega Threes that 
that mitigated the depressive symptoms 

1041
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:18,821
like they didn't get the depressive 
symptoms because I think that what's 

1042
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:20,360
happening is that inflammation is 
causing.

1043
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,800
One thing that EPA does very potent and 
potently inhibits the generation of

1044
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,920
approximate sentence.
So in that way,

1045
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,430
gut bacteria,
especially taking in in the form of 

1046
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,991
probiotics is probably a very important 
part of the human diet that is widely 

1047
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,350
ignored by a lot of people,
right?

1048
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,490
Yeah.
Acidophilus.

1049
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,180
You're drinking Kombucha here.
I love,

1050
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:49,270
I love my Kombucha.
But what I said to you that this is the 

1051
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,810
computer that's watered down so that it 
meets the whole food standards.

1052
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,550
No,
I had no idea that this.

1053
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,900
Did you get this at whole foods?
The one up the street.

1054
00:52:56,901 --> 00:53:01,901
They have the regular stuff too.
You gotta know what bottle to get and 

1055
00:53:01,901 --> 00:53:03,720
you need to have a license,
like a driver's license.

1056
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,790
It shows you're over 21,
but it's only one half of one percent.

1057
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,850
That's the cutoff.
If it's more than one half of one 

1058
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:12,920
percent alcohol by volume,
then you have to have.

1059
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,490
It has to have to have a liquor license 
to sell it,

1060
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:17,450
which is preposterous.
You can't get drunk off of it.

1061
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,580
No,
I had no idea that this was watered 

1062
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:22,580
down.
But yes,

1063
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,860
you know,
probiotics are very important.

1064
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,700
Um,
you know,

1065
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:28,230
you've,
you want.

1066
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,590
So probiotics are doing things like 
generating lactic acid,

1067
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:36,591
which are does a lot of things.
One is it's killing off these pathogenic

1068
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:41,670
bacteria that can't live in an acidic 
environment in the gut,

1069
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,490
but also like I mentioned,
lactate,

1070
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,910
you know,
lactates also can be used by 

1071
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:49,910
Mitochondria.
So you know,

1072
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,320
you're talking about giving a source of 
energy for your Mitochondria,

1073
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,610
you know,
so that you can,

1074
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,300
it an important component of not having 
a lot of gut inflammation is,

1075
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,050
yes,
the balance between pro biotics and,

1076
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,100
and the pathogenic bacteria.
But it's also maintaining that gut 

1077
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,200
barrier because you've got a lot of 
immune cells in your gut,

1078
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:18,290
you know,
they're there because you don't want to 

1079
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:18,290
eat something bad and you know,
kill you.

1080
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,490
So they're there and they're ready to,
you know,

1081
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,000
fight off anything that's potentially 
pathogenic.

1082
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,630
So they have a purpose of being there.
The way they don't continually,

1083
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,450
continually,
uh,

1084
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,710
start fighting off things is because 
there's a barrier which is basically a 

1085
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,020
mucous,
um,

1086
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,750
it's called mucin and your gut cells 
secrete it.

1087
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:44,990
And this mucin is important for 
separating the immune cells in your gut 

1088
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,221
from the bacteria.
Because when that mucin gets broken 

1089
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:51,861
down,
then your immune cells are exposed to 

1090
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:51,861
bacteria which are supposed to be in 
your gut,

1091
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:52,200
and they're like,
oh,

1092
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:57,201
bacteria.
And they start firing all these 

1093
00:54:57,201 --> 00:54:57,201
cytokines and you get,
you start to get inflammation,

1094
00:54:57,201 --> 00:55:01,611
which then breaks down the gut barrier 
more and it causes the same sort of 

1095
00:55:01,611 --> 00:55:01,890
cycle that I was talking about in the 
brain.

1096
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:06,891
You know,
this sort of cycles going on can happen 

1097
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:06,891
in the gut as well.

1098
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:08,560
So things like eating a lot of sugar,
you know,

1099
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,270
like can literally break down the Mucin,
uh,

1100
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,300
you know,
so it's like that's having that chronic 

1101
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,510
inflammation is I'm doing a lot of 
things.

1102
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:21,300
So having the right balance of bacteria 
is one thing that's good,

1103
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:26,240
but also making sure that you're eating 
the right diet to make sure that you're,

1104
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,520
you know,
you're giving yourself the right energy 

1105
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,471
they need to,
to do things that they're supposed to 

1106
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:33,471
do.
Like if it's,

1107
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:37,040
if we're talking about the gut making,
Mucin and sugar actually fuels bad 

1108
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,400
bacteria in the gut as well,
right?

1109
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,730
Yeah.
A sugar does feel bad bacteria in the 

1110
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,581
gut.
So a lot of the bad bacteria in the gut 

1111
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:48,441
like to get them some sugar.
So then you're talking about having 

1112
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:50,550
overgrowth of the bad bacteria,
you know,

1113
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:55,551
so it's,
there's a lot weakens your immune 

1114
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:55,551
system.

1115
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:55,551
Yes.
Sugar is significant.

1116
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:58,350
Immune system weakening inflammation in 
general.

1117
00:55:58,351 --> 00:56:00,480
I mean,
I think that also has a lot to do with,

1118
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,440
if you think about having,
you know,

1119
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:09,441
a breakdown of the gut barrier and all 
this pathogenic bacteria which also 

1120
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:11,940
break down the gut,
like that's what they do also.

1121
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:17,260
Um,
a lot of energy gets spent towards 

1122
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,120
fixing that,
fixing that,

1123
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,500
oh my God,
I got to fix that.

1124
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,860
I got to repair this.
And that takes away from brain phone.

1125
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,630
That takes away from Brent Stage Immune 
function because now you know,

1126
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,650
you're all,
the energy's going towards the gut to 

1127
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,200
repair this chronic damage that's also 
happening.

1128
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,330
And now you're,
your immune systems.

1129
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:37,270
Don't you know when,
when you're fighting off a disease,

1130
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,540
when you're fighting off a pathogenic,
you know,

1131
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,280
whether it's viral or bacterial or 
whatever,

1132
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,430
like that requires a massive amount of 
energy,

1133
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,660
massive amount of energy.

1134
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:51,660
That's an energy consuming process.
So it's a matter of triaging this energy

1135
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,830
to the right place.
It's like,

1136
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,460
okay,
well,

1137
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,260
you know,
if I,

1138
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:59,260
if my guts really healthy,
I'm not inflamed,

1139
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:01,630
I have a good diet,
I'm getting my micronutrients,

1140
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,840
I'm not eating a bunch of sugary crap,
you know,

1141
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,910
the refined carbohydrates and things 
like that.

1142
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,920
Then you know,
your,

1143
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,200
you don't have all this chronic damage 
happening that you,

1144
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,690
your,
your energy is constantly.

1145
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,970
It's like a drain,
an energy drain.

1146
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:18,340
It just keeps getting sucked into it and
that,

1147
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:23,341
you know,
that affects all sorts of other 

1148
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:23,341
functions in the body.
So,

1149
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:23,950
uh,
and there's other explanations,

1150
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:28,951
but I like to think about it that way in
terms of like a triaging of energy 

1151
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:31,720
because it really just makes a lot of 
sense from an energetic standpoint.

1152
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:36,721
Looking at how energetically consuming 
I'm fighting off diseases and how 

1153
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:39,730
energetically consuming repair is.

1154
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,610
And people that are obese or type two 
diabetic,

1155
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,760
they're in a constant repair state 
constant.

1156
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,820
So it's,
a lot of it is poor energy management 

1157
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,791
because of your diet,
because your energy is being taken away 

1158
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:59,101
to a bunch of functions that you 
wouldn't order ordinarily needed for if 

1159
00:57:59,101 --> 00:57:59,770
your diet was good.
Exactly,

1160
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:00,610
exactly.
Like,

1161
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:03,430
um,
it's really interesting the lab that I,

1162
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:04,930
uh,
that I work in.

1163
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,040
I'm at Children's Hospital in Oakland.
We work with a lot of insulin resistant,

1164
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,350
obese children,
um,

1165
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:17,770
but we're also doing research on 
adolescents and even some of the parents

1166
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:20,920
of these children which are also obese,
insulin resistant.

1167
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,200
Um,
and uh,

1168
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,900
some of my colleagues in my lab have 
developed a,

1169
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,930
like a nutrient bar,
they call it the core rebar and the 

1170
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,771
nutrient.
It's like a micronutrient dense bar 

1171
00:58:34,771 --> 00:58:34,771
where it has,
you know,

1172
00:58:34,771 --> 00:58:38,120
all sorts of vitamins and minerals and 
vitamin D and fiber has some 

1173
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,120
polyphenols.

1174
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,110
It has.
Dha has just a bunch of good stuff 

1175
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,880
instead of taking a bunch of vitamins,
it's all in like a matrix with fiber and

1176
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:48,340
stuff so that things are absorbed better
and digested.

1177
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,910
And,
um,

1178
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,290
you know,
my,

1179
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,590
my colleagues,
I haven't been directly involved in this

1180
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:55,960
research because I look more at things 
like dna damage,

1181
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:01,290
but what,
what my colleagues have found is that 

1182
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,021
giving these obese people,
whether we're talking about children or 

1183
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:09,000
adolescents,
adults giving them this micronutrient 

1184
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,000
bar,
um,

1185
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,661
if you compare like giving it to a lean 
person and you don't have them change 

1186
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:13,661
their diet at all,
it's like,

1187
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:14,440
you know,
do what you're going to do,

1188
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:15,700
eat,
eat what you're going to eat.

1189
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:17,620
But here,
take this twice a day on top of that.

1190
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,140
Um,
what we find is that one publication 

1191
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,250
that was done on lean people,
lean people like immediately it,

1192
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,930
their hdl goes up,
you know,

1193
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:27,710
things start happening.

1194
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,560
They make more glutathione,
like all these positive changes occur,

1195
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,350
but obese people,
it takes a lot longer to happen.

1196
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:41,490
Like it takes a couple of weeks.
Whereas I actually takes even more than 

1197
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:41,490
that.
Um,

1198
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,220
I don't remember the exact amount of 
time,

1199
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,460
but,
uh,

1200
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,340
it,
it takes longer to happen.

1201
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:49,430
We think it takes longer because these 
people first,

1202
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:51,020
all that energy that,
you know,

1203
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,160
this stuff,
the micronutrients,

1204
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,290
all these things,
it's,

1205
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,880
it's being shunted towards fixing,
fixing,

1206
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:01,080
and eventually as they start to fix,
then you start to see little changes 

1207
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,850
happening.
But it doesn't happen right away.

1208
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:06,851
Like it happens in people that are 
healthy and I use lean as a marker for 

1209
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:06,851
healthy.
I mean,

1210
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,240
it's not entirely accurate,
accurate,

1211
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:12,770
but generally speaking,
when exactly relatively speaking,

1212
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,710
glutosiome do you take glutathione 
supplement?

1213
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:17,960
Um,
no,

1214
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:22,610
so that actually I wanted to talk about 
some of the possible,

1215
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,500
you know,
Tbi,

1216
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,800
we're talking about traumatic brain 
injury and I talked about all this 

1217
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,470
terrible stuff,
but there are things that can be done to

1218
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:30,830
help.

1219
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:35,400
Um,
and glutathione is interesting because,

1220
01:00:35,401 --> 01:00:40,010
so glutathione is,
it's one of the major antioxidant in the

1221
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,830
brain,
which is why it's very important,

1222
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,450
um,
you know,

1223
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:47,180
as,
as for for brain aging in general,

1224
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:52,181
and it's all been associated with a lot 
of studies in terms of the more 

1225
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:52,620
glutathione in the brain,
you know,

1226
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,730
decreased Alzheimer's,
decreased damage in the brain going on.

1227
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,380
Um,
you know,

1228
01:00:57,381 --> 01:01:02,381
glutathione is just basically three 
amino acids that are together and it's 

1229
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:04,460
glutamic acid,
glycine,

1230
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:09,490
and I think assisting,
so our body makes this inside of 

1231
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:10,190
ourselves.
We make it,

1232
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,280
we have an enzyme called Glutathione 
synthase and that enzyme takes those 

1233
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,560
amino acids and puts it together.
And then once we have glutathione,

1234
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:22,570
we have other enzymes that are able to 
use glutathione as a potent antioxidant.

1235
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,000
Glutathione Peroxidase,
for example,

1236
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:31,001
this is another enzyme that uses that 
glutathione to prevent that reactive 

1237
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:34,220
oxygen species damage I was talking 
about that happens like one of the early

1238
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:39,221
events with traumatic brain injury and 
it's also one of the early damaging 

1239
01:01:39,221 --> 01:01:40,460
events that happens just with normal 
brain aging,

1240
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,020
which is happening all the time.

1241
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,460
We're making it right now in our brains.
Um,

1242
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:45,910
so,
uh,

1243
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:51,130
having gludethyon in the brain is really
good and there's different enzymes that 

1244
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:51,130
use it.
So Glutathione Peroxidase,

1245
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,650
we'll use glutathione to,
um,

1246
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:59,050
to basically reduce that oxidative 
damage so it can't damage the neuron or 

1247
01:01:59,050 --> 01:01:59,930
astrocyte or whatever,
you know,

1248
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:02,490
cell type that it comes in contact with.
Um,

1249
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:07,510
the problem is that with age,
we decrease the expression of 

1250
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,620
glutathione related genes and what that 
means is,

1251
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:14,940
you know,
you have genes in your body and 

1252
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,740
sometimes they can be expression just 
means you make more of it.

1253
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:17,450
So when you're,
when it's being expressed,

1254
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,380
you're making more of it.
So that's a thing.

1255
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,800
As we age,
we decrease the expression,

1256
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:27,801
so like everything,
things fall apart and we don't make as 

1257
01:02:27,801 --> 01:02:28,630
much of these glutathione related genes.
Um,

1258
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,400
the thing with glutathione is you can't 
because it's made in ourselves.

1259
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,440
There's no transport mechanism to get 
glutathione into the cell,

1260
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,890
like you know,
you,

1261
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,900
you,
you can transport it in immuno acids and

1262
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,960
the amino acids.
Then this glutathione synthase uses 

1263
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,691
those to make it in the cell,
but there's no transport mechanism for 

1264
01:02:50,691 --> 01:02:54,500
glutamic acid,
glycine and sustained together to get 

1265
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:54,500
in.
And,

1266
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:54,510
you know,
you can't just,

1267
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,780
cells have a transport mechanism to get 
stuff inside.

1268
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,850
It's a regulated process.
Um,

1269
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:04,851
so taking glutathione orally a is sort 
of pointless.

1270
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,850
Not to mention the fact that the guy 
isn't going to absorb it,

1271
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,710
either.
It gets broken apart.

1272
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,550
Um,
there is lyposomal glutathione.

1273
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,480
Yeah,
so Lyposomal,

1274
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:19,420
Glutathione,
um,

1275
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:24,650
anything that's Lyposomal can bypass a 
lot of these transport mechanisms just 

1276
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,370
based on,
you know,

1277
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:27,570
the way.
So first of all,

1278
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:32,571
liposomes can be absorbed by the gut but
also they can get into cells because a 

1279
01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:35,430
lyposomal is basically like,
you know,

1280
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:40,431
it's like a little liquid that has a 
fascial liquid by layer and it has 

1281
01:03:40,431 --> 01:03:40,620
whatever it has inside of it,
in this case,

1282
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:45,621
glutathione which is soluble and it 
fuses with the Lipid biolayer of the 

1283
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:48,090
cell membrane and basically just gets 
taken up.

1284
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,340
And so then whatever's inside of it goes
into the cell.

1285
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,630
They've shown in.
I've looked for studies to see,

1286
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:00,020
you know,
lyposomal supplemental Lyposomal 

1287
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,990
Glutathione.
Like how I like is it getting into 

1288
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:02,990
tissue,
is it getting into the brain,

1289
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:06,081
for example,
because that's important and I haven't 

1290
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:07,050
found a lot of studies.
I found one study that showed in rabbits

1291
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:12,051
that were given oral glutathione,
oral liposomal glutathione were able to 

1292
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:15,480
increase the glutathione levels in their
brain,

1293
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:16,860
in their heart and also in the liver.

1294
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,570
But they were given a massive dose.
Like they were given 400 milligrams.

1295
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:26,630
And there are about 11 pounds,
so that's like six grams for like 180 

1296
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,820
pound man.
Four hundred milligrams in the physical 

1297
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,300
form.
Like what would you see?

1298
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:34,620
Is it,
would it be,

1299
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:37,390
how many teaspoons would that be for 
row?

1300
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:38,620
Oh,
I don't.

1301
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,230
I don't know.
I mean you'd have to look at.

1302
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,590
I think if it's in a teaspoon,
it tells you the like milligram content 

1303
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:49,371
per teaspoon.
I did look up online to see because I 

1304
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:49,371
was like,
I got to gave me some of this.

1305
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:53,720
And um,
the problem is that most of the 

1306
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:58,010
liposomal glutathione is really 
expensive and it's like between 100 

1307
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,990
milligrams and 400 milligrams per dose,
per teaspoon or per capsule,

1308
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:04,130
whatever they do to a rabbit.
They gave write a law.

1309
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,850
But a rabbit weighs 11 pounds.
Swallows it too.

1310
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,300
Aren't you supposed to hold it in your 
mouth?

1311
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:10,880
Under your tongue.
Now they're,

1312
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,420
they,
they,

1313
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:13,260
they enjoy.
They give it to the,

1314
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,900
to the rabbit.
Like they inject it in their mouth.

1315
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,960
Yeah.
And the way I've been told to take the 

1316
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,181
lyposomal glutathione is to Tuck it 
under your tongue or shorter under your 

1317
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:27,751
tongue,
holding your mouth for 30 seconds and 

1318
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:27,751
then swallow it.
Does that make any sense at all?

1319
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:29,560
And now I have no idea how that,
what that would do,

1320
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:31,540
but the idea of being.
Sorry,

1321
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,130
go ahead.
No,

1322
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:37,131
I mean the point is,
is that you supplement like Lyposomal 

1323
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:40,800
Glutathione,
maybe actually you may be getting it 

1324
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,231
into your brain.
It's just a matter of how much is it 

1325
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:47,220
they didn't do a dose response in that 
study and if it wasn't so darn 

1326
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,851
expensive,
there's other ways to increase 

1327
01:05:50,851 --> 01:05:50,851
glutathione.
But here's the thing.

1328
01:05:50,851 --> 01:05:52,450
So taking supplemental glutathione in 
the form of Lyposomal Glutathione,

1329
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:57,470
of course,
any other supplemental glutathione is 

1330
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:57,470
just useless.
Yeah,

1331
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:57,970
it's useless pill form.
Nothing.

1332
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,240
I think they have liposome.
You can have it in pill form with 

1333
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:03,240
letrozole.
Yeah.

1334
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,680
But it just has to be.
Light is almost the point,

1335
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,480
right?
Yeah.

1336
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:10,870
If it's not lyposomal then you're not 
even getting it passed the gut let alone

1337
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:12,380
into the cell.
So,

1338
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,400
um,
but the other thing is,

1339
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:15,940
is that,
okay,

1340
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:18,440
so here's the thing,
your suppliers,

1341
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,730
your yourselves with this lyposomal 
glutathione,

1342
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:26,940
but the thing is,
is that the enzyme that uses 

1343
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,401
glutathione,
glutathione peroxidase and these other 

1344
01:06:29,401 --> 01:06:29,401
enzymes,
they decreased with age.

1345
01:06:29,401 --> 01:06:31,400
So while you're bypassing the,
you know,

1346
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,660
the decrease in the expression of 
Glutathione synthase,

1347
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:40,110
which is what makes glutathione,
you're not bypassing the decrease in 

1348
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:43,960
expression of this enzyme that uses it,
that's using gludethyon to do its thing.

1349
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,410
So that's also important and there's 
other ways that you can actually 

1350
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:52,180
increase glutathione.
But just interestingly,

1351
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,110
I came across a study recently,
like 2014,

1352
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,330
very late,
I think it was even just a couple months

1353
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:59,290
ago.
It was,

1354
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:04,291
um,
a traumatic brain injury study where 

1355
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,971
they basically took mice and they 
induced traumatic brain injury by like 

1356
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:11,310
putting pressure on their brain.
And what happens is they noticed that 

1357
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:16,070
the blood brain barrier is compromised.
All those things that I was talking 

1358
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:18,451
about happens.
Water's flowing into the brain and saw 

1359
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,140
you and all that and activation of 
immune function.

1360
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:25,141
All that stuff's happening.
What they found was that if they put 

1361
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:25,141
glutathione,
they actually,

1362
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:30,180
because I did a pressure now schools are
much thinner than a human's goals are 

1363
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:30,850
and if they did a pressure room to the 
mouse school,

1364
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:35,020
there was like a little tiny crack in 
the skull and they could put glutathione

1365
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:40,170
on top topically where the crack is and 
it would get through into the brain and 

1366
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:44,200
what they found was that if they did it 
within three hours of the injury,

1367
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:49,590
they,
they abrogated like 70 percent of the 

1368
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:49,590
cell death.

1369
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:51,580
That happens.
It was amazing,

1370
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,120
but it was a three hour time window 
because there will be done the humans.

1371
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,650
So I was wondering,
well,

1372
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:59,650
so the thing that's what got me on this 
whole episomal trail,

1373
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:00,970
I was like,
well we can't.

1374
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
First of all,
we don't even know anything about the 

1375
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,040
human skull.
I mean we know about it,

1376
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:11,041
but we don't know whether or not you can
put something topically after a 

1377
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,520
traumatic injury and if it's going to 
get in there doing those studies.

1378
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:13,210
Now,
because this was.

1379
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,230
This was actually a new discovery where 
it's like,

1380
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,100
Oh wow,
you can

1381
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,160
actually get through the skull and get 
into the,

1382
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,800
at least under an injury's type 
situation.

1383
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,860
So the idea would be that you would 
inject something into the skin on the 

1384
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:28,610
scalp.
Um,

1385
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,290
I don't know if they injected it,
but yeah,

1386
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:35,530
that go under the French,
the end of the needle.

1387
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,030
But whether or not that can be done in 
humans,

1388
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,020
I don't know.
Like I said,

1389
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,800
I mean,
first of all,

1390
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:41,820
humans have a much thicker skull then 
then.

1391
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,670
So.
Right.

1392
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:44,300
But,
um,

1393
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,090
so they're going to be testing that.
But the other thing is,

1394
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:47,600
is like,
okay,

1395
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:52,601
well can you.
The key part of this study and my mind 

1396
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:55,220
was they inhibited that reactive oxygen 
species,

1397
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,140
which is the instigator of this whole 
cascade,

1398
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:05,141
this neuroinflammatory,
if they went downstream and try to 

1399
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:05,141
inhibit,
inhibit inflammation,

1400
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,100
it didn't have the effect because those 
things were already activated.

1401
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:12,310
You already had sell dead cells because 
it's the reactive oxygen species 

1402
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:12,380
starting it and causing the cell death.

1403
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:17,380
And that was how they were able to 
prevent like 70 percent of the cell 

1404
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:17,510
death by giving that topical 
Glutathione.

1405
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,360
So,
uh,

1406
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,360
that was,
it was like,

1407
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:25,361
wow,
well we've got to figure out how to do 

1408
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:25,361
that.
Yeah,

1409
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:25,361
exactly.
And so,

1410
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:25,730
uh,
the,

1411
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,610
there's other ways you can increase 
glutathione.

1412
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,330
The light is almost one.
I don't know how robust,

1413
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:34,340
like I said,
with that one study in rabbits,

1414
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,640
massive amount.
We're talking about like for 180 pound 

1415
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,851
man.
And I don't even know how much some of 

1416
01:09:42,851 --> 01:09:42,851
these MMA fighters were.
They probably weighed more than that.

1417
01:09:42,851 --> 01:09:43,940
But you know,
180 pound man,

1418
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:46,580
he's talking about six grams of 
Liposomal Glutathione,

1419
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:48,780
which is a lot significant amount.
I mean,

1420
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,690
considering how much,
how costly is,

1421
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:54,440
it's just not economically feasible in 
my mind on these.

1422
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,940
The holding it under the tongue I've 
seen will be 12 of.

1423
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:00,360
That's okay.

1424
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,320
Make sense?
It'd be 12 people.

1425
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:07,730
It's sublingual that people do that to 
bypass the whole stomach acid thing.

1426
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:09,320
But you know,
I don't know,

1427
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:14,321
maybe there's something I just don't 
know about with the Liposomal 

1428
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:14,860
Glutathione.
Sublingual means what,

1429
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:19,861
what does that actually mean?
That means holding it in under the 

1430
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:19,861
tongue is just the distribution method.
Right?

1431
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:25,270
So to use lyposomal and use it in a 
sublingual way to Tuck in under.

1432
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,420
Does that make any sense?
Would it go into your blood that way?

1433
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,970
Um,
I mean,

1434
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:34,700
I don't know why it would be any 
different than swallowing it,

1435
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:40,390
but don't waste my time.
I would just be not thinking about 

1436
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:44,340
something that's obvious to me or,
or it's just always time.

1437
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:48,680
There've been studies on that light bulb
will be 12 taken sublingually.

1438
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:52,820
I haven't really read any.
There may have been studies on that,

1439
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:57,821
but I haven't,
I haven't looked in the literature of 

1440
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:57,821
that.

1441
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:57,821
I'll look it up right now.
Yeah.

1442
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,830
So the other ways to increase.
So like I mentioned,

1443
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:05,831
so there's,
there's genes that are glutathione 

1444
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:07,810
related genes and you can increase the 
expression of those genes were right 

1445
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:11,141
away.
Sublingual lyposomal glutathione shows 

1446
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:11,420
up in the first thing that you,
uh,

1447
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:17,290
you google.
If you Google sublingual lyposomal 

1448
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,290
glutathione is the first thing that pops
up in Google.

1449
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1450
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:27,620
Well,
that's something I can certainly read 

1451
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:27,620
about,
but I just off the top of my head,

1452
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:33,080
can't think of why that would be more 
effective at getting into yourself 

1453
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:37,440
saying right here,
the only way to get significant amounts 

1454
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,760
into your body is with lyposomal 
glutathione supplements.

1455
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:44,410
Uh,
either ivy or injection is the other 

1456
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:44,410
way.
Yeah.

1457
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:45,870
Yeah.
Injections another way.

1458
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,270
And that all obviously bypasses the 
whole intestinal absorption thing.

1459
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,100
Yeah.
So what's interesting is they've done so

1460
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,780
other ways to increase glutathione would
be,

1461
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,060
for example,
a turmeric.

1462
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,740
Turmeric.
Turmeric,

1463
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,790
yeah.
I use that stuff.

1464
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:03,990
That's awesome.
Well,

1465
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:05,070
they've shown.
So the,

1466
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:10,190
there,
there's two different bioactive 

1467
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,141
components in it.
One is the curcumin and that has.

1468
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:14,040
What that does,
curcumin is,

1469
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,300
first of all,
it's awesome.

1470
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:20,301
It gets into the brain and it's an anti,
has antioxidant activity itself aside 

1471
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:25,911
from Gludethyon,
but it also increases the expression of 

1472
01:12:25,911 --> 01:12:30,471
all the good design related genes.
So it turns on Glutathione Peroxidase,

1473
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:35,991
glutathione synthase,
and another gene called Glutathione 

1474
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:39,560
reductase,
which actually recycles glutathione 

1475
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,271
that's already been used or oxidized,
which is really cool because now you're 

1476
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:43,620
talking about ramping up the whole 
glutathione system.

1477
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:44,890
Like all of it,
and,

1478
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,810
and this curcumin does this.
Um,

1479
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,240
and so there was a,
they've done studies in mice where 

1480
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,691
they've done know,
Tbi related studies for traumatic brain 

1481
01:12:56,691 --> 01:12:56,691
injury where they've,
they've given them,

1482
01:12:56,691 --> 01:13:01,470
they did intravenous and because of the,
the effects of,

1483
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,370
you know,
you,

1484
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,710
you basically metabolize curcumin 
immediately.

1485
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:09,830
Um,
it's like 40 minutes to an hour to say 

1486
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,470
curcumin or cirque human.
I always Kirk Hubert human.

1487
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,470
Yeah.
I know I've said it wrong.

1488
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,560
What do you usually say?
Human.

1489
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,210
Oh,
now I think it's curcumin.

1490
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,380
Yeah.
Just read it and try to understand.

1491
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:24,250
Oh really?
Wow.

1492
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:30,100
So America have heard,
but the actual turmeric to Merck termer 

1493
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,900
tumor,
I think there's an art.

1494
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:32,190
She,
you are turmeric.

1495
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,420
Turmeric.
Yeah.

1496
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:38,820
But whatever.
It's not important to get good stuff.

1497
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,020
Yeah.
It's like curries,

1498
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:41,280
you know,
people using the curries,

1499
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:45,070
but it's sort of antiinflammatories not 
only anti-inflammatory,

1500
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,460
it inhibits the activation of nf kappa 
b,

1501
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:52,461
which is like this gene that turns on a 
whole variety of different genes 

1502
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:57,021
involved in inflammation.
So it's like blunting the whole 

1503
01:13:57,021 --> 01:13:59,140
inflammatory cascade and it activates 
all the glutathione genes.

1504
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,570
And on top of that,
it has antioxidant activity itself,

1505
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:04,360
so it's like,
you know,

1506
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,990
it's just like a triple whammy.
So it's really cool.

1507
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:11,060
So curcumin is probably way better than 
taking lyposomal glutathione,

1508
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,980
I don't know,

1509
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,150
because maybe in synergistic for 
synergistic.

1510
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:21,151
But the thing with Kirk curcumin is that
it is also rapidly metabolized because 

1511
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:22,350
it's a form it says,
you know,

1512
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:27,360
biotic,
which means it's not a vitamin or a 

1513
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:27,360
mineral,
it's something foreign to the body,

1514
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,170
you know,
polyphenols,

1515
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,500
EGC,
gds from green tea,

1516
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:32,150
all these things were the same.
A lot of herbal academia,

1517
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:37,500
these are what are called xenobiotics.
And what happens when you take a 

1518
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,310
xenobiotic is it activates this whole 
pathway in the liver,

1519
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,440
which is like the liver is like,
oh,

1520
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:44,350
there's this foreign thing in my body 
that's not supposed to be here.

1521
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,550
It's not a vitamin,
it's not a mineral.

1522
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:46,900
Okay,
I need to get rid of it.

1523
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,810
So it metabolize it's detoxifying,
whatever.

1524
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:50,910
So,
um,

1525
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:56,130
it gets metabolized rapidly.
But there's something in black pepper 

1526
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:58,030
called piperine.
Piperine.

1527
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:03,031
Yeah.
That inhibits the nobody xenobiotic 

1528
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:03,031
metabolism.

1529
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,690
So it's been shown in humans that if you
give a coworker curcumin and piperine 

1530
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:13,530
that you can increase the 
bioavailability of curcumin by 2000 

1531
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:15,820
percent in humans,
which is pretty significant.

1532
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,100
And so that's kind of cool because I'm 
like,

1533
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:23,130
oh,
well of course I ordered some curcumin 

1534
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:26,011
with piperine and a tick for myself 
because I've got April before and it's 

1535
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,960
just a really good thing.
Um,

1536
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,730
but with traumatic brain injury they've 
shown that,

1537
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,800
you know,
if they gave it to a,

1538
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:36,160
to mice to do it intravenously and they 
give them like a really high dose,

1539
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,670
it prevents,
you know,

1540
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,000
the whole inflammatory response to the 
edema.

1541
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:45,240
Intercranial pressure,
like all that stuff is dramatically 

1542
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,120
improved.
And this is again,

1543
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:48,010
it's like a time window where it was 
like,

1544
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,190
you know,
a few hours after the trauma,

1545
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,050
after the trauma.
So it's,

1546
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,850
you know,
but I think maybe even before,

1547
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:57,490
if you're already,
if you already have it in your system,

1548
01:15:57,491 --> 01:16:00,280
you know,
the question is how much is it,

1549
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,180
is it going to like,
you know,

1550
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,770
prevent the acute immediate thing.

1551
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:09,340
I don't know to what degree,
but at least at the very least taking it

1552
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:14,341
every day,
you're talking about inhibiting some of 

1553
01:16:14,341 --> 01:16:15,310
that neuroinflammatory cycle,
that cycle.

1554
01:16:15,311 --> 01:16:16,470
That's really,
you know,

1555
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,850
vicious because once you have the 
plaques forum,

1556
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:22,360
which happens within hours after injury,
then you're talking about,

1557
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:27,680
you know,
it activating the whole cycle where it 

1558
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:27,680
causes more and more years and years and
years.

1559
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,060
So there's no negative repercussions to 
take my other stuffing their.

1560
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:35,540
Yeah.
So in that study where they increased 

1561
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:35,980
the bioavailability by 2000 percent,
there was no adverse side effects.

1562
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:41,250
However,
since piperine inhibits xenobiotic 

1563
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,190
metabolism,
full force,

1564
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:43,470
like you know,
it's,

1565
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,500
it's inhibiting this very generalized 
pathway that's used to detoxify and get 

1566
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,270
rid of all sorts of foreign things.
Like even drugs like antibiotics,

1567
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,230
whatever,
you know,

1568
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:54,640
your stands,
whatever you take.

1569
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,050
I'm so,
there is a concern like in my mind,

1570
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:01,300
I haven't done a lot of reading on this,
you know,

1571
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:06,301
to see what's out there in literature,
but just from my understanding of the 

1572
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:10,171
mechanism,
I think it's you don't want to go crazy 

1573
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:12,661
because it's like if you're taking a 
bunch other stuff because it's going to 

1574
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,060
increase the,
the half life of all sorts of,

1575
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:19,090
you know,
other xenobiotics which are just like I 

1576
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:22,031
said,
a lot of different herbal things or you 

1577
01:17:22,031 --> 01:17:22,031
know,
things like curcumin and UGC,

1578
01:17:22,031 --> 01:17:22,430
all that stuff.

1579
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,860
So there's always that potential.
It's like,

1580
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:28,100
well what else are you taking?
Are you increasing the half life of that

1581
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:32,120
too by taking this piperine with it and 
what does that doing?

1582
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:37,540
So that's it.
You should definitely be cautious in 

1583
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:37,540
that,
in that respect.

1584
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,680
But don't take too much of it.
But yet I haven't seen too much of it.

1585
01:17:39,681 --> 01:17:43,220
Like I know when I did some searching 
for like the Tumeric,

1586
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:48,221
but the thing is is that I like the 
tumeric and not just the curcumin 

1587
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:51,701
because there's another compound in 
turmeric called tomorrow and aromatic 

1588
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:58,780
turnaround and a study just came out 
like a couple of months ago on this 

1589
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,650
where it's actually,
it does.

1590
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,800
It does a lot of the same things that 
the curcumin does and that it inhibits 

1591
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,821
inflammation,
but it does something in addition to 

1592
01:18:09,821 --> 01:18:10,940
that,
it actually repairs brain damage because

1593
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,970
it causes the proliferation of neural 
stem cells in your brain.

1594
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,890
So I know it's like.
And it was very robust.

1595
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:23,891
There's,
there's two regions of the brain that 

1596
01:18:23,891 --> 01:18:24,650
you can actually.
You have neuro stem cells,

1597
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,790
which means you can make new neurons.
You've damaged neurons,

1598
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,290
neurons have died,
you know,

1599
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:35,291
you want to replace those neurons and 
there's two regions of the brain that 

1600
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:38,621
can do that.
The sub brand tricolor zone and the 

1601
01:18:38,621 --> 01:18:40,931
dentate gyrus.
And so tomorrow actually causes the 

1602
01:18:40,931 --> 01:18:43,820
polyphony ration of neural stem cells in
the sub ventricular zone.

1603
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:47,090
And to some degree when they're giving 
these mice.

1604
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:48,830
I can't recall off the top of my head 
the dose,

1605
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:53,831
but they were giving him a pretty high 
dose and what they found was that it 

1606
01:18:53,831 --> 01:18:54,440
increased the proliferation of them by 
like,

1607
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,450
you know,
60 percent,

1608
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:01,460
which is pretty significant.
A part of the problem with age is that,

1609
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:03,590
uh,
these neuro stem cells,

1610
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:09,130
they start to proliferate less and as 
they start to proliferate less than you 

1611
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:13,670
have less of them being made and you 
also have less a new neurons being made.

1612
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:18,670
So net less neurogenesis.
So if you think about in the context of 

1613
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,160
someone who's undergone a traumatic 
brain injury,

1614
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:24,410
they have undergone,
they've had massive amounts of cell 

1615
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:24,950
death occurring from that reactive 
oxygen species from that inflammation.

1616
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,720
You know,
they've lost neurons.

1617
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:27,290
That's,
that's,

1618
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:32,370
that's a fact.
So if you can have something that's 

1619
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,020
boosting the proliferation of their 
neuro stem cells,

1620
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:38,410
that's a great thing.
It's not just a great thing for people 

1621
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:38,870
that have had an injury.
It's a great thing for just normal brain

1622
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:40,020
aging.
Um,

1623
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:45,160
I think it's also a great thing for 
people that are susceptible to 

1624
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,720
neurogenic diseases like myself,
because I have one of these April,

1625
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:48,910
we four wheels,
you know,

1626
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,310
so I'm,
you know,

1627
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:54,230
I've got to be really careful because I 
can't repair damage as well.

1628
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:57,590
If I can make sure I grow new neurons,
then you know,

1629
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,150
that's,
that's a good thing.

1630
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,610
I didn't know there was anything that 
you could eat.

1631
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,100
The could help grow new neurons.
I'd never heard of it.

1632
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,660
Yeah.
So tomorrow is,

1633
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,980
stimulates,
stimulates the,

1634
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,250
of

1635
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:11,580
the neuro stem cells in the suburban 
Tricolor zone.

1636
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,470
Um,
this,

1637
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,990
this study was really came out like less
than two months ago.

1638
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,970
That's incredible.
It's pretty incredible.

1639
01:20:17,971 --> 01:20:20,070
Yeah.
I'm so you could get smarter for meeting

1640
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,270
today.
They did get smarter.

1641
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,880
They had improvements.
Now,

1642
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,960
I mean take this with a grain of salt in
the sense where it's like the whole 

1643
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:29,790
bioavailability thing and humans and how
much are we.

1644
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,770
That's always the issue.
It's like,

1645
01:20:31,771 --> 01:20:33,420
okay,
well they're giving mount mice,

1646
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:36,870
you know,
a much higher dose and you know,

1647
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,960
so that it's like bypassing,
first of all they're injecting it in 

1648
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,930
some cases so it's bypassing the whole 
getting absorbed.

1649
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:46,800
But the fact that it occurs is hopeful 
because it's like,

1650
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:51,801
well eventually we'll find a way to 
overcome some of the bioavailability 

1651
01:20:51,801 --> 01:20:51,801
issues,
which,

1652
01:20:51,801 --> 01:20:52,740
you know,
we kind of are.

1653
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:57,820
So is the Bio availability issue 
mitigated it all by a large dose is 

1654
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,750
taking,
what do you recommend as a dose?

1655
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:04,530
Like a thousand milligram pills or what 
I have of turmeric?

1656
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,560
Well in the case of the Mouse Studies,
it's mitigated by a large dose that's 

1657
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,500
given intravenously.
So I need to start shooting.

1658
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,370
So you don't have,
but how do you shoot up turmeric?

1659
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:14,940
Yeah,
I,

1660
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:17,190
you know,
I don't know.

1661
01:21:17,191 --> 01:21:17,670
I,
and,

1662
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:19,380
and the question is they bought up your 
book,

1663
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:23,730
the suppository.
They have clinical trials that are,

1664
01:21:23,731 --> 01:21:28,620
they're doing now with people with 
Alzheimer's or people that have dementia

1665
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:29,250
early,
you know,

1666
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:34,280
early dementia science.
They're doing this with a tumeric and I 

1667
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,810
hope they use piperine also are using 
depositories or there might just,

1668
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:42,330
I don't know,
I don't know what they're using because 

1669
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:42,330
a lot of studies have come out recently 
in a different,

1670
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:46,101
in different model organisms where 
they've looked at worms and flies and 

1671
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,060
mice and they're and they have all these
different neurodegenerative,

1672
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:50,610
you know,
sort of models where they look and study

1673
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:55,140
this stuff and they find hands down this
tumeric is doing some cool shit.

1674
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,400
Like it's,
it's awesome.

1675
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:01,550
And these studies are the administering 
it orally or the using injectables if 

1676
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:07,910
talking about mice then there's a lot of
them have been injectable and this is 

1677
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,060
where the studies are coming out.
So these aren't on humans yet,

1678
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,660
but they did get smarter.
The people that they did it to,

1679
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,280
that got smarter.
They did.

1680
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:17,370
So the people and that,
those were mice.

1681
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:22,550
The mice get smarter,
the mouse performed better on learning 

1682
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,550
and memory.
Yes,

1683
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,550
yes.
Yes.

1684
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:23,730
So,
but let's see,

1685
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:28,731
what was the other.
There was another interesting thing 

1686
01:22:28,731 --> 01:22:28,731
about the.
Oh,

1687
01:22:28,731 --> 01:22:30,540
I know what I wanted to bring up.
It was,

1688
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:34,350
I got sort of sidetracked when I was 
talking about the neural stem cells that

1689
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:39,351
are in the brand tricolor zone.
What's really interesting about this is 

1690
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:39,351
that they,
um,

1691
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:44,090
they readily go to the olfactory bulb,
no smell,

1692
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:49,100
so their sense of smell is a good 
predictor of Alzheimer's disease and 

1693
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:52,380
Parkinson's disease and even just all 
caused mortality.

1694
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:57,381
Like literally you can have decreased 
sense of smell and you know,

1695
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,980
it can be a good predictor of your next,
you know,

1696
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,630
five year mortality.
Um,

1697
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:06,040
and it's like,
why is this sense of smell such

1698
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,460
a good predictor of,
you know,

1699
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:10,060
people that are going to get Alzheimer's
soon.

1700
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:14,560
Also people that may just die soon and 
re we're finding out again,

1701
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:19,561
just recently within the past couple of 
months that the olfactory bulb requires 

1702
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:25,231
a constant supply of neural stem cells 
because the olfactory neurons which are 

1703
01:23:25,231 --> 01:23:30,001
in your factory bulb,
which is just right in front of your 

1704
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:31,801
brain.
Those neurons which are responsible for 

1705
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:31,801
smelling things,
you know,

1706
01:23:31,801 --> 01:23:32,410
and they send signals to the brain so 
that you can,

1707
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,030
you know,
experience it,

1708
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:36,970
so to speak.
They require a constant supply of neural

1709
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:39,280
stem cells,
which is coming from the sub ventricular

1710
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:40,750
zone.
And so,

1711
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,840
uh,
when you start to,

1712
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:47,930
to,
to have that process diminish where you 

1713
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:49,330
can't supply those new stem cells to the
olfactory bulb,

1714
01:23:49,331 --> 01:23:54,331
your sense of smell goes away.
And so that's why also it's a predictor 

1715
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:56,740
of Alzheimer's because you're literally 
losing the ability to know,

1716
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:00,610
don't people are born with people are 
born with a terrible sense of smell.

1717
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:05,640
That doesn't mean that you don't,
that you're not making neural stem 

1718
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,130
cells.
So please don't freak out.

1719
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:08,860
Like there's other reasons why you 
cannot have a good sense of smell.

1720
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,580
The reason this was impacting me right 
now is because I know people who've been

1721
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:14,380
knocked out and lost their sense of 
smell.

1722
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,760
Yeah.
So,

1723
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,520
wow.
So that's,

1724
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,600
um,
the,

1725
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:20,260
uh,
the,

1726
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:22,360
the tomorrow and that was given to these
mindset,

1727
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:24,220
improve their sense of smell and 
improved.

1728
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:24,820
Um,
you know,

1729
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:26,190
there's,
this is,

1730
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,410
there's another thing also with this 
neuro stem cell.

1731
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:32,800
I'm,
I've known for some time that this sense

1732
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:36,160
of smell is a good predictor of 
Alzheimer's.

1733
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:41,580
But in just until I had,
I just didn't understand why and this 

1734
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,061
whole understanding the neuro stem cells
being having to replace it like 

1735
01:24:45,061 --> 01:24:47,020
constantly.
So it's literally like marker.

1736
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:50,830
It's like a marker for brain,
your brain's ability to repair damage in

1737
01:24:50,831 --> 01:24:51,310
your brain.

1738
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:56,770
Um,
I remember last time I was on the 

1739
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,360
podcast,
you mentioned that study where they gave

1740
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,170
young blood to old mice and they 
essentially made them again,

1741
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:04,110
well I'm going to bring this back to the
nose.

1742
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:07,570
So I became very interested in that 
study.

1743
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:12,630
And so essentially what they found is 
that there is something in the blood 

1744
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,440
that secreted in.
So it's in the plasma actually,

1745
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:20,230
and it's called a growth differentiation
factor 11.

1746
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:23,200
And it goes,
it's made.

1747
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:27,850
It's made more readily in young blood.
So it decreases with age,

1748
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:32,851
like everything does.
And what happens is this growth 

1749
01:25:32,851 --> 01:25:33,790
differentiation factor 11 goes to the 
brain,

1750
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,820
goes to the muscle and it stimulates 
stem cell proliferation and it does it 

1751
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,920
in the separate ventricular zone.
And so when they gave it,

1752
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,900
like they did this,
when they did it in mice,

1753
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,240
what they found was that the mouse,
the mice,

1754
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,680
you know,
there are tissues were less age,

1755
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:52,681
the only way you can reverse tissue 
aging in that to that degree has got to 

1756
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:56,530
be related to stem cells because when 
you already have all this damage,

1757
01:25:56,531 --> 01:26:01,531
like the only way you're going to repair
that damage is by replacing and 

1758
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,560
replenishing that population with new 
cells.

1759
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,240
And because as we age,
the ability to do that,

1760
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:10,241
our stem cell,
the ability proliferation decreases and 

1761
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:10,241
all that stuff decreases.
We can't do it as well.

1762
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:11,570
And also,
you know,

1763
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:13,640
the more reactive oxygen species,
we get them more.

1764
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:18,050
Those cells start dying.
So the fact that you know,

1765
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:23,110
these tissues were able to reverse the 
aging was really,

1766
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:28,220
you know,
obviously indicative of stem cells when 

1767
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:28,220
they found was indeed this growth 
differentiation factor is in the plasma.

1768
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:31,910
More bits and young people and it's 
causing the proliferation of neural stem

1769
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:34,130
cells and the stubborn tricolor zone.
And also in muscle.

1770
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:37,550
What they found was they could even 
isolate that growth differentiation,

1771
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:40,570
differentiation factor.
And you know,

1772
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,040
inject it into old mice and you would 
have the same effect,

1773
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:47,000
which is really cool because that gives 
hope for isolating it in for,

1774
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:50,600
you know,
basically people using it as a source to

1775
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,910
stimulate proliferation of stem cells.

1776
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,960
And there's actually a clinical trial 
that started this month at Stanford 

1777
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,200
where they are injecting plasma from 
young individuals that are younger than 

1778
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:06,860
30 and they're giving them to people 
with mild Alzheimer's,

1779
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,990
older people with mild Alzheimer's and 
they're going to check the,

1780
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:11,300
the cognitive effects,
you know,

1781
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,180
immediately after and also longterm.
So,

1782
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,040
but the whole stem cell thing in the 
nose.

1783
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:21,110
And it's very interesting how it's like 
the nose that stem cells,

1784
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:27,610
neural stem cell,
more capacity to make more of them can 

1785
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:27,610
be,
you know,

1786
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:33,100
you can see the status of that by your 
sense of smell and the fact that you've 

1787
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,940
observed fighters that have had 
decreased sense of smell that is 

1788
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:39,940
alarming.

1789
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:39,970
Well,
there's one guy named Gary,

1790
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:44,971
good rich.
He's a real veteran mixed martial arts 

1791
01:27:44,971 --> 01:27:47,020
fighter who was around during the early 
days of the UFC and he fought in k,

1792
01:27:47,021 --> 01:27:49,000
one.
He fought in pride.

1793
01:27:49,001 --> 01:27:54,001
He's like kind of a legendary mixed 
martial arts character and he's dealing 

1794
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:57,360
with some pretty significant traumatic 
brain injury now from,

1795
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:01,330
from years and years of fighting,
and that's one of the issues that he had

1796
01:28:01,331 --> 01:28:05,410
and he lost his sense of smell and that 
makes total sense what you're saying.

1797
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:05,640
Yep.

1798
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,650
I'm sorry to hear that.
You know,

1799
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,390
I,
I,

1800
01:28:09,391 --> 01:28:10,440
like I said,
the,

1801
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:16,290
the April we,
fourth thing is something I think is 

1802
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,441
really,
really significant and I think that 

1803
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:21,180
yeah,
they've shown it with traumatic brain 

1804
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:21,630
injury from car accidents.
They've shown it with stroke,

1805
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:25,770
they shown it in boxers.
You know that having one of those deals,

1806
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:30,090
you're talking about a tenfold increased
risk of screwing up your brain.

1807
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:35,230
You think that that's something that 
they should screen for when they give 

1808
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:37,820
someone a license to fight.
I think that if I were a fighter,

1809
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:41,660
I would want to know,
I'd want to know my risk and you're,

1810
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:46,100
you're completely missing the psychology
of a fighter.

1811
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:51,220
Fighters feel invulnerable.
Like the idea of a fighter is that 

1812
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:51,220
everybody else is going to get fucked 
up,

1813
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,970
but not me.
I'm going to be different.

1814
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,490
I'm going to rise above.
I have a championships,

1815
01:28:55,491 --> 01:28:57,680
heart champion,
champion's heart,

1816
01:28:57,681 --> 01:29:02,681
champion's mindset.
I'm going to get through things that 

1817
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:02,681
other people can't.
You're not

1818
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:03,120
going.
You're not going to.

1819
01:29:03,121 --> 01:29:04,980
If you have an April,
we for a little weird.

1820
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,390
You're not.
Yeah.

1821
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:11,410
You're,
you're bringing science into the world 

1822
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:11,410
of fighting.
I,

1823
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:14,660
I would love for that to happen because 
you're talking about possibly changing 

1824
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:16,260
the lives of like,
you know,

1825
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:21,710
25 percent of fighters.
Fighters would still want to fight a 

1826
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:23,830
guarantee.
You a good majority of them.

1827
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,250
I still want to fight and they would 
just say,

1828
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:27,870
well,
across our bridge when I come to it,

1829
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,790
well,
if I start feeling the difference,

1830
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:32,880
but the real issue is once you start 
feeling the issues,

1831
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:37,910
you've only touched the tip of the 
iceberg of the amount of damage that 

1832
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:37,910
you've actually

1833
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:38,320
correct actually acquired.
Yes.

1834
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,150
And once you start becoming symptomatic 
in the sense where your memory,

1835
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:48,210
short term memory becomes affected.
Like what we were talking about with 

1836
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:51,031
denny and our friend that is typical of,
you know,

1837
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:57,270
a 80 year old human being that is 
acquired 80 years of inflammatory 

1838
01:29:59,471 --> 01:30:01,540
reactive oxygen species damage in the 
brain,

1839
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,790
you know,
then you start to see those symptoms.

1840
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:08,170
Do you remember there was a story a few 
years back of a football player.

1841
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,750
Do you remember the football player?
The fell off the truck,

1842
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:12,340
Jamie.
He jumped Henry,

1843
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:13,300
Chris Henry.
That's it.

1844
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,370
He was involved in some sort of a 
dispute with his girlfriend or his wife,

1845
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:23,980
forget which one.
And she took off with his truck and he 

1846
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,730
chased her and jumped on the back of the
truck and fell and fell off the truck 

1847
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:28,900
while she speeding down the road,
cracked his head open,

1848
01:30:28,901 --> 01:30:33,901
died.
They did a autopsy on him and found out 

1849
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:38,341
that he had the brain of a 70 something 
year old Alzheimer's Alzheimer's 

1850
01:30:38,341 --> 01:30:40,270
patient.
And he was in his twenties,

1851
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,450
wasn't he?
Yeah.

1852
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,640
Find out how old he was.
I'm,

1853
01:30:43,641 --> 01:30:43,950
I'm,
uh,

1854
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:48,951
I want to say he was 28 years old and he
had me.

1855
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:54,390
This is a guy who had not expressed any 
issues as far as like there's a bunch of

1856
01:30:55,871 --> 01:31:00,871
different athletes now that are coming 
out and there has been an hbo real 

1857
01:31:00,871 --> 01:31:04,321
sports piece that they just did this 
past weekend that I watched about 

1858
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:08,970
football players,
violent expression that they're directly

1859
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,820
relating to this traumatic brain injury 
that they're suffering from football.

1860
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,800
But this young man,
26,

1861
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:19,801
26,
26 and he had see if you can find the 

1862
01:31:19,801 --> 01:31:20,290
article about him having.
Did it,

1863
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,230
does it say he had about his brain 
issue.

1864
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:28,530
There was an article where they did the 
autopsy on her research is find brain 

1865
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,350
trauma and Henry Twenty six years old.

1866
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:34,130
Chronic and see.
I can't say that.

1867
01:31:34,131 --> 01:31:37,750
Encephalopathic encephalopathy.
Yes.

1868
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:46,300
Well there's multiple things that you 
brought up that is to say we could 

1869
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,230
discuss.
I think one is definitely the 

1870
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:53,351
accelerated brain aging that's happening
from the repeated traumatic events where

1871
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:55,190
it's,
it's doing that

1872
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:58,240
school football,
college football and the pros.

1873
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,370
You're just into things

1874
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,200
like a good chunk of your life and,
and,

1875
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:08,480
and I did see one press release or some 
article that was like 74 at a 76 or 

1876
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:15,210
something like nfl players or something 
somewhat,

1877
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,920
don't quote me on those statistics,
but something that was very,

1878
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:22,921
very,
almost like 90 percent of them had a 

1879
01:32:22,921 --> 01:32:26,551
Beta amyloid Beta plaques in their brain
and Tau tangles in the brain that were 

1880
01:32:26,551 --> 01:32:28,360
characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.
Seventy six out of 79.

1881
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:31,610
And this is post post death postmortem.
Yes,

1882
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,010
yes,
exactly.

1883
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:35,290
That's depression.
That's after birth.

1884
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:40,750
She gave birth because they asked me if 
I was mad.

1885
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,370
That's how they got hit.
Um,

1886
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:44,910
but yeah,
so,

1887
01:32:44,911 --> 01:32:45,750
uh,
the,

1888
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:50,870
the other really interesting thing about
this traumatic brain injury is the 

1889
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:53,290
effects on behavior.
You mentioned you ran over there,

1890
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:57,970
he ran chase chase car and jumped on the
truck and go off of it.

1891
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:00,370
That's impulsive behavior.
I mean,

1892
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:02,830
that's like not,
that's not a normal thing.

1893
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:07,950
You don't just chase after a truck and 
try to jump on it while it's moving 

1894
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:11,760
athletes and fighters and like really 
that's a really common,

1895
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:17,130
like the sort of impulsive behavior.
It's super common for fighters so.

1896
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,370
Well,
there are definitely.

1897
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:20,890
There's one aspect of the fighting 
culture.

1898
01:33:20,891 --> 01:33:21,360
I mean,
you know,

1899
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,560
there.
Yeah.

1900
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:23,590
Yeah.
That's part of.

1901
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:27,670
It's also what leads you to do that in 
the first place is you have this ability

1902
01:33:27,671 --> 01:33:31,020
to do like a lot of them.
I mean,

1903
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:33,730
I think before they ever got any brain 
damage whatsoever.

1904
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:38,940
They're impulsive people.
That's what led them to do fighting in 

1905
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:38,940
the first place.
I see.

1906
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,670
You think that was part of the civil?
No,

1907
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,660
I mean I'm guessing she certainly is.
I'm,

1908
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,120
I'm guessing,
based on my own life,

1909
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:45,490
so I don't know.

1910
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,880
I think that,
you know,

1911
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:52,020
people so impulsive behavior that's 
related to impulsive aggression,

1912
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:57,520
that can be self directed like suicide 
or self harming.

1913
01:33:57,521 --> 01:33:59,680
It can also be like aggressive towards 
others.

1914
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:04,720
Impulsive behavior can be like not 
longterm planning where you're just not.

1915
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:07,100
You're not weighing out all the possible
you know,

1916
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,640
events that can occur and what's more 
likely to happen or not.

1917
01:34:09,641 --> 01:34:11,440
You know,
you're just impulsively do something.

1918
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:17,340
There are polymorphisms that are related
to serotonin related genes that are 

1919
01:34:17,891 --> 01:34:22,891
associated with that because Saratonin 
plays a very important role in 

1920
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:27,421
regulating impulsivity,
so people that are already genetically 

1921
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:30,280
predisposed because they have a 
polymorphism.

1922
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:35,340
Again,
that gene variant that I was describing 

1923
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:37,291
earlier when I talked about a pui,
they have a gene variant in serotonin 

1924
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:41,731
synthesis gene or in the release 
serotonin release or on the transporter 

1925
01:34:41,731 --> 01:34:42,070
on the receptor.
You know,

1926
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:46,840
they've shown that there are 
associations with these and impulsivity.

1927
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:52,460
You know,
Saratonin is one of the things that 

1928
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:55,351
happens.
I've talked about this before on the 

1929
01:34:55,351 --> 01:34:55,351
podcast,
you know,

1930
01:34:55,351 --> 01:34:58,230
you can deplete.
People have Saratonin by taking away 

1931
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:58,370
their trip to fan and become impulsive

1932
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,210
and they become impulsive in terms of 
impulsive,

1933
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:03,270
aggressive things.
You know,

1934
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:08,290
when they do sorts of tests.
And that's partly because what's 

1935
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:10,880
happening is behavioral disinhibition.
Behavioral disinhibition is,

1936
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,550
you know,
they're signaling that's happening.

1937
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:16,790
That's going on from the orbital frontal
cortex part of the brain,

1938
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:21,791
and it's happening.
It's signaling to other regions of the 

1939
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:21,791
brain,
like the Amygdala,

1940
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:25,421
and I don't understand exactly how 
serotonin does this or what his specific

1941
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:31,421
role is.
I'd have to really dig into two more 

1942
01:35:31,421 --> 01:35:34,781
neuroscience for that,
but I do know that it does play a very 

1943
01:35:34,781 --> 01:35:36,680
important role in that when you take 
away the Serotonin disinhibition occurs,

1944
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:40,640
which means disinhibition means now 
usually you're having inhibitory signals

1945
01:35:40,641 --> 01:35:41,480
happen that say,
okay,

1946
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,920
you know,
you can't just go out and do something 

1947
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:46,920
crazy.
Like,

1948
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,030
you know,
you can't do it and your brain knows 

1949
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,200
that and there's certain signals that's 
happening.

1950
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:54,350
When you take away Serotonin,
those signals go away.

1951
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:57,290
And so now that inhibitory signal isn't 
there.

1952
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,410
Um,
this is something that I,

1953
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:02,390
you know,
like I was doing some reading on some of

1954
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:07,391
these nfl players that have gone crazy 
and committed suicide.

1955
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:13,510
I'm like,
junior sale I think is one who shot 

1956
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,770
himself in the heart,
you know,

1957
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:16,850
because he specifically wanted his brain
to be examined,

1958
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:20,030
examined,
and there was another football player,

1959
01:36:20,031 --> 01:36:23,420
I don't recall his name,
but he also committed suicide.

1960
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,970
I think he shot himself in his heart as 
well.

1961
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:30,200
And then there was a pro wrestler,
um,

1962
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:32,930
and I don't know his name,
but he liked it,

1963
01:36:32,931 --> 01:36:35,420
a murder suicide.
So these are all,

1964
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:41,170
you know,
there's probably multiple things going 

1965
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:41,170
on.
The,

1966
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:41,540
the,
the orbital frontal cortex.

1967
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,120
So that plays a very important role in 
inhibitory actions.

1968
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,450
But when things start to get messed up 
in that region of the brain,

1969
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:50,180
including the Serotonin,
and I think,

1970
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:53,240
like I mentioned,
the inflammation in the brain.

1971
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,580
When you generate a two series 
prostoglandins,

1972
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,980
which happens when there's inflammation 
in the brain,

1973
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,260
you,
they've shown,

1974
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:02,360
they've shown this in many different 
studies in mice.

1975
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:05,930
You inhibit the release of Serotonin.
So you take that,

1976
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:06,820
you know,
in,

1977
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:11,890
in of itself,
and you're talking about not having as 

1978
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:13,580
much of that Serotonin plus the damage 
to the orbital frontal cortex.

1979
01:37:13,581 --> 01:37:18,581
And all these things are compounding.
You're talking about like just massive 

1980
01:37:18,581 --> 01:37:22,031
changes in behavior that are occurring 
and then on top of that you may have 

1981
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:23,240
someone that is,
like you said,

1982
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:28,130
they,
they go into these sorts of sports for a

1983
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:29,390
reason.
They're already impulsive,

1984
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:34,391
so they,
you're talking to people that may 

1985
01:37:34,391 --> 01:37:35,651
already be genetically predisposed,
they may already have some sort of 

1986
01:37:35,651 --> 01:37:40,630
alteration in their serotonin function 
and now they're depleting their 

1987
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:45,281
serotonin release on top of that and 
they've got damage to their orbital 

1988
01:37:45,281 --> 01:37:48,281
frontal cortex.
It's like these things are compounding 

1989
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:50,741
to cars,
just total impulsive behavior and you 

1990
01:37:50,741 --> 01:37:50,810
know,
where they become aggressive and they do

1991
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:55,811
crazy things that they normally 
otherwise wouldn't do because they'd 

1992
01:37:55,811 --> 01:37:55,811
have that impulsive.
I mean,

1993
01:37:55,811 --> 01:37:56,100
sorry,
they'd

1994
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,020
have an inhibitory signal saying,
no,

1995
01:37:58,021 --> 01:37:59,160
don't do this.
You can't do this.

1996
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,010
So,
you know,

1997
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:06,020
I think it's very damaging in the 
respects of changing the behavior of 

1998
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,311
these people to where they just become 
even more impulsive and aggressive and 

1999
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:11,460
they're already,
you know,

2000
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,750
in this,
in the case of fighters,

2001
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:15,060
they're already fighting.
It's already a culture thing,

2002
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,220
you know.
So,

2003
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,030
uh,
it's,

2004
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:22,740
it's something very interesting with the
serotonin system also in the interaction

2005
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:26,850
between inflammation and Serotonin and 
they've even shown the opposite,

2006
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:31,851
like when you take people and you give 
them an acute dose of like an Ssri and 

2007
01:38:33,181 --> 01:38:36,570
you flood the brain with Serotonin just 
acutely just for like,

2008
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:41,610
you know,
a couple of hours people become more 

2009
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,380
adverse to harming others.
Like when you do give them a,

2010
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:44,040
you know,
like uh,

2011
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:49,130
one of those questionnaire things,
they become more adverse to harming 

2012
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:52,390
others even at the expense of saving 
other more people.

2013
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:56,820
Uh,
so serotonin is somehow regulating these

2014
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:58,980
types of,
I don't know,

2015
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:03,981
you know,
and there's neuroscientists and 

2016
01:39:03,981 --> 01:39:06,501
philosophers and all this that are doing
this research and trying to understand 

2017
01:39:06,501 --> 01:39:10,500
it doesn't make sense so that happy 
people would be more kind and less 

2018
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,401
likely to harm others.
And I've found personally that people 

2019
01:39:13,401 --> 01:39:15,510
that are most oppressed or the most 
likely to fucking slash and burn those,

2020
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,060
those are the people that want to take 
everybody down with them.

2021
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:21,330
It's usually the people that are really 
depressed that are looking to make other

2022
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:22,770
people feel bad.
Yeah.

2023
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:27,950
I think happiness is a is a component,
but I also think the impulsivity is 

2024
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:29,520
another component that's important.
It seems that Serotonin,

2025
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:35,270
if that really is what's going on,
that giving someone a large dose of 

2026
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:39,471
Serotonin would actually make them less 
likely to want to harm other people.

2027
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,760
That's a pretty significant thing.

2028
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,560
Yes.
That,

2029
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,260
that study was published,
I don't know,

2030
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:51,000
like 2010 or so I think and they're,
they're looking into,

2031
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:52,740
they're doing a lot of follow up studies
on that.

2032
01:39:52,741 --> 01:39:57,741
Like you know,
there's a difference between giving 

2033
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:59,871
someone an acute dose of Serotonin,
flooding their brain and doing it 

2034
01:39:59,871 --> 01:39:59,970
constantly,
you know,

2035
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:04,971
because when you're constantly doing it,
then there's feedback loops and you 

2036
01:40:04,971 --> 01:40:06,750
start to decrease the amount of 
serotonin receptors and the Bra.

2037
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,190
Yeah.
So that's so,

2038
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,090
you know,
but anyway,

2039
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:14,091
it's just the fact,
what they're trying to understand is 

2040
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:16,220
what is serotonin doing?
Like why is it that by giving someone a 

2041
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:20,391
huge dose of it,
they become more adverse to harming 

2042
01:40:20,391 --> 01:40:22,010
others and I don't know the answer.
You know,

2043
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,970
it just seems like there'd be happier.
Right?

2044
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,570
I mean,
if you,

2045
01:40:24,571 --> 01:40:29,571
if your Serotonin,
part of its function is to promote 

2046
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:29,620
happiness,
right?

2047
01:40:29,621 --> 01:40:34,621
It's just one of the reasons why Ssri or
termed antidepressants because people 

2048
01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:37,600
who are on depressants,
they take these regulators are serotonin

2049
01:40:37,601 --> 01:40:40,040
and gives them a big uptake in it and 
then Ooh,

2050
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,770
they feel better.
I don't know if it's as clear cut,

2051
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:45,360
but it does,
you know,

2052
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,630
I'm simplifying.
It does affect mood.

2053
01:40:48,631 --> 01:40:49,050
Yeah,
it does.

2054
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:50,450
You do feel better.
Um,

2055
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,380
it,
they've shown also the Serotonin,

2056
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,350
a Ssri

2057
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,170
effect,
pain like you pain,

2058
01:40:56,171 --> 01:41:01,171
so you actually feel less pain.
So it's not just a matter of feeling 

2059
01:41:01,171 --> 01:41:04,621
happier.
It's also a matter of not feeling as 

2060
01:41:04,621 --> 01:41:07,351
much pain.
And there's similar pathways between 

2061
01:41:07,351 --> 01:41:07,351
physical pain and social pain.

2062
01:41:07,351 --> 01:41:11,910
I have a friend who had depression 
issues and before being on Ssri,

2063
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,490
he was like really angry.
Like fuck everybody,

2064
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:20,491
fuck this guy.
And like he would say horrible things 

2065
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:20,980
about people.
Once he got on the antidepressants,

2066
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:24,580
all that went away now couldn't care 
less what other people do.

2067
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,410
Couldn't care less.
Like who cares?

2068
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:31,680
Like someone's doing something bad or 
someone saying something bad or 

2069
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:31,680
whatever.
He's like,

2070
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,710
I don't care,
just doesn't bother me.

2071
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:34,900
I'm not,
I don't want to harm that person.

2072
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,050
You know?
It's a complete shift in his mindset.

2073
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,360
Yeah Sir.
Serotonin does affect that,

2074
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:41,590
uh,
that aggressiveness,

2075
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:42,760
you know,
like I,

2076
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:43,440
you know,
it's,

2077
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:44,620
it's definitely playing a role.

2078
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:47,210
Well,
it's more of a lash out sort of a thing,

2079
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:52,300
but I think there's,
one of the issues with depression is 

2080
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:55,070
that people that are depressed and 
people that do have depression issues,

2081
01:41:55,071 --> 01:42:00,071
they kind of want to bring other people 
into their world almost like they feel 

2082
01:42:00,071 --> 01:42:02,660
like that people,
other people being happy is some somehow

2083
01:42:02,661 --> 01:42:04,700
taking something away from them,

2084
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,370
you know?
Yeah,

2085
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:08,210
yeah,
I do.

2086
01:42:08,211 --> 01:42:08,970
I think,
you know,

2087
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,020
they want to surround that.
They want other people to be miserable,

2088
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:17,110
miserable with them.
I think in this sense also where it's 

2089
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:17,110
like,
because it's justification,

2090
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:18,770
it's like I'm here,
then it must be okay and you know,

2091
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:20,900
if everyone here is also here with me,
then yeah,

2092
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:22,460
then I'm not,
I'm,

2093
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,920
I'm not abnormal.
There's not something wrong.

2094
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:30,060
I've always wondered how much of that is
what's going on psychologically,

2095
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:35,610
how much of that is what's in their life
and how much of the psychology and how 

2096
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:39,751
much of what's going on in their life.
Like what kind of feedback they're 

2097
01:42:39,751 --> 01:42:42,181
getting on daily day to day basis in 
their life is actually regulating their 

2098
01:42:42,181 --> 01:42:42,181
human neurochemistry.
Yeah,

2099
01:42:42,181 --> 01:42:42,181
yeah.

2100
01:42:42,181 --> 01:42:47,080
No.
There is a very complex interaction 

2101
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:50,081
going on between the environment and the
neurochemistry and this has been 

2102
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:50,081
demonstrated,
you know,

2103
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:53,420
in a lot of different animal studies 
where it's like,

2104
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:58,690
so you can actually alter someone 
serotonin system by having an early 

2105
01:42:59,931 --> 01:43:00,970
life,
you know,

2106
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:04,490
stressful event happen.
So you know,

2107
01:43:04,491 --> 01:43:09,140
like in the case of mice and early life,
stressful event is when the pups,

2108
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:13,150
when you're born you're a pup and you're
not nurtured as a pop.

2109
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:18,430
So when you're nurtured,
you know the parent mice will lick the 

2110
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:19,930
pops and when that,
when they get licked you will.

2111
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:22,670
They release Serotonin in their brain 
when they're really,

2112
01:43:22,671 --> 01:43:24,740
really young.
And when happens,

2113
01:43:24,741 --> 01:43:25,980
when they released her tone into the 
Brown,

2114
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:27,890
they're really young.
It's all sorts of feedback,

2115
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,920
epigenetic feedback loops.
So epigenetics is changing the 

2116
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:36,341
expression of their genes without 
actually altering the DNA nucleotide 

2117
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:40,061
sequence,
like a polymorphism is different 

2118
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:42,041
sequence of DNA,
but epigenetically they'll change the 

2119
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:44,810
receptors in their brain that respond,
that respond to like Glucocorticoids,

2120
01:43:44,811 --> 01:43:47,240
like stress hormones,
and they incur.

2121
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:51,800
So when they have serotonin there,
they increased the amount of receptors,

2122
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:54,860
which means when they have more 
receptors to glucocorticoids,

2123
01:43:56,330 --> 01:44:01,330
your body doesn't make us shoot as much 
cortisol and much much for the 

2124
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:02,720
glucocorticoids out because it has a lot
of receptors.

2125
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:05,810
There's a feedback so they're calmer,
they're happier,

2126
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:10,811
they're not as anxious,
but if you take that away and those 

2127
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:14,771
pumps don't get licked,
they don't make Serotonin in early 

2128
01:44:14,771 --> 01:44:14,771
development and those glucocorticoid 
receptors,

2129
01:44:14,771 --> 01:44:17,450
you don't have as many.
And so the body is constantly.

2130
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,080
It's like in a stress state and these,
these mice grew up very,

2131
01:44:21,081 --> 01:44:22,940
very anxious,
fearful.

2132
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,320
I'm just,
you know,

2133
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,660
their,
their,

2134
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:29,510
their brains develop differently.
Is that the same with children that grow

2135
01:44:29,511 --> 01:44:31,680
up in orphanages where they don't get 
cuddled and.

2136
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,860
Yeah,
I mean that's what I would be.

2137
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:38,890
That's what I think.
It seems likely that you take that in 

2138
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:38,890
combination.

2139
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:42,800
So you've got someone who's already 
genetically predisposed.

2140
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:43,730
I like,
you know,

2141
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,830
the serotonin system because it,
you know,

2142
01:44:45,831 --> 01:44:47,570
we're talking a lot about that.
They're already,

2143
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,460
they already have a polymorph and these 
things,

2144
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:54,730
polymorphisms are common.
You've got people with polymorphisms in 

2145
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:58,420
Serotonin transporters,
serotonin synthesis genes or their 

2146
01:44:58,420 --> 01:45:02,471
receptors,
and so they're already kind of 

2147
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:02,471
vulnerable.
They're already,

2148
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:06,370
you know,
they're not making as much serotonin or 

2149
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:06,740
they're not responding it like,
like normal,

2150
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:09,320
so they're already genetically 
vulnerable to that.

2151
01:45:09,321 --> 01:45:14,321
And then you couple that with an early 
stressful event and then it just screws 

2152
01:45:14,321 --> 01:45:15,940
things up even more.
Uh,

2153
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:20,960
and also diet is coupled to it.
I'm going to have talked about vitamin 

2154
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,830
deregulating serotonin synthesis.
EPA regulates the release of it.

2155
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:26,680
They've shown that.
I mentioned the two series.

2156
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:29,770
Prostoglandins inhibits the release when
you,

2157
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,970
when you put EPA,
and it mitigates that.

2158
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:34,550
So having an anti inflammatory Omega 
three,

2159
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:40,200
you know,
is very important for people that are 

2160
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,090
genetically predisposed to have their 
serotonin system screwed up.

2161
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:46,460
You take that person anything about 
someone who's already on the fringe 

2162
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:51,101
who's already waiting to be tipped over 
into mental illness or behavioral types 

2163
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:56,450
of behaviors that are non productive and
you and you take their nutrition,

2164
01:45:56,451 --> 01:45:58,640
they don't,
they have poor nutrition there,

2165
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:03,880
inflammation going on,
so all the energy is going sucked into 

2166
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:03,880
the wrong place and not up here where it
needs to be.

2167
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:07,400
And then you add stressful environment.
I mean you're talking about dynamite for

2168
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,070
mental illness and not just stressful 
environment,

2169
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:13,270
but negative feedback or negative 
environment.

2170
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:16,190
Yeah.
Poor a poor relationships,

2171
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,730
poor friendships,
real hardcore negativity.

2172
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:25,120
Yeah.
They've even shown actually in terms of 

2173
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:25,120
the relationships,
this,

2174
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:28,790
this whole behavioral epigenetics,
so to speak,

2175
01:46:28,791 --> 01:46:33,791
is kind of what it's called.
And it's very interesting because it's 

2176
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:37,061
talking,
it's like the relationship between 

2177
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:37,520
what's happening in your environment and
how that's changing,

2178
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:42,610
you know,
things that the neurochemistry in your 

2179
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:45,101
brain either at the level of 
neurotransmitters or receptors or 

2180
01:46:45,101 --> 01:46:45,950
whatever they've shown that another.

2181
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:49,130
So another thing that happens when 
you're a cuddled,

2182
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,620
you're young and they do a lot of these 
studies in mice,

2183
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,060
um,
obviously,

2184
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:57,150
but you release like,
like for example,

2185
01:46:57,151 --> 01:46:59,730
when your mother licks you,
you also,

2186
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:04,790
there's also oxytocin being released and
oxytocin sort of that bonding hormone 

2187
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:06,840
that's made where the mother bonds with 
the trial.

2188
01:47:06,841 --> 01:47:07,610
But also it's,
it's,

2189
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:08,670
it's pair,
you know,

2190
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:12,390
mate bond bonding as well.
And so when you take that away,

2191
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:13,760
uh,
when,

2192
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:14,740
when you know,
like,

2193
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:18,510
like if you're not coddled or you don't 
get that attention early,

2194
01:47:18,511 --> 01:47:21,390
like that early attention from the 
mother in early life,

2195
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:26,660
then what happens is that the,
the offspring grow up and they make less

2196
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
oxytocin.
Like some epigenetic changes are 

2197
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,000
happening where now they're not making 
as much.

2198
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,700
So now they grow up and they don't bond 
to their children and it perpetuates and

2199
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:36,940
they don't bond to their relations.

2200
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:41,940
So they have poor relationships.
Similar thing happens with Vasopressin,

2201
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:47,031
which is,
it's very a vasopressor and regulates a 

2202
01:47:47,031 --> 01:47:47,250
lot of things.
It's also an antidiuretic,

2203
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:51,090
but interestingly it's also made in the 
brain and it's important for male,

2204
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:56,120
like males respond to it in the context 
of meeting.

2205
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:58,240
So like for example,
they,

2206
01:47:58,250 --> 01:48:01,980
they've shown in like prairie voles,
which are rodents that are monogamous.

2207
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,250
They,
um,

2208
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:08,270
they have higher level,
they have a higher level of receptors 

2209
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:11,301
for that.
Vas are present in their brain compared 

2210
01:48:11,301 --> 01:48:11,400
to other species that are not 
monogamous.

2211
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:16,790
And when they take away,
when researchers take away the ability 

2212
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,770
to take away those,
they basically antagonize the receptors 

2213
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:21,780
so it can't bind Vasopressin,
those prairie voles which are monogamous

2214
01:48:21,781 --> 01:48:22,460
and they,
they,

2215
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,880
they,
they mate for life.

2216
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:26,620
All of a sudden that goes away.
Let's take it.

2217
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:29,370
They become freaks.
Like,

2218
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:30,570
yeah,
polygamist and stuff.

2219
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,840
And they've shown this in like nonhuman 
primates to where I think it was like 

2220
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,840
Alma Alma keys.
They're monogamous and you look at it 

2221
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:39,840
and you compare them to,
um,

2222
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:44,040
reduce monkeys that are non non 
monogamous.

2223
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:49,240
There the difference is also at the 
receptors for bas or precedent that 

2224
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:50,670
monogamist ones have a high density of 
them in their brain.

2225
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,550
And then another study came out looking 
at humans.

2226
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:58,850
I'm in a Swedish cohort.
They looked at males that were in 

2227
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:00,150
monogamous relationships that were 
married,

2228
01:49:00,151 --> 01:49:02,840
had successful relationships versus ones
that were divorced.

2229
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:06,930
I'm also ones that were just single and 
they found that there was an association

2230
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:11,610
again with these vasopressin receptors 
in the brain where the men that were,

2231
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,800
uh,
had failed marriages,

2232
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:16,110
for example,
or we're not likely to even get married.

2233
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,310
They had less of these vasopressin 
receptors.

2234
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:24,770
Um,
so it's really interesting that there's 

2235
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:27,150
these social hormones that we're making 
that are really changed epigenetically.

2236
01:49:27,151 --> 01:49:28,320
So these are also,
like,

2237
01:49:28,321 --> 01:49:29,580
for example,
in the prairie voles,

2238
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:35,120
they release more of this Vasopressin 
when they're meeting,

2239
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,640
so like the act of mating with their 
monogamous,

2240
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:40,680
with their partner that they partner 
with for life.

2241
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:43,140
Uh,
there's something that goes on with that

2242
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:47,040
meeting event,
that bonding event that makes,

2243
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:49,330
makes them more monogamous.
Exactly.

2244
01:49:49,331 --> 01:49:51,950
And it's happening.
I don't remember if,

2245
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,860
I think it was happening at the level of
the receptor.

2246
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:55,600
Yes.
They were making more of the receptors.

2247
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:59,280
The meeting event caused them to 
strengthen that bond

2248
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,200
more.
No,

2249
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:05,250
it'd be fascinating.
Is if they could figure out some way to 

2250
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:05,980
experiment with Benobos who are patently
polygamous.

2251
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:10,560
Bonobos are freaks.
They just have sex with everybody there.

2252
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:14,250
The only.
The only frictions.

2253
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,370
Yeah,
they do.

2254
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:15,790
Yeah,
they're.

2255
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:20,820
They're homosexual.
The only restrictions are the mother 

2256
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:21,610
won't meet with the suns.
That's it.

2257
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:26,880
Everything else is a free party and it 
would be fascinating if they could 

2258
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,030
figure out a way to introduce that.

2259
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:29,920
Could you.
Can you introduce it?

2260
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:31,270
Yes.
Yes.

2261
01:50:31,271 --> 01:50:33,880
You can make a transgenic and until 
recently,

2262
01:50:33,881 --> 01:50:38,881
transgenic by Informa Diet or a 
transgenic in the context of,

2263
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:43,120
of biology on means that we take a piece
of DNA,

2264
01:50:43,121 --> 01:50:48,121
like a gene that does something and we 
put it into any species of rodents and 

2265
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:55,141
we make it like we can give rodents,
human genes and study their effects are 

2266
01:50:55,141 --> 01:50:58,621
we can give Rodin's genes that we give 
them more of them and see what happens 

2267
01:50:58,621 --> 01:50:59,930
so we can take away.
Got started.

2268
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:03,940
Probably so fucking disaster.
So we do it in rodents.

2269
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:07,990
That's the chimps.
So now with this,

2270
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:11,470
we.
There was some limiting ability with the

2271
01:51:11,471 --> 01:51:16,120
cloning techniques and how we do it,
but now we can do it more readily,

2272
01:51:16,150 --> 01:51:18,510
so I think those studies are going to be
done yet.

2273
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:21,230
But you're right.
There's always the variability that you.

2274
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:23,320
The chaotic factor.
It's like,

2275
01:51:23,321 --> 01:51:24,940
well,
what if wake up,

2276
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:28,420
what if they like become really smart?
Start over,

2277
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:29,260
right?

2278
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:30,630
Sure.
But the Zune,

2279
01:51:30,631 --> 01:51:34,290
the chimps have fucking welding masks on
making sorts.

2280
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:36,680
That would be Kinda cool.
Yeah,

2281
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,300
in a way.
Terrifying.

2282
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:42,000
Yes.
I mean a lot meaner than people,

2283
01:51:42,001 --> 01:51:43,630
but nobody aren't.
Yeah.

2284
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:48,640
Which is really fascinating because 
they're like the least violent of all 

2285
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:49,620
the primates or one of the least 
violent.

2286
01:51:49,621 --> 01:51:54,621
They almost never harm each other 
because they're having so much sex 

2287
01:51:54,621 --> 01:51:54,621
wonder,
but.

2288
01:51:54,621 --> 01:51:59,150
But chimps have a lot of sex too.
They don't have as much sex as Banabos 

2289
01:51:59,150 --> 01:51:59,760
for sure,
but Benobos have so much sex.

2290
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:03,420
They don't use them in captivity.
You never see Benobos at the zoo and the

2291
01:52:03,421 --> 01:52:05,880
reason being is that they're just so 
hypersexual.

2292
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:10,910
They people would find a defensive 
because western culture so ridiculously 

2293
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:12,360
suppressed.
If we had benobos in the zoo,

2294
01:52:12,361 --> 01:52:13,410
we couldn't say,
well,

2295
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:18,440
this is the thing.
What you're looking at here is a normal 

2296
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:18,930
natural expression of Banabos.
They like to have sex with each other.

2297
01:52:18,931 --> 01:52:23,931
They solve disputes with sex,
they use sex for bargaining and we know 

2298
01:52:23,931 --> 01:52:28,751
that chimps use bargaining for sex.
And I had an old bit about it was 

2299
01:52:28,751 --> 01:52:32,630
because one of the first things that 
they ever discovered about chimpanzees 

2300
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:33,290
when they started experimenting with 
money,

2301
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:38,291
they started giving chimps coins and 
they could give those coins and get 

2302
01:52:38,431 --> 01:52:41,670
fruit with it.
So the first thing they did was give the

2303
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:43,170
coins the females and have sex with 
them.

2304
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:45,850
We're really the thing,
the,

2305
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,020
the,

2306
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,560
once they realized the coins represented
food,

2307
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:53,740
they would give the coins,
the females and the females would just 

2308
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:56,261
have fucking stacks of coins to the 
ceiling and all these males would be 

2309
01:52:56,261 --> 01:53:01,151
having sex with them.
That associative learning where then 

2310
01:53:01,151 --> 01:53:02,040
they immediately been able to realize,
okay,

2311
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:05,300
this prostitution is genetic.
Um,

2312
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,980
yeah.
Interestingly,

2313
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:08,970
back onto the.
I mean,

2314
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:14,050
I guess it's not really prostitution,
but back on the whole life style and how

2315
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:19,721
that changes your behavior.
They've also shown that in mice when 

2316
01:53:19,721 --> 01:53:21,560
they female minds,
so when female mice,

2317
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:27,640
when they're not cuddled.
So there's a lot of this in behavioral 

2318
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:30,500
epigenetics stuff that they're doing.
They do a lot of studies on,

2319
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,570
okay,
what happens in early development?

2320
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:34,610
You know,
what happens to the brain,

2321
01:53:34,611 --> 01:53:35,980
like if you're not,
you know,

2322
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:38,360
if you don't get attention,
you don't get the cuddling and licking.

2323
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:41,210
How do you grow up like what's going on?

2324
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:44,180
And with the females,
what happens too is they,

2325
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:49,181
uh,
when they don't get cuddled and licked 

2326
01:53:49,181 --> 01:53:52,031
and all that,
they grow up with more estrogen 

2327
01:53:52,031 --> 01:53:53,690
receptors in their brain and they become
more sexually receptive.

2328
01:53:53,691 --> 01:53:57,920
So estrogen is make,
makes females more sexually receptive.

2329
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:02,921
And so what ends up happening is usually
when you put a male mouse into a cage 

2330
01:54:02,921 --> 01:54:04,760
with a female mouse,
she may or may not meet with them.

2331
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:10,480
And if you put,
if you put one male mouse into the cage 

2332
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:10,490
with her,
this is a normal,

2333
01:54:10,491 --> 01:54:12,290
like a mass attach,
cuddling coddling.

2334
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:13,190
And all that,
uh,

2335
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:18,580
you put the second male mouse in,
let's say she made it with the first 

2336
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:18,630
one,
you put the second one in and it's,

2337
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,150
she's not going to just meet with this 
guy.

2338
01:54:20,151 --> 01:54:21,290
It's like she already made it,
you know,

2339
01:54:21,291 --> 01:54:26,291
she's not,
she's not promiscuous where she just 

2340
01:54:26,291 --> 01:54:26,291
having sex and after sex after,
you know.

2341
01:54:26,291 --> 01:54:29,930
But what happens with those female 
mindset grow up without that cuddling,

2342
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:35,200
they have increased,
epigenetically increased expression of 

2343
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:36,080
estrogen receptors in their brain to 
become more promiscuous.

2344
01:54:36,081 --> 01:54:41,081
And you put it,
you put a male mouse in again and it 

2345
01:54:41,081 --> 01:54:41,081
will make.
And you put another one in and it made.

2346
01:54:41,081 --> 01:54:44,600
So it's changing the sexual behavior.
Now,

2347
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:46,790
you know,
whether I'm sorry,

2348
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:48,680
but isn't there a correlation with human
beings?

2349
01:54:48,681 --> 01:54:53,681
Because human beings are come from 
troubled childhoods with the lack of 

2350
01:54:53,681 --> 01:54:54,740
love tend to be more promiscuous.
Yeah,

2351
01:54:54,741 --> 01:54:57,050
I mean,
I agree.

2352
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:59,300
You know,
obviously I can't make that statement,

2353
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:01,730
but yeah,
you did.

2354
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:04,320
The more we learn about,
you know,

2355
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:09,610
how these early life events are 
affecting behavior of our own brain and 

2356
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:11,090
also of our offspring.
Um,

2357
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,730
you know,
like the more we can start to apply this

2358
01:55:13,731 --> 01:55:16,130
to humans,
I think it makes sense,

2359
01:55:16,131 --> 01:55:18,050
you know,
I think there's definitely a correlation

2360
01:55:18,051 --> 01:55:20,330
between um,
growing up in poverty,

2361
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:21,230
growing up,
you know,

2362
01:55:21,231 --> 01:55:23,990
with,
without having that family there,

2363
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:28,250
that love nurturing supportive system,
whether it's a single parent,

2364
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:30,020
it's not,
it's not necessarily the case.

2365
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:33,520
I'm not saying like I grew up in a 
single parent home and you know,

2366
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:35,420
I'm not out there frequently.
Yeah,

2367
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:38,770
freaking getting free gun kind of.
I get my science free gone,

2368
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:42,420
but I'm a little different.
So yeah,

2369
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:43,310
I,
I,

2370
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,690
I,
I'm just saying I don't want to like say

2371
01:55:45,691 --> 01:55:49,020
that everyone,
there's definitely no exceptions,

2372
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:54,021
but yeah,
but I do think that our increased 

2373
01:55:54,021 --> 01:55:57,951
understanding at the biochemical level 
of how the environment changes the 

2374
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:59,310
brain,
you know,

2375
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:03,000
whether we're talking about behavior,
cognitive function,

2376
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:08,020
you know,
in general is very interesting and I 

2377
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:11,301
think that it should be extrapolated and
sort of apply to humans and in hopes 

2378
01:56:12,661 --> 01:56:15,060
that we can start to make society 
better.

2379
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:20,390
You know,
it's just so fascinating to me that a 

2380
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,580
human being is essentially the product 
of an equation.

2381
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:24,600
The equation of all these different 
hormones,

2382
01:56:24,601 --> 01:56:28,410
all these different neurotransmitters,
all these different epigenetic factors,

2383
01:56:28,411 --> 01:56:31,020
all these different life experience 
factors,

2384
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:32,610
all these different things.

2385
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:35,090
It's just that,
that's what producers are.

2386
01:56:35,091 --> 01:56:36,030
Rhonda,
Patrick.

2387
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:36,940
I mean,
it's,

2388
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:38,970
it's amazing.
It's so,

2389
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:42,150
it's so complex.
I agree with you.

2390
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:43,410
I think,
you know,

2391
01:56:43,411 --> 01:56:46,770
there's a lot of years the things that 
we cannot control,

2392
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:49,290
you know,
and the things that we cannot control,

2393
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:50,880
our,
you know,

2394
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:55,650
our polymorphisms that we're born with,
like me being born with apo e four,

2395
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:59,220
I can't control that or it's hard to 
control,

2396
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:04,490
you know,
being raised in a family where let's 

2397
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:04,490
say,
you know,

2398
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:07,260
you're from a single parent family and 
your mom's working hard.

2399
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,880
She doesn't have time to,
you know,

2400
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:10,680
you don't,
you don't get as much nurturing.

2401
01:57:10,681 --> 01:57:11,700
Dad's gone,
you know,

2402
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,130
that sort of thing.
You can't choose that.

2403
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,000
I mean,
you,

2404
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:16,430
you're very young.
You know,

2405
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:18,000
when you're a young infant and young 
toddler,

2406
01:57:18,001 --> 01:57:23,001
I mean these,
your brain is very susceptible to all 

2407
01:57:23,001 --> 01:57:25,311
these environmental interactions that's 
epigenetically changing the way your 

2408
01:57:25,311 --> 01:57:26,670
brain is working.

2409
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:29,310
Um,
but things that you can change are,

2410
01:57:29,311 --> 01:57:30,570
you know,
as you know,

2411
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:34,600
diet diets are really important.
One that you can change,

2412
01:57:34,601 --> 01:57:37,460
you know,
the whole ballgame.

2413
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:38,130
Basically.
It's,

2414
01:57:38,131 --> 01:57:39,030
you know,
you're talking about,

2415
01:57:39,031 --> 01:57:43,860
I really think there is a complex 
interaction between genetics,

2416
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,690
epigenetics,
diet,

2417
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:49,280
and you know,
I'm not the only one that thinks that,

2418
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:54,290
I mean there is,
there's people researching all these 

2419
01:57:54,290 --> 01:57:56,121
different complex interactions.
But I think what I like to focus on is 

2420
01:57:56,121 --> 01:57:58,470
the part that we can control and the 
part that we can control right now.

2421
01:57:58,950 --> 01:58:00,300
And that is,
you know,

2422
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:01,580
our lifestyle.
We,

2423
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:03,630
what we,
what we as an adult at least,

2424
01:58:03,631 --> 01:58:08,631
you know,
obviously when you're really young 

2425
01:58:08,631 --> 01:58:08,631
you're sort of beholden to your parents 
feeding you and also,

2426
01:58:08,631 --> 01:58:09,690
you know,
that's the sort of unfortunate.

2427
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:11,630
But at a certain point,
you know,

2428
01:58:11,631 --> 01:58:15,600
it's like when you're able to realize 
what's going on,

2429
01:58:15,601 --> 01:58:19,320
I think that trying to control what you 
can is really important.

2430
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:21,040
So getting a good diet,
you know,

2431
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:26,060
things like getting enough Omega threes,
EPA and your brain is literally an 

2432
01:58:26,281 --> 01:58:28,770
antiinflammatory.
It's extremely,

2433
01:58:28,771 --> 01:58:30,150
extremely important.
Like,

2434
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:35,480
you know,
this study where they're injecting 

2435
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:35,480
people with cytokines that are causing 
inflammation,

2436
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:38,670
that gives them depression and yet if 
they take epa with it,

2437
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:40,320
they don't get depressed.
Yeah,

2438
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,370
that's pretty.
That's a massively

2439
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:47,370
significant.
It would be a huge issue with children 

2440
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:47,370
as well.
I,

2441
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:48,910
I definitely think it's a huge issue 
with children.

2442
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,130
They have these,
um,

2443
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,460
these,
the,

2444
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:53,800
there's various um,
uh,

2445
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:59,340
fish oil,
gummy bears and these different little 

2446
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,690
candies that you can give the children.
They don't really taste like candy,

2447
01:59:01,691 --> 01:59:04,270
the context quite a bit shittier than 
candy,

2448
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:07,480
but they're sweet enough so they feel 
like a treat the kids.

2449
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:13,320
I think that it's extremely important,
especially early on to get to get that 

2450
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:16,270
EPA.
I know I've talked about in the past,

2451
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,450
Dha has always talked about because it's
high,

2452
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:24,510
there's a high level of it and the brain
and I even talked about it in the 

2453
01:59:24,510 --> 01:59:27,721
context of Krill oil.
I did some research after our last 

2454
01:59:27,721 --> 01:59:27,970
conversation.
We had a conversation about that.

2455
01:59:27,971 --> 01:59:32,971
That's one of the things that keeps 
coming up on my message board guys 

2456
01:59:32,971 --> 01:59:32,971
wanting to.

2457
01:59:32,971 --> 01:59:36,240
Folks wanted to question you about that.
Like what is the difference trend Krill 

2458
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:40,060
oil and fish oil and what,
what are the benefits of curoil and also

2459
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:44,380
how do you know whether crow was rancid 
because that appears to be an issue with

2460
01:59:44,381 --> 01:59:48,160
Krill oil.
Really friendly with crude oil.

2461
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:49,270
Interesting.
Okay.

2462
01:59:49,271 --> 01:59:53,010
Well I'll tell you what I know and I'll 
definitely tell you what I don't care.

2463
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:58,320
So the thing you know,
the reason Dha and EPA are very 

2464
01:59:59,201 --> 02:00:04,201
important is because they're,
they're both an important part of the 

2465
02:00:04,201 --> 02:00:06,640
brain in terms of Dha.
It's very important because it's part of

2466
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:11,641
the cell membrane.
I'm like new neurons are astrocytes and 

2467
02:00:11,641 --> 02:00:15,991
other cells in your body,
but particularly it's concentrated in 

2468
02:00:15,991 --> 02:00:15,991
the gray matter of the brain.
So it's very important.

2469
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:19,540
The difference between fish oil and 
Krill oil.

2470
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:22,570
And you know this,
this is something that I made a video on

2471
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:27,571
recently is is that sufficient oil is 
usually a molecularly distilled because 

2472
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:34,711
they use it to fish,
have higher on the food chain and 

2473
02:00:34,711 --> 02:00:38,071
they've got concentration of more bad 
things like mercury and they're fat and 

2474
02:00:38,071 --> 02:00:42,541
so they molecularly distill it to get 
rid of that junk because we don't want 

2475
02:00:42,541 --> 02:00:43,050
to take a bunch of,
you know,

2476
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:43,840
mercury.

2477
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:49,050
And also they,
they distill it because they want to 

2478
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:52,470
concentrate the fish,
the EPA and Dha to make it more 

2479
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:52,600
concentrated.
So what they do is they take the fit,

2480
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:56,950
the EPA and Dha and they put this like 
ethanol backbone.

2481
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,710
They usually,
it has a glycerol backbone on it,

2482
02:00:59,711 --> 02:01:04,711
which makes it a triglyceride and they 
take that off and they do this ethanol 

2483
02:01:04,711 --> 02:01:07,861
backbone.
It's part of the molecular distillation 

2484
02:01:07,861 --> 02:01:07,861
process.
How they distill it,

2485
02:01:07,861 --> 02:01:10,830
get the impurities away.
But then most companies leave it like 

2486
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:11,470
that.
They don't put it back in a triglyceride

2487
02:01:11,471 --> 02:01:13,330
form.
So they have this ethanol backbone,

2488
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:18,700
which is not recognized very well by 
pancreatic lipase,

2489
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:23,701
is in our small intestine.
So it doesn't get absorbed very well 

2490
02:01:23,701 --> 02:01:23,790
because that's,
you know,

2491
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:25,960
an ethanol backbone.
It's not common,

2492
02:01:25,961 --> 02:01:27,400
it's,
it does get absorbed,

2493
02:01:27,401 --> 02:01:32,401
but you just have to take more of it.
Fish oil can be reestablished into a 

2494
02:01:32,401 --> 02:01:36,670
triglyceride form where they put 
glycerol back on and that is much better

2495
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:39,730
because know the triglyceride is what 
these,

2496
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,010
these

2497
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:45,100
pancreatic lipase is,
are used to seeing so they can absorb 

2498
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:48,551
it.
Your small intestines can absorb it 

2499
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,081
better.
So the bioavailability is better 

2500
02:01:50,081 --> 02:01:50,081
essentially.
So,

2501
02:01:50,081 --> 02:01:50,990
but the problem is most fish oil 
supplements don't do that.

2502
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:52,550
There's a,
there's a couple of exceptions.

2503
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:54,290
I know Nordic naturals is one.
Um,

2504
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:57,560
I like them.
So that's the fish oil.

2505
02:01:57,561 --> 02:02:01,370
Krill oil is mostly in a phospholipid 
form.

2506
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:05,630
And so that.
The thing about the phospholipid form,

2507
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:10,780
much like when we were talking about 
with liposomes is so the thing with 

2508
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:13,781
phospholipid form is that the,
the Dha and EPA and Krill oil can be 

2509
02:02:13,781 --> 02:02:14,930
easily absorbed by the small intestine 
for one,

2510
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:20,110
it can be absorbed and it's intact form 
without having to undergo all this 

2511
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:22,961
enzymatic cleavage stuff so it can just 
be absorbed intact and get transported 

2512
02:02:22,961 --> 02:02:27,311
to the cholesterol at clough microns 
like hdl ldl that can be transported 

2513
02:02:27,311 --> 02:02:28,610
there in full tax form.

2514
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:31,040
Um,
but so that's,

2515
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:32,840
you know,
better bioavailability,

2516
02:02:32,841 --> 02:02:37,841
so to speak.
And there's been a couple of studies 

2517
02:02:37,841 --> 02:02:39,371
showing that there's a 40 percent 
increase in bioavailability and from 

2518
02:02:39,371 --> 02:02:42,910
getting EPA and Dha in phospholipid form
from Krill oil versus getting into a 

2519
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:45,230
triglyceride form from fish oil.
So that's Kinda cool.

2520
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:46,670
Um,
the,

2521
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:51,800
the thing that's really cool about Krill
oil is that this phospholipid form,

2522
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:52,860
um,
is,

2523
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:57,560
is great because Dha,
to get Dha into the brain,

2524
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:01,790
we actually have a transporter,
which means you can get the of the brain

2525
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:06,850
by just having it as a fatty acid,
free fatty acid and it can be carried 

2526
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:11,051
into the brain.
But there's also a specific transporter 

2527
02:03:11,051 --> 02:03:14,681
that has dha in a certain kind of fossil
liquid form called phosphatidylcholine.

2528
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:20,950
Phosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid 
and it isn't Krill oil and it's pretty 

2529
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:25,121
awesome because the that Dha 
lysophosphatidylcholine can transport 

2530
02:03:25,121 --> 02:03:26,240
transport's Dha into the brand.

2531
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,490
It's actually an important way that Dha 
gets into the brain.

2532
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:33,730
In fact,
when they knock out that transporter in 

2533
02:03:33,730 --> 02:03:33,730
mice,
mice had 60,

2534
02:03:33,730 --> 02:03:36,730
60 percent less Dha in their brain.
So it's obviously an important pathway.

2535
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:41,920
The brain likes it in that form.
So I think for for for that reason in 

2536
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,971
and of itself,
Krill oil was cool for the Dha because 

2537
02:03:45,971 --> 02:03:46,880
it's in that lie.
So phosphatidylcholine form.

2538
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,390
However,
that's not the whole story.

2539
02:03:50,391 --> 02:03:55,391
I think that a fish oil,
because fish oil concentrates the EPA 

2540
02:03:55,391 --> 02:04:00,341
and Dha to insane levels.
I mean even though Krill oil is more 

2541
02:04:00,341 --> 02:04:00,860
bioavailable,
you know,

2542
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:04,700
it doesn't have high levels of EPA or 
Dha to speak,

2543
02:04:04,701 --> 02:04:07,400
but your brain doesn't need that much.
Dha,

2544
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:10,670
your brain conserves Dha very,
very well.

2545
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:14,750
The half life of Dha is like anywhere 
between like six months to a year.

2546
02:04:14,751 --> 02:04:16,070
It's like very,
very long.

2547
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:19,940
Your brain is conserving it and the 
brain doesn't take up a lot,

2548
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:25,600
so on a daily basis,
I think it's something like four 

2549
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:28,781
milligrams a day,
so your brain isn't taking up a whole 

2550
02:04:28,781 --> 02:04:29,450
lot of Dha,
but when it does take it up,

2551
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:32,120
it likes it in that Krill oil form,
that phospholipid form,

2552
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:35,510
EPA,
EPA is the thing that your brain needs a

2553
02:04:35,511 --> 02:04:40,511
lot of constant supply and EPA is so 
important for so many different reasons.

2554
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:41,660
We're talking about,
you know,

2555
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:46,800
that whole neuro inflammatory pathway 
that we started out talking about with,

2556
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:51,860
you know,
traumatic brain injury with just normal 

2557
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:51,860
brain aging with inflammation in 
general.

2558
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:55,440
Anything going on in the body will be 
any sort of gut issues.

2559
02:04:55,441 --> 02:04:57,480
All that stuff that's affecting the 
brain.

2560
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:58,710
And so,
you know,

2561
02:04:58,711 --> 02:05:03,270
having EPA in the brain is so important.
It's so important.

2562
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:07,230
And so I like to get a concentrated 
amount of EPA from fish oil.

2563
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:11,790
I get mine and triglyceride form.
So I use Nordic naturals because.

2564
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:16,791
So I actually take both.
I take Krill oil and I take fish oil 

2565
02:05:16,791 --> 02:05:19,521
because I think the Krill oil is awesome
for the Dha in that phosphatidylcholine 

2566
02:05:19,521 --> 02:05:23,721
form and I think that the fish oil,
because I can get like I try to get to 

2567
02:05:23,721 --> 02:05:25,830
grams,
they've shown like multiple,

2568
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:28,500
multiple studies have shown whether I'm 
looking at cognitive function,

2569
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:33,770
whether I'm looking at depression,
whether I'm looking at impulsive 

2570
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:36,591
behavior or other types of brain 
functions and behaviors to Graham seems 

2571
02:05:36,901 --> 02:05:40,830
to be a consensus in terms of benefits.
So that's 2000 milligrams.

2572
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:41,910
Yes.
Yes.

2573
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:46,260
And so I get that from my mind,
Nordic naturals EPA that I take.

2574
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:50,280
And then I get my Dha from Krill oil.
Um,

2575
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,070
the other thing about the Krill oil is 
it has asked,

2576
02:05:53,071 --> 02:05:56,310
is dampen,
which is a crock annoyed that is,

2577
02:05:56,311 --> 02:05:59,760
I'm also accumulates in the rods and 
cones in the eye and also in the brain.

2578
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,760
And the reason it does that is because 
it has a unique structure that is able 

2579
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:08,421
to sequester singlet oxygen which is 
produced by UV light.

2580
02:06:09,121 --> 02:06:12,960
The Sun singlet oxygen is the thing that
damages our eyes with age.

2581
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:18,250
It's very real.
It's one of those reactive oxygen 

2582
02:06:18,250 --> 02:06:20,331
species that I talk about and it damages
the rods and the cones of the eye and 

2583
02:06:20,331 --> 02:06:20,580
it's a,
it's a cause of,

2584
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,740
you know,
age related blindness,

2585
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:24,750
whether we're talking about macular 
degeneration,

2586
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:26,900
degeneration or other sorts of,
you know,

2587
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:29,850
uh,
I dibella attaining diseases,

2588
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:31,860
so I'm asked is anthon,
Lutein,

2589
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:34,020
zeaxanthin.
These are carotinoids that are really,

2590
02:06:34,021 --> 02:06:39,021
really good.
And they accumulate in the eye because 

2591
02:06:39,021 --> 02:06:40,551
they're like basically every time we're 
out in the sun and that blue light hits 

2592
02:06:40,551 --> 02:06:42,150
which caused,
which has the elect,

2593
02:06:42,151 --> 02:06:47,151
the singlet oxygen in it,
it captures it and it stops it from 

2594
02:06:47,151 --> 02:06:47,930
damaging brain and also eyes.

2595
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,530
So acids,
anthony is really cool.

2596
02:06:49,531 --> 02:06:51,180
It's also been shown in clinical studies
to,

2597
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:54,990
you know,
improve hdl to have know lower oxidation

2598
02:06:54,991 --> 02:06:59,991
locks at lower oxidative stress.
All these good sorts of goodies that 

2599
02:06:59,991 --> 02:07:00,220
come along with it,
which I also think are really cool.

2600
02:07:00,221 --> 02:07:03,450
I like and um,
in terms of rancidity,

2601
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:05,490
I personally,
the reason,

2602
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:08,970
another reason why I take Nordic 
naturals is because of the isolate their

2603
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:14,210
fish oil under nitrogen conditions,
meaning there's no oxygen oxygen 

2604
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:17,721
present.
So in order for these Omega threes to 

2605
02:07:17,721 --> 02:07:18,360
get damaged,
they need to be oxidized.

2606
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,760
So part of the whole distillation 
process,

2607
02:07:20,761 --> 02:07:22,410
the pilling,
all that stuff,

2608
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:25,680
you're,
you're exposing it to oxidative damage.

2609
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:30,920
And so the fact that Nordic naturals 
does all that in a nitrogen 

2610
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:30,920
conditioning,
there's no oxygen present.

2611
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,250
So it's kind of awesome.
Now,

2612
02:07:32,251 --> 02:07:34,540
the Krill oil rancidity,
uh,

2613
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:36,160
I wasn't aware of how

2614
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:40,060
rents rancid it gets just because I'm 
sort of new to the Krill oil field.

2615
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:43,450
I just did a lot of reading on this Dha 
phosphatidylcholine form.

2616
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:44,920
It's probably a similar situation,
right?

2617
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:50,390
Probably is.
Xanthan is a very good at it.

2618
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:52,900
It's also good at preventing lipid 
peroxidation.

2619
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:54,850
So it's,
you know,

2620
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:57,160
it's doing some good students.
It's an antioxidant,

2621
02:07:57,190 --> 02:08:02,190
it's preventing a lot of that rancidity 
just a matter of maybe how much as 

2622
02:08:02,190 --> 02:08:03,010
Stanton's in there.
That's possible.

2623
02:08:03,011 --> 02:08:08,011
I've seen various doses,
so maybe more acid antin would help 

2624
02:08:08,011 --> 02:08:08,420
prevent the rancidity uh,
in that,

2625
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,340
in that regard.
But,

2626
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:14,590
um,
that would be one thing that I would 

2627
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:18,570
look for if you're getting.
The Cro will try to get a higher level 

2628
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:19,990
thinking of macular degeneration and our
issues.

2629
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:25,830
What,
what specifically is a good thing to 

2630
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:26,280
take for vision?
I've heard core sutton.

2631
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,060
Is that what it's Quercitin yeah,
of course.

2632
02:08:28,110 --> 02:08:33,110
It's supposed to promote healthy vision.
Even better than that is Lutein and 

2633
02:08:33,110 --> 02:08:36,370
Zeaxanthin leading the team as well.
This sort of thing.

2634
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:41,430
There's this pure has a macular health 
packet or some supplements they saved 

2635
02:08:44,201 --> 02:08:45,670
that has both that loot.
That's,

2636
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,630
you say Ludy and Lutein,
looting,

2637
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:51,100
Z Z is absent 10.
Yeah,

2638
02:08:51,101 --> 02:08:51,910
I'm not,
I'm not.

2639
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:56,620
I mean that's course attendance.
Just got generalized mechanisms where it

2640
02:08:56,621 --> 02:09:01,621
activates NRF two,
which is a transcription factor that 

2641
02:09:01,621 --> 02:09:02,110
activates glutathione.
So it's,

2642
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:04,240
you know,
it's one of those broad spectrum kind of

2643
02:09:04,241 --> 02:09:08,500
like the curcumin where it turns on a 
lot of good good genes in the body.

2644
02:09:09,230 --> 02:09:14,230
Um,
but really if we're talking about the 

2645
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:14,230
idea,
ha,

2646
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:14,620
Lutein and Zeaxanthin,
uh,

2647
02:09:14,621 --> 02:09:19,621
the,
they're really the main ones and moving 

2648
02:09:19,621 --> 02:09:21,220
into Xanthan are present in like green 
plants is really high in it.

2649
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:23,500
Um,
Zucchini,

2650
02:09:23,501 --> 02:09:28,501
you know,
these things that it has all those 

2651
02:09:28,501 --> 02:09:28,501
things is a pure one.

2652
02:09:28,501 --> 02:09:28,780
The one that I'd say has,
um,

2653
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:32,180
has looting,
it has a zs,

2654
02:09:34,970 --> 02:09:39,970
a in the course attend as well as well 
as a and Siedel l sighting and inositol 

2655
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,230
assisting cystine.
Is that what it says?

2656
02:09:44,290 --> 02:09:44,710
Yes.
Yeah.

2657
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:49,920
So actually that's another inositol 
sustain is another way that you can 

2658
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:55,890
activate nrf two and also glutathione 
and it's also a potent antioxidant.

2659
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:57,360
Um,
you know,

2660
02:09:57,370 --> 02:10:02,370
I don't know it.
It's not like a general thing that's 

2661
02:10:02,370 --> 02:10:02,850
specific to the eye.
It's more of a,

2662
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:04,720
sorry,
not a specific thing to the eye.

2663
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:08,020
It's more of a general thing.
It can induce glutathione synthesis,

2664
02:10:08,021 --> 02:10:08,740
so it's,
you know,

2665
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:11,650
it's one of those things that are good 
for multiple cells,

2666
02:10:11,651 --> 02:10:16,651
but especially when I'm,
if we're just talking about the eye 

2667
02:10:16,651 --> 02:10:18,100
lutein and Zeaxanthin,
like if you look in other tissues,

2668
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:23,550
the only place you find it is in the eye
and the rods and the cones in the eye 

2669
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:23,550
and in the brain.

2670
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:25,060
That's it.
That's where it accumulates.

2671
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:28,810
Whereas n-acetyl NSU assisting gets in 
like multiple cells.

2672
02:10:28,811 --> 02:10:31,030
It's just doing a general antioxidant 
thing.

2673
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:34,550
So having the Lutein and Suzanne and 
that's part of the.

2674
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:37,160
I think this,
I make a smoothie every morning,

2675
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:40,550
which has a lot of Kale in it and other 
Greens,

2676
02:10:40,551 --> 02:10:43,280
but it's got a high concentration of 
Lutein and Zeaxanthin.

2677
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:44,930
Also,
my multivitamin has it as well.

2678
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:49,990
I think I'm confusing corset in with 
something else because I think it was 

2679
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:53,681
looting there was thinking about,
because I don't even think this pure 

2680
02:10:53,681 --> 02:10:56,820
mentor,
probably what you were thinking about 

2681
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:56,820
looting his course it into something 
else.

2682
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:58,370
Right.
It's a polyphenol.

2683
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:59,240
Yeah,
it's good.

2684
02:10:59,241 --> 02:11:03,020
I mean it does a lot of good things.
You know that a lot of the mechanisms by

2685
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:05,420
which these polyphenols work is through 
that,

2686
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,960
it's slightly toxic.
It activates all these different genes 

2687
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:14,621
in our tissues that are detoxifying 
enzymes like with Ioan and other 

2688
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:18,770
reactive oxygen species,
scavengers and things like that.

2689
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:24,170
So inositol sustaining has been shown to
activate all the glutathione genes so 

2690
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:24,170
those,
you know,

2691
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:24,870
it's,
it's a,

2692
02:11:25,790 --> 02:11:27,320
it's one of those mechanisms where it's 
like,

2693
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:28,200
it,
it,

2694
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:30,230
like I mentioned before,
the hormetic response.

2695
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:35,231
It's kind of like that where it does 
something like that generalizing 

2696
02:11:35,231 --> 02:11:39,130
response.
You talked earlier about something that 

2697
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:39,910
I always thought it was bullshit that,
um,

2698
02:11:40,690 --> 02:11:41,340
the,
the,

2699
02:11:41,370 --> 02:11:46,370
the,
the herbal shit that everybody always 

2700
02:11:46,370 --> 02:11:46,700
prescribed when people are sick at 
conation.

2701
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:48,990
I always thought it was nonsense.
I don't,

2702
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:51,590
I don't know if it is or not.
I just,

2703
02:11:51,591 --> 02:11:54,020
I mentioned it because I know that it's 
in people's minds.

2704
02:11:54,021 --> 02:11:59,021
It's an herbal thing that people going 
to take a couple of jobs of recognition 

2705
02:11:59,021 --> 02:12:00,350
when you're on it and never did 
anything.

2706
02:12:00,351 --> 02:12:02,990
I never felt any increased,
uh,

2707
02:12:02,991 --> 02:12:06,380
you know,
healing or recovery from colds.

2708
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:11,810
I honestly have no idea if it's,
if it's real or not because I haven't 

2709
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:11,810
read about it enough.

2710
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:13,010
I mean,
I think the best thing to do,

2711
02:12:13,011 --> 02:12:14,210
like we were talking about,
you know,

2712
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:17,600
is making sure you don't have a lot of 
inflammation going on.

2713
02:12:17,601 --> 02:12:21,410
Making sure you're healthy.
Like that's gonna be the way to have the

2714
02:12:21,411 --> 02:12:26,411
best immune response you can possibly 
have when you are exposed to something 

2715
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:31,420
pathogenic.
It's fascinating the way human beings 

2716
02:12:31,420 --> 02:12:33,791
work because we always go to try to fix 
it once it's broken and don't try to 

2717
02:12:34,611 --> 02:12:36,190
prevent it from being fixed.
Like there's a,

2718
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,630
there's a lot of money.
Well,

2719
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:39,020
there's a lot of money in health 
supplements,

2720
02:12:39,021 --> 02:12:43,550
but there's a lot of money and like 
homeopathic remedies once you're already

2721
02:12:43,551 --> 02:12:46,460
sick.
Like I remember,

2722
02:12:46,461 --> 02:12:49,130
I don't remember who gave it to me,
but I remember there's this stuff,

2723
02:12:49,131 --> 02:12:54,120
it's like these little,
like little sugar capsules there.

2724
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:56,600
You pop the top and put in your mouth.
I'm like,

2725
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:57,530
I'm eating sugar.

2726
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:00,590
Was it?
Homeopathy is nonsense.

2727
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:01,130
No,
no,

2728
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:02,360
no.
This is amazing.

2729
02:13:02,570 --> 02:13:04,820
Homeopathic remedy for Kohl's.
I go,

2730
02:13:04,821 --> 02:13:08,330
this is fucking sugar sugar effect.
Is that what it is?

2731
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:09,800
Yeah.
Yeah,

2732
02:13:09,801 --> 02:13:11,110
I think that.
Is that stuff called,

2733
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:12,270
you know what I'm talking about?
No,

2734
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:14,450
you pop the top of it.
It's like sugar crystals now.

2735
02:13:14,451 --> 02:13:19,451
I've never,
I have no idea what you're talking 

2736
02:13:19,451 --> 02:13:19,451
about.
But I do know that homeopathic stuff is,

2737
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:22,700
there's just no way that can be 
effective.

2738
02:13:22,701 --> 02:13:27,701
The way that diluted to the point where 
there's like one molecule of the 

2739
02:13:27,701 --> 02:13:28,250
compound in.
It's just crazy.

2740
02:13:28,450 --> 02:13:29,510
Um,
I did,

2741
02:13:29,511 --> 02:13:31,100
I was given,
given that once,

2742
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:32,820
and I took one I didn't know was 
homeopathic,

2743
02:13:32,821 --> 02:13:34,250
but I thought it was like Arnica or 
something.

2744
02:13:34,251 --> 02:13:36,920
And I took it,
but it was like little tiny little cap,

2745
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:40,230
like sugar things inside of it.
And I could tell just by the way I shook

2746
02:13:40,231 --> 02:13:41,370
the capsule,
I didn't,

2747
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:42,380
I didn't pop it open.

2748
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:43,380
Maybe I was supposed to,
I don't know,

2749
02:13:43,381 --> 02:13:45,210
I just took the capsule.
But anyways,

2750
02:13:45,211 --> 02:13:49,440
that that's when his Arnica Arnica is,
um,

2751
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:53,490
it's,
it's anti inflammatory or anti microbial

2752
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:58,870
mean.
It's used for like mouthwash kind of 

2753
02:13:58,870 --> 02:13:58,870
thing.
It's,

2754
02:13:58,870 --> 02:14:00,870
it's potent at inhibiting.
I'm aerobic bacteria.

2755
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:02,700
Bacteria that are aerobic.
So,

2756
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:04,920
so that's,
you know,

2757
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:10,220
I haven't done a ton of research on the,
but it's the one thing that it does do 

2758
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:14,280
golden rule is another one that's always
partnered with Achalasia gold.

2759
02:14:14,290 --> 02:14:15,640
Golden Seal.
Golden.

2760
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:17,340
That's right.
No,

2761
02:14:17,341 --> 02:14:17,910
you're right.
You're,

2762
02:14:17,950 --> 02:14:22,950
you're bringing back memories from like,
I don't know because I just haven't 

2763
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:23,400
looked into those.
I haven't been.

2764
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:29,450
I know the things that are good are the 
polyphenols course to 10 in Kerman 

2765
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:32,300
Turmeric in general because of the 
tomorrow.

2766
02:14:32,301 --> 02:14:37,301
And I'm the inositol assisting in Alpha 
lipoic acid is another way to increase 

2767
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:42,890
glutathione.
That's also impart important for 

2768
02:14:42,890 --> 02:14:42,890
mitochondrial function.

2769
02:14:42,890 --> 02:14:43,110
So,
you know,

2770
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:45,750
there are,
there are good things and who knows some

2771
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:47,460
of these.
Yeah,

2772
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:50,280
Alpha lipoic acid is interesting 
because,

2773
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:53,100
um,
my actually my mentor,

2774
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:58,730
he is one of the pioneers that showed 
when you give alpha lipoic acid to old 

2775
02:14:59,251 --> 02:15:01,470
rats showed this like,
I don't know,

2776
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:04,860
15 years ago,
I guess it made them young again,

2777
02:15:04,861 --> 02:15:07,290
like their brain,
like made their brains young.

2778
02:15:07,291 --> 02:15:10,280
So when you gave them to old rats,
it was reversing aging.

2779
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:13,200
How do they administer?
It was an intravenous.

2780
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:13,930
Oh,
you know,

2781
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:18,950
I don't remember.
I don't remember if it was intravenous 

2782
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:18,950
or not.
I can easily check that,

2783
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:21,960
check that out.
But Alpha lipoic acid does get absorbed.

2784
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:25,860
It actually gets absorbed better when 
it's not taken with protein,

2785
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:28,830
interestingly enough,
because it binds.

2786
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:31,500
Usually it's something we make 
ourselves,

2787
02:15:31,530 --> 02:15:33,140
like plants make it,
it's in,

2788
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:35,540
it's in food that we eat and it's also,
you know,

2789
02:15:35,630 --> 02:15:37,200
we have,
we make it in our body,

2790
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:39,270
um,
but it,

2791
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:41,700
when it's complex to protein for some 
reason.

2792
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:43,230
And I don't,
it's been so long.

2793
02:15:43,231 --> 02:15:46,140
It's been quite a few years since I read
about this mechanism.

2794
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:47,850
But something about it,
um,

2795
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:53,460
does it doesn't get absorbed because 
it's like getting cleaved away or 

2796
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:56,901
something with the protein.
So actually taking Alpha lipoic acid 

2797
02:15:56,901 --> 02:15:56,901
supplement should be taken on an empty 
stomach.

2798
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:58,870
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

2799
02:15:59,060 --> 02:15:59,860
Yeah.
No.

2800
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:05,450
Which is kind of different than other 
foods where you take them with morphine 

2801
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:09,120
or how many people like listen to all 
this information and there's a lot of 

2802
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:10,980
people listening this podcast right now,
like fuck,

2803
02:16:11,370 --> 02:16:14,610
there's too much to really take into 
consideration.

2804
02:16:14,611 --> 02:16:15,840
There's too much.
Like,

2805
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:17,610
okay,
I need some of that,

2806
02:16:17,611 --> 02:16:19,700
but I don't want protein.
Okay.

2807
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:20,940
What do I take it?
Okay.

2808
02:16:20,941 --> 02:16:22,280
Light bulbs,
Somo,

2809
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:25,800
gludethyon.
Is that legit or do I need a lot of fun?

2810
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:30,830
Okay.
So I'll take turmeric and then I'll get 

2811
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:30,830
my,
the same thing

2812
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:33,010
that I would get from people on the 
subway right now,

2813
02:16:33,011 --> 02:16:38,011
writing on their hands,
trying to put all the shit in their 

2814
02:16:38,011 --> 02:16:40,450
head.
How much stuff should you take a day?

2815
02:16:40,830 --> 02:16:42,820
And how much of this can you get from 
your food?

2816
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:44,390
Can you get this free food?
Yeah,

2817
02:16:44,391 --> 02:16:49,391
absolutely.
Like there's apple podcasts and your 

2818
02:16:49,391 --> 02:16:49,391
food when you're cooking.
What kind of foods?

2819
02:16:49,391 --> 02:16:50,350
I think,
you know,

2820
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,600
I think that it's,
you know,

2821
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:53,950
Joe,
it's been so long I can't,

2822
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:55,570
I can't recall which ones have the,
most of it.

2823
02:16:55,571 --> 02:16:59,020
It's in a lot of foods,
but in terms of concentration wise,

2824
02:16:59,021 --> 02:17:02,170
I forgot.
But the thing is,

2825
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:02,970
is that,
you know,

2826
02:17:02,971 --> 02:17:06,220
like I'll take alpha lipoic acid.
It's not part of my staple,

2827
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:07,810
you know,
my,

2828
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:12,840
what I really,
really focused on is on micronutrients 

2829
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,721
that are part of all these biochemical 
pathways that are going on in all of 

2830
02:17:15,721 --> 02:17:15,850
ourselves,
including our brain.

2831
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:17,800
Those things I want to make sure I'm 
getting.

2832
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:20,560
That's key.
So getting the Omega threes,

2833
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:22,210
getting my EPA,
Dha,

2834
02:17:22,211 --> 02:17:24,550
getting vitamin D,
magnesium,

2835
02:17:24,551 --> 02:17:26,260
getting all my minerals,
calcium,

2836
02:17:26,261 --> 02:17:27,230
magnesium,
getting that right,

2837
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,470
making sure I get all that stuff.
Vitamin C,

2838
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:32,890
like all I need all those micronutrients
and I want to make sure I get that.

2839
02:17:32,891 --> 02:17:34,510
That's most important.
Um,

2840
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,340
the other stuff,
you know,

2841
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:41,341
like the taking the current curcumin or 
turmeric and I'm glad with my own things

2842
02:17:44,111 --> 02:17:45,170
like that,
you know,

2843
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:48,310
those are more,
I think other measures that you can,

2844
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:50,500
I think first and foremost,
healthy diet,

2845
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:55,800
you know,
making sure you're eliminating the 

2846
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:55,800
inflammation at the source of it,
which is,

2847
02:17:55,800 --> 02:18:00,661
you know,
making sure you're not causing too much 

2848
02:18:00,661 --> 02:18:00,850
inflammation by eating,
eating sugar and refined crap.

2849
02:18:00,851 --> 02:18:05,851
Just eat.
You want to make sure you're eating a 

2850
02:18:05,851 --> 02:18:07,090
lot of micronutrients,
eating your meats that are not all crazy

2851
02:18:07,570 --> 02:18:09,090
a processed.

2852
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:14,100
Yeah.
And nitrites and nitrates night.

2853
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:19,010
Well,
nitrates aren't used for um,

2854
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:20,840
you know,
they're in,

2855
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:23,310
they're in,
they're an all plant later,

2856
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,890
like everywhere in nature.
Um,

2857
02:18:25,390 --> 02:18:30,390
nitrites are used to cure me and like 
lunch meats and bake a lot of bacon,

2858
02:18:30,551 --> 02:18:31,720
I think has it.
Um,

2859
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:36,810
the difference is that I try,
it's can form a nature,

2860
02:18:37,230 --> 02:18:42,220
a nitrosamines which are potent 
carcinogens.

2861
02:18:42,221 --> 02:18:47,221
So they basically what they do is they 
bind to your DNA and they formed this 

2862
02:18:47,221 --> 02:18:47,740
bolt,
bulky adduct on your DNA.

2863
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:50,560
And what happens is when your cell tries
to replicate,

2864
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:53,380
so that's DNA damage,
a bulky addicts and I trusted means they

2865
02:18:53,381 --> 02:18:56,680
like interact with DNA and then when the
cell replicates,

2866
02:18:56,681 --> 02:18:58,450
like the,
the,

2867
02:18:58,770 --> 02:19:03,770
the replication machinery,
you can't recognize that DNA sequence 

2868
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:05,140
because there's a big thing sitting 
there and so it just puts anything there

2869
02:19:05,141 --> 02:19:08,020
and it's actually associated with a 
specific type of mutation.

2870
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:10,000
I think it's a Gett one.
It's been a while.

2871
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:10,800
But,
um,

2872
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:13,510
that causes,
that's associated with cancer,

2873
02:19:13,511 --> 02:19:15,310
which is why it's labeled as a 
carcinogen.

2874
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:19,000
Um,
so nitrites can form that.

2875
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:22,400
Um,
mostly because they're in,

2876
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:24,430
when they're in an accurate,
accurate solution,

2877
02:19:24,431 --> 02:19:29,330
they conform nitrous acid which then can
react with amiens which are everywhere.

2878
02:19:29,331 --> 02:19:31,690
And proteins like amino acids,
like ambience.

2879
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,630
So that reacted to,
that,

2880
02:19:32,631 --> 02:19:33,890
informed them,
conform on,

2881
02:19:33,891 --> 02:19:38,420
I trusted me.
So that's not a good thing.

2882
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,850
And nitrates,
you can form.

2883
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,940
Nitrates can form nitrites,
like in the saliva,

2884
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:46,730
we have bacteria in our saliva that can 
do that.

2885
02:19:46,731 --> 02:19:51,731
And I've seen studies everywhere and 
anywhere ranging from like five,

2886
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:55,370
five to 20 percent or something like 
that where it can form.

2887
02:19:55,390 --> 02:19:57,980
Nitrates are starting nitrites and 
nitrates conform,

2888
02:19:58,070 --> 02:20:02,750
so eating lots of plants to inform which
get into your system,

2889
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:05,710
but a significant amount can be toxic.

2890
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:06,530
Well,
um,

2891
02:20:06,531 --> 02:20:11,300
so while there is,
I don't remember what the toxicity,

2892
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:13,220
I think that there is something that can
happen,

2893
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:18,470
but so there's a,
there's a nitrates conform nitric oxide,

2894
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:20,660
which is a vasodilator.
It's,

2895
02:20:20,661 --> 02:20:25,661
you know,
it's kind of a good thing and actually 

2896
02:20:25,661 --> 02:20:26,891
they use,
sometimes they use that to help people 

2897
02:20:26,891 --> 02:20:26,891
with hypertension.
Um,

2898
02:20:26,891 --> 02:20:27,710
and I tried to,
can also form that,

2899
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:33,160
but it depends on whether or not there's
enough antioxidant around like vitamin C

2900
02:20:33,551 --> 02:20:38,551
or other antioxidants because nitrites,
because they'd be formed this nitrous 

2901
02:20:38,551 --> 02:20:42,971
acid acid in acquia solution,
they can immediately then go into 

2902
02:20:42,971 --> 02:20:47,171
nitrogen means,
but if you have this reducing agent 

2903
02:20:47,171 --> 02:20:47,570
around,
then you can shift them nitrites to form

2904
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,270
night nitris nitric oxide.
Uh,

2905
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:52,160
but so plants,
right,

2906
02:20:52,161 --> 02:20:57,161
which is good,
but so plants have a lot of vitamin C 

2907
02:20:57,161 --> 02:20:57,161
when you're eating the nitrates in the 
plants,

2908
02:20:57,161 --> 02:20:59,100
you're getting vitamin C,
you're getting all these antioxidants,

2909
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:02,840
vitamin CS and Kale,
celery,

2910
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:03,440
all that stuff.

2911
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:05,180
It's there.
So you don't,

2912
02:21:05,181 --> 02:21:10,181
they've done studies where they've 
looked at the amount of nitrogen means 

2913
02:21:10,181 --> 02:21:12,560
formed from either nitrites or nitrates 
and like so for meat like meat,

2914
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:17,730
nitrates that are cured meat and they've
shown that nitrates don't form those as 

2915
02:21:17,730 --> 02:21:19,790
readily because it's warming the nitric 
oxide instead,

2916
02:21:19,791 --> 02:21:24,791
especially because there's a lot of 
vitamin C around which inhibits the 

2917
02:21:24,791 --> 02:21:26,951
formation of the nitrogen mean if you,
if you take the nitrites and the cured 

2918
02:21:26,951 --> 02:21:31,931
me,
then you're not getting a lot of 

2919
02:21:31,931 --> 02:21:31,931
antioxidants unless you're eating them 
also with it.

2920
02:21:31,931 --> 02:21:33,530
Uh,
but in the case where you're cooking the

2921
02:21:33,531 --> 02:21:38,531
nitrites cooking is dangerous because 
can be dangerous because when you cook 

2922
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:40,830
water,
you know,

2923
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:45,080
water is,
have you get water and the nitrites in,

2924
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:50,360
in accurate solution and water form 
nitrogen form nitric acid which then 

2925
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:53,840
react with the degradation products of 
amino acids from like Bacon for example,

2926
02:21:53,841 --> 02:21:55,750
like has protein and they formed trust 
in me.

2927
02:21:55,751 --> 02:21:59,500
And so cooking conformed the Nitros the 
means and you can ingest them.

2928
02:21:59,501 --> 02:22:04,460
So cured bacon with,
with chemicals is what's bad for you.

2929
02:22:04,461 --> 02:22:05,860
I don't,
I'm not a big fan of,

2930
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,310
of eating nitrites daily or even weekly.
Um,

2931
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:14,640
you know that I think if you love Bacon,
why not just buy the stuff without the 

2932
02:22:14,871 --> 02:22:16,770
nitrites?
They make it without it.

2933
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:18,560
You can get to the butcher shop where 
it's not.

2934
02:22:18,590 --> 02:22:23,590
Right.
I think I've even seen it like at 

2935
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:23,590
Berkeley Bowl,
like we're,

2936
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:26,400
we're a shop so it's not so are bad and 
I traits

2937
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:29,500
or plant formed and nitrates can form my
truck.

2938
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,520
It's just,
I know it was like a little confusing 

2939
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:34,920
and complicated,
but commonly misconstrued commonly.

2940
02:22:34,921 --> 02:22:36,000
Yeah.
They commonly get.

2941
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,090
Yes.
So yeah,

2942
02:22:39,091 --> 02:22:42,120
nine traits are not what are curing 
meat.

2943
02:22:42,121 --> 02:22:44,250
Nitrates are Woodson plants and you can 
form them.

2944
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:46,860
You can form nitrites from them.
However,

2945
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:48,510
because of all the vitamin C and all 
that,

2946
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:53,570
they don't readily form.
They chose the meetings I trust that 

2947
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:53,570
means which is the bad stuff,
that it's the carcinogen.

2948
02:22:53,790 --> 02:22:55,350
That's,
that's what you don't want to form.

2949
02:22:55,590 --> 02:23:00,330
It forms nitric oxide more readily so 
and nitrites can form nitric oxide,

2950
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:03,990
but they also form nitrogen means.
And particularly if there's not a lot of

2951
02:23:03,991 --> 02:23:05,520
vitamin C,
your antioxidants around,

2952
02:23:05,521 --> 02:23:07,150
they can get pushed towards that.
And I trust him.

2953
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:09,360
Can State.
Yeah,

2954
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:12,960
Uber complicated.
It's so complicated.

2955
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:18,050
I've seen the switched.
I'm all over the place on the Internet 

2956
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:18,120
actually.

2957
02:23:18,410 --> 02:23:23,410
So I know a lot about it because my 
mentor studied nitrospan means and he 

2958
02:23:23,791 --> 02:23:28,791
was like one of the pioneering guys that
like was talking about how this DNA 

2959
02:23:28,791 --> 02:23:29,520
damage causes cancer.
So I've,

2960
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:31,980
he's told me about them,
you know,

2961
02:23:31,981 --> 02:23:36,981
so I know a little bit,
a little bit about them and he knows a 

2962
02:23:36,981 --> 02:23:39,591
lot more than it.
So it just seems like one of those 

2963
02:23:39,591 --> 02:23:42,561
things where when you're,
when you're talking about all these 

2964
02:23:42,561 --> 02:23:45,381
different nutrients and you talking 
about this is a real constant area of 

2965
02:23:45,571 --> 02:23:48,360
study for anybody who wants to be 
consistently healthy.

2966
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:53,840
Anybody who really wants to have a 
really nutritionally balanced diet and 

2967
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:58,310
optimize their health and their 
potential to recover from illness and 

2968
02:23:59,070 --> 02:24:00,870
prevent certain,
you know,

2969
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:06,110
certain damage and free radicals and all
the areas that could be problematic in 

2970
02:24:06,721 --> 02:24:10,460
our world and our diets.
This just so much to think about.

2971
02:24:10,470 --> 02:24:12,650
There's so much to calculate.
I,

2972
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:13,530
yeah,
I think that,

2973
02:24:13,531 --> 02:24:18,531
um,
one of the main things I think that my 

2974
02:24:18,531 --> 02:24:23,421
advice would be,
it's a lot easier to focus on what you 

2975
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:27,051
should eat then on what you shouldn't.
And I think that in more inclusionary 

2976
02:24:27,571 --> 02:24:29,100
diet is,
is key.

2977
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:32,780
So focusing on what your body needs,
you know,

2978
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:35,760
not only for short term but what it 
needs for longterm.

2979
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:39,810
Focus on that more than focus on what 
you're eliminated from your diet because

2980
02:24:39,811 --> 02:24:41,460
it's just,
first of all,

2981
02:24:41,461 --> 02:24:43,320
if you focus on what your limiting from 
your diet,

2982
02:24:43,321 --> 02:24:45,630
then you're not going to be getting all 
the good stuff that you need.

2983
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:49,480
That's a lot about loss.
You're also thinking if you need that,

2984
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:52,020
it's just like it's so there's too many 
little.

2985
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:57,650
It's easy to become caught up in a lot 
of my new show and I know this because 

2986
02:24:57,650 --> 02:24:58,080
I've been there.

2987
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:00,600
And so,
you know,

2988
02:25:00,601 --> 02:25:02,310
getting caught up in all this little 
minutia,

2989
02:25:02,311 --> 02:25:05,040
you know,
it can take you forever to try to figure

2990
02:25:05,041 --> 02:25:07,350
out what's going on.
And then in the meantime,

2991
02:25:07,351 --> 02:25:09,900
you're getting distracted from the 
important thing is not as what you need.

2992
02:25:09,901 --> 02:25:12,690
You know your body,
your body is very resilient,

2993
02:25:12,691 --> 02:25:16,200
and if you feed it what it needs,
you can fight off stuff.

2994
02:25:16,201 --> 02:25:16,680
You're,
you're gonna,

2995
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:21,710
you're gonna age better.
You know all these little chemical 

2996
02:25:21,710 --> 02:25:22,530
reactions and enzymatic reactions going 
on in all your cells,

2997
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,190
in your liver and your kidney and your 
brain.

2998
02:25:24,191 --> 02:25:29,191
All these things,
they're going to keep happening because 

2999
02:25:29,191 --> 02:25:30,841
you're feeding it.
And when you have a little bit of toxic 

3000
02:25:30,841 --> 02:25:30,841
stuff,
guess what?

3001
02:25:30,841 --> 02:25:32,890
All of these pathways are ready because 
they're so they're getting nourished,

3002
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:34,960
are getting what they need that they 
activate in the.

3003
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:38,290
Your body has protective mechanisms to 
make sure it doesn't get cancer.

3004
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:43,320
And you know,
I explained that when you make reactive 

3005
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:45,691
oxygen species,
you can repair it or you can see the 

3006
02:25:45,691 --> 02:25:45,691
cell will die.
But all those,

3007
02:25:45,691 --> 02:25:48,220
all those repairs,
a stress response mechanisms,

3008
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:50,540
they require that you know,
you're,

3009
02:25:50,610 --> 02:25:52,510
you're giving yourselves what they need 
to do that.

3010
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:57,540
So if you're so focused on what not to 
eat that you're not getting enough of 

3011
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:58,600
what you need,
then your body is,

3012
02:25:58,690 --> 02:26:03,690
you know,
capacity to do that isn't gonna be as 

3013
02:26:03,690 --> 02:26:03,690
optimal.
So I really like,

3014
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:08,790
I really think it's easier,
especially for people that don't have a 

3015
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:09,640
scientific background that don't have 
time.

3016
02:26:09,641 --> 02:26:14,641
I mean because it takes a lot of time to
sit there and read through all the 

3017
02:26:14,641 --> 02:26:15,310
scientific studies and figure out what's
going on,

3018
02:26:15,311 --> 02:26:17,440
all the complex interactions,
you know,

3019
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:21,550
I barely have time to do that and it's 
like I do this every day.

3020
02:26:21,550 --> 02:26:24,340
Like I do research every day and on top 
of that in my spare time I do.

3021
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:27,820
And it's still overwhelming and I still 
can only get so much done.

3022
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:32,910
And you have the education to deal with 
all the information and you understand 

3023
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:35,410
what's going on and the mechanisms 
behind it.

3024
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:36,210
Yeah.
Well,

3025
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:41,220
you know,
last time we were here we talked about 

3026
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:42,340
some of the dis information that even 
medical professionals,

3027
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:47,260
guys who've written books that without 
an understanding of the different,

3028
02:26:47,261 --> 02:26:52,261
like we talked about vitamin e and the,
the understanding of the different 

3029
02:26:52,261 --> 02:26:55,801
mechanisms involved in vitamin D,
absorption in the body and people who 

3030
02:26:55,801 --> 02:26:58,060
have written books that are incorrect 
about the,

3031
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:03,210
what's negative about high levels and 
what is good about high levels and what 

3032
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:03,540
is,
you know,

3033
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:08,600
what,
how your body should be processing it 

3034
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:11,130
and what different types of vitamin 
either is just so there's so many 

3035
02:27:11,501 --> 02:27:12,220
variables.

3036
02:27:12,220 --> 02:27:13,570
There's so much going on.
Uh,

3037
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:18,590
yeah,
I think that in addition to so many 

3038
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:21,601
variables and it being so complex where 
we're also continually finding out new 

3039
02:27:21,601 --> 02:27:22,120
things,
you know,

3040
02:27:22,121 --> 02:27:27,121
I'm talking about studies that were 
published two months ago in the context 

3041
02:27:27,121 --> 02:27:27,730
of traumatic brain injury in some of 
these neural stem cells.

3042
02:27:27,731 --> 02:27:32,731
I mean,
it takes a continual searching of the 

3043
02:27:32,731 --> 02:27:33,190
literature,
you know,

3044
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:38,191
to,
to keep up to date with all the new 

3045
02:27:38,191 --> 02:27:38,191
research.
And,

3046
02:27:38,191 --> 02:27:41,200
and that's incredibly difficult to do 
when you're occupied full time.

3047
02:27:42,071 --> 02:27:47,071
As for example,
as a physician and you're treating 

3048
02:27:47,071 --> 02:27:47,830
patients already overworked,
you know,

3049
02:27:47,831 --> 02:27:48,700
these are things,
it's,

3050
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:52,060
it's extremely difficult for a lot of 
physicians.

3051
02:27:52,061 --> 02:27:57,061
First of all,
they haven't been trained in a lot of 

3052
02:27:57,061 --> 02:27:57,670
these biochemical pathways in nutrition 
and mechanisms.

3053
02:27:57,860 --> 02:28:01,270
I think that the training itself 
inherently it's flawed.

3054
02:28:01,810 --> 02:28:06,810
Um,
and that's something that needs to be 

3055
02:28:06,810 --> 02:28:06,810
changed at the institutional level.

3056
02:28:06,810 --> 02:28:08,740
You know,
I think that doctors need to be,

3057
02:28:09,730 --> 02:28:14,730
there needs to be more of a focus on 
understanding how nutrition interacts 

3058
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:16,420
with genes,
how diet interacts with genes,

3059
02:28:16,421 --> 02:28:19,750
how these complex biochemical pathways,
why they,

3060
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:22,820
why they need all these different 
micronutrients as cofactors,

3061
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:24,860
make enzymes work and all this stuff 
that's not,

3062
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:30,110
that's,
that's lacking in the medical 

3063
02:28:30,110 --> 02:28:31,841
profession.
I know that talking [inaudible] I have 

3064
02:28:31,841 --> 02:28:31,841
several friends that are physicians have
told me and also because,

3065
02:28:31,841 --> 02:28:36,310
you know,
even people that aren't my friends that 

3066
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:36,560
are physicians have told me that they 
don't get trained in this way.

3067
02:28:36,790 --> 02:28:39,140
Um,
so I think that's really,

3068
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:41,480
you know,
that's one of the flaws in medicine,

3069
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:45,290
but in addition to that,
you have doctors that work really hard.

3070
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:46,190
You know,
and I,

3071
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:50,090
I respect them,
I think that they do to some degree,

3072
02:28:50,091 --> 02:28:50,470
you know,
they,

3073
02:28:50,471 --> 02:28:51,860
they,
they train hard,

3074
02:28:51,861 --> 02:28:56,360
they work hard and they try,
they're trying to somehow help people.

3075
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:58,690
They're trying to diagnose diseases and 
um,

3076
02:28:58,760 --> 02:28:59,890
to some degree that,
you know,

3077
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:02,150
they do do that.
But um,

3078
02:29:02,151 --> 02:29:07,151
I think the problem is that they also 
can't keep up with all the new 

3079
02:29:07,151 --> 02:29:07,910
literature that can't keep up with the 
new research.

3080
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:13,360
And then there's the whole human 
component that comes in when you got 

3081
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:15,770
your patient that knows more about 
something than you do.

3082
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:20,890
Sometimes ego gets in the way and your 
immediate response is sort of a jerk 

3083
02:29:20,890 --> 02:29:21,020
knee response where it's like,
no,

3084
02:29:21,021 --> 02:29:23,240
this can't be true because I'm the 
leader.

3085
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:25,970
I'm the person that knows this.
And especially when you're talking about

3086
02:29:25,971 --> 02:29:28,610
things like you were talking about the 
study with the mice,

3087
02:29:28,670 --> 02:29:33,670
the showing that the,
the neurons or actually it's stimulating

3088
02:29:33,891 --> 02:29:38,891
the stem cell growth that this is all so
new and you're talking about something 

3089
02:29:38,891 --> 02:29:40,450
that's like a couple months old.
If your,

3090
02:29:40,451 --> 02:29:43,100
your degree was in the nineties,
good fucking luck.

3091
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:44,540
No,
it's true.

3092
02:29:44,541 --> 02:29:45,180
It's,
you know,

3093
02:29:45,181 --> 02:29:46,480
it's,
you know,

3094
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,770
I do like for me,
I,

3095
02:29:48,771 --> 02:29:51,470
I'm putting out some of these videos and
I do this,

3096
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:53,300
you know,
I'm sort of,

3097
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I'm trying to do it more frequently,
but some of my videos are a little more 

3098
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,990
complex than like the general,
you know,

3099
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:06,220
educational video.
Like I try to really be comprehensive 

3100
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:06,520
and bring it home and sort of,
you know,

3101
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:11,660
make sure I explained mechanism and 
context and all those things and I've 

3102
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:15,191
been getting emails from positions that 
are thanking me because they're saying 

3103
02:30:15,191 --> 02:30:15,191
they never knew this and they don't have
time.

3104
02:30:15,191 --> 02:30:19,070
And it's really rewarding in addition to
like educating the public,

3105
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:24,670
you know,
like I think that's also very important 

3106
02:30:24,670 --> 02:30:24,670
and making sure the public people that,
you know,

3107
02:30:24,670 --> 02:30:28,780
understanding how to prevent disease,
understanding what you need to try to 

3108
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:32,000
optimally optimally perform is as good 
as you can now and to age as best as you

3109
02:30:32,001 --> 02:30:32,360
can.

3110
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:37,600
That's important.
But it's also important for physicians 

3111
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:37,600
to understand the things that they 
didn't get.

3112
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:40,370
They didn't get trained in and they 
don't have time to read about.

3113
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:45,490
It's almost impossible if you have a 
full practice and you're constantly 

3114
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:48,500
training people on a daily basis and 
exactly how much education is involved 

3115
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:53,810
in getting a degree in nutrition.
Well,

3116
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:55,700
I mean when you,
even if you're a doctor,

3117
02:30:55,701 --> 02:31:00,701
if your general practitioner,
how much of your time is really spent 

3118
02:31:00,701 --> 02:31:02,630
learning about nutrition and when you go
to a doctor for advice but nutrition,

3119
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:06,890
you're almost better off just fucking 
googling it.

3120
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:09,290
Yeah.
I don't know how much time.

3121
02:31:09,291 --> 02:31:12,710
I think that relatively speaking to the 
rest of their training,

3122
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:15,010
I would say it's not much.
Um,

3123
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:20,350
and you know,
also getting into new degree in 

3124
02:31:20,350 --> 02:31:20,350
nutrition is also.

3125
02:31:20,350 --> 02:31:21,320
I mean,
like I,

3126
02:31:21,370 --> 02:31:23,820
I got a degree in biomedical science and
I'm,

3127
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:24,590
you know,
I've,

3128
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:29,430
I've done research on aging cancer and 
now I'm doing some nutrition research,

3129
02:31:30,390 --> 02:31:34,350
but I think that even getting a degree 
in nutrition has flaws because,

3130
02:31:34,610 --> 02:31:36,300
you know,
I think that some of these,

3131
02:31:36,870 --> 02:31:41,870
some of the dogma with nutrition itself 
is been changing with new science and 

3132
02:31:42,511 --> 02:31:45,030
then getting people to like change their
state of mind.

3133
02:31:45,031 --> 02:31:46,500
I mean,
that's always harder to do,

3134
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:50,820
especially when they've been spewing 
this out for years and uh,

3135
02:31:51,090 --> 02:31:53,210
and also that a lot of,
you know,

3136
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:54,720
degrees in nutrition,
you know,

3137
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:59,750
like they don't have a real hardcore 
science in some cases like a science 

3138
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:01,020
background where it's like,
I always liked,

3139
02:32:01,050 --> 02:32:02,940
I like to change fields.
I'm changing my,

3140
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,860
I've changed my field several times,
you know,

3141
02:32:04,861 --> 02:32:09,780
I've started out doing chemistry,
looking at the very,

3142
02:32:09,781 --> 02:32:14,781
very molecular level and then I went 
into aging research and then cancer and 

3143
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:16,560
now I'm doing nutrition and now I'm 
getting,

3144
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:21,620
now I'm even getting into the brain.
So I think that it's Kinda cool to also 

3145
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:26,180
have different perspectives like where 
it's like because you see things that 

3146
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:27,840
other people had been in that field 
forever don't see,

3147
02:32:28,210 --> 02:32:28,850
you know,
like,

3148
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:34,020
you know,
the neural stem cells and there's not a 

3149
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:37,470
lot of nutrition people talking about 
neural stem cells and things nutrition 

3150
02:32:37,470 --> 02:32:39,560
that are important for that.
So it's,

3151
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:42,240
yeah,
it's definitely,

3152
02:32:42,241 --> 02:32:47,241
it's hard for the,
for the average person to figure out 

3153
02:32:47,241 --> 02:32:47,241
what they should eat or what they should
supplement.

3154
02:32:47,241 --> 02:32:47,930
I know that you were saying

3155
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:54,420
one of the companies that you're 
involved with does like nutritional 

3156
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:57,901
scans on people.
You'll do like a blood work panel and 

3157
02:32:57,901 --> 02:32:59,020
then recommend what the person is 
deficient in.

3158
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:01,170
Yeah,
so I'm not involved with them.

3159
02:33:01,171 --> 02:33:04,640
I had done some.
I've done a couple of guest blog post.

3160
02:33:04,930 --> 02:33:09,750
I'm a little over a year ago to sort of 
a because I liked what they were doing.

3161
02:33:09,751 --> 02:33:10,740
Basically.
I like the service.

3162
02:33:10,780 --> 02:33:15,780
They companies with wellness.
Fx wellness effects is cool because 

3163
02:33:15,780 --> 02:33:17,450
they.
They are they,

3164
02:33:17,470 --> 02:33:20,430
they're basically consumer based where 
it's like you sort of,

3165
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:26,220
you don't have to go get a doctor's 
prescription to go get your blood work 

3166
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,600
and to look at things like c reactive 
protein,

3167
02:33:27,601 --> 02:33:29,360
your vitamin D levels,
you know,

3168
02:33:29,370 --> 02:33:31,650
your rbc,
magnesium,

3169
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:33,570
your lipid profile,
you know,

3170
02:33:33,571 --> 02:33:35,580
these sorts of things.
Omega three they do.

3171
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:40,581
They measure ea at EPA and Dha and they 
also measured the Omega three to Omega 

3172
02:33:40,581 --> 02:33:42,570
six ratio,
which is also important.

3173
02:33:42,571 --> 02:33:47,571
I mean having too much of omega six 
fatty acids also leads to that 

3174
02:33:47,571 --> 02:33:48,480
inflammation,
that generation of Youtube series,

3175
02:33:48,481 --> 02:33:50,310
prostoglandins and the brain and the 
body.

3176
02:33:50,311 --> 02:33:52,770
It's causing inflammation in,
so having a,

3177
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:57,000
having a good omega six to Omega three 
ratio is also really good.

3178
02:33:57,320 --> 02:34:00,180
Um,
so they do that as well and I think that

3179
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:05,780
people that are going to get these tests
done and then they get their blood work 

3180
02:34:05,780 --> 02:34:05,840
and then they,
you know,

3181
02:34:05,850 --> 02:34:10,850
they'll wellness fx has like a panel of 
nutritionists and other physicians I'm 

3182
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:16,190
not really familiar with.
They help people interpret and to what 

3183
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:16,620
degree they know what they're doing.
I can't tell you,

3184
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:18,040
but the point is,

3185
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,230
is that you have that information.
You can,

3186
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,540
you can also learn a lot from the 
internet,

3187
02:34:22,541 --> 02:34:23,970
but also you can,
uh,

3188
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:29,820
look at your baseline and make dietary 
changes and start to see how things 

3189
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:30,790
change.
Like that's really important.

3190
02:34:30,850 --> 02:34:35,850
You know,
this quantifying this quantified self 

3191
02:34:35,850 --> 02:34:38,461
movement,
it's called where you're basically 

3192
02:34:38,461 --> 02:34:38,461
quantifying your own thing,
you know,

3193
02:34:38,461 --> 02:34:41,550
blood work and things like that,
and figuring out how to optimize 

3194
02:34:41,550 --> 02:34:41,550
yourself.
That's a lot of work.

3195
02:34:41,550 --> 02:34:45,240
It seems like it'd be really problematic
to find a lot of Rhonda Patrick's out 

3196
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:46,840
there though.
I don't know how many of you there are.

3197
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:49,630
I'm not blowing smoke up your ass 
because you're my friend and I love you,

3198
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:54,130
but if there was 100 Rhonda Patrick's 
out there running clinics,

3199
02:34:54,370 --> 02:34:57,340
who will be awesome.
That means 100 cities could have a place

3200
02:34:57,341 --> 02:35:02,341
where you could go and you could get 
someone who's really completely absorbed

3201
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:07,860
in this sort of research like you are,
give you a real systematic breakdown of 

3202
02:35:08,891 --> 02:35:09,550
your diet.

3203
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:12,130
Here's your profile.
This is what you're missing is.

3204
02:35:12,470 --> 02:35:14,840
This is fucking difficult.
Chip.

3205
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:16,720
Well thank you for that compliment.
But I,

3206
02:35:16,721 --> 02:35:18,340
um,
I think that,

3207
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:23,670
you know,
getting the blood work done and looking 

3208
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:26,281
at these different micronutrients and 
biomarkers and liberal panel lipid 

3209
02:35:26,281 --> 02:35:29,851
panels is one aspect of it.
And I think the other aspect that I'm 

3210
02:35:29,851 --> 02:35:31,990
becoming increasingly interested in is 
getting the genetic data as well,

3211
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:33,900
like 23 and me.
So I,

3212
02:35:33,901 --> 02:35:34,900
you know,
I'm,

3213
02:35:35,450 --> 02:35:37,810
you know,
I'm trying to figure out a way somehow I

3214
02:35:37,811 --> 02:35:42,811
can.
I'm getting more and more interested in 

3215
02:35:42,811 --> 02:35:45,121
because I'm looking a lot at these 
complex interaction between genes and 

3216
02:35:45,121 --> 02:35:46,060
diet and I'm trying to figure out,
okay,

3217
02:35:46,061 --> 02:35:49,270
you have this polymorphism.
You being me,

3218
02:35:49,271 --> 02:35:50,950
I have it.
Apo e four,

3219
02:35:51,130 --> 02:35:56,130
what do I do to make sure that I can 
give myself the best chance of not 

3220
02:35:56,441 --> 02:35:58,690
getting Alzheimer's disease,
excuse me,

3221
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:02,680
what can I do for my father who is 65 
years old now?

3222
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:07,920
And it's at a critical point.
I got to make sure that if I don't 

3223
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:09,370
somehow intervene now and make sure he's
doing things right,

3224
02:36:09,790 --> 02:36:12,670
that he's going to get Alzheimer's and I
probably want that even.

3225
02:36:12,910 --> 02:36:16,870
I want to make sure he doesn't get it 
even more than idea probably because you

3226
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:17,740
know,
when you have it,

3227
02:36:17,741 --> 02:36:19,930
it's,
I feel bad for all my family members,

3228
02:36:19,931 --> 02:36:21,070
you know,
but I won't really know.

3229
02:36:21,071 --> 02:36:21,520
It's,
it's,

3230
02:36:21,570 --> 02:36:26,570
it's dealing with your close loved ones 
and then completely losing their mind 

3231
02:36:26,570 --> 02:36:30,421
and not remembering who you are.
I can't think of a worse thing that can 

3232
02:36:30,421 --> 02:36:31,300
happen,
you know,

3233
02:36:31,301 --> 02:36:34,090
except from death.
Watched bunch of documentaries on people

3234
02:36:34,091 --> 02:36:36,010
with Alzheimer's and it's brutal.
And like I said,

3235
02:36:36,011 --> 02:36:41,011
I've seen the traumatic brain version of
it in fighters slowly start to appear.

3236
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:47,760
And uh,
not just in real time but in the highly 

3237
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:47,760
accelerated real time.

3238
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:51,400
Like I've seen a guy go from being one 
way,

3239
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:56,460
two to three fights later,
I see them a year later and he's a 

3240
02:36:56,460 --> 02:36:58,130
different guy and this is fairly common.
I see this.

3241
02:36:58,690 --> 02:37:00,760
You can literally see the struggle in 
their eyes.

3242
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:05,940
Wow.
See the struggle in the way they formed 

3243
02:37:05,940 --> 02:37:05,940
sentences.
Some of the.

3244
02:37:05,940 --> 02:37:08,730
I talked about some things that are 
possible to help you know,

3245
02:37:08,980 --> 02:37:10,780
people that are getting traumatic brain 
injury,

3246
02:37:10,781 --> 02:37:14,470
repetitive traumatic brain injury and 
obviously I really,

3247
02:37:14,530 --> 02:37:17,810
I really think that the Aicpa we for 
genetic test is.

3248
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:23,560
I would love to see that come into 
practice where we're talking adopted by 

3249
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:25,760
athletic commissions.
I'd like to see that adopted.

3250
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:28,940
Yes.
I'd like to see it adopted by NFL.

3251
02:37:28,941 --> 02:37:32,000
I'd like to see boxing,
mma.

3252
02:37:32,001 --> 02:37:37,001
I'd like to see all those types of 
athletic commissions adopted where it's 

3253
02:37:37,001 --> 02:37:37,001
like,
you know,

3254
02:37:37,790 --> 02:37:38,870
I don't want to say,
okay,

3255
02:37:38,871 --> 02:37:43,871
well they're going to say your April 
before you can't do that because I hate 

3256
02:37:43,871 --> 02:37:44,960
to like take that away from someone,
you know.

3257
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,070
I don't know.
Maybe maybe,

3258
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:51,100
maybe people will figure it out and 
there's some committee formed and 

3259
02:37:51,100 --> 02:37:51,100
they'll say,
you know what?

3260
02:37:51,100 --> 02:37:52,160
It's such a high risk that we aren't 
just can't.

3261
02:37:52,161 --> 02:37:55,880
Have you been a hemophiliac sword fight?
It is.

3262
02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:58,070
It really is.
It's just that bad.

3263
02:37:58,071 --> 02:38:03,071
I mean you're talking about going from 
just having that a Lele I'm already 

3264
02:38:03,071 --> 02:38:07,391
freaked out because I've got a two to 
three fold risk of Alzheimer's disease 

3265
02:38:07,391 --> 02:38:09,110
and you're talking about going from that
to attend in some cases,

3266
02:38:09,111 --> 02:38:09,740
you know,
10,

3267
02:38:09,741 --> 02:38:13,430
15 fold increase risk and and not only 
increased risk,

3268
02:38:13,431 --> 02:38:14,980
it's an earlier onset.
It,

3269
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,900
it changes the onset like by seven 
years.

3270
02:38:17,901 --> 02:38:19,610
So you're talking about getting it 17 
years,

3271
02:38:19,611 --> 02:38:23,060
almost a decade earlier than other 
people.

3272
02:38:23,061 --> 02:38:27,680
So that Aaliyah like having that isoform
and it's just an easy,

3273
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:32,800
it's an easy test to do.
Twenty three and me does it and doctors 

3274
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:32,810
do it as well.

3275
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:38,020
No.
There was a really a recent study 

3276
02:38:38,020 --> 02:38:39,881
published in the Journal of Alzheimer's 
disease that reported neuroscientists 

3277
02:38:39,881 --> 02:38:40,730
using a cellular model of the 
Alzheimer's,

3278
02:38:40,731 --> 02:38:45,731
found low doses of Delta nine 
tetrahydrocannabinol,

3279
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:51,010
which is thc from marijuana actually has
been shown to reduce the production of 

3280
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:59,420
amyloid Beta and prevented abnormal 
accumulation,

3281
02:38:59,421 --> 02:39:02,110
which is some of the early signs of 
memory loss,

3282
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:07,300
which is hilarious because marijuana has
been known to give people short term 

3283
02:39:07,300 --> 02:39:07,800
memory loss.
I mean,

3284
02:39:07,810 --> 02:39:12,810
that's the one thing that pot heads like
myself constantly complaining about the 

3285
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:13,880
fuck was I just talking about you,
what would,

3286
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:19,180
only when they're on it,
but when you were smoking marijuana or 

3287
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:20,000
eating it when you were intoxicated by 
it.

3288
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:25,120
The big thing is short term memory loss.
So it's interesting that you bring this 

3289
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,040
up because in my whole traumatic brain 
injury quest,

3290
02:39:28,041 --> 02:39:29,270
as I've been reading about,
you know,

3291
02:39:29,570 --> 02:39:31,430
recently,
um,

3292
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:36,580
cannabinoids came up on my radio radar 
because new studies have just recently 

3293
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:40,991
come out related to als to also 
traumatic brain injury where they found,

3294
02:39:41,001 --> 02:39:46,001
for example,
that patients that were admitted to the 

3295
02:39:46,001 --> 02:39:49,661
hospital after a traumatic brain injury,
I think it was like a mild to mild to 

3296
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:52,190
moderate.

3297
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:56,660
So it was like Glasgow Coma score of 
four or five.

3298
02:39:56,661 --> 02:39:58,150
It wasn't like a severe,
severe,

3299
02:39:58,250 --> 02:39:59,880
like totally like,
you know,

3300
02:39:59,881 --> 02:40:04,881
in a coma and all that.
But they found that those people that 

3301
02:40:04,881 --> 02:40:06,020
were admitted after having a traumatic 
brain injury,

3302
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:09,620
they,
those that had the highest levels of thc

3303
02:40:09,890 --> 02:40:13,070
in their blood were the least likely to 
die.

3304
02:40:13,290 --> 02:40:13,950
And it was like

3305
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,980
there was a dose dependent thing where 
they saw people that had higher levels 

3306
02:40:18,980 --> 02:40:19,740
were much less likely to die in the 
hospital.

3307
02:40:19,741 --> 02:40:22,900
So that sort of sparked my interest in 
like,

3308
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:27,910
what's going on.
I did a short little research and I 

3309
02:40:27,910 --> 02:40:31,461
found out that also,
even in mice mice that were given a low 

3310
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:36,560
dose of thc that was not high enough to 
have a psychotropic effect.

3311
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:39,180
Um,
it actually,

3312
02:40:39,181 --> 02:40:44,181
so they gave mice this low dose,
just a single low dose of thc either 48 

3313
02:40:45,751 --> 02:40:50,751
hours before the traumatic injury.
So they induced traumatic injury in the 

3314
02:40:50,751 --> 02:40:54,891
mice when they typically press put 
pressure on their little tiny mouse 

3315
02:40:54,891 --> 02:40:59,070
skulls and,
or they gave it to them one to seven 

3316
02:40:59,070 --> 02:40:59,370
days after the traumatic event had 
occurred.

3317
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:04,850
And what they found was that it 
dramatically reduced the whole neuro 

3318
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:07,620
inflammatory pathway.
There was less edema,

3319
02:41:07,621 --> 02:41:11,040
there was less inflammation,
less amyloid plaques were aggregated.

3320
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:13,530
So this is quite significant.
Um,

3321
02:41:13,531 --> 02:41:15,120
so I started reading just a little bit 
more.

3322
02:41:15,121 --> 02:41:18,180
I haven't done a ton of reading on this 
topic,

3323
02:41:18,181 --> 02:41:23,181
so I really am no expert by any means.
So apparently there's two different 

3324
02:41:24,361 --> 02:41:27,390
receptors.
Cannabinoid receptors in the brain,

3325
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:32,660
there's a CB one and CB two,
CB one is found on neurons predominantly

3326
02:41:32,971 --> 02:41:37,620
in cb two is found on the Microglia,
which are the immune cells of the brain,

3327
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:42,621
which is really interesting because 
they're also found in the immune cells 

3328
02:41:42,621 --> 02:41:45,710
in the body.
So it's like somebody about the CB two 

3329
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:46,260
receptor is specific to immune cells,
whether we're talking about immune cells

3330
02:41:46,261 --> 02:41:51,261
in the brain or in the periphery.
But what's interesting is that 

3331
02:41:51,261 --> 02:41:55,010
cannabinoid activation of the CB two 
receptors in the Microglia,

3332
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:00,680
it prevents them from getting activated 
and prevents them from throwing out all 

3333
02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:03,540
sorts of cytokines and causing all sorts
of neuroinflammatory cycles that happen.

3334
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:06,270
I don't know exactly how I think that 
it's.

3335
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:11,360
I think it's also well known that 
cannabinoids have some sort of anti 

3336
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:12,000
inflammatory effect in general.
Um,

3337
02:42:12,001 --> 02:42:17,001
so that is one likely mechanism.
And the other thing was the CB one 

3338
02:42:17,910 --> 02:42:22,910
receptors.
So they recently found this led me into 

3339
02:42:22,910 --> 02:42:23,120
this Alzheimer's.
There was studies.

3340
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:26,580
So the fact that it can protect from 
traumatic brain injury is,

3341
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:28,530
and it's that it's an anti inflammatory 
effect,

3342
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:32,250
is also is showing that this is relevant
for Alzheimer's.

3343
02:42:32,430 --> 02:42:33,870
So when I did a search on that,
sure enough,

3344
02:42:33,871 --> 02:42:38,871
yes,
it's like lots of studies actually had 

3345
02:42:38,871 --> 02:42:39,690
been done on the effects of cannabinoids
on Alzheimer's.

3346
02:42:40,290 --> 02:42:41,160
And so,
um,

3347
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:44,530
there was a recent study that showed 
that somehow the,

3348
02:42:44,570 --> 02:42:49,570
the receptor,
when you agonize the receptor cb one 

3349
02:42:49,570 --> 02:42:49,960
receptor on neurons,
it's,

3350
02:42:49,990 --> 02:42:51,540
um,
protects,

3351
02:42:51,810 --> 02:42:56,810
it does something where it's important 
for longterm potentiation and it's kind 

3352
02:42:56,810 --> 02:43:00,981
of a confusing mechanism,
but longterm potentiation is when you 

3353
02:43:00,981 --> 02:43:01,080
have.

3354
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:06,080
So during learning the learning process,
when you're learning something new and 

3355
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:10,640
you form,
you've got a synopsis forming between 

3356
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:10,980
the neurons and there's an enhancement 
in that,

3357
02:43:12,470 --> 02:43:15,820
a signal.
So it's like it's enhanced.

3358
02:43:15,821 --> 02:43:18,270
So it's solidifying that memory,
that learning,

3359
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:20,530
whatever you're learning,
it's making it stronger.

3360
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:24,730
And that's a very important mechanism 
for like neuroplasticity.

3361
02:43:24,731 --> 02:43:27,460
So making sure that you're going to 
remember something longterm,

3362
02:43:27,730 --> 02:43:29,320
you know,
because you've enhanced that signal,

3363
02:43:29,321 --> 02:43:34,321
it's going to be there.
And to do that enhanced that a longterm 

3364
02:43:34,321 --> 02:43:37,090
potentiation you can activate,
you can cause,

3365
02:43:37,091 --> 02:43:39,520
you know,
more like activating types of signals,

3366
02:43:39,521 --> 02:43:44,521
but you also get rid of the inhibitory 
ones and the CB one receptor seems to 

3367
02:43:44,521 --> 02:43:46,810
somehow get rid of those inhibitory ones
when it's activated.

3368
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:50,860
And amyloid Beta plaques,
when they build up in the brain,

3369
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:52,300
they,
they act,

3370
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:57,360
they antagonized CB One receptor.
They prevent the CB one receptor from 

3371
02:43:57,360 --> 02:43:57,840
doing that role.

3372
02:43:58,110 --> 02:44:00,220
It does in longterm potential 
potentiation,

3373
02:44:00,430 --> 02:44:05,430
which is part of the,
the effects on memory long term memory 

3374
02:44:05,430 --> 02:44:05,590
to um.
Now in terms of short term memory,

3375
02:44:05,591 --> 02:44:10,591
I don't really know.
It's kind of interesting because I had 

3376
02:44:10,591 --> 02:44:10,591
the same thoughts I've heard that,
you know,

3377
02:44:10,591 --> 02:44:12,550
will short term memory's affected.
It's very stereotypical when you talk to

3378
02:44:12,551 --> 02:44:15,940
anyone on the street,
they've heard that 100 percent,

3379
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:20,920
but I don't know that I would have to 
read a lot more on this topic,

3380
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:26,220
but there may be some sort of acute 
versus chronic effect where it's like 

3381
02:44:26,260 --> 02:44:29,140
there's something happening acutely 
while you're,

3382
02:44:29,220 --> 02:44:30,880
you know,
agonizing them while you're,

3383
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,530
while you're taking the cannabinoids and
then versus the longterm effect.

3384
02:44:35,531 --> 02:44:37,660
And maybe there's some sort of trade 
off,

3385
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:41,230
maybe it's like short term,
some things affected,

3386
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:42,970
but in the longterm,
your,

3387
02:44:43,060 --> 02:44:48,060
your,
your ability to have that longterm 

3388
02:44:48,060 --> 02:44:48,060
potentiation is good.
Um,

3389
02:44:48,060 --> 02:44:49,180
so it's,
it's interesting the cannabinoid.

3390
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:54,760
It's unfortunate that there's not a lot 
of research being done in that field.

3391
02:44:54,761 --> 02:44:57,730
I think that more and more people are 
doing more research on it.

3392
02:44:57,731 --> 02:45:00,010
As all these studies are coming out,
you just can't ignore it.

3393
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:05,770
It's absolutely happening more and more.
Especially now that there's money 

3394
02:45:05,770 --> 02:45:08,870
involved in it because of what's going 
on in Colorado and Washington state.

3395
02:45:09,170 --> 02:45:14,170
There's so much money that's being 
poured into marijuana research now 

3396
02:45:14,170 --> 02:45:16,190
because people are starting to look at 
it in terms of,

3397
02:45:16,310 --> 02:45:21,310
well this is some seriously financially 
viable stuff like this is not just like 

3398
02:45:23,050 --> 02:45:28,050
some sort of a fringe thing that people 
trying to sneak in under the guise of 

3399
02:45:28,050 --> 02:45:29,240
medicine.
This is a crop and we have to look at it

3400
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:31,640
as this is a commodity.
I mean,

3401
02:45:31,641 --> 02:45:33,950
they're making hundreds of millions of 
dollars now in taxes.

3402
02:45:33,951 --> 02:45:37,640
These states are,
Colorado is going to be over $100,

3403
02:45:37,641 --> 02:45:42,641
million dollars here.
Washington state might surpass it and 

3404
02:45:42,641 --> 02:45:42,800
once all is said and done,
I mean it's gonna be crazy.

3405
02:45:42,801 --> 02:45:46,730
And once the new elections start rolling
in and these,

3406
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,290
these,
uh,

3407
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:49,490
options were on the ballot for other 
states,

3408
02:45:49,970 --> 02:45:54,970
there's a lot of states that are 
economically challenged that are going 

3409
02:45:54,970 --> 02:45:56,060
to probably jump aboard and in 
California should be an barest that they

3410
02:45:56,061 --> 02:45:56,390
have.

3411
02:45:56,390 --> 02:46:00,680
And especially with fucking Moonbeam 
Jerry Brown in Sacramento,

3412
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:03,530
the whole thing is ridiculous.
It should have been illegal a long,

3413
02:46:03,531 --> 02:46:04,490
long,
long time ago.

3414
02:46:04,491 --> 02:46:05,420
But,
um,

3415
02:46:05,750 --> 02:46:10,750
I think that there's going to be a lot 
more studies being done on positive 

3416
02:46:10,750 --> 02:46:14,681
effects because they're just,
they've looked at so many different 

3417
02:46:14,681 --> 02:46:18,791
things.
The reduction of interocular pressure 

3418
02:46:18,791 --> 02:46:20,270
for people that have glaucoma,
people have wasting disease and aids and

3419
02:46:20,271 --> 02:46:23,360
all sorts of people have a appetite 
issues because of chemotherapy.

3420
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:25,130
I mean,
you can go on and on and on,

3421
02:46:25,131 --> 02:46:30,080
but now when you're fighting all termers
the anti-inflammation properties of it,

3422
02:46:30,350 --> 02:46:35,350
um,
especially the differences between 

3423
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:35,350
eating it and smoking it,
you give,

3424
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:39,170
you get more benefits from eating it.
A lot of people that complain about 

3425
02:46:39,170 --> 02:46:41,420
chronic pain or hugely,
uh,

3426
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:43,410
they find it hugely beneficial.
I mean,

3427
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:46,430
it's a really good plan.
Yeah.

3428
02:46:46,431 --> 02:46:47,060
That's,
um,

3429
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:48,980
I think you're right,
as,

3430
02:46:49,030 --> 02:46:54,030
as more and more research comes out,
there's going to be a positive feedback 

3431
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:56,711
loop where it's like you test and in 
addition with all these other 

3432
02:46:56,711 --> 02:46:56,720
progressive states like Colorado and 
Washington state,

3433
02:46:56,721 --> 02:46:57,980
which are now,
you know,

3434
02:46:57,981 --> 02:47:00,920
it's recreational,
recreationally legal,

3435
02:47:00,921 --> 02:47:02,870
and it's not only that it's generating 
income,

3436
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:04,910
which is like,
you just can't ignore that.

3437
02:47:04,910 --> 02:47:05,660
I mean,
that's money.

3438
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:09,410
The money's too big at this point and 
people have a hard time ignoring money.

3439
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:15,120
Well,
it'd be really hard for them to take it 

3440
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:17,411
away now because what happens is the 
states get addicted to that tax revenue 

3441
02:47:17,411 --> 02:47:19,520
when you're talking about withdrawing 
$100,000,000

3442
02:47:19,521 --> 02:47:24,521
in tax revenue when the statistics,
here's where it gets really crazy 

3443
02:47:24,521 --> 02:47:27,880
decrease in violent crime,
decrease in Dui arrests and over and 

3444
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:29,020
over and over,
there's like,

3445
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:31,370
no,
there's no negatives.

3446
02:47:31,371 --> 02:47:34,130
There's like a.
God jumped off a roof somewhere like,

3447
02:47:34,131 --> 02:47:39,131
okay,
that fucking guy might've jumped off a 

3448
02:47:39,131 --> 02:47:39,131
roof anywhere.
That's terrible.

3449
02:47:39,131 --> 02:47:39,131
Terrible,
terrible.

3450
02:47:39,131 --> 02:47:40,550
High driving,
even if you get in an accident,

3451
02:47:40,551 --> 02:47:45,551
you go into miles and hour.
Everybody's just bumping into each 

3452
02:47:45,551 --> 02:47:45,551
other.
It's really relaxed,

3453
02:47:45,790 --> 02:47:47,570
hydrating accidents.
I mean,

3454
02:47:47,571 --> 02:47:48,950
we're talking about traumatic brain 
injury.

3455
02:47:48,951 --> 02:47:51,380
I mean getting hit by a drunk driver.
I mean you're talking about.

3456
02:47:51,390 --> 02:47:53,810
It's awful.
It's just amazing.

3457
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:58,870
Really,
truly amazing how few drunk driving 

3458
02:47:58,870 --> 02:48:01,301
accidents there are in comparison to how
frequent the places where you can get 

3459
02:48:01,371 --> 02:48:03,020
alcohol or as you're driving down the 
street,

3460
02:48:03,021 --> 02:48:04,760
if you drive down the street and the 
street,

3461
02:48:04,761 --> 02:48:09,761
you drive down,
you have drug dealers all over the 

3462
02:48:09,761 --> 02:48:09,950
place.
Every restaurant you pass a drug dealer.

3463
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:12,860
Every cvs store is a drug dealer.
I mean,

3464
02:48:13,610 --> 02:48:16,310
they're all selling trucks.
They're all selling alcohol.

3465
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:17,930
I mean,
almost every bar.

3466
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:19,340
I mean,
of course every bar,

3467
02:48:19,341 --> 02:48:22,220
but almost every restaurant,
almost every drug store,

3468
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:23,690
they're all selling alcohol.
I mean,

3469
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:28,780
it's incredible.
The availability of alcohol and if you 

3470
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:31,511
take that into consideration,
it's incredible how few alcohol related 

3471
02:48:31,511 --> 02:48:36,131
accidents we really do have.
What's interesting is that they're 

3472
02:48:36,131 --> 02:48:37,400
selling this drug that alcohol.
It does.

3473
02:48:37,730 --> 02:48:40,910
It does a lot of damage.
Alcohol does damage to your gut.

3474
02:48:41,060 --> 02:48:46,060
I mean,
you're talking about poking holes in 

3475
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:46,060
your gut like sugar does,
it does that.

3476
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:50,470
It also obviously your liver,
that's what most people are familiar 

3477
02:48:50,470 --> 02:48:51,290
with,
but the brain is my concern,

3478
02:48:51,291 --> 02:48:56,291
you know,
particularly because I can't repair 

3479
02:48:56,291 --> 02:48:57,020
damage as efficiently as my husband who 
has,

3480
02:48:57,230 --> 02:48:59,420
doesn't have this apl we for,
um,

3481
02:48:59,421 --> 02:49:01,460
so when you drink and they've even shown
in studies,

3482
02:49:01,461 --> 02:49:06,461
people with April before illegal that 
drink alcohol even increase their risk 

3483
02:49:07,321 --> 02:49:08,160
of Alzheimer's even

3484
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,570
more because what,
you know,

3485
02:49:09,571 --> 02:49:14,571
when you're,
when you're talking about inducing cell 

3486
02:49:14,571 --> 02:49:14,880
death,
then if you can't replenish that,

3487
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:16,050
you know,
cell death,

3488
02:49:16,051 --> 02:49:19,520
if you can't repair that damage and 
April we for can't.

3489
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:22,980
When you have that Apl we afford it,
impairs the ability to grow new,

3490
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:25,110
like I said,
grow new neurons and repair damage.

3491
02:49:25,111 --> 02:49:26,520
And that's very important.
Um,

3492
02:49:26,730 --> 02:49:31,730
it also,
it's so bad because it's also causing 

3493
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:33,300
more aggregation of amyloid Beta and all
that.

3494
02:49:33,301 --> 02:49:36,750
So that's the neurons are prime to die.
And when you had alcohol on top of that,

3495
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:40,050
it's causing a tipping them over to 
death.

3496
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:42,360
That stress plus stress like I was 
talking about.

3497
02:49:42,361 --> 02:49:43,350
So,
um,

3498
02:49:43,400 --> 02:49:44,520
you know,
I don't,

3499
02:49:44,850 --> 02:49:47,160
I don't drink a lot,
it's fun and I,

3500
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:48,390
and I've always done it,
you know,

3501
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:53,410
in social situations,
but after finding out about my April 

3502
02:49:53,410 --> 02:49:56,340
before every time I am an associate 
social situation,

3503
02:49:56,420 --> 02:50:01,420
if I'm having a dinner with them,
a bunch of friends and they give me a 

3504
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:04,611
glass of wine and even though there's 
some benefits with polyphenols and the 

3505
02:50:04,611 --> 02:50:05,100
wine resveratrol and one.

3506
02:50:05,250 --> 02:50:06,750
Yeah,
Rivera trials one,

3507
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:07,860
um,
and,

3508
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:10,320
but the problem is,
is that I,

3509
02:50:10,350 --> 02:50:10,960
the,
the,

3510
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:13,440
the,
it's like the pros and cons.

3511
02:50:13,441 --> 02:50:16,560
The cons outweigh the benefits in my 
mind because alcohol does so much damage

3512
02:50:16,561 --> 02:50:21,561
that I can't repair.
So if you and I are drinking a glass of 

3513
02:50:21,561 --> 02:50:21,561
wine,
you know,

3514
02:50:21,561 --> 02:50:23,270
let's,
let's just assume that you're,

3515
02:50:23,310 --> 02:50:25,980
you don't have this April before because
one in four people have it.

3516
02:50:25,981 --> 02:50:28,680
There's three people in this room.
It's likely that neither of us,

3517
02:50:28,690 --> 02:50:30,390
Mike,
I'm the one me,

3518
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:31,530
you know,
so,

3519
02:50:34,410 --> 02:50:36,120
but you know,
what I'm saying is that,

3520
02:50:36,121 --> 02:50:41,121
you know,
I have to think about this interaction 

3521
02:50:41,121 --> 02:50:41,121
between the genes and the Diet and me 
drinking the alcohol.

3522
02:50:41,121 --> 02:50:43,470
Now I know that I can't repair that 
damage as efficiently,

3523
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:46,280
so it's like it changes,
it changes my,

3524
02:50:46,300 --> 02:50:49,620
my future behavior and incense and some 
people would probably say,

3525
02:50:49,621 --> 02:50:51,090
Whoa,
you're not going to enjoy life.

3526
02:50:51,090 --> 02:50:56,090
And you know,
it's like I'm not saying I don't ever 

3527
02:50:56,090 --> 02:50:57,150
drink and I do a lot of other really,
really good things to counteract that,

3528
02:50:57,420 --> 02:51:02,420
counteract that.
And I'm trying to figure out more good 

3529
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:02,420
things.
But I think that knowing that,

3530
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:03,450
like for example,
exercise exercise also,

3531
02:51:03,780 --> 02:51:04,680
you know,
it was very,

3532
02:51:04,681 --> 02:51:08,280
very important for people with April 
before and they've shown this in studies

3533
02:51:08,281 --> 02:51:10,580
that people that exercise more,
um,

3534
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:16,080
that have an April before Lele are less 
likely to get it to get Alzheimer's.

3535
02:51:16,231 --> 02:51:21,231
So this is where this complex 
interaction between genes and 

3536
02:51:21,231 --> 02:51:23,601
environment come into play.
But it's interesting that cannabinoids 

3537
02:51:23,601 --> 02:51:25,230
which are not found in every cvs store,
any store,

3538
02:51:25,231 --> 02:51:29,280
like within a block radius,
I'm actually have the opposite effect on

3539
02:51:29,281 --> 02:51:34,281
the brain.
And they actually help repair the 

3540
02:51:34,281 --> 02:51:36,141
damage.
They actually decreased the 

3541
02:51:36,141 --> 02:51:36,141
inflammation.
Um,

3542
02:51:36,141 --> 02:51:39,710
you know,
it makes people like me who are very 

3543
02:51:39,710 --> 02:51:40,590
hyper aware of this Alzheimer's disease.

3544
02:51:40,590 --> 02:51:44,760
And all the mechanisms that are 
accelerating it and how to stave it off,

3545
02:51:44,860 --> 02:51:46,110
it makes me think,
well,

3546
02:51:46,470 --> 02:51:51,470
that's kind of interesting that 
something that's seems to be beneficial 

3547
02:51:51,470 --> 02:51:55,011
from our,
from our studies that we've had 

3548
02:51:55,011 --> 02:51:55,011
published so far.
Um,

3549
02:51:55,011 --> 02:51:58,760
you know,
so when will we see that adopted in the 

3550
02:51:58,760 --> 02:51:58,760
medical community?
You know,

3551
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:02,790
are we going to see changes?
Are we going to start to see people 

3552
02:52:02,790 --> 02:52:02,790
given cannabinoids?
And,

3553
02:52:03,230 --> 02:52:05,100
you know,
I don't know if they're trying to figure

3554
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:10,110
out a way to uncouple the psychotropic 
effects from the anti inflammatory 

3555
02:52:10,110 --> 02:52:14,341
effects.
I'm almost certain that people are 

3556
02:52:14,341 --> 02:52:14,341
trying to figure that out.
And I don't know if that's gonna work or

3557
02:52:14,341 --> 02:52:14,341
not.
You know,

3558
02:52:14,341 --> 02:52:18,980
there may be something about the 
psychotropic effect of it that's also 

3559
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:18,980
important for,
you know,

3560
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:19,930
there's,
there's no telling biology.

3561
02:52:19,931 --> 02:52:20,370
I mean,
it's,

3562
02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:22,900
it's the way it is for a reason,
you know.

3563
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:24,310
Um,
but,

3564
02:52:24,350 --> 02:52:25,060
uh,
it's,

3565
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:29,980
it's something that's on my mind.
It's on my mind now that I,

3566
02:52:29,981 --> 02:52:30,770
you know,
especially that,

3567
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:33,580
that I know I have this April,
we for a Lille,

3568
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:35,980
which completely changes a lot of,
you know,

3569
02:52:36,850 --> 02:52:38,620
things that I.
When I think about exercise,

3570
02:52:38,621 --> 02:52:40,360
I don't think about exercise in the 
sense of,

3571
02:52:41,830 --> 02:52:44,140
Oh,
I need to lose weight.

3572
02:52:44,141 --> 02:52:46,420
I want to stay toned and look good.
I think about it.

3573
02:52:46,421 --> 02:52:51,421
If I don't get exercise,
I am dramatically increasing my risk of 

3574
02:52:51,421 --> 02:52:52,930
Alzheimer's disease.
If I don't get that exercise,

3575
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:57,040
my brain is going to atrophy and I'm 
going to move more.

3576
02:52:57,070 --> 02:53:02,070
It's going to be more likely that I'm 
going to lose my brain function and I'm 

3577
02:53:02,070 --> 02:53:02,890
going to change my behavior in older 
age.

3578
02:53:02,891 --> 02:53:05,230
And that is terrifying,
terrifying,

3579
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:06,220
you know,
so,

3580
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:07,930
you know,
the exercise,

3581
02:53:08,710 --> 02:53:10,350
it's becoming like,
you know,

3582
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:13,270
I think people still really think of it,
of it in terms of,

3583
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:16,210
you know,
losing weight and it's just,

3584
02:53:16,211 --> 02:53:18,070
it's doing so much more.

3585
02:53:18,130 --> 02:53:19,870
It's doing so much more.
And,

3586
02:53:20,350 --> 02:53:21,170
uh,
you know,

3587
02:53:21,250 --> 02:53:26,250
I'm really glad that people do it to 
lose weight because at least they're 

3588
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:26,250
doing it,
you know,

3589
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:28,450
but they even just like a couple of 
weeks ago,

3590
02:53:28,451 --> 02:53:33,451
a study came out showing that exercise 
literally causes your muscle cells to 

3591
02:53:33,671 --> 02:53:36,970
detoxify something that we made called 
[inaudible],

3592
02:53:37,180 --> 02:53:41,320
which is actually a byproduct of 
Tryptophan metabolism trip to fan,

3593
02:53:41,410 --> 02:53:44,140
as I've talked about before in our 
conversations.

3594
02:53:44,141 --> 02:53:44,710
Can,
you know,

3595
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:46,500
it was a precursor to Serotonin,
right?

3596
02:53:46,510 --> 02:53:49,990
So tryptophan and has to get into the 
brain and in order when it gets into the

3597
02:53:49,991 --> 02:53:51,710
brain and make serotonin.
Well,

3598
02:53:51,730 --> 02:53:54,310
trippy fan can also form something 
called [inaudible].

3599
02:53:54,670 --> 02:53:56,560
And when it forms [inaudible],
uh,

3600
02:53:56,970 --> 02:54:01,970
this happens under conditions of stress 
or when you're in you,

3601
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:08,020
when you,
when there's some sort of pathological 

3602
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:08,020
invader.
So it's like,

3603
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:09,460
it's an important part of the Immuno 
Immuno immunological response.

3604
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:12,430
So kindness is important to make t 
regulatory cells.

3605
02:54:12,430 --> 02:54:12,730
So,
I mean,

3606
02:54:12,731 --> 02:54:15,160
you obviously want to be able to have 
this response mechanism.

3607
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:17,950
However,
when you make too much kinder running,

3608
02:54:18,490 --> 02:54:22,150
not only his trip to fan not being made 
into Serotonin in the brain because it's

3609
02:54:22,151 --> 02:54:25,210
getting sucked into this other pathway,
in addition,

3610
02:54:25,211 --> 02:54:30,211
kind uranian can cross the blood brain 
barrier and it conformed something 

3611
02:54:30,211 --> 02:54:32,050
called quinolinic acid,
which is like a neurotoxin.

3612
02:54:32,051 --> 02:54:35,710
It literally causes too much glutamate 
to be released and it causes et Cetera,

3613
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:40,720
toxicity in cell death,
and it activates Microglia so it causes 

3614
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:41,320
inflammation.
If you already have amyloid Beta plaques

3615
02:54:41,321 --> 02:54:43,660
in your brain,
great more activation of Microglia.

3616
02:54:43,661 --> 02:54:48,661
You're going to keep making more.
It's like feeding into that already 

3617
02:54:48,661 --> 02:54:51,600
terrible cycle.
So exercise causes muscle cells to like 

3618
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:56,310
convert that kind urinating into a 
another byproduct that can't get into 

3619
02:54:56,310 --> 02:54:58,930
the brain.
So you're talking about another way that

3620
02:54:59,140 --> 02:55:01,870
you know,
exercise is protecting the brain.

3621
02:55:01,990 --> 02:55:06,990
In fact,
in these study that was published in 

3622
02:55:06,990 --> 02:55:07,010
cell,
they found that these mice that they did

3623
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:12,070
this in mouse models when they injected 
the mice with Kenya earning it got into 

3624
02:55:12,681 --> 02:55:15,770
the brain and caused all this neuro 
toxicity sort of effects,

3625
02:55:15,771 --> 02:55:19,040
but it also costs depression,
caused them to have depression,

3626
02:55:19,041 --> 02:55:20,470
which of course,
you know,

3627
02:55:20,870 --> 02:55:25,870
inflammation in the brain depletes the 
ability of the brain to release 

3628
02:55:25,870 --> 02:55:28,700
Serotonin and that's one aspect of how 
inflammations causing depression.

3629
02:55:28,910 --> 02:55:33,910
So you're not,
you're not making serotonin cause 

3630
02:55:33,910 --> 02:55:36,221
depressive symptoms in these mice,
and they do all sorts of little studies 

3631
02:55:36,221 --> 02:55:36,860
where they look at exploratory behavior 
and all sorts of things in little mice.

3632
02:55:36,861 --> 02:55:41,861
Obviously humans are way more complex,
but then so when they made the mice 

3633
02:55:42,801 --> 02:55:46,400
exercise,
the depressive symptoms went away.

3634
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:49,250
The neuro toxicity that did better on 
learning and memory test.

3635
02:55:49,251 --> 02:55:52,190
So yet another reason why,
you know,

3636
02:55:52,191 --> 02:55:55,130
exercise is freaking awesome for the 
brain,

3637
02:55:55,370 --> 02:56:00,370
for depression,
for me to make sure I'm not going to get

3638
02:56:00,381 --> 02:56:02,710
Alzheimer's.
So for everybody,

3639
02:56:02,870 --> 02:56:03,560
for everybody,

3640
02:56:03,750 --> 02:56:05,340
we're out of time.
Unfortunately,

3641
02:56:05,341 --> 02:56:08,760
we just rattled through three hours at 
an accelerated rate.

3642
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:10,680
Yeah.
He just blasted through.

3643
02:56:10,950 --> 02:56:12,660
Yeah,
you were in a trance,

3644
02:56:12,690 --> 02:56:15,060
you were in a information disseminating 
trans.

3645
02:56:16,830 --> 02:56:18,940
Well,
I certainly hope people learn stuff.

3646
02:56:19,300 --> 02:56:24,300
I barely learned.
They're going to have to go over it 

3647
02:56:24,300 --> 02:56:24,330
again with a notepad and they're going 
to google the shit out of it.

3648
02:56:24,331 --> 02:56:29,331
And,
and I think we got a lot out of this to 

3649
02:56:29,331 --> 02:56:29,331
holy shit.
Every time we talk,

3650
02:56:29,331 --> 02:56:34,160
next time we got to talk about 
cryotherapy is something that I've 

3651
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:36,120
started getting into my God,
we got to talk about that.

3652
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:39,080
But God damn this was awesome.
Totally awesome.

3653
02:56:39,081 --> 02:56:44,081
So much.
So much cool stuff to talk more about 

3654
02:56:44,081 --> 02:56:44,081
behavioral epigenetics because that's 
fascinating.

3655
02:56:44,081 --> 02:56:46,740
Do it again in month or so whenever.
Thank you so much.

3656
02:56:46,741 --> 02:56:48,360
It's always awesome.
Your website.

3657
02:56:48,850 --> 02:56:49,760
Yeah.
So uh,

3658
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:54,800
found my fitness.com
is where you can find me and all my 

3659
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:54,800
stuff.

3660
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:59,180
Found my fitness on twitter,
found my fitness on twitter and also 

3661
02:56:59,180 --> 02:57:02,811
I've got a new android APP coming out 
there this afternoon so you can find it 

3662
02:57:02,811 --> 02:57:04,920
a lunch so you can find it.
They're awesome.

3663
02:57:04,921 --> 02:57:09,921
And also I've got my patrion where I'm 
now about to make a mile another my 

3664
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:13,200
first milestone.
So I'm pretty stoked about it and um,

3665
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:16,860
which means I'm going to have to step up
my game and get some more creative works

3666
02:57:16,861 --> 02:57:18,870
out there for people to listen to.
Beautiful.

3667
02:57:19,150 --> 02:57:20,430
Awesome.
You're fantastic.

3668
02:57:20,431 --> 02:57:22,080
Thank you so much.
So it was a pleasure,
