1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,960
Want the place,

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,550
but he was making so much money.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,090
He couldn't fucking Cleveland.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,360
It was 1984.

5
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,200
It was too fast.

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,133
Wow.

7
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,330
And they fucking blew.

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,081
Can you imagine that?

9
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,970
Getting blown up in a fucking pipe bomb.

10
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,260
That's where you know somebody

11
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,960
and he didn't die right away.

12
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,640
The metal went up in his ass.

13
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,530
He stayed awake for hours.

14
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,950
We went up in his plate
under the jeep and shit.

15
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,020
They all have those
crash plates in Colorado.

16
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,010
They all have those plates.

17
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,750
Those plates were working against
you and you have a bomber.

18
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,643
The fucking car.

19
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,750
So the point went right
this fucking Cooley's.

20
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,330
So he was just bleeding a.

21
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,440
that's fucking crazy.

22
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,530
When somebody kills you with a car bomb
the shit that means you did something

23
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,364
bad.

24
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,290
They slice your throat.

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,180
You've got to be a ghost at the slicers.

26
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,570
Your drawer.

27
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,210
You'll never arrest
arrested fucking piece.

28
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,880
You got to be something.

29
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,160
You know,

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,860
a ghost haunting the woods forever.

31
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,630
Wanted somebody,

32
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,031
your husband,

33
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,780
Colombians.

34
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,160
Anything.

35
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,370
Fucking Brian Redman.

36
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:56,821
What's up,

37
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:57,140
Brian?

38
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,750
Michael,

39
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,501
do you believe in ghosts?

40
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,130
Joey Diaz.

41
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,963
Fuck yeah.

42
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,143
Fuck you.

43
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,330
I don't believe that I seen.

44
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,860
I seen something at the comedy store.

45
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,980
One thing not,

46
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,680
I didn't see the door ringing.

47
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,880
I didn't see nobody walking in with.

48
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,871
Not a head on.

49
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,730
I mean I've heard a lot
of stories in economies.

50
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,570
Look.

51
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,360
And then I've been around people
who pass spirits as a young child.

52
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,841
In fact,

53
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,550
I went to see the lady
when I went home last week.

54
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,493
Yeah,

55
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,341
that was a kid.

56
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,780
I've seen the do some wild shit.

57
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,650
What'd you do when that was about
a woman who was about eight,

58
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,271
you know,

59
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:29,160
my mother had a bar and all these
people coming in to shake it down,

60
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,431
you know,

61
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,930
cops would come and nice guys,

62
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,360
just white guys come in and
that's part of the business.

63
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,223
When you have a bar,

64
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,160
you know,

65
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
somebody gets stabbed,

66
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:37,340
you want the cops there first,

67
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,730
you got to give her an envelope,

68
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,541
you know?

69
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:39,881
And then,

70
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,714
uh,

71
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,020
after about three months,

72
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,890
his guy started coming.

73
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:43,591
It was a Cuban guy,

74
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,460
looked like separate goal,

75
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,950
but he would come in and
break the Cubans balls.

76
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,420
He went after Cubans.

77
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,540
He wouldn't have to Cubans in 76 and 75.

78
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:55,130
You wouldn't have to run heavy and he
would come into my mother's bar in Salta

79
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,750
and fuck you motherfuckers,

80
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,830
I want a bigger envelope next time I come,

81
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,664
that type of shit.

82
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,860
So when that went in there after school
and he was yelling and screaming in,

83
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,770
they're not in like this fucking guy.

84
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,950
He was younger and he had a beard
and he was a weightlifting type dude.

85
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,870
Somebody's couple of weeks later I go to
the bar and it's all these Cuban guys.

86
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,090
They had a ball and 38th
street they had the brandies.

87
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190
These will all Cuban
bookmakers that my dad knew,

88
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,720
my stepdad and my mom do.

89
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,920
Nice fucking people.

90
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,121
And it was this lady.

91
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:22,380
I played basketball with the kids.

92
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,211
A kid was a boxer.

93
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,960
His name was Jose Torres bad.

94
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,760
Their uncles,

95
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,593
the fucking dude.

96
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,781
That's their uncle.

97
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,190
The Kuda Jose Torres.

98
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,730
He's a boxing ref or
something big boxing official.

99
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,564
That's their uncle.

100
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,860
This is their nephew,

101
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:35,694
their Puerto Rican.

102
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,690
So I was the guy that was.

103
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,850
He was a light heavyweight champion.

104
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:39,684
Right.

105
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,370
You know he something big with boxing.

106
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,213
This is his nephew.

107
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,650
I grew up with that nephew.

108
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:44,640
They were basketball players.

109
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,160
I think that's what I'm talking about
isn't even one that wrote the book about

110
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:47,994
Mike Tyson.

111
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,520
He kind of grew up with Mike Tyson and
kind of like wrote a tell all book about

112
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:52,610
them.

113
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,880
I was Kinda like Kinda shitty.

114
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,040
None of this is Joe Torres.

115
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,521
Yeah,

116
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:56,790
that's.

117
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,960
This is Jose Torres,

118
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,980
the referee from the seventies
and thinking of the wrong

119
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,180
guy.

120
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,980
I don't think this guy even raft like a.

121
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,680
He was.

122
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,850
He was the one that did our fight
when they were trying to stop it.

123
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,260
The ran against when they
were trying to stop it.

124
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:08,650
He's the.

125
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,483
We got to look it up.

126
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,290
Duran Duran against that fight.

127
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,840
When he killed the guy in the ring
and the guy died two weeks later,

128
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,890
but he took the spirit of what?

129
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,200
What's the fight we always
talk about with David?

130
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,390
I think he had died years later in a car.

131
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:26,200
The car accident or the fucking
Jack Philanthropic got crushed.

132
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:26,750
But he,

133
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,410
I took his spirit,

134
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,370
his spirit that happens to guys.

135
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:30,860
Man.

136
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,790
Did Julio Cesar Chavez when
he fought Meldrick Taylor,

137
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,230
there's no question about that fight.

138
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,730
Meldrick Taylor got a spirit taking.

139
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,020
Chavez took his spirit.

140
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,030
He hurt them bad to physically,

141
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,440
like he was never the same physically,

142
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,670
but he was also number the
same psychologically to go
through that crazy ass war

143
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,100
and to be boxing the fucking
ears off the guy at first.

144
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,530
Then eventually the guy
just slowly wears you down,

145
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,610
slowly wears you down,

146
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,270
and then boom stops you in the
twelfth with like seconds to go.

147
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,290
They stopped the fight.

148
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,790
Like that's a crushing blow,

149
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,160
a devastating blow,

150
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,970
you know,

151
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,310
that's a to to have the referee
look at you when there's like,

152
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,970
was it like two seconds left on the
clock and the referees shakes him off.

153
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:07,980
And Chavez winds like,

154
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,943
what?

155
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,023
What?

156
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,580
That's like a spirit crusher.

157
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,350
Well,

158
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,900
talking about the spirit with Jose Torres.

159
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,400
So we were kids and once a month this
lady would pass a fucking spirit in the

160
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,234
house.

161
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,040
She would go.

162
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,900
She was on mom.

163
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,120
No,

164
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,050
this lady was a mom.

165
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:24,884
I used to watch her.

166
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,151
She was a mom.

167
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:29,150
She used to drive her kids around to
different basketball games and shit.

168
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,220
Her husband and her was separated.

169
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,210
She wasn't a boozer.

170
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,680
She never really cursed.

171
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,500
I would go with in the daytime and she
would make sandwiches for you and stuff

172
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,334
like that.

173
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,310
She would take the kids
to church on Sundays,

174
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,190
so I used to watch it,

175
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,210
but my mother once told me that said
that lady passes a fucking weird spirit

176
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,810
once a month or some shit and people go
over there and you bring them money or

177
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:51,350
gifts or whatever the fuck you bring
in and she talks to you show one night.

178
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,300
We wasn't to him with the spirit.

179
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,430
So one night we went over there.

180
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,330
Now how long have you known me?

181
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,780
Time.

182
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,510
Look at me.

183
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,343
I don't fuck around.

184
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,220
Shut the fuck up Brian.

185
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,083
I don't fuck around.

186
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,660
Fuck.

187
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,910
When I talked to you for like a
man I talked to you like a man.

188
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,480
This is fucked up but I'm going to
tell you I'm about eight or nine.

189
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,530
So this one.

190
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:12,430
Last time I went to the bar and
he had them all up at the ball.

191
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,800
Like Popeye Doyle had
those people in fucking,

192
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,430
uh,

193
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,580
the French connection memory
when he goes in and he says,

194
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,371
everybody against the wall,

195
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:22,640
this is the last time I went in there
and now he's fucking Cuban's pitch.

196
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,660
My Mom's pissed.

197
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,460
So like we got to figure something out.

198
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,980
And I knew eventually my dad
was going to shoot this guy.

199
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,640
That's the.

200
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,480
I just had a funny feeling and my Stepdad
or some of these on the shoot this

201
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,060
fucking guy because he
was going over his bounds.

202
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,680
They felt that he was abusing Cubans,

203
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,090
which is even worse when you're Cuban.

204
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,190
If he was a white dude or a black dude,

205
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:40,401
hey,

206
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,240
it's part of the turf.

207
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,290
You're fucking Cuban.

208
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,730
We're going to get your ass.

209
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,670
So I knew about this and I
just turned the other way.

210
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,960
One night we go to this lady's house and
she's talking to these people and she's

211
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:51,794
got the spirit.

212
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,910
Now I'm wanting to sleep.

213
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,220
This lady would drink
fucking rule alcohol.

214
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,054
What's that?

215
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,571
What's that?

216
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:59,120
Fucking don't know the
shit that people drink.

217
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,500
That's 140 proof.

218
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,013
Oh Claire,

219
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,680
you just drink it and talk
to you and smoke a cigar.

220
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,180
Oh my God.

221
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,980
She was supposed to be a
black African fucking slave,

222
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,740
but she was really a Puerto Rican woman
and she plucked it and drink the fucking

223
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,230
shit and she was talking to my
mother and she came over there.

224
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,260
I was a little fucking kid.

225
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,080
Doug and I remember looking at his shit
in my pants off and she took a dish and

226
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,740
she showed it to my mom is a white dish
and then she took a fucking candle and

227
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:25,520
she took the dishes.

228
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,050
She put the candle under the dish.

229
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,191
She took the candle,

230
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:28,860
she drew it down.

231
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,170
She showed the dish to my mother.

232
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,040
She said,

233
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,510
this is what's bothering you lately,

234
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,490
and it was just some fucking thing.

235
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,550
It just looked like some
candle designer the thing,

236
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,210
right.

237
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,043
She took the dish,

238
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,801
she smashed it.

239
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,460
She goes,

240
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,470
done seven days.

241
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,761
I went home,

242
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:46,280
Doug and never thought
about this shit again.

243
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,740
I was eight or nine.

244
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,130
I had Gi joes.

245
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,350
I was trying to look at my dad's pornos.

246
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:51,921
You know what I'm saying?

247
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:52,221
Right.

248
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:56,210
I don't believe this hocus pocus or one
day I got out of school and I take the

249
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:58,140
bike and I go to my mother's
bomb when I get up there,

250
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:02,030
they're all fucking drinking and
having a good time at 3:30 and I go,

251
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,450
what happened?

252
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,601
They go,

253
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,680
they know that fucking cop.

254
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,820
They shot him to pieces last night
and they shot him up by this place.

255
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,581
Rapido tax.

256
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:12,230
He was the first Cuban taxi cab company
in the seventies that would deliver

257
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,011
blown the taxis.

258
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,680
All these geniuses that Jesus.

259
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,460
Now the Cubans are doing that.

260
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,650
The 17 union city,

261
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,560
they will go over the bridge.

262
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,850
You call from the city.

263
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:20,571
They live in the studio.

264
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,420
Fifty four would deliver that.

265
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,950
Come on though because it's 74 slash 75.

266
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,491
Come on dark.

267
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,910
And the name of the
company was rapido taxi,

268
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,280
you know,

269
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,630
wrap it on means in Spanish.

270
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,870
But quick bitch quit little quick,

271
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,561
quick,

272
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:34,394
quick,

273
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,060
quick.

274
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,880
So I took my bike to
rather than Joe Rogan,

275
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:38,480
I went up to this.

276
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,740
Fuck.

277
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,620
This is really.

278
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,531
It was the taxi,

279
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:41,420
a taxi company,

280
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,591
taxi company,

281
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,880
but the delivered fucking blow.

282
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,311
That was the,

283
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,460
that was the purpose of we.

284
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,990
They made money on a $3 toll.

285
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,280
They make money delivering
the fucking goody good.

286
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,821
The studio.

287
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,020
That's how did they run a real taxi too?

288
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,883
Because we'll tax.

289
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,650
You can take it from the supermarket.

290
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,900
Go on the way home.

291
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,060
Can you get me some coke right?

292
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,280
No,

293
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,361
no,

294
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:58,700
no.

295
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,481
I'm away home.

296
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:00,350
You got to go to the city.

297
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,870
They just put a keel over the city
and they don't get pulled over.

298
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,040
You got a ride in the city?

299
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,680
Are you pulling me over to Joe
Rogan in the back of the car?

300
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,430
I'm sorry.

301
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,971
Go right ahead.

302
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,130
We thought you were doing something else.

303
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,160
Meanwhile his fucking bag of fucking blown
the trunk and the cops must have been

304
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,700
on a tear.

305
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

306
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,950
How much or how many of the
cops were in on it back then?

307
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,113
I don't fucking know.

308
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,633
New York.

309
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,980
New York was a different.

310
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,920
New York was a different
fucking animal then,

311
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,480
but you got to remember
that it was just a taxi.

312
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,810
Nobody thought about that
when New York back then.

313
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,700
That was 20 years ahead
of that fucking time.

314
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:31,980
When,

315
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,990
when New York's needs,

316
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:33,201
bro,

317
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,550
everybody else caught a fucking cold.

318
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,570
Let's get down to that 10 years behind
over here and he's fucking savages.

319
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,530
You know,

320
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,660
this is a totally different
place socially than New York,

321
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,523
that's for sure.

322
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,010
Right now.

323
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,170
You think people are
more on the ball there?

324
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,680
There's more like there's
more con artists and shit.

325
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,560
There's more clever people did anything
that's more fucking Douche bags

326
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,403
everywhere.

327
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,590
People here I think.

328
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:55,890
Yeah,

329
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,040
there's

330
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,850
a lot of that,

331
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,880
but I think that I always say
something about the weather man.

332
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,140
You don't have to deal with the weather.

333
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,010
You get soft,

334
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,300
you know your brain doesn't have to think,

335
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,920
think quickly because you have to survive.

336
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,150
You know when you're in Boston and it's
fucking zero degrees out and you get in

337
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:12,984
your car and it goes,

338
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,810
fuck,

339
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,930
fuck woo.

340
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,400
And you don't have a cell phone.

341
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:20,851
Stupid.

342
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,320
There was no cell phones back then.

343
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,101
So what are you doing?

344
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:23,934
Oh my God,

345
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,670
I've got to knock on someone's
door so I don't freeze to death.

346
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,460
You got to wake some people up
because you might freeze to death.

347
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:29,941
I'm sorry,

348
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:31,050
I'm in my car broke down.

349
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,220
Can I use your dude?

350
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,980
You got to think quicker when you're
in that kind of an environment in

351
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,814
California,

352
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,810
you know your car breaks down,

353
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,410
you just sleep in the car until you know
the cops come and then the cops tell

354
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:41,131
you what's going on.

355
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,740
Oh my car broke down and they get you a
tow truck and you find you don't have to

356
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:44,910
worry about dying outside.

357
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,341
Living in Boston,

358
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,270
you got to worry about dying.

359
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,330
That's like some real shit and that's
why they're there a little quicker,

360
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,470
a little quicker on a take.

361
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,290
That sounds

362
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,831
the sound,

363
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,870
that sound that you
made for doing the car.

364
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,070
I was just imagining.

365
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,950
I was imagining that's what it
sounded like when Joey Diaz had sex.

366
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,450
Do you think so jody?

367
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,820
Like when you have sex,

368
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,940
it's more,

369
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,250
it was good,

370
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,650
Dick that I tell you.

371
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,484
I'm giving you.

372
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,430
I'm giving you good.

373
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,550
Don't get me started.

374
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,360
I'll have you know who he had 20 minutes.

375
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,740
Bitch slap and motherfuckers.

376
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:23,250
You know what I'm saying?

377
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,850
Who you have here?

378
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,683
What the fuck?

379
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,750
What's plan b?

380
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,583
You know,

381
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,933
do you know?

382
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,960
So

383
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,261
dog,

384
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:30,591
Trixie,

385
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:32,390
vixen got a raped again,

386
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,090
girl by a girl dog.

387
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,260
The person was like,

388
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,450
I gotTa pee while you tell the story.

389
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,250
The person I was with him

390
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,290
Joey and Wednesday man,

391
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,610
because my story are so the person
that was worth it own the dog.

392
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:44,911
They were like,

393
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:49,310
my dog has never a humped anything
and be my dog is a girl dog.

394
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:50,131
So I don't even know why.

395
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:53,310
It's like trying to hump your dog's
ass because it doesn't have a dick.

396
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,501
So Joey,

397
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:54,790
what,

398
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,580
what do you think about rss feeds?

399
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,370
I have no idea what David fucking up here.

400
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,550
Why are you bothering me for
a little about computers?

401
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,410
You don't know anything about computers.

402
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,330
What will you take a bottle that says,

403
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,533
uh,

404
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,260
whether designed to a pump out a,

405
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,610
like if you have a website,

406
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,980
it's designed only for,

407
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,330
were mostly for,

408
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,020
uh,

409
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,700
sending out your website.

410
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,200
So other applications and other websites
can add it to their website and their

411
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,100
applications.

412
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,110
But if you don't want to do that,

413
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:29,670
you don't have an rss feed.

414
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,510
So I could see you
wouldn't want an rss feed.

415
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,240
Love to me about something

416
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,993
like,

417
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,610
Oh,

418
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,443
is that real?

419
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,533
That's really.

420
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,460
See now that's why you wanted to take.

421
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,240
We'll get employees
walking right into the.

422
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,310
And I had to pee.

423
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:51,761
I'm sorry,

424
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:52,594
Ladies and gentlemen,

425
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,493
I,

426
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,260
I was working on that
video game all day today.

427
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,060
Like Gyros.

428
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,580
I was working on that UFC video game
today and I drink tea when I work on that

429
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,414
show.

430
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,950
The video game is like,

431
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:10,360
it's very a script and there's like I
have to pretend that like fights going on

432
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,280
for hours and hours and hours.

433
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,550
You're talking about that
like really intense fast and,

434
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,590
and your,

435
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,090
your voice gets really tired because I
had to drink a lot of tea so I could not

436
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:19,930
hold in my urine.

437
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,700
So what you were saying before I left
so rudely is that your dog's a whore,

438
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,451
a whore,

439
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:26,950
that lesbians are raping your daughter.

440
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,320
No.

441
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,621
Yeah,

442
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,161
exactly.

443
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:33,161
And like why do all dogs have just the
intuition to get on top of another dog

444
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:35,630
and Hump it even if
they don't have a dick?

445
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,740
Because it doesn't make sense.

446
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,130
No,

447
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,600
it does.

448
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,720
My dog used to do that.

449
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:42,230
She was a female pit bull and I had a
male pit bull that was a puppy and she

450
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:44,920
used to get on top of them and hump
them just like rubbing pussies and no,

451
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:45,111
no.

452
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:46,160
It's a dominant thing.

453
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,160
So what she's doing is saying that
if I wanted to fuck you in the ass,

454
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:49,551
I could,

455
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,440
I can get to the position
where I'm on top of you.

456
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,550
I'm stronger than you.

457
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,170
Like they jockey for position.

458
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,980
You have to almost like it's,

459
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,211
it's,

460
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,200
it's a social thing.

461
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,260
It's like for a dog to be able to
get on top of you and dry hump you.

462
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,300
It's not just that he's Horny,

463
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,970
it's also that he's trying to
let you know he can do that.

464
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,680
He can impose himself on you.

465
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,820
Like my two dogs,

466
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,750
they have very clear rules
like Johnny's a mastiff,

467
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,920
he's a big fucking dog and you know,

468
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,620
he's got this giant fucking head
and he's a sweetheart of a dog,

469
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,760
but the other dogs,

470
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:17,461
a bull dog,

471
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:20,570
Shiba inu banks and the other
dog doesn't get no say and shit.

472
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,411
That's just the way it is.

473
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:22,244
They don't fight,

474
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,030
they don't argue,

475
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,290
but when I opened up the door,

476
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,550
johnny walks in first.

477
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,443
Every time,

478
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,780
every time the other dog will stop
and let Johnny go through first.

479
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:30,230
Why?

480
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,220
Because Johnny a 140 pound master,

481
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,380
if he's fucking huge,

482
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:33,891
you know,

483
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,360
so there's just clear rules.

484
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,190
If Johnny wanted to hunt Brutus,

485
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,120
he could get away with it,

486
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,950
but it brutus tried to Hump Johnny.

487
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,270
There would be chaos.

488
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,231
It would be like,

489
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:43,400
what the fuck?

490
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,910
Buddhist probably would
growl and snap at Johnny.

491
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,701
Johnny tried to Hump Them,

492
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,460
but the point is the other way
is absolutely preposterous.

493
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,360
It's never going to happen.

494
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,490
There's like a this with animals,

495
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:56,600
there's an Alpha and then there's the
ones who give in to the Alpha and your dog

496
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,660
clearly is like the most Beta dog ever.

497
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,001
I know.

498
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,390
It's so much dog food and we gave her.

499
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,890
Is that what it is dog?

500
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,730
So I guess the way it works is that they
just feel her submissiveness and they

501
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:10,640
want a mount her.

502
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,710
Their instinct is to
mount her and dominator.

503
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,820
And this,

504
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,120
the old dog I used to have was always
a bad dog and every time it was bad I

505
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,600
would just like kind of put her in
between my legs and my arm and kind of

506
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:24,260
getting like a crouching position and
kind of just like put her in between me

507
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,094
and like hold her.

508
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,030
And so I was kind of like on top of her,

509
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,140
it wasn't like fucking earnings,

510
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,550
you know,

511
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,290
she was just like on
like underneath my belly,

512
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,000
like a little cave I would make.

513
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,910
I would just sit there for like 10
minutes and you can tell the dog at first

514
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,773
trying to get out.

515
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,570
And then finally just
kind of some this are,

516
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,440
you know,

517
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,540
just kind of lays down and it gives up.

518
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,830
Dog is just fine,

519
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,270
you know,

520
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,103
just walks around.

521
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,030
I don't think you're supposed to do that.

522
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,440
I think you fucked up your dog's head,

523
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,270
raped your dog.

524
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:52,670
Every time it shit on carpet and
every time it sits in the car,

525
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,350
but you rate it.

526
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,681
Well No,

527
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:53,880
no.

528
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,590
It's something I learned
kind of from a Caesar.

529
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,300
Caesar does he?

530
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,733
After showtime,

531
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,421
after nights,

532
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:02,440
showtime version of it.

533
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,120
Now he,

534
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,311
he,

535
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:04,330
he says secret.

536
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,620
Yeah,

537
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,190
probably be the best way to do it.

538
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,431
Yeah.

539
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:06,701
He said,

540
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:07,630
well he didn't say it like that.

541
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:10,810
He said that you should grab it by the
back of the neck and like hold it down

542
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,980
for awhile,

543
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,240
but that's pretty much what I was doing.

544
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:16,330
I was pretty much getting on top of
it and just kind of like getting like,

545
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,780
Yo,

546
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,830
I am the master here.

547
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,170
It's the whole dog thing is crazy man.

548
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,620
Do you have these animals that
listened to you right now?

549
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,620
Like what the fuck?

550
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,970
What's wrong with us?

551
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,790
There's not another animal that
keeps animals that they love.

552
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,540
You know,

553
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,690
it's weird and we've got an
engineered to be like the sweetest,

554
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:32,890
nicest things ever.

555
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,280
I mean,

556
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,940
look at your dog.

557
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,980
Your dog's ridiculously affectionate.

558
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,590
I've never seen a dog but
not just affectionate,

559
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:40,510
but she's so needy to her.

560
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:41,860
It's like every breath,

561
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,270
but like taking a breath.

562
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,900
She needs that much attention.

563
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,600
Like it's like as much as she's breathing,

564
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,440
she someone touching her as much
as she needs to take him there.

565
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,680
She needs someone to touch her.

566
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:51,760
It's like that extreme,

567
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,170
right?

568
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,970
A stripper or something way worse.

569
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,240
Way Worse since does.

570
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,290
Is there any animal that has pubic hair?

571
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,690
I've never taken the other day.

572
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:01,290
I was like,

573
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,700
wouldn't it be cool if animals have pubic
hairs and like term or you could just

574
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:06,750
get a full Bush,

575
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:06,940
you know,

576
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,773
like if you're it,

577
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,080
the animal would have to
have nothing else around it.

578
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,390
I mean they have pubic hair
over their whole fucking body.

579
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:13,440
That's basically what's going on.

580
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,040
Yeah,

581
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,820
kind of.

582
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,300
Sure.

583
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,751
But I mean like,

584
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,070
like even like bald eagles,

585
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,701
Bald Eagles,

586
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,390
that bushes.

587
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,170
Those are feathers.

588
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,830
But I mean like,

589
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,670
why don't they have.

590
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,590
Are you talking about
Bald Eagles have penises,

591
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,230
right?

592
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,550
Yes.

593
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,950
Why are humans the only ones
that have a pubic hairs?

594
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,210
Because we don't have hair
on the rest of our body.

595
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:32,280
There's very few animals that have
exposed very few animals that have exposed

596
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:32,650
skin.

597
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,191
That ain't shit.

598
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:33,430
Dude.

599
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,450
If you were a viewer,

600
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,140
a coyote,

601
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,010
I would take him to the vet.

602
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,070
I believe this poor thing is dying
because all his hair is missing.

603
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,980
When you think is Harry is only
Harry to a hairless person.

604
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,810
You know I'm covered in here too.

605
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,310
That's not Harry is.

606
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,980
That's your hairless.

607
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,710
You just.

608
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,040
You have a little hair compared
to the other healers folks.

609
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,670
Why don't monkeys have huge bushes?

610
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,743
They do ban.

611
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,590
They do.

612
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,423
They have pubic hairs.

613
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,330
They do.

614
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,880
Don't get long and crazy like ours
because they just have different kinds of

615
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:58,330
hair,

616
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,070
but they have hair around
their dick and balls.

617
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,860
The fuck is wrong with you son.

618
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,560
You're going to do some research before
you come up with these crazy pubic hair

619
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:06,350
theories.

620
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,620
I mean,

621
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,580
they don't have bushes like
talking about the biggest.

622
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,900
We don't have it anywhere else.

623
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,800
It would be weird if like animals,

624
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,993
you know?

625
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,090
I mean there's no the only animal that's
like us that his hair and certain parts

626
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:22,860
of his body is like some some
dogs and I just wish all men.

627
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,720
Why don't give a fuck about animal pubic?

628
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,310
It'd be all worried about people dying
of radiation poisoning and Japan and

629
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,960
fucking.

630
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,910
Why are we in Libya?

631
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:31,960
The CIA's involvement,

632
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:32,500
our life.

633
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,640
I'm worried about animals

634
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,790
think Peter would exist
if animals have hairs.

635
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,110
Ryan,

636
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,400
don't let me get built

637
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,050
in the ass or this last time with
fucking brock lesnar right now.

638
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,140
Can you put into the microphone bro?

639
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,043
I'm straight.

640
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,640
My voice is too big.

641
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:57,770
I blow the speakers might be called dog.

642
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,470
Alright.

643
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,860
Alright.

644
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,470
What's going on in the
pilborough did a video where a,

645
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,270
he fucking talked about the
thing that is a video on youtube.

646
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,850
So he made it six minutes long.

647
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,890
He talked about the argument on his own
for another six minutes and at the end

648
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,161
of it he goes,

649
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,490
yeah.

650
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,323
And I was right.

651
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,343
That's the point.

652
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,183
That guy,

653
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,390
that guy,

654
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,290
he doesn't know about computers and
they're trying to rip you off and take the

655
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,370
money for the artists.

656
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,880
They never had money for the
artist fucking rss feeds.

657
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,510
You know what?

658
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,000
You know what the thing
that bugged me the most,

659
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,731
six minutes.

660
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:30,530
This is expensive.

661
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:30,980
Talking to him.

662
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,860
The thing that bugged me the most,

663
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,210
I met him like four times,

664
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,050
five times before,

665
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:34,680
right?

666
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,170
He even did I,

667
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,070
we did a,

668
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,181
uh,

669
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:40,140
a comedy show that the
following night or that night,

670
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,100
that night we did a comedy show and knows
the following the following night and

671
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:44,760
I was like,

672
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,470
the host of this show and I'm like,

673
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,940
he knew that I'm a comic.

674
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,783
Awesome.

675
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,410
He's knows who I am right now.

676
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,440
And if he's Nice fucking whatever.

677
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,060
So he and the beginning of the video,

678
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:54,390
he goes,

679
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,840
yeah.

680
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,770
So there's that guy,

681
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:56,850
that little guy that whatever,

682
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,830
that the male assisting guy,

683
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,290
fucking male assistant
to something over there,

684
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,901
this guy,

685
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:05,890
whatever the fuck he is,

686
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,670
give me a jay route.

687
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,863
Come on,

688
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,550
but,

689
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,750
but fuck that,

690
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,010
that the thing that bugs me the most is.

691
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,461
And I,

692
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,590
I was pretty baked when
that argument happened,

693
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:19,790
but the thing that bugged me the most
about everything was my whole thing wasn't

694
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,390
that I'm like,

695
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,631
yeah,

696
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,850
what stitchers doing is 100 percent legal.

697
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,231
No,

698
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:23,630
what?

699
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,220
What I was saying is if you have something
on your website that you put on your

700
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:31,580
website that is only put on your website,

701
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,290
if you want to broadcast to your stuff,

702
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,310
if you don't want that,

703
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,240
then take it off your website.

704
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,770
It doesn't change anything.

705
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,360
My whole argument is like,

706
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,520
why do you have an rss
feed on your website?

707
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,020
Why?

708
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,470
What?

709
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,740
What?

710
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,700
Why did you put it on?

711
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
Are we really having this conversation?

712
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:46,274
What are you doing?

713
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,491
No,

714
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:48,590
but I'm already so my art,

715
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,970
but my argument that I'm just saying,

716
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,610
know your argument was brought it up.

717
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,683
Here we go again.

718
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,680
Here we go.

719
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:54,921
No,

720
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:55,011
it.

721
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:55,671
His argument is,

722
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:56,600
I know what your argument is.

723
00:19:56,601 --> 00:20:00,140
I'm aware of the general
details of the disagreement.

724
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,531
I know,

725
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:01,010
but how?

726
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,070
How is how is what I'm saying is
that's not a wrong or right thing.

727
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,470
That's just a question now

728
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,800
actually anymore.

729
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,451
I don't care anymore.

730
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:10,450
What's way more fascinating to
me is how involved you to gut.

731
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,560
That was way more fun.

732
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:11,990
Fascinating.

733
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,340
When you're getting a tax issues,

734
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,300
trying to explain to somebody

735
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,420
the actual issue was minuscule compared
to how psychologically captivating it

736
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:22,980
was and how he was genuinely getting
upset and you were getting upset too and I

737
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:26,890
was trying to mediate because
I generally did see both sides.

738
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,060
I genuinely did,

739
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,270
but what I couldn't understand is how you
guys are getting so God damn upset and

740
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,560
then when I would bring it up building it.

741
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:32,771
Oh,

742
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:37,400
this is the fucking new spa Joe Rogan
Joe Rogan from 1994 with a fucking stab

743
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:38,320
somebody by now.

744
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,930
We didn't even know each other back then.

745
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:41,170
Man.

746
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,390
You're just assuming you're
assuming I would have done that.

747
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:43,801
Well,

748
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:47,440
you know what it was just to me it was
like I've already said the same five

749
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:47,980
times.

750
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,161
I.

751
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:50,740
I can't say anything else about that.

752
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,020
I couldn't get you guys to stop.

753
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,893
It was fascinating.

754
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,581
You would like to.

755
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:54,414
Dogs Bark like,

756
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,300
shut up.

757
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,531
Bye Bye.

758
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:55,670
Bye.

759
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,503
Bye Bye.

760
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,920
Starting there also comes to
a point where you are like,

761
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,020
feel like you're talking
to your mom doing email.

762
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,330
That's how I get about certain things.

763
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,910
You must have saw his point a little bit.

764
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,211
No,

765
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,080
I see what he's saying,

766
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,100
but that's not what I'm saying.

767
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,950
I'm not saying I agree with him
or disagree with them on that.

768
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:16,180
He wasn't willing to listen to what you
were saying about the whole concept of

769
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,410
an rss feed,

770
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,740
which stands for really simple
syndication and what syndication mean.

771
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:23,720
You want to syndicate.

772
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,460
Yeah.

773
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,330
What's that mean?

774
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,010
It's you want to spread it out
to as many people as possible.

775
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,380
Absolutely available on your website.

776
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:29,920
Absolutely,

777
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,810
but the real problem was the real problem
is itunes numbers and that's what he

778
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:37,680
really wants to say is that sticker
was helping hurting his items,

779
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,160
numbers and probably that he
doesn't know what an rss feed is,

780
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,290
why it's on his website.

781
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,060
If he wants people to go to his website,

782
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,080
take off your rss feed,

783
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,943
that's all you have to do.

784
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,371
Make.

785
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,050
Don't make your rss feed public.

786
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,100
Just give it to Itunes,

787
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,780
only hide your rss feed and then everyone
will come to your website and you'll

788
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,481
have your items.

789
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,340
Only one.

790
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,110
We do one better than that.

791
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:57,960
We allow people to download
it and not just on Stitcher,

792
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,090
but allow people to download it directly,

793
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,160
so the moment it goes live,

794
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:04,710
I have a download link so I don't want.

795
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:07,470
You have to wait till somebody
itunes numbers will be higher.

796
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,500
Like to me all that matters
is that you get it out there,

797
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,560
you don't get cookies for being number
three or number four or you know,

798
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,251
it's cute.

799
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,390
It's nice to see the number,

800
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,600
but what's important to me is just that
it gets distributed to as many people as

801
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,280
possible as easily as possible.

802
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,110
Some people don't like
fucking with itunes.

803
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,910
Some dudes who love the Zune.

804
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:24,440
You know?

805
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,000
I heard the New Zealand is pretty bad ass.

806
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,050
I think they stopped making them bro.

807
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,171
Oh,

808
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:27,630
did they?

809
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,160
Yeah,

810
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,120
I lied on my ass.

811
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,770
I mean there's some people

812
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,970
that have just little MP.

813
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,500
Three players was a little flash MP.

814
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:34,440
Three players were like a little.

815
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,001
You know what I mean?

816
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:37,220
It's like he got to have it
available for everything in anybody.

817
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,100
No voids,

818
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,340
and especially when it's.

819
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,620
If it's a free thing that you just
want to get out your podcast to people,

820
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:44,771
you're.

821
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:44,891
No,

822
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:45,340
you're not.

823
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,380
You're not doing like Doug Benson
where you're charging money.

824
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:50,260
You're just trying to get your
body just calling out Doug Benson.

825
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:52,170
I can't believe the fee.

826
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,220
The honest thing is
the future of podcasts,

827
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,990
how our podcasts is going to make money.

828
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,510
What Doug is doing is pretty interesting.

829
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,730
He's charging money now
for like certain shows.

830
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,720
I don't think it's every shoe.

831
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,190
I think it's like he
has like certain shows.

832
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,060
Marin does that too.

833
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,830
It's like something where you become
like some super members on shit.

834
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,340
Right?

835
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,980
I mean,

836
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,980
I honestly think the only way really to
make money and to get sponsors got to

837
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,170
get a lot a lot of
listeners and get sponsors.

838
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:17,950
That's the way to do it,

839
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,550
right?

840
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,130
I think.

841
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,490
I think because I think we've just
reached this time on the Internet.

842
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,770
We have to look at the music
industry and we have to say,

843
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,011
look,

844
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,540
the music industry has changed.

845
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,260
It's not that people started
stealing and taking shit from,

846
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,230
from the music industry.

847
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,290
Is that happened and that
there was no way to stop that,

848
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,660
so the music industry has to reorganize,

849
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:37,660
refigure out how they do it and that's
going to happen with everything and you

850
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:38,740
can't fucking stop it.

851
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,410
You just gotta go with what you think
is going to happen and that's like

852
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,041
podcasting.

853
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,900
No one knows what's
happening with podcasting,

854
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,010
but you have to pretty much
go with what you can do

855
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,580
right now.

856
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,440
We'll try to have the luxury thing.

857
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,750
We also have the luxury
of doing other things,

858
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,021
you know,

859
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:55,070
I have the luxury of not having to rely
completely on my podcast with the UFC

860
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:58,070
and we're doing standup especially
with doing standup because the podcast

861
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,200
definitely enhances the standard insanely.

862
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:00,401
And,

863
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:01,670
and also just look at Philly,

864
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,360
Philly,

865
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,960
you just sold out all affiliate,

866
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:04,101
right?

867
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:04,291
Yeah,

868
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:04,751
it's sold out.

869
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:05,720
It's two weeks from now.

870
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:06,260
I mean how,

871
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,490
when was the last time that happened?

872
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,170
It wasn't happening like that before.

873
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,470
It's like that everywhere it.

874
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,890
Seattle last weekend
was fucking crazy man.

875
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,970
1,800 people.

876
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,691
And when I asked them,

877
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:14,901
I'm like,

878
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,310
how many guys were listening to podcast?

879
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,420
It was like the whole crowd.

880
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:18,800
It was 100 percent of the crowd.

881
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,580
Do you get that now?

882
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:19,880
Joy.

883
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,020
I get people yelling out.

884
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:23,630
Do Joe Diaz has changed completely.

885
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,530
And with music which really going on
with music is that they had to give it

886
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,190
away.

887
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,850
So now you make money performing
at these bitches can't perform.

888
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,423
Yeah,

889
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,520
they're faking it.

890
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,000
Sorry.

891
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,590
They can't perform the music.

892
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,420
The music will use it.

893
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:40,610
Got Real auto tune over their voice.

894
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,390
And you know,

895
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,450
the allman brothers could show up with
three white guys with fucking rocket

896
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,150
soca.

897
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,740
Whether it's good,

898
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,240
there's no they can do it.

899
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,990
The organist shit don't
come through like God,

900
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,250
I believe that.

901
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,840
Good.

902
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,360
I want to go see fucking the black eyed
peas to sing songs for fucking people

903
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,530
are one fucking song.

904
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,040
Boom,

905
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,401
boom,

906
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:58,820
boom,

907
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,330
boom,

908
00:24:59,330 --> 00:24:59,691
boom,

909
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:00,020
boom.

910
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,740
But really 80 fucking dollars for
the ticket to see that nonsense.

911
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,160
There's no musician store.

912
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,261
There's not that many.

913
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:09,200
The black keys are pretty fucking
bad listening to black kids.

914
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:09,351
Yeah,

915
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,240
but they can't do fucking
love the black kids.

916
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:11,691
Seriously.

917
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:12,650
I can't get enough.

918
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,790
Like anything they do.

919
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,580
I fucking love the shit they're.

920
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,700
They're on the right frequency.

921
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:17,840
They're on the radio frequency.

922
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,880
Listen,

923
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,060
they're real musicians.

924
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,460
Listen to king of the musicians
right now is the Guy Dave Grohl,

925
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,630
better musician that's lived
that spirit of this band,

926
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,410
the band,

927
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,920
the foo fighters there is bad because
their students are the fucking gate.

928
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,670
Prince went to Vegas two years
ago and did a show of request.

929
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,780
Really?

930
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,600
Can you imagine everything
you hit print with.

931
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,660
He's going to play for,

932
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:39,060
I believe,

933
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,760
Elsa to fuck billy idol,

934
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:43,290
so people yell it out in the crowd
and we just did $500 a ticket.

935
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,803
Bam.

936
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,330
Coming.

937
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,100
Y'All bitch aerosmith and people
go and performance at the end.

938
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,190
Started flying out there just
because I want to get an estate.

939
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,120
This motherfucker's going.

940
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:53,954
What do you want to hear?

941
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,780
Come together.

942
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,221
The Beatles.

943
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:55,491
Ready?

944
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:55,880
One,

945
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,091
two,

946
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:56,540
three,

947
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,373
four

948
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,990
down.

949
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,750
Now.

950
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,020
That's fucking.

951
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,060
That's why he was getting a little
fucking ticket or get these tickets are

952
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:05,600
outrageous.

953
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,120
Now for these bands to the real deal.

954
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,400
He's a real musical genius.

955
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:10,880
You know?

956
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,100
He put out a lot of bad songs.

957
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:14,000
Unfortunately.

958
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,391
He.

959
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:16,450
There's a lot of his songs and I just then

960
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,140
he was experimenting with everything
but they were still stuck in this bucket

961
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:24,980
and he was like,

962
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,610
Yo,

963
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,780
he had some great jams bro

964
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,180
Chances.

965
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,531
So there's,

966
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:33,110
some of them didn't come out and some
of them is very self indulgent so his

967
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:33,840
style is,

968
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,340
you know,

969
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,810
sometimes it gets caught
up and what he's doing,

970
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,070
but when he hit it,

971
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,390
erotic city,

972
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,560
come on son,

973
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,610
come on,

974
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,870
come on,

975
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,140
done.

976
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,970
That's a great God damn song.

977
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,151
I,

978
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:45,984
that was my.

979
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,910
During high school there was a,

980
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,610
they were trying to get that
as our high school senior song,

981
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,683
erotic city.

982
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,290
We were,

983
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,190
it was a write in,

984
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,731
you know,

985
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:56,730
so we were all trying to like organize
it and then someone listened to it.

986
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,600
Someone who worked for
the school as it do it.

987
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,860
That was the end of that.

988
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,970
Do Do.

989
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,270
Oh,

990
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,330
it's fucking amazing.

991
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,090
He's done some great shit and
that's what's really going on.

992
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,690
So everybody's got to have gone.

993
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:13,770
But it's amazing that somebody told
me this two years ago and I really

994
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:15,570
experienced that last year in Irvine.

995
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,500
Last year was when I see the
fruition of what you've been doing.

996
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,620
Somebody told me that now
because of the Internet,

997
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,090
twitter and all the podcasts and people
want the full experience and I didn't

998
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:28,740
really see it to last July.

999
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,040
If you noticed last July when I
changed everything about my twitter,

1000
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,690
my facebook,

1001
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,960
I changed everything about it because
they paid more attention to it.

1002
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,020
How come I understand now
where you're coming from?

1003
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,461
There's no more.

1004
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:42,840
I see what Ralphie may's doing.

1005
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:43,860
I see what you're doing with these.

1006
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:48,690
Wasted his time when he flies into a city
a week before or two days to do radio.

1007
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,620
That's a waste of time.

1008
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:51,960
That's all that you're staying at home.

1009
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,033
You don't have to do.

1010
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,120
The thing about this game is to to make
the most money for the least amount of

1011
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:57,331
work.

1012
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,760
That's why I don't like that.

1013
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,061
It's not just that.

1014
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,490
It's not that with as
many people as you can,

1015
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,301
but you have a wife,

1016
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,134
you have children.

1017
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,560
I don't want to chew in the Brassica
Monday doing some radio show for what,

1018
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,600
but I never did that anyway.

1019
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:08,810
No,

1020
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,440
I wouldn't.

1021
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,111
I would never do it,

1022
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:13,440
but I will look what you do with
a blink of a fucking button.

1023
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,980
You added an extra show in Australia
three weeks ago with a blink of a couple

1024
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,290
hours,

1025
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,000
a couple of hours.

1026
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,940
We put together a show on a
Thursday night or differently.

1027
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,140
Now that you've been
talking about it for years.

1028
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,550
It all came to fruition with a podcast
or blog with twitter and you know I've

1029
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:32,490
become an expert now at the twitter
is now I know how to do it more.

1030
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,380
You gotta give them something
and then tweet something.

1031
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,783
Give them something.

1032
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,670
Not Every fucking stupid joke that
comes out of your fucking mind because

1033
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,460
everybody thinks if you're a monologist,

1034
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:44,640
you're going to die on twitter because
you got to sell the fucking joke.

1035
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,290
If you to make a mind jumping on twitter,

1036
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,520
it's not going to go nowhere.

1037
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,450
Sometimes when you talk
about your situation and
twitter and then talk about a

1038
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:53,760
free show or a show and
then your situation,

1039
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,721
it's different.

1040
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:57,930
I answered every fucking body and on
twitter I try to fuck with people on

1041
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:58,764
twitter.

1042
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,050
My twitter is a lot on facebook,

1043
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,951
more Christians.

1044
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:04,530
I got nephews and nieces.

1045
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,211
I can't think of it.

1046
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,570
I still throw out the blunt of life,

1047
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:06,991
you know what I mean?

1048
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:07,801
I don't give a fuck.

1049
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:09,610
Get over it every now and
then you hit him with.

1050
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,390
I got to hit them with something every
morning just to wake the morning and they

1051
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,530
got to look at your shit.

1052
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,940
Little 13 year old lady.

1053
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,550
That motherhood Uncle Joe.

1054
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:17,610
He wrote on his twitter today.

1055
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:18,120
Mommy,

1056
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,400
what's the uni by doing the afternoon.

1057
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:21,420
Go Fuck Yourself.

1058
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,320
That's the truth though.

1059
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,550
That Tito tee shirts,

1060
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,211
by the way folks,

1061
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,680
they are being printed right now.

1062
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,460
The if you ain't high by two in
the afternoon and go fuck it.

1063
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:28,790
Sorry.

1064
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,020
Sophia told me he ordered
up a couple thousand feet.

1065
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,930
Ain't no joke does.

1066
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,080
He was still viable
because this year is cool.

1067
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,963
So strong.

1068
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,700
It's so strong.

1069
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,550
If you've seen on the phone and
I seen the such a strong shirt.

1070
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,560
So the saying is so strong.

1071
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,430
Dr. Hole when you sent it,

1072
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,300
we repeated it like four times because
it was so funny and it was the weirdest

1073
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,131
thing because the guy,

1074
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:51,310
I don't know to tell the story that the
guy was smoking with Oscar for fucking

1075
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,410
three Ds shift for Star Wars.

1076
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,970
His name is Dykstra.

1077
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:55,871
Oh yeah.

1078
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,080
And I despite a band too,

1079
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:00,600
and Dykstra was that the guy in
charge of all the fucking crazy three.

1080
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:01,540
Our Three d guy,

1081
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,351
the special effects,

1082
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,041
special effects.

1083
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:03,874
His name is.

1084
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,720
He's a genius.

1085
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,040
He's a fucking genius.

1086
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,200
When you talked to him and
he has a little daughter,

1087
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:14,350
if you watch spiderman two after I stick
up for us by the minute as a little

1088
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:15,940
girl on the train that says me too.

1089
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,510
That's his daughter and his daughter was
telling everybody on the train the suck

1090
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,080
a dick.

1091
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,600
He was 12.

1092
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,460
Something like that though.

1093
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:22,294
That's my father.

1094
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,163
Shut up,

1095
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,003
sit down.

1096
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,970
But the only way she dug was me
because I would give it to her.

1097
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,481
You know what I'm saying?

1098
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:28,931
Like what's up?

1099
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:29,530
Sit down.

1100
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,020
Will you think talking to Joey Bananas,

1101
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,320
the baby.

1102
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,080
I was so big that they
wouldn't put me on the train.

1103
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,100
They just go check it.

1104
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,760
So I come into Spiderman,

1105
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,820
I check in and then I go
eat and go to my room.

1106
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:40,630
They put me in a room,

1107
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,463
not even in the trailer.

1108
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,210
So I would go to my room and smoke pot.

1109
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,321
I told you about this.

1110
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:45,070
I go get ready.

1111
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,450
I go raping somebody,

1112
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:47,570
keeps smoking dope in my room,

1113
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,580
but I get to the bottom of this.

1114
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,710
Go Joe here.

1115
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,280
I don't know.

1116
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,490
And it was me the whole time.

1117
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,610
So one day dykes were figuring it out.

1118
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,931
He goes,

1119
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:55,764
things nobody's smoking.

1120
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,180
Do you think you getting over on him?

1121
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:58,871
It's fucking me.

1122
00:30:58,871 --> 00:30:59,704
Where is it?

1123
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,990
What's behind the building?

1124
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,040
So we go behind the building.

1125
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,320
Like one day it was smoke and
we go behind the building again.

1126
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,290
The one they were smoking,

1127
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,750
the third day comes,

1128
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,130
some fucking PA comes,

1129
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:12,580
you know how they get some
type of an older woman like 42.

1130
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,751
She came back,

1131
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:14,860
then she seen us and she goes,

1132
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,750
let a whatever they're looking for you,

1133
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,880
are you smoking pot?

1134
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,530
What's wrong with you?

1135
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,610
And I sat for a minute,

1136
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:22,444
I got all like,

1137
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,770
there is something wrong with me.

1138
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,840
What's wrong with me?

1139
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:26,890
What's wrong with you?

1140
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,090
If you will fucking high,

1141
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,920
you wouldn't be worried
about us not smoking high.

1142
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:30,490
It was like 10,

1143
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,181
15 in the morning.

1144
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,420
I meant to say it's 10:00 in the morning
and how the hell can you be smoking

1145
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:34,660
pot?

1146
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,950
You really smoking pot,

1147
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,933
why wouldn't you?

1148
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,130
And that's what we came up with.

1149
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:38,710
A name for it.

1150
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,030
But we will fuck what's wrong with you?

1151
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,620
Fuck is wrong with me.

1152
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:42,580
What's wrong with you?

1153
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,443
Bitch?

1154
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,380
You Ain't fucking problem.

1155
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:45,971
And you were high.

1156
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,680
You wouldn't worry about me smoking dope.

1157
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,933
Yeah,

1158
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,370
it's,

1159
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,840
it's a weird thing where people want to
stop you from doing something because

1160
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,400
they think it's an indulgence.

1161
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,420
You know,

1162
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:55,571
they,

1163
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:55,721
you're,

1164
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:56,860
you're being weak.

1165
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,240
Indulging.

1166
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,410
You know,

1167
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,120
my wife said to me two days ago,

1168
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:01,421
she goes,

1169
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:01,691
you know what?

1170
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:03,580
The funny thing is at 5:30 in the morning,

1171
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:04,780
I can hear the alarm go off.

1172
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,880
But I heard you do a water bong hit.

1173
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,353
That's when you.

1174
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,900
I told me Tuesday morning,

1175
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,181
she goes,

1176
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:13,380
you know,

1177
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,171
I didn't hear the alarm,

1178
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:18,310
but I definitely heard your
bong hit bong in the bedroom.

1179
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,630
I got a bong in the office.

1180
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:20,470
Then the office door,

1181
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,440
they step off into the
office and fire it up.

1182
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:22,710
Oh.

1183
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,291
When I get up,

1184
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,130
I brush my teeth.

1185
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,940
I piss and put the coffee on and I
feed the cats and I go right for that.

1186
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,050
I pray for 10 million.

1187
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:29,500
You'll wake and bake like a motherfucker.

1188
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,820
I used to wake and bake.

1189
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:31,840
That fucks up your whole day.

1190
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:32,740
You wait five minutes.

1191
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,830
I got real balance out the body.

1192
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,680
Eight a little candle up to balance
out the Ph to get the fucking bottles.

1193
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,220
Moving.

1194
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,860
Cantaloupe.

1195
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,250
Hmm.

1196
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,340
I think it does up if you take it,

1197
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,280
if you can bake,

1198
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,860
it fucks you up your whole
day up your whole day.

1199
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,671
Once he smoked weed,

1200
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:50,370
you're pretty much the same
for the rest of the Times.

1201
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:51,031
I'm the king of it.

1202
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:51,864
I ain't gonna lie to you

1203
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,201
by 11:00.

1204
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:53,501
You're like,

1205
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:54,334
I fucked up.

1206
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,320
When you call the doctor's office,

1207
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:56,620
he like,

1208
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,440
I ain't going to happen.

1209
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,730
Do you tell how many days you take
off on a regular firm will take off

1210
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,683
for what?

1211
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,811
I went to prison.

1212
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:04,644
That was long enough.

1213
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,630
Fucking months without smoking.

1214
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:09,350
Weed out of my ass in the
fucking sneaking around.

1215
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,670
So you're addicted to it.

1216
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,120
I'm not addicted to it.

1217
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:13,631
I just can't.

1218
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:14,321
I'm a head dog.

1219
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:15,154
I'm the real deal.

1220
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
I'm going to smoke dope.

1221
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:18,981
That's my bag.

1222
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:19,371
Some people,

1223
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:20,900
alcoholics and people like to drink.

1224
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,410
I can't imagine a life without wheat.

1225
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,930
I.

1226
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,220
I've been smoking since I was 14.

1227
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:25,991
Have you ever thought,

1228
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:28,450
maybe because you can't imagine
because you don't remember it?

1229
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:28,990
No,

1230
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,950
I can't imagine it.

1231
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:30,890
Not the front door.

1232
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,450
Redman.

1233
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,320
I'm the real fucking deal.

1234
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:32,770
I remember.

1235
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,603
I know you're the real deal,

1236
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,573
so

1237
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,990
I just like smoking weed.

1238
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,010
The people I grew up,

1239
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,670
the type of person I grew up with when
I went to Colorado was all around a lot

1240
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:42,360
of heads.

1241
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,193
They like weed,

1242
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,711
they enjoy.

1243
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:45,480
We when I got home
yesterday night and that,

1244
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,160
that thing was 31 percent.

1245
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:48,930
I told it in 10 people got back to me.

1246
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:50,550
That said go drive up in San Diego.

1247
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,550
That's a head that's not a kid that just,

1248
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,340
Oh my God,

1249
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,330
I got the boats.

1250
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,740
Were Pineapple Express?

1251
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:56,280
No,

1252
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,100
there's certain weeds that's got a
name that you just smoke it to be cool.

1253
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,221
Then there's the shits.

1254
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,040
This stuff again,

1255
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,870
coach called Matt Number One or g mats.

1256
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:04,540
Number one.

1257
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,250
Look at like some famous growers.

1258
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,240
Matt is the guy that owns Kush smart,

1259
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:09,120
so when he took her,

1260
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,020
he bought that brand and wanting to
grow for him and this is a hybrid.

1261
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,110
It's a hybrid and that he's got
the snoop Dogg that's a 28 percent.

1262
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,220
That's how this stuff might be.

1263
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,620
The perfect week might be
the greatest we'd ever.

1264
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,360
I smoked it and I realized when I smoked
at the I've been going to CC and I've

1265
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,390
been buying $50,

1266
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:28,940
fucking eights and I realized that the
part was good and some days when I Bite

1267
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,780
Grand Lake by 6:00 after grant was gun,

1268
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,390
I'm smoking too much pot.

1269
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,000
When the bond,

1270
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,650
that's when I hit,

1271
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,960
we'd had member that how I
started this diet was match.

1272
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,790
Oh Gee.

1273
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,960
When you smoked in the morning,

1274
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:43,800
the sativa would take over your mind
so quickly and I have to get out of the

1275
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:47,220
house before my head blew up and I will
have to get on a bike and I would just

1276
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:51,120
get on the bike and pedal because they're
chasing me and that's how I lost 100

1277
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,150
fucking pounds on that
bug smoking to match.

1278
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,960
So g,

1279
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,781
because it's a Tiva,

1280
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,520
wouldn't speed you up by cocaine.

1281
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,010
It speed you up at a greg control you.

1282
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,790
And it went from being a sativa
and to methodically like Endeca.

1283
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,673
It was the weirdest.

1284
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,680
People don't have standard.

1285
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,230
Sativa actually makes the ambitious.

1286
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,900
People think that it's the people that
look like a pot and you look at people

1287
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:13,130
being potheads being like unambitious
and Lazy Sativa makes me way more

1288
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:13,700
ambitious.

1289
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,960
It makes me aware of the consequences of
not working as hard as you can and how

1290
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:18,794
you feel.

1291
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,950
It makes me super sensitive
to my own actions,

1292
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:22,970
positive or negative.

1293
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:26,660
So it makes me super sensitive to doing
things that I should be doing as far as

1294
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,490
like getting work done as far as like,

1295
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:28,701
you know,

1296
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,740
writing and performing and you know,

1297
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,111
and,

1298
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:32,480
and doing podcasts and it,

1299
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,250
I don't ever cancel podcast man,

1300
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:34,680
you know,

1301
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,100
after I'd have to be sick as fuck
and I don't get sick very often.

1302
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,940
So we do.

1303
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,060
Um,

1304
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,250
you know,

1305
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:43,090
it's like Sativa makes me hyper
aware when I'm hyper aware I'm,

1306
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:44,460
I'm more diligent,

1307
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:44,940
you know.

1308
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,650
So I think it makes me more ambitious.

1309
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,140
But do you guys think if you had,

1310
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,880
if you wanted to take a month off,

1311
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,410
do you think you could
possibly easily do it?

1312
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,801
Sure,

1313
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,960
I've done that and I
haven't taken a month off,

1314
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,010
but I've taken weeks off.

1315
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,610
I can take a couple of days off.

1316
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,430
But why?

1317
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,330
Just to see what does this fear factor.

1318
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,731
Here's the perfect.

1319
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:03,231
I've tried.

1320
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:04,220
I've thought about it.

1321
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,300
You smoke a shitload of weed.

1322
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:07,470
You have to be spending a shit

1323
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,303
load of.

1324
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,320
I smoke a shitload of weed in the
people around me smoke a shitload dog.

1325
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,000
It's really weird that the
people around me are into it,

1326
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:15,781
like I'm into it,

1327
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:19,410
like the type people we all have fun
together and when people don't understand

1328
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,930
about marijuana is that they
think it's some sort of an escape.

1329
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,550
It's an enhancement.

1330
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,110
It's not an escape.

1331
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,850
We're living in the same
world you're living in,

1332
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,390
ma'am.

1333
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,100
It's just more fun when you're high.

1334
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,590
It's really that simple and
it's not ruining your body.

1335
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,760
It's bullshit.

1336
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,760
Pepper on your steak for tate.

1337
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,180
Tate.

1338
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,931
Can't smoke weed.

1339
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:37,350
You know,

1340
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,460
standing up doesn't like weed.

1341
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,960
There's a lot of our
friends don't like weed.

1342
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,250
That's all well and good man.

1343
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,510
It's fine.

1344
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,343
Yeah.

1345
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,220
I mean I've been smoking weed so much
that I could take a couple of days off.

1346
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,750
I could take probably a week.

1347
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,430
I've probably taken a week off recently,

1348
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:50,880
but.

1349
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,481
But the,

1350
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:52,830
the idea of taking a month off,

1351
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,150
it's so foreign to me.

1352
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,730
I almost want to do it
just to see what happens.

1353
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,970
Like I must blog about it.

1354
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,290
She'd become a Republican.

1355
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,540
He started watching bill o'reilly.

1356
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,820
I have no idea.

1357
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,551
It was right.

1358
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,290
We do have to be afraid of Mexican.

1359
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
I haven't stopped smoking weed since 14,

1360
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,120
15 to a point in my life,

1361
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,270
my career,

1362
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,070
I can't write anymore.

1363
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,180
When I get really high.

1364
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,590
Really?

1365
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:13,861
You're like,

1366
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:13,951
well,

1367
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:14,671
I get up in the morning,

1368
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:15,211
I get high.

1369
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:19,230
It's to go on twitter and facebook and
make adjustments here and get my day

1370
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:20,064
ready.

1371
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,280
But like now when I write I
try to be a little straighter.

1372
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,810
Really what I work out.

1373
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,090
I got a blaze dog.

1374
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,840
If I get good at it.

1375
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,860
I had a book I got to get an edible.

1376
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,860
I love working out stumped.

1377
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,430
That is my life.

1378
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,340
That was how I did 30 years ago.

1379
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,000
I love not remembering what set it
is and I know my shoulders on fire.

1380
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,931
You know what I'm saying?

1381
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:41,860
I love the fact that if I get.

1382
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,780
If I don't get high,

1383
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,930
I still work out an hour
and I still do a good job,

1384
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,621
but if I work,

1385
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:47,341
if I get high,

1386
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:50,220
I'll work out an our 40 and
it's just a little tighter.

1387
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:51,780
I concentrate on my kicks.

1388
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,130
I concentrate on the form.

1389
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:53,940
Yeah,

1390
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,773
I know what you mean.

1391
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,733
Do everything.

1392
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,100
When I kicked the bag of them high,

1393
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,680
usually I don't usually I kicked the
whole holding the bag by mistake.

1394
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:02,514
I will.

1395
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,540
I left Brown House with the fucking ankle,

1396
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,920
but I like getting on the bike
stones because think about it.

1397
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:15,270
I liked the elliptical stone
is a fucking different world.

1398
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,870
You know how many people were all
stoned Jujitsu or you have to.

1399
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,840
Everybody does.

1400
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,021
No,

1401
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:19,091
no,

1402
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:19,330
no.

1403
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:19,940
I'll tell you,

1404
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,770
these classes and these classes,

1405
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,700
like you walk in that room,

1406
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,960
you smell refer you.

1407
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,440
Some everyone smells like refer.

1408
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,660
This is like half of his fucking
students are high as fuck.

1409
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:28,494
When they take you

1410
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,470
a piece of banana cake and you go to yoga.

1411
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,590
Oh my God.

1412
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,040
But you that that's Mckenna

1413
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,710
used to say that that's
what yoga was invented for.

1414
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,160
Yoga was an advance before
was maximizing cannabis.

1415
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,290
It was you.

1416
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,530
People would be eating cannabis and when
they were eating it they realized how

1417
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:50,170
good it felt when you hold
your body in certain positions.

1418
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,810
So they came up with this like
connection to spirituality through eating

1419
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,970
cannabis and holding these poses.

1420
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:59,180
These difficult political.

1421
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,160
Yeah,

1422
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,701
because something.

1423
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:04,240
I don't know what it is about the energy
of the pose that makes you go into some

1424
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,950
some state when you're high as fuck,

1425
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,940
but it really does.

1426
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,870
Even if when you're sober,

1427
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:08,081
man,

1428
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,330
I've done yoga sober and after it's over,

1429
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,020
I felt high.

1430
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,853
Well the breathing,

1431
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,880
the breathing,

1432
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,910
intense breathing that's going through
your body and focusing so much on the

1433
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:16,630
breathing.

1434
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,870
When I go in and ate a little piece of
banana bread because it's 8:30 in the

1435
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,090
morning when I got to go to your.

1436
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,310
So I gotta start blazing 7:30 by the time.

1437
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,290
How long does it take for
banana bread or hit you?

1438
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,130
Twenty minutes.

1439
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,540
Twenty minutes to five minutes
and I kick it a little Jaffa,

1440
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:29,770
Jay,

1441
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,790
to get everything going.

1442
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,540
I didn't have to do
other than downward dog.

1443
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,200
I've been fucking pigeons.

1444
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:37,600
I've been fun and it's.

1445
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,840
And it's you thinking about
your breathing is so beautiful.

1446
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:41,674
When you're high,

1447
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,400
I want you to go into the
water and you have like.

1448
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,110
And you could hear your
breath like right now.

1449
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,153
Yes.

1450
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,293
Yeah.

1451
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,410
When you do yoga,

1452
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,870
you can hear if you hear
that you've reached it,

1453
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,740
reached that level in that
position with the weed.

1454
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:58,150
It makes it a lot easier for me.

1455
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,810
I'm a loser.

1456
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,560
I know you ain't really.

1457
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,221
Like I said,

1458
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:06,370
that's the reason why in Yoga
may have very well been invented.

1459
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,300
According to Mckenna,

1460
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,520
they believe he believes they were,

1461
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,960
they invented yoga to maximize the,

1462
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:11,261
the,

1463
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:11,491
the,

1464
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:11,891
the uh,

1465
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,330
effects of eating cannabis.

1466
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,340
It's something I've gotten
high play basketball.

1467
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:16,630
I've got high lifting weights.

1468
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,650
There's nothing like eating a
little bit of weed and go to yoga.

1469
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,800
Even if it's a basic class just
to focus on your breathing.

1470
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:24,591
I do it every Tuesday,

1471
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,800
like tomorrow I got rush
and then go to the airport,

1472
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,070
but I'll do it now.

1473
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,110
Either that a bowl in the morning because
I have nothing else and it is just

1474
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,460
fucking breathe my body.

1475
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,490
Randy Parsons,

1476
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,900
your good friend Ryan Ryan was at the gym.

1477
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:41,290
Would they adjustments and there was an
argument going on between trainers and

1478
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,460
these guys were white guys.

1479
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:47,170
They weren't heads and the guy was saying
that he's been telling all his clients

1480
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,381
to,

1481
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,690
if police after their workouts,

1482
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:54,540
their weight workouts to smoke a little
reefer because it's a anti inflammatory

1483
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,320
and it works better than anything else.

1484
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,110
Even like the letters should
have the ass daddy and muscles.

1485
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,420
Lettuce like lettuce.

1486
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,680
When you eat lettuce and pulls
the acid out of your muscles,

1487
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,060
work out something like that.

1488
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,871
Acid.

1489
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:05,600
This something.

1490
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,000
Let us do something after you work out
the acid out of your muscles so they can

1491
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:10,990
recover or something.

1492
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,470
Okay.

1493
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,470
Well this guy was talking about does that.

1494
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,800
We'd done anti inflammatories yes,

1495
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,590
and that they're scared to tell
people because we'll go fucking crazy.

1496
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:18,940
Well,

1497
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,773
it kind of makes sense.

1498
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,830
It's a painkiller.

1499
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,770
If people enjoy it for a pain,

1500
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,900
it kind of makes sense
that it would also be,

1501
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:26,800
you know,

1502
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,150
for inflammation.

1503
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:31,460
He said it's really good for your
joints to do something with the.

1504
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,661
Well,

1505
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:35,210
that's one of the reasons they
prescribed for arthritis people.

1506
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,980
A lot of people that
have chronic arthritis,

1507
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,150
like I've talked to people that said that
they literally couldn't move and then

1508
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,240
they would smoke weed and then all of a
sudden they could walk around like they

1509
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:44,990
could function,

1510
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,220
you know,

1511
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,510
it allowed them to be,

1512
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,603
to be mobile.

1513
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,921
I don't know,

1514
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:49,430
man.

1515
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,263
It makes sense.

1516
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,253
I mean,

1517
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,330
it helps a lot of people
in a lot of different ways.

1518
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,970
It's just a shame that we have to
pretend that something wrong with it.

1519
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,340
If people want to think
it's not a big deal.

1520
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,680
Like why don't you guys talk
about we don't fucking losers.

1521
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:01,843
Like first of all,

1522
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,590
we're not losers and don't be mean.

1523
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,580
And second of all,

1524
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,080
it is a fucking important issue,

1525
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:06,410
man.

1526
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,250
It is important.

1527
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:08,360
We know ourselves,

1528
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:09,380
how it affects us.

1529
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,610
We know ourselves.

1530
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,150
How much,

1531
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,080
how much more aware.

1532
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,370
Thank God you turn his mic off and
stick it here and you still go there.

1533
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,040
But what I wanted them we 20 years
ago is not what I want from me today.

1534
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,510
He wanted to escape 20 years ago.

1535
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,170
Um,

1536
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,860
I liked it.

1537
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,120
I have an only child,

1538
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
so I love living in my head.

1539
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,741
Guys,

1540
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:28,370
you give me a fuck.

1541
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,260
You let me get my head.

1542
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,094
You're a dead man.

1543
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,280
Say Yeah,

1544
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,190
you let me get my head.

1545
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:32,850
The lonely child.

1546
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,490
I'm breaking it down in little time.

1547
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:34,800
I know.

1548
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,110
I know what it is to be in the closet.

1549
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:37,030
Playing Gi Joes,

1550
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,460
making up your own world and Disneyland
is outside your fucking closet.

1551
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,630
I'm an only child.

1552
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,670
I know how to get the party
started my fucking head.

1553
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,870
That's why I like being alone.

1554
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,770
Even though there's that you can be with
and the life pod you go fuck yourself.

1555
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,120
Nevermind.

1556
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,530
Two o'clock they go fuck yourself.

1557
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,783
I'm one of those guys.

1558
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,670
Joey will vanish.

1559
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,510
Sometimes I could go on an island solo.

1560
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,120
I like.

1561
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,880
I enjoy.

1562
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,500
I don't.

1563
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,090
I don't creep out of my skin.

1564
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,080
Well listen man,

1565
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:03,440
that's a beautiful quality in
comparison to the alternative.

1566
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,060
The alternative is someone who needs
people around them all the time and needs

1567
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:12,010
attention all the time and everybody
knows how God down with knowing that is

1568
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,540
rare that someone says extroverted as you,

1569
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,420
but also I guess it's just
a balance to Yin and Yang,

1570
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:17,760
right?

1571
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,190
You need that downtime to.

1572
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,410
I really enjoyed my.

1573
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,800
I never enjoyed this drop.

1574
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:22,251
My wife.

1575
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,710
I always thought you
had to be moving with.

1576
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,710
That's what kills people.

1577
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,740
People don't make enough time
for themselves themselves.

1578
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:28,480
And what's that?

1579
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,360
A trip to Jamaica.

1580
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,650
One hour.

1581
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:30,921
Well,

1582
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:31,754
people don't.

1583
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,440
Don't make enough.

1584
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:33,741
Well,

1585
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,251
it's hard.

1586
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:37,190
You got to manage your life correctly
to to get to a position where you can

1587
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,450
enjoy things because some people,

1588
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:39,800
they're just scratching every week.

1589
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,310
Man.

1590
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,510
Every week is scratching
trying to get ahead.

1591
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,910
Can't get no fucking traction.

1592
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:44,870
Trying to figure it all out.

1593
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,490
That's a tremendous amount of stress,

1594
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:46,731
you know?

1595
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:47,480
Less than an hour.

1596
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,190
He came over and were smoking
the metallurgy and it was
10 to six or something

1597
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,440
and we heard this belt being
being Mexican ice cream man,

1598
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,280
and it is the best ice
cream you'll ever have.

1599
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:01,400
It's dairy queen with ice cream and
it makes a delicious banana split.

1600
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,930
I'd been there for a year now,

1601
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,000
one brown spot over of data,

1602
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,760
and it's funny that you said to me,

1603
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:10,220
you get so much enjoyment
for the ice cream truck.

1604
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,410
Your life is what you make enjoyment.

1605
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,610
I'm not filthy loaded,

1606
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,910
but I get off on that
fucking ice cream man coming

1607
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:18,591
to New York.

1608
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:19,424
I talked to Ralph.

1609
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,150
He's in this hotel in the
city and I got this and that.

1610
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,243
Fuck it.

1611
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,430
I'll come around if he doesn't use
the Internet because he feels that his

1612
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:29,264
clientele,

1613
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,620
he doesn't use the Internet.

1614
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,790
I don't know the answer.

1615
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,470
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.

1616
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,800
He's found the one percent of
the population that isn't online.

1617
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,161
I mean,

1618
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:39,320
who the fuck isn't online?

1619
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,081
That's so silly.

1620
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:42,890
It's just really weird online.

1621
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,170
Now,

1622
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,670
that expression is so true.

1623
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,260
That expression is so true.

1624
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,250
When chicken is another man's Gumbo,

1625
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,710
did a show with the city and all my
friends go to chinatown with do this blog

1626
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,333
kind of sucked.

1627
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,750
That sucked my place in
Richfield park chance dragging,

1628
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,730
instilled the pound for pound.

1629
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,930
We're in old school.

1630
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,770
Chinese food.

1631
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,903
You gotta eat more?

1632
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,520
I grow shrimp and lobster
sauce has been working it.

1633
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,400
Old Schools to doodle.

1634
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,303
Old School.

1635
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,810
Old School 30.

1636
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,530
I've been going to answer since
1979 to get steak on a stick.

1637
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:14,450
When I was a sophomore.

1638
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,300
They send a cup.

1639
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,460
They have one of the best pupil
platters and the Chinese food.

1640
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,080
So good on the east coast.

1641
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,980
Is China closer image right?

1642
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,150
The east coast.

1643
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,150
New York must be.

1644
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,830
You can get great Chinese food out here,

1645
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:29,850
but it's not consistent.

1646
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:30,750
Not everything is good.

1647
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,850
I go to a place that the pork fried rice.

1648
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,440
You think you're in the bronx but
don't get the shipment in Galway.

1649
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,310
So it's a lobster cantonese or you feel
like you're reading it with a white dude

1650
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:39,280
named Chad lobster.

1651
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,110
Cantonese is.

1652
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,270
Nobody goes last week.

1653
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,930
I'm a city.

1654
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,580
Respect lobster,

1655
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:46,430
Cantonese everywhere.

1656
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,780
Some people got to eat postured rails.

1657
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:49,591
You and I both know.

1658
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:52,890
You take a little train to fuck in the
bronx and you find the mom and pop store

1659
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,280
and for 1495 you're going to get hard
that you offered the guy 100 bucks.

1660
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:00,840
You could sleep in the back for an hour.

1661
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,040
Notice.

1662
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,330
When I lived in new Rochelle,

1663
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:05,040
we used to go to frank and knows this.

1664
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:08,540
So frank and John's in new Rochelle is a.

1665
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,650
When I lived in new
Rochelle is just old school,

1666
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:11,550
Italian place.

1667
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,280
The fucking food was so good.

1668
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,630
It was right down the street from me.

1669
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:17,100
I never eat anywhere else.

1670
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,960
I barely could afford
to eat there every day,

1671
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,210
but I scraped by everyday,

1672
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,110
barely affording it.

1673
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,153
Are you drinking more?

1674
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,260
You're just going to finish this,

1675
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:25,660
but said,

1676
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:25,990
well,

1677
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,580
what do you need to do?

1678
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,120
A black casts to let everybody know?

1679
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:30,750
Portland,

1680
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,171
Oregon,

1681
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:31,730
baby.

1682
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,140
It's all the shows are almost sold out.

1683
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:34,590
And uh,

1684
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,080
were there Thursday,

1685
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,640
Friday and Saturday at helium comedy club.

1686
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,410
And it's going to be fun as fuck.

1687
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,460
I can't wait.

1688
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,160
I've never done like a
long weekend in Portland.

1689
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,390
I've only done like one night.

1690
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:46,650
There were there for a UFC.

1691
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,180
I did one night in Portland.

1692
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,700
Sorry.

1693
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,860
Good fucking time.

1694
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:50,730
There's great food.

1695
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,560
There's great strip clubs.

1696
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,351
We've got little radio.

1697
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:53,960
So we're going out.

1698
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,120
Yeah,

1699
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,400
we got no radio and your
helium is their shit.

1700
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,010
Salute.

1701
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:01,440
We didn't and we got to
run this house nonstop.

1702
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,670
Nonstop jobs with that
little comedy tonight.

1703
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,930
Brian Cowen is going to
be down there at Sal's.

1704
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:09,670
Doug Benson,

1705
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,700
Doug Benson is going to be
down there and sales sales.

1706
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:12,660
Cami Hall in Hollywood,

1707
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,890
which is really.

1708
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:15,210
You're going to see it and
you going to go really?

1709
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,170
We in the right fucking place.

1710
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,160
It says Vianna cafe outside.

1711
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:23,161
It doesn't even have a sign that says
sounds comedy on the most low rent ghetto

1712
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:24,270
setup ever.

1713
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,440
But it's growing.

1714
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,310
And uh,

1715
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,120
eventually he's,

1716
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,250
well,

1717
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,990
he's doing construction
is going to have the back.

1718
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:30,010
It's

1719
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,360
going to be much better and bigger.

1720
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:32,530
And so this is just a spot.

1721
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,620
He had a nice spot and labrea and he's
a cool guy and he was always cool to

1722
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,640
comics and so we did you.

1723
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:38,610
You recorded a secret.

1724
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,530
Would you ever do with that cd?

1725
00:47:40,531 --> 00:47:42,000
They recorded that I could use it.

1726
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,060
No garbage.

1727
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,570
No.

1728
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,410
What happened was wrong.

1729
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,460
It was really weird job because uh,

1730
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,150
if you notice after that
I changed everything.

1731
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,000
I hate listening to
myself or watching myself.

1732
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,070
Let's get this out of the way.

1733
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,000
I got boxes and shit at the house.

1734
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:55,691
People give me,

1735
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:55,811
hey,

1736
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:56,511
but I taped it.

1737
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't want to see myself not at all.

1738
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,540
And I thought there was a problem and
then one that I watched the Johnny Depp on

1739
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,580
Letterman and let them set them.

1740
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,470
So after the thing he was living in it.

1741
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,813
After I shoot,

1742
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,193
it's over.

1743
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,870
I don't watch myself
because really who I felt.

1744
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:11,261
Okay.

1745
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:12,240
I'm not the only retaught.

1746
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,360
I don't like nothing about that.

1747
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:15,550
That's why I've never looked
into myself doing stand up.

1748
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,200
I can't take my voice.

1749
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,900
But after I taped that
special and listened to it,

1750
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:24,800
I was so ashamed of myself that I made
notes in this shit and really helped me.

1751
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,960
And I still,

1752
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:26,110
I,

1753
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,700
I bring the Ipod,

1754
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,860
I taped myself on short
sets during the week.

1755
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,870
I'm up to like six minutes.

1756
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:32,860
Then I got to shut it off,

1757
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:33,881
you know,

1758
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:36,940
I can't listen to the whole thing and
so it's hard to listen to yourself,

1759
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:37,774
but it's good.

1760
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,640
It's good because like what you said,

1761
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,281
how you,

1762
00:48:40,281 --> 00:48:43,720
you force yourself just
take five years twisted.

1763
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,411
You got to do that,

1764
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:44,650
man.

1765
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,191
You got to do that.

1766
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,620
You can't just take it on
the audience's reaction.

1767
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:51,090
You got to judge it as if you're a
comic listening to another comic to,

1768
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,641
you know,

1769
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:51,911
when I,

1770
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:52,810
when I listened to my stuff,

1771
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,140
I'm wondering how would I feel about this?

1772
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,010
Is this funny to me?

1773
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,461
You know,

1774
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:57,561
I,

1775
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:01,480
I listened to it and I will forget
about how the audience is laughing.

1776
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,860
Why does this make me think?

1777
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:03,010
Well,

1778
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:03,730
does this make me.

1779
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,380
Do I think this is the
right way to do this bit?

1780
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,940
Should I shorten this part?

1781
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,350
Is this too verbose?

1782
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,660
Is this to this or this or that?

1783
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,810
And when you do that,

1784
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:11,230
man,

1785
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,970
everything gets tighter and stronger.

1786
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:13,930
You focus on it.

1787
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,250
It's uncomfortable though.

1788
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:16,210
It's a terrible feeling.

1789
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,223
You feel like you're.

1790
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,460
It's a weird thing,

1791
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:18,791
man,

1792
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,600
or the [inaudible] the same as the
energy that brings you to be creative.

1793
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,210
The energy that brings
you to smash it on stage.

1794
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,340
That is not a selfish energy.

1795
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:30,940
People think it is because it seems
like it is because you're on stage going

1796
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,451
what the fuck?

1797
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:32,080
Cock sucker.

1798
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,200
And everyone's laughing and crying,

1799
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,390
but to do it right,

1800
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,130
to be tuned into those people,

1801
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,950
really you have to be almost selfless.

1802
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,880
You have to be.

1803
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,560
You have to be tuned into this crazy
way where it's all just about this fund

1804
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:45,101
that we're having.

1805
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,090
It's not about me.

1806
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,140
It ain't about me.

1807
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,070
You know what I'm saying?

1808
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:52,240
So it's like the opposite that you
would get from like someone who like,

1809
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:53,170
listens to themselves.

1810
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:53,381
Like,

1811
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:53,781
yeah,

1812
00:49:53,781 --> 00:49:54,614
I'm the shit.

1813
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,473
Listen to me,

1814
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm the shit.

1815
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:56,841
It's almost like,

1816
00:49:56,841 --> 00:50:00,310
just know that that's the police in that
thinking like that is the poisoned that

1817
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:01,360
takes away the magic.

1818
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,100
Because if you start
thinking you're the shadow,

1819
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:03,731
you start thinking,

1820
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:06,610
you know that you're something special
and you'll lose your whole connection

1821
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:07,480
with the magic.

1822
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,230
You know?

1823
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,750
So that's one of the reasons
why you feel uncomfortable.

1824
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,690
You don't want to listen and you don't
want to be that guy who wants to get,

1825
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,321
get in my car.

1826
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:17,620
Let's get my new toy set last
night telling me what I did.

1827
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,010
You ever been to someone's car and
they make this mother fucking routine.

1828
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,850
Oh,

1829
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,720
tell me about this new bit.

1830
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:23,860
Is there anything you could add to this?

1831
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:24,490
Like,

1832
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,061
oh Geez.

1833
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:25,930
I wrote the joke.

1834
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:26,764
I want to try it.

1835
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,620
Say That on stage and give you a way out,

1836
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:32,260
but don't try.

1837
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:32,811
I've never tried.

1838
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:34,400
I don't try to fucking Bro.

1839
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:34,731
Yeah,

1840
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,080
you say it or you don't say it.

1841
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,300
Just the idea that you're trying it out.

1842
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,781
Look,

1843
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:39,860
it ain't a fucking weapon,

1844
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:40,280
right?

1845
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,170
God Damn job a stage.

1846
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,431
Do It on a stage.

1847
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:44,660
Take your goddamn chances.

1848
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,680
And the more you do that,

1849
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:47,570
the more you know what the fuck's
gonna work in the first place.

1850
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:49,160
You don't have to talk to
people about stuff like that.

1851
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:49,520
No,

1852
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,420
it's crazy because with me,

1853
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:54,170
I have a hard time writing
the zone with people.

1854
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:55,460
Like how do I get pissed off?

1855
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:57,230
To a degree before I go on stage,

1856
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,700
like I like a little pistol office.

1857
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,820
When you get mad you get like
fake arguments with people.

1858
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:04,080
I want to do that one time.

1859
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,820
Eddie Bravo.

1860
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,640
We were all in the back at the
House of Blues and he's like,

1861
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,830
you guys with your fucking bullshit.

1862
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,730
You're a fucking man.

1863
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,211
And he's like,

1864
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:12,200
why is she getting upset?

1865
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:12,590
I'm like,

1866
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,160
he's just got to put
himself in that place.

1867
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,613
He's not really.

1868
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:15,980
No,

1869
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm not mad at nobody,

1870
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,980
but he's getting these
fucking guys fucking.

1871
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:22,521
Oh,

1872
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:24,230
I need to use a vaporizer.

1873
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,293
Listen,

1874
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,490
I was smoking weed with
an apple when I was five.

1875
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,203
Crazy how?

1876
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,600
Whatever around you guys
sometimes just be mad.

1877
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:35,770
Makes me say somebody like,

1878
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:36,190
Joey,

1879
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,390
you got to fucking say that

1880
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,700
and I'll forget for a month.

1881
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,361
I'll forget.

1882
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:42,850
And you guys like Joe
was fucking stage yet.

1883
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:43,361
I'm like,

1884
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:46,540
you like when you guys got a
forced me like your records keeper.

1885
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:48,390
I'm always telling them shit.

1886
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,470
Did you do.

1887
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,790
Do you still doing that
thing about a dead Dick?

1888
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:52,840
You still doing that thing?

1889
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,290
Yeah,

1890
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,720
but the soldier don't say anymore,

1891
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:56,200
please.

1892
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,680
People must see that on stage.

1893
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,693
Uh,

1894
00:51:58,810 --> 00:51:59,501
when you did that,

1895
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:00,490
we have that video still.

1896
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:01,324
Do you have that video?

1897
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,400
You got to do something with that video.

1898
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:05,350
But just even if it's
for internal use only,

1899
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,580
I need to see that set.

1900
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,500
GimMe that set please Brian,

1901
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,590
send it to you already know
you did that joey from.

1902
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,520
From Bria.

1903
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,510
It was last night,

1904
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:13,810
right?

1905
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:14,643
It was Sunday night.

1906
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,810
Jesus fucking Christ.

1907
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,850
I've never seen anybody
killed hardening that.

1908
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,270
The only thing that was closer to someone
killing harder than that was when you

1909
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:24,760
killed in Vegas at the
Mandalay Bay theater.

1910
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,930
Holy Shit.

1911
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,890
When you were doing that bit about fucking
having that fistfight with the nun.

1912
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,420
Holy Shit.

1913
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,690
I might not have ever laughed that
hard at anything ever in my whole life.

1914
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,110
It was the funniest thing I've ever seen

1915
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,530
Mr. comedy store.

1916
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,980
And that's the bad thing because during
the week that's what you would enjoy

1917
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,410
laughing at each other like each other.

1918
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:48,411
And that really took away from my career
because you see bill burga Tuesday and

1919
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,170
water die.

1920
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:49,531
You know,

1921
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:50,070
he don't care.

1922
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,570
He's so confident was extended up.

1923
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,970
Are you willing to try
different things and you know,

1924
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:57,960
we always get into conversations and
style joke about the store that at the end

1925
00:52:57,961 --> 00:52:58,980
they will come to whatever,

1926
00:52:58,981 --> 00:52:59,860
but you know,

1927
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,280
I don't take away the truth from anything.

1928
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,910
That's what's really lacking.

1929
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:05,690
I wish we had south is
becoming thousands becoming.

1930
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,800
I know we just need some more
people to go on their support.

1931
00:53:07,801 --> 00:53:09,360
I've been out of town on Wednesdays.

1932
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,120
We've got a plenty of plenty of people.

1933
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,510
Bill burroughs was by last week.

1934
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,310
Sarah Silverman was by the week before
and it's Doug Benson is coming down all

1935
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:16,761
the time.

1936
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:18,500
Steve Reynolds easy came and crushed it.

1937
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,060
Katt Williams to meet that
dude that's still never met.

1938
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:23,740
That dude.

1939
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,020
He is.

1940
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,890
Is he in jail?

1941
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,820
I'm a big fan of that dude.

1942
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,050
That dude makes me laugh.

1943
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,390
He makes me laugh like very few dudes.

1944
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,300
He's one of my top favorite guys to
watch how it's like if someone sends me a

1945
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:33,840
clip,

1946
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,250
someone sends me a clip and says like,

1947
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:35,461
Hey,

1948
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:38,700
check out this cat Williams clip that
fucking thing where he was going after

1949
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:39,540
Steve Harvey.

1950
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,910
Oh Shit.

1951
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:41,660
That's funny.

1952
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,050
And one of the things that accentuate
something and as they accentuates it,

1953
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,820
he slides across the room,

1954
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,850
like he's kicking someone in
the nuts and as he does it,

1955
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:50,120
he goes,

1956
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,960
I'm a little Nigga,

1957
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,190
I fight dirty.

1958
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,830
And he slides slides of the stage.

1959
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,330
Lewis a little flip up in the attic.

1960
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,680
He's kicking somebody in the balls.

1961
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,590
I remember one man,

1962
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:03,880
he makes me laugh hard.

1963
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,740
We're talking about it.

1964
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,230
But you have no idea that numbers.

1965
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:07,770
He does.

1966
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,603
How he does crazy.

1967
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:09,481
He goes,

1968
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:11,280
you got to a place where we go to the UFC,

1969
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:11,801
the,

1970
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:12,634
he does that.

1971
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,130
He does the Pearl at the palms.

1972
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,660
That's like 5,000 seats.

1973
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,010
That's a big ass place.

1974
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:18,180
They have big bands there.

1975
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,220
Katt Williams cells that fucker out man.

1976
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,730
And there's pictures of him in the
casino with like fur coats on and shit.

1977
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,583
And diamonds.

1978
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,070
He's hilarious man.

1979
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,701
He,

1980
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:29,760
that dude really makes me laugh because
he's just going for it all the time.

1981
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,560
He's not trying to be
anything other than he is.

1982
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,880
He's just trying to be funny.

1983
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,740
He's just going for it all the time.

1984
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:38,280
Gone for the funny going for the
funny and he's fucking good dude.

1985
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,140
He does a funny thing about fucking
Shaquille o'neal trying to be a cop.

1986
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Doing fucking hilarious is how Shaquille
O'Neal's three year old was his height.

1987
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,310
Yeah.

1988
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,650
Oh really?

1989
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,573
That's special.

1990
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,980
And that thing that he did on
Michael Jackson that made him a star.

1991
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,800
When you watched that bit on Youtube,

1992
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,170
you watch that and you
see the black people.

1993
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:06,210
They don't even know how to
act because you see the truth.

1994
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:06,811
See,

1995
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:10,610
the truth is a motherfucker when you say
it the right way and that stays even if

1996
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,071
it's wrong.

1997
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:11,904
What he was saying.

1998
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,140
Where's Michael Jackson?

1999
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,990
He's probably smelled a little babies.

2000
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:16,560
Booty hole.

2001
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,890
Is this something that is
a classic fucking La and he
just runs from there with

2002
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:20,281
it guys?

2003
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:20,620
Yeah,

2004
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:20,860
he.

2005
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,910
He runs with it and said,

2006
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,090
when was the last time you seen
Michael Jackson with a woman?

2007
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,690
Not because all that crazy shit,

2008
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:27,841
bro.

2009
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:31,950
That shit was that made them ms dot that
little piece of him been themselves.

2010
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,120
Just that little piece,

2011
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:33,721
that complex.

2012
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:34,441
Pray for that.

2013
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:35,680
You opiod a couple of days.

2014
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,910
It's important to have
guys like that out there.

2015
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,680
I like guys that are just going for it.

2016
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:40,640
You know?

2017
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,890
I liked guys are out there
just fucking going for it.

2018
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:48,110
There's a lot of people that think that
comedy is comedy is about the respect of

2019
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:52,970
your peers and creating the proper clever
joke with the right wording and it's

2020
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:53,870
not man.

2021
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,790
It's about entertainment value.

2022
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,400
If it's about your standup
comedy and to these these days,

2023
00:55:58,401 --> 00:55:58,820
man,

2024
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,430
you comedy doesn't even nearly
have to be that deep anymore.

2025
00:56:01,431 --> 00:56:02,810
If you want to get deep man,

2026
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,060
why you tell you know you,

2027
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,580
you can.

2028
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,230
You could do a podcast and get deep.

2029
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:07,760
You could write a blog and get deep.

2030
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:08,623
You know you could.

2031
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,910
You could have a conversation
with an intelligent person.

2032
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:11,111
Get to.

2033
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:12,470
You don't have to get
that deep of your comedy.

2034
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,790
It's shit that makes me laugh.

2035
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:17,040
Is Kat Williams the floor
kicking some dude in the book.

2036
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,060
I'm a little Nigga.

2037
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:19,140
I fight dirty

2038
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,980
and what he does and it's so natural.

2039
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,980
It's so funny,

2040
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:24,740
man.

2041
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,330
Oh,

2042
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,200
that God kills me,

2043
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:26,471
man.

2044
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:27,550
He's got some great shit.

2045
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:28,150
I,

2046
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:28,700
I,

2047
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,340
you know what he had,

2048
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,450
he actually had some real
good advice too that I took.

2049
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,870
He said that uh,

2050
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,310
he listens to a,

2051
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,790
he has on his ipod,

2052
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,310
he has like a playlist of all music that
he listens to right before he goes on

2053
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:41,144
stage.

2054
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,071
And I'm like damn,

2055
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:45,370
that's a great idea because I have just
like a group of like some of my favorite

2056
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:47,680
songs on my ipod that I just,

2057
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,581
I throw on,

2058
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,570
it's on my iphone too.

2059
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,090
I'll throw them on like when
I'm at the gym or whatever,

2060
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,601
whatever.

2061
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:55,270
But I don't have a specific list just for,

2062
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,133
for standup,

2063
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,460
but that's a good fucking idea.

2064
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,510
It's a real good idea.

2065
00:56:58,511 --> 00:56:59,440
So I started doing that.

2066
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,000
I started doing that just based on that,

2067
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,170
because I know music,

2068
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,390
if you listen to like
the right kind of music,

2069
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,590
you know the right kind of music and
fucking get you in a good groove man,

2070
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,430
you know,

2071
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,263
especially if you haven't.

2072
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,730
Sometimes when you
listen to music too much,

2073
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:13,900
if you lose it's power,

2074
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,480
you don't have that feeling
anymore and just loses its impact.

2075
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,840
But every now and then a song which
is Jack you and let you know what's

2076
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:20,674
possible.

2077
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,100
Member,

2078
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,690
when we were at the Brian Improv and we
were in the parking lot and I had that

2079
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,690
Nissan truck and you got out and that,

2080
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,890
that crazy sound system in
and you got out of your car,

2081
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:30,670
you're like Joe Rogan.

2082
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,260
Joe Rogan put this fucking CD and
right now Donna summer hot stuff.

2083
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,670
You put on hot stuff

2084
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:41,620
sitting here in my greatest success.

2085
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,290
Some music drives you fucking nuts.

2086
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,281
I love music.

2087
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:47,150
I love music.

2088
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,100
I love loving skin that listen to loads.

2089
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,710
It mainly the old shit.

2090
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,220
Oh,

2091
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,031
I love landscaping.

2092
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:55,700
I love almond brothers from the seventies.

2093
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:56,534
Lennon skinner.

2094
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:57,920
I love that vibe,

2095
00:57:57,921 --> 00:57:58,281
man.

2096
00:57:58,281 --> 00:57:59,840
There's something about that time,

2097
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:02,240
like if I'm in a pool hall and sweet home,

2098
00:58:02,241 --> 00:58:03,350
Alabama comes on.

2099
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,393
It's like,

2100
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,220
like your girlfriend just
comes over and rubs your neck.

2101
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,143
You know what I'm saying?

2102
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,760
It's like someone comes over
and gives you a hug like that.

2103
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:11,700
So I don't know.

2104
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,013
You hear that?

2105
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,270
Oh sweet.

2106
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:15,900
So what a great song.

2107
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,510
Guns,

2108
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,360
blue singing it.

2109
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,091
They're singing it,

2110
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:20,390
man.

2111
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,480
We'd hold.

2112
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,900
Why do you think you
were good at your finger?

2113
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:24,381
On the trigger?

2114
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:25,214
What are you doing?

2115
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,360
What are you doing?

2116
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,040
Just waiting for a to get out of here.

2117
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,450
How long have you been doing this?

2118
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:32,671

Just we're going to be late for a show,

2122
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,770
whatever.

2123
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,060
So we're a couple minutes late.

2124
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:40,250
This is a whole internet out
that I'm running the show,

2125
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,090
which is even better because they
can't go there without you being there.

2126
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,310
I can't start it too.

2127
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:46,791

00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:48,920
This is it.

2131
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,420
This is how we're going
to end this fucking thing.

2132
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:50,880

2135
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,001
That's it too.

2136
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:52,310
Wow.

2137
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:53,720
This is the end.

2138
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,240
My only friend.
