00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,620
That's the new noise. Pink
Pang pain. Hello everybody.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,860
This episode of the podcast is
brought to you by Squarespace.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,580
Squarespace is the all in one platform
that allows you to create your own

4
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,320
professional looking website.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,920
I say professional looking like because
if it's like a, like a fake Rolex,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,720
but now it'd be like a
professional website.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,590
Squarespace is an amazing invention and
what they did is they figured out how to

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,760
code a website that allows you to make
your own websites in a very simple,

9
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:37,650
easy drag and drop fashion.
It is so intuitive,

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,450
so easy to use and it works
on absolutely every platform,

11
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:45,150
which is beautiful.
It would work on an android phone.

12
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,630
It'll work on a windows
computer to work on a Mac. Very,

13
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,630
very easy to use and you
can start your own website.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,200
It's simple as attaching pictures to an
email or to a Microsoft word document.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,230
It's really that easy. Uh, they
also have a beautiful logo creator.

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,070
You can create a clean and simple
logo designed for yourself in minutes.

17
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,800
If you're thinking about starting up a
business and you want a website to do it,

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,250
Squarespace is your answer.
You're all in one platform.

19
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:14,310
You can start your own online
business through Squarespace.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,060
They have an online store.
You could set up so easy and quickly.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,340
You can sell digital downloads if you
are a musician or a comedian or you just

22
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:27,660
want to see if people will pay to hear
you talk, I guess you never know. Fuck it,

23
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,420
man. Just fucking Squarespace
for everything. And there's,

24
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,860
I mean the second model
of the kickstarters,

25
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,950
people that like some dude
made a Kickstarter to make
potato salad and made like

26
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:38,420
50 grand.
So if you want to sell yourself talk,

27
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,080
and I bet you could probably do it.
Um,

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,820
every design automatically includes a
unique mobile experience as well that it

29
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,670
matches the overall style of
your websites or your content.

We're also brought to you by blue apron.

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,070
Blue Apron is a, a new podcast
sponsor that I really enjoy and I,

45
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,840
I've been using it lately.
I had, um, what it is,

46
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,360
is they send you all the ingredients and,
um,

47
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,030
detailed a photographic instructions
of how to cook them for healthy meals.

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,630
And, uh, I just had amine, these peppers,
he stuffed peppers the other day,

49
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,690
like be stuffed peppers.
It was really good. Um,

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,780
it's really delicious stuff
and it's super healthy. 500,

51
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:11,800
700 calories per serving and you would
really imagine that it'd be more than

52
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,350
that, uh, because it tastes really
good. It tastes like, like, Ooh,

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,730
it's probably can't be good for you. But
they're designed, uh, by, uh, by chefs,

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,100
nutritionists and it's a really,
really yummy stuff. Nine 99 per meal,

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,180
they'll send you the ingredients in
the exact right proportions with simple

56
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,380
recipe instructions right to your
door. You know, for a lot of folks,

57
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,640
ordering out is expensive and
it can get pretty unhealthy. Um,

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,300
shipping and cooking can be tough too.
Or shopping rather shopping and cooking.

59
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,440
It's like if you get a recipe book and
you want to go out and buy all the stuff

60
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,410
and it, you got to look around
and you gotta like measure shit.

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,790
Blue Apron takes care of
all that stuff and uh,

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,560
they work around your schedule
and your dietary preferences.

63
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,410
Cooking takes about a half an hour.
Shipping is always free.

64
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,240
And they'll never send you the same
meal twice. Really yummy stuff. Um,

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,590
I'll give you a list of some of the stuff
that they have now. Um, this is, uh,

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,690
here's, here's one of them. Um,
egg plants with chicken thighs,

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,150
cod with Parmesan crusted squash,

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,500
spice rubbed pork medallions with peach
salsa. This is not like boring food.

69
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,480
It's really delicious.
Chicken breasts,

70
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:24,481
Gumbo with chicken sausage and Okra pan
seared scallops with sauteed Sungolds.

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,510
Everything you get comes in like
one of those styrofoam containers.

72
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,750
It's packed with dry ice,
so it stays cold for like two days.

73
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,460
Mexican style Turkey Burger. It's not
like they're not bland foods either.

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,330
They're, they're really delicious

the supplements, uh, any of the
products that we sell at on it,

90
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,710
we have a research page on every,

91
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,730
if you go to each individual page for
each individual ingredient has a research

92
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,070
page. If you go to it, the research page,

93
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,200
explain to you like for instance
if you got a shroom tech,

94

shroom tech is a quarter seps mushroom
supplement that's designed to increase

95
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,060
endurance and oxygen utilization.
And you're like,

96
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,820
why the fuck is that about?
Well,

97
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,280
if you go to the shroom tech page,

98
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,550
you will see all of the research along
with references that explains the

99
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:21,950
mechanisms behind each individual
ingredient, why it works,

100
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,390
how they work synergistically, and what
the studies have been done. And you know,

101
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:30,650
what, what has been proven about
these individual ingredients? Well,

102
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:34,430
we're trying to do it on it is
we live in a fantastic time.

103
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,880
And one of the beautiful things about
this time is there's so much information

104
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,840
out there and there were many, many
things that can benefit you physically.

105
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,700
Many things that can benefit you mentally
as far as your cognitive function. Um,

106
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,480
you know,
and there's,

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,870
there's a lot of bullshit out there too
and it's hard to figure out what's the

108
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,930
bullshit and, and what's the
real shit well at, on it,

109
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,490
we have isolated what we find to be
all of the most beneficial supplements.

110
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,120
And we sell them to you.

111
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,310
We sell them to you at a very
reasonable rate with great ethics.

112
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,980
If you buy any of the supplements
at on it and you feel like, oh,

113
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,030
it's kind of bullshit. I'm
not really into this. This is,

114
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,960
this is a waste of my money.
We have a 100% money back
guaranteed. First 30 pills,

115
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,390
the order you have 90 days,
you don't have to return the pills.

116
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,100
You just say the stuffed socks,
you get your money back.

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,670
All we're trying to do is make
a good relationship with you.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,180
We're trying to create a relationship
where we sell you the best shit you could

119
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,540
possibly get and you feel good about it.
If you don't feel good about it,

120
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,690
that kind of relationship sucks for
everybody. It's negative, it's bad,

121
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,540
it's bad energy. It's not good
for anybody. We're not interested.

122
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,380
We're only interested on selling things
to people that are going to benefit you

123
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,720
and that you're going to feel good
about the relationship that you have.

124
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,820
We sell strength and
conditioning equipment,

125
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,520
everything that you need
for functional strength,

126
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:51,320
meaning strength that you
can use an athletic endeavors
like kettle bells, steel,

127
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:54,050
maces, battle ropes. Uh,

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,440
we sell medicine balls and ab wheels.

129
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,410
We also have workout DVDs like
the excellent Keith Webber,

130
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,860
extreme kettlebell cardio series, Keith
Weber who will be on the show, uh,

131
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,310
in the next couple of months.
We're working out the details right now,

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,000
but I'm a big fan of that guy and it's,
his workouts are insane.

133
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,200
There's so fun to do.

134
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,390
If you're thinking about starting into
any sort of an exercise program, look,

135
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,410
if he's thinking about starting a health
program, just get right on it, you know,

136
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,260
as far as eating healthy
and then mild exercise.

137
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,250
But if you're thinking about doing
anything as far as strenuous physical

138
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:29,930
activity, I please start off slowly.
It's the most important thing.

139
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
The last thing you want to do is try
to exercise and then get injured and be

140
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:37,130
fucked for six months. He don't want
that to happen. So start off slowly.

141
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,500
Pick a lightweight if you can afford it.

142
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,140
Hire a trainer to show you the,
the, the basic movements in,

143
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:48,530
in the correct form so that you're not
injuring yourself and start off slow. Um,

144
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,320
if you can't hire a trainer,
there's plenty of DVDs,

145
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,160
plenty of youtube videos online.
You can go and just simple,

146
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:01,050
basic exercises are broken down. Do
it slowly. Please. Take your time,

147
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,820
build up,
write down your results,

148
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:06,720
write down your goals and get your shit
together. Son and Gals, gals, daughter.

149
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,280
So I did 10 called girls,
daughter,

150
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,660
a daughter that's just fucking creepy
called dude son. It's okay. Anyway,

151
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,560
go to Onnit. I've talked too
much on and.com O. N. N. I
t. Use the codeword Rogan.

152
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:21,090
Save 10% off any and all supplements.
Relaxed. Ladies and gentlemen, sit down,

153
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,970
grab a cup of coffee.
We're going to discuss society.

154
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,880
We're going to figure out what
the fuck makes this thing tick.

155
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:28,470
And is there a better way to go about it?

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,630
Joe Quirk is here from the seasteading
institute. Young Jamie. Cue The music,

157
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,130
the Joe Rogan experience.

158
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,510
Try my day. Joe Rogan
podcast by night. All Day.

159
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,300
Hello everybody.
Um,

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,630
for those of you who are
not familiar with my guests,

161
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,980
Joe Quirk is from the seasteading
institute and the seasteading institute.

162
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,810
Seasteading is a very unique concept
and it's been going around, uh,

163
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:02,930
over the last x amount of years online.

164
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:06,710
There've been all these articles and
videos where people have talked about

165
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,790
international waters going
out and creating a city,

166
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:15,590
a floating city and trying to
reengineer society. This is, you know,

167
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:18,520
all of the land and the earth has
been sort of claimed and taken.

168
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,460
You can't really start your own cult
in the middle of nowhere without the

169
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,050
government coming in and
crashing your parade.

170
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,470
But can you build a city and design a
utopia based on the mistakes that we see

171
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,070
in society today? Is that a fairly
accurate way of describing seasteading

172
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,060
one of the misperceptions is that
seasteading is not about creating one.

173
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:42,140
See stead. It's about closest you can get
to this thing. We always have them in.

174
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,810
Yeah. Did you move it around too?
Okay, good. Sorry. We, we can, uh,

175
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,230
we want to create as many steps as
possible to provide people with the

176
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,750
technology to found their
own floating country.

177
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,200
And the key idea is 193
national governments don't
represent the range of ideas

178
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,210
that 7 billion people have produced.

179
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,140
And we're sort of have these government
monopolies that, uh, uh, you know,

180
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,480
control the decisions people make.

181
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,110
And in order to have solutions
for how to live together,

182
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,100
we have to force them through these 193
government monopolies and technology and

183
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,750
every other front is moving forward.

184
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,610
And the thing that's
holding us back isn't it?

185
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,640
We're not innovating in the
technology of governance.

186
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,220
So the key idea is if we can create a
silicon valley of the, see if we can get,

187
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,731
you know,

188
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:31,470
thousands of Hong Kong's and Singapore's
in aisles of man's on the ocean and

189
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,160
allow innovators to go out there and form
their own societies will discover new

190
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,900
ways of living together and we'll push
forward a evolution in governance.

191
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,021
And what's the stop?

192
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:45,670
Some fucking psycho like Jamie over here
starting the Jamie country. And, uh,

193
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,980
just having like a one mile square thing
that he's built some raft and it's, uh,

194
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,790
you know, some, he's got some Mad
Max style world. No, nothing, right?

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,420
Yeah. Well this is the key idea. I mean,

196
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,560
Jamie can go out there and declare
himself, you know, tyrant of Jamie's dead.

197
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,060
But the problem is he has
to attract people to come
to his see stud and you just

198
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,690
hit on the key idea that makes floating
a nation's different from land based

199
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:09,770
nations.
I mean,

200
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,460
if you're a some evil dude and you
take control of a land based nation,

201
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,370
you got it. You got monopoly
control over those people.

202
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:19,640
Those people don't have any choice. That's
the problem with modern governments.

203
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:20,720
We can't choose among them.

204
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:24,800
Like we can't among other products that
advanced quickly if we're on the sea,

205
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,780
you got to compete to attract immigrants.

206
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:28,490
You've got to compete
to attract investment.

207
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,770
You've got to compete to
attract people to uh, uh,

208
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,850
give you money so that you can build
a business in a way that they think is

209
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:38,660
profitable. Uh, you got to attract
different kinds of ideologues out there.

210
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,060
It's going to start as a business.
I mean,

211
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:46,061
if you think of countries as being founded
by conquerors and the future ceased

212
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:50,810
eds being founded by creators,
what I like to call aquaponic sewers,

213
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,150
that sets up a completely
different dynamic.

214
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,650
And if people can choose amongst the studs
that will drive what we think will be

215
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,980
a market of competing governments
competing to police people.

216
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,060
And then this will unleash the
innovation that's out there. Uh,

217
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,790
somebody, you know, for
the past half century,

218
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,450
people have come up with wonderful
ideas for how we could live together.

219
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:15,860
People have, you can go online and look
up all sorts of interesting rule sets. Uh,

220
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,070
the problem is all ground is claimed and
there's no place we can try this out.

221
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,510
So the, the technology for permanent
floating structures is coming.

222
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,130
Half the earth's surfaces is
unclaimed by existing governments. Uh,

223
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,450
we have a new frontier and I think
it's time we started colonizing it and

224
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:33,620
building floating cities.

225
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,300
It's a very interesting concept.
Um, but I'm going to be honest,

226
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,700
my own personal feeling about it,
it's not,

227
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,750
not my opinion of how it should go about,
but my own feeling when I hear this,

228
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,250
the idea that I go, yeah,
that would be interesting,

229
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,650
but man,
it brings up all these other problems.

230
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:55,940
Like some crazy fuckers are going to have
their own weird countries floating out

231
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:59,840
there and who's going to, what kind of
lawless lands are you going to create?

232
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,870
What kind of weirdness?
But when I think about,

233
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:06,140
when I analyze my own thoughts about it,
my own instinctive reaction to it,

234
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:08,000
like it's just the,

235
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,840
I know there's something wrong with
the way society is structured today,

236
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,960
but change brings a whole new set of
problems and people are afraid of change.

237
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,003
Yeah.
Like

238
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,530
to understand,
uh,

239
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,810
seasteading you kind of have to go
deep about where solutions come from.

240
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,230
And so what's the right way to live
together? The answer is we don't know. Uh,

241
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,550
what's the right way to make this
microphone? We don't know. Uh,

242
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,130
these kind of magnificent solutions.

243
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,230
They're not designed by
some really smart person.

244
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,340
They emerge from millions of people
competing in a market to please us.

245
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,490
And so we're on this
exponential, uh, a rocket, uh,

246
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,590
in all areas except governance.
And the problem is,

247
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:53,120
is that that governments are monopolies
and most of the problems were afraid of,

248
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,290
uh, existing among current
monopolies of governance.

249
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,690
And the key idea is that on the water,

250
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,890
a fluid environment is fundamentally
different from the land based environment.

251
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,850
If you have a chunk of land,
it's,

252
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,850
it's very easy for a conquered take it
and declare monopoly control and then the

253
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,260
government doesn't advance.
It just,

254
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,320
it has no incentive to advance
if you're on the water.

255
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,460
And countries can only form if people
choose to attach to each other,

256
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,340
there is no land unless you
attract people to come visit you.

257
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,180
If those people aren't
happy with your assisted,

258
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,020
they can detach and move somewhere else.

259
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,000
We'll have a completely
different situation where
instead of citizen's competing

260
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,920
to survive their government's decisions,

261
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,130
governments will be competing
to survive citizens decisions.

262
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,530
So if you're a governor and you're
competing to attract citizens and you go

263
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:46,040
bankrupt and you're cced,
ed disappears is people detach.

264
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,810
And move fluidly somewhere else,

265
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,680
it'll be much harder for it to
kind of control consolidation.

266
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,960
And then you're not even
thinking about citizens.

267
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:57,380
You're thinking about customers looking
for the kind of governance they want.

268
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,360
And when you think about it, this
is variation and selection, uh,

269
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,870
variation by governments,
selection by citizens. Uh,

270
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,880
and I started as a science writer and a
novelist. I wrote a lot about evolution.

271
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,750
I thought about why as their
progress in the world, why is there,

272
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,020
why aren't things just chaotic? Uh, how,

273
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,160
how has our brain so sublime in biology
that it can understand these symbols?

274
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:26,060
And I'm sending to you, why is
this coffee Mug, uh, so available,

275
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:29,570
so cheap and so plentiful?
It's because of variation and selection,

276
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,420
decentralized variation, selection. Uh,

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,700
and when I was exposed to pottery,

278
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,730
Freedman's ideas about evolution,

279
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,930
like in the primal soup of the ocean,
I realized he was right.

280
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,970
We're on a fluid frontier where people
can detach and move about and choose the

281
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,830
societies they want.
You would have variation and selection.

282
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:55,640
And we unleashed the kind of progress
we see in markets and technologies in

283
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,160
governance. And we think of
governance as a technology.

284
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,740
I think it's really interesting,

285
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:04,741
this comparison that you made in a recent
video that I watched about cell phones

286
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,710
and the competition that
drives cell phones to innovate,

287
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,930
and the reason why we have
such amazing phones today,

288
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:14,590
while we have all these apps, while
we have all these incredible cameras,

289
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,730
great battery life,

290
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:20,731
and it's because there's this incredible
competition in multiple platforms all

291
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,290
across the world. Everyone's
trying to come up with the biggest,

292
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,710
best thing every year,
but in government you have none of this.

293
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,270
You don't have any competition.

294
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,860
It's not a bunch of people competing to
see who could, whose ideas are the best.

295
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,680
It's a very rigid,
strict structure that's in place.

296
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:40,450
It's been in place for a long time. It's
archaic. It's, it's very, very flawed.

297
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:43,000
The representative government that
we have in this country today,

298
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,510
when you look at the
influence that they have, the,

299
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:49,920
and you look at the influences on
them as far corporate interest,

300
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,160
special interest groups, lobbyists,
it's all madness. I mean,

301
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,510
no one in their right mind.
If you had a chance to reengineer society,

302
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,410
no one would look at it and go, perfect.
There's no reason to fuck with this.

303
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,080
This is, this thing is great.
Right? You know, it's a terrible,

304
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:08,100
terrible system and it's the only
system we have and it, it is the system.

305
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,660
And if you try to change that system,

306
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,040
you're a trader or a psycho or whatever
the fuck you are, an anarchist,

307
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,500
you're a cult member.
WhatW or cult leader, um,

308
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,880
this idea is that this same sort of
competition that has led everything to

309
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:27,840
innovate to the incredible degree that
it is at today, whether it's computers,

310
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:32,260
whether it's cars, all the things that
we seen in joy today in our society that,

311
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,510
that, that are at this incredibly high
level. It's because of competition.

312
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,260
And that is the exact thing that
is wrong with our government.

313
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:45,261
This stagnation is two
party system influenced by
corporations that has the same

314
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:50,640
mandate, the same ideas, the same tired
rhetoric over and over and over again.

315
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,850
And seasteading you believe offers a
potential opportunity to break that mold.

316
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,260
Yes. And it's about breaking
the mold. And I think, uh,

317
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,610
the future of humanity turns on the pivot
of this problem because everything is

318
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,820
advancing very quickly.
Uh, but governance is not,

319
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:12,080
and it because it is these monopolies
like you and I don't have to argue about,

320
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,080
you know, which app we're
going to have on our iPhone.

321
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,070
And then we all vote on the APP and then
that we all get one app and we have to

322
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,490
agree on it. And then we have to wait
four years to vote on the next APP.

323
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:26,980
We're all going to get, no,
we, we apps pull refrigerate,
we all get to choose them.

324
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,180
And, and this drives innovation
in that field. Um, and you know,

325
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,550
governments, you can imagine the
government we're in right now,

326
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:38,960
there's like 300 million people that
have to fight with each other over these

327
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,730
small little changes.

328
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,180
And then everyone ends up with a
bitter compromise and nobody is happy.

329
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,550
And I've been astonished at how people
pushing forward this blue frontier have

330
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:54,530
been independently attracted
to the metaphor of apps.
So there's this Dutch guy,

331
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,840
uh, a coon Othias, I'm
pronouncing his name wrong. I
don't know how to speak Dutch,

332
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,160
but, uh, he runs water
studio. Um, and he is,

333
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,040
has already created
what he calls city apps.

334
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,460
So we take shipping containers and
he convinced them into schools.

335
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,150
He converts them into a
water purification units.

336
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:19,151
He converts them into the
hospitals and he proposes,

337
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:24,311
he wants to float these things too crappy
coastal governments and park them in

338
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:28,610
the slums and provide schools and those
kinds of things for children. And the,

339
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,440
the advantage these things
have is that they're moveable.

340
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,220
Suppose the government says, we don't
want that. Well then you can move them,

341
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,350
move it somewhere else. Uh, it,

342
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,020
it's much easier than having to
build a school in those areas.

343
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,680
And he calls this program city apps and
I bet you he's going to be doing this in

344
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:43,700
the next couple of years.

345
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,830
How far out do you have to be from shore?
Does it vary from to country?

346
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,570
It depends on what we're talking about.
It's,

347
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,370
it varies slightly from country to
country in some cases. Uh, it's 12 miles.

348
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,650
So, for instance, uh,

349
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,240
some cs sitters or are physicians
and biotech entrepreneurs and they're

350
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:05,980
interested in innovating in this
space of stem cells or in, in biotech,

351
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:10,660
and feel like the regulations written
in 1970 or holding back innovations

352
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:14,620
written in 2020 another problem with
monopolies. They can't update their rules.

353
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,480
So we're just stuck with these old rules.

354
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,310
Some of these guys just want to get a
cease dead 12 miles off shore and start

355
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:24,070
pushing forward. Uh,
stem cells and biotech,

356
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,710
which is personalized medicine
is the future of medicine.

357
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:31,400
It can change everything. Other people
want to get floating hospitals, um,

358
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,230
offshore, cheaper, better, faster
care, millions of people travel, uh,

359
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,780
uh, you know, to India to get
cheaper, better, faster care from, uh,

360
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,940
you know,
American trained physicians.

361
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,500
Why take a plane all the way across the
world and you can take a ferry just off

362
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:50,560
shore. But to really be
truly an independent country,

363
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,520
you have to go, uh, about
200 miles off shore, 200

364
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,480
miles. Yeah. Um,

365
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,720
that's a really interesting point
you just brought up about medicine,

366
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,510
about a cheaper,
easier,

367
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:06,440
faster care or better care.
That's a,

368
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:10,760
that's a very complex and tricky issue
because a lot of people are worried about

369
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,600
quacks,

370
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,580
a lot of people worried about people that
are not following all the regulations

371
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:21,581
that had been set by the American Medical
Association and that you would attract

372
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,890
bad people,
bad ideas.

373
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,380
Then.

374
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,130
So thinking about the fluid frontier
requires us to rethink these assumptions

375
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,860
that we bring to this.
So imagine the fluid frontier.

376
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:35,690
That's what you're calling the ocean.
I got,

377
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,080
I got a million of these little phrases.
I like the blue frontier.

378
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,940
So imagine I'm a quack quirk.

379
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:45,650
The quack and I go out there and I
start offering some crazy procedure that

380
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:49,780
causes cancer and kills be enhancement,
but enhancement caulking. Let's do,

381
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,400
um, uh, if, if I start killing people,

382
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,840
I,
I'm in a market,

383
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,870
I don't have a monopoly that the first
see stet that like kill somebody or

384
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,420
causes a disaster. That will
be the end of that. Cease dead.

385
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:08,810
No one will move there. No. And we'll
go there. No one will invest in it. Uh,

386
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,070
just to take an example,

387
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:14,060
one of the guys I'm going to feature in
my seasteading book is a doctor Chris

388
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,070
Centeno, and he's innovated in
the realm of stem cells. Uh,

389
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,770
there's people that lost, uh, I'll,
I'll take an example. Jarvis Green.

390
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:25,760
He's a two time super bowl champ.
He lost cartilage under his kneecap.

391
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,580
Chris Santana was one of the,

392
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,080
he has like a thousand
successful operations where
he basically take stem cells

393
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:35,210
out of your hip,
reinject them into your joint,

394
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:39,050
you grow a new cartilage like a baby.
Uh,

395
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,820
Jarvis Green had been forced to retire.
Uh, he took Santana those treatments.

396
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:47,210
He grew it back as cartilage and he
jumped out of bed and signed with the

397
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:51,730
Houston Texans. He's had fabulous
success with his procedure. Uh,

398
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:55,110
after a thousand more than a
thousand successful procedures, uh,

399
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:58,670
the FDA knock on his door and said,
uh, you can't offer this procedure.

400
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,930
Um, it's now illegal in the United
States, this particular thing.

401
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,560
So he was forced to license his
procedure to the Cayman Islands,

402
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,410
uh, to, uh, to, uh, a
company called schematics.

403
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,520
So now people are flying to the Cayman
Islands to get this procedure done. Um,

404
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,020
so you know,
economists call this regulatory capture.

405
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:25,010
We have this instinct that if you just
make a monopoly of regulators and put

406
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,450
them in place,
that will protect us.

407
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,340
But what ends up happening is the dominant
industries within that area end up

408
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,050
controlling the regulations are having
undue influence in the regulations well is

409
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,370
process that this guy has to go through
in order to clear this particular

410
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:40,870
procedure that he hasn't done yet.

411
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,340
Well at, at first he thought he, that he
did and he thought that it was all legit,

412
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,690
but the FDA is unclear about
what its jurisdiction is. They,

413
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,880
they came in and literally declared
that your own stem cells once taken from

414
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:58,690
your body and process are now drugs.
So they're like, okay, well the,

415
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,510
your stem cells are now drugs.
So now we have jurisdiction.

416
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:06,000
We're telling you to stop. And
you know, that's absurd. I,

417
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,840
I'm actually quoting from the letter
they sent Centeno your stem cells are now

418
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,733
our drugs.

419
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,830
Wow.
Well,

420
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:16,380
there's this a process that I've gone
through call Regena keen or you're aware

421
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,200
of this? Um, you've heard of it? I
don't think so. There's a, a doctor, um,

422
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,260
I think his name's Peter Weller from uh,
Germany.

423
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,760
He created this procedure where you
take blood out of a person's body,

424
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,120
he spin it in a centrifuge and apply
heat to it and they heated blood produces

425
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,950
this incredibly potent anti
inflammatory agent and it's the,

426
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,250
it's extracted from the blood.

427
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:44,270
It's like a yellow serum and injected
directly into areas of inflammation,

428
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:48,510
joint swelling, things along those lines.
Then that's very similar. Yeah, probably.

429
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,890
And Imagine I can donate
my blood to somebody else,

430
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,130
but now I can't donate my
own stem cells to myself.

431
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,880
Well,
this is does,

432
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,210
what I'm confused is this procedure is
legal in the United States. It's illegal.

433
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:01,760
It's called off label.
If it wasn't for a while,

434
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,730
they had it in Germany
and the like Coby Bryant,

435
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,610
a lot of these athletes
were flying to July.

436
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,800
The UFC guys flew to Germany
to get this procedure done,

437
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,430
but now it's available in several
different places in America.

438
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:17,620
I got mine done at this place called
lifespan medicine in Santa Monica. And uh,

439
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,460
it's incredible. I mean, it has an
amazing effect on knees. Amazing effect.

440
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,010
I've had it done on my neck, on
my back. I mean, it's just any,

441
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,110
any areas that were like problem areas,

442
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,170
you can reduce inflammation
in this incredible way,

443
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,190
but it's essentially the same thing. It's
taking your own blood out, making it,

444
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,650
turning into the serum and then
injecting it back into your body.

445
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,700
What's different about what this guy's
doing that it's illegal? Do you know?

446
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,490
Uh, I don't know. I mean,
think of it, what were talking
about as a new innovation?

447
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,440
Uh, people are coming up with new
innovations and the climate among people

448
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,960
innovating in health care and in,

449
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,890
especially with stem cells and
with biotech is one of fear.

450
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,250
Like they don't know what the government
is going to tell them to do because the

451
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:03,150
rules are unclear. They're very complex
and they keep changing the rules.

452
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,140
And this stifles the innovation we
need. So if you look at, you know,

453
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,990
the psychodramas of our age, it's,
you know, healthcare, it's banking.

454
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,070
It's, you know, the public
environment. It's education, it's war,

455
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,560
it's all the things that
governments micromanage.

456
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,670
And so why aren't these things improving
with all the other things we use that

457
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:25,050
aren't micromanaged by government?

458
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,190
It's because we don't have an innovation
because the government monopolies

459
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,400
ultimately don't permit them.
If you have a monopoly,

460
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,790
you don't want people to compete with you.
Um,

461
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,540
and we want to provide more
market competition on the
ocean in a place where you

462
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,570
don't have to, you know, aggress
against anyone on the ocean.

463
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,890
Well, there's negatives
against this micromanagement,

464
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,030
but isn't there some benefits like,
like for instance,

465
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,020
the government has been cracking down
on Doctor Oz lately for all these bogus

466
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:53,460
fat loss claims.

467
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:57,060
Like this has been all these different
things that he's shield on his show that

468
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:01,860
her mirror, he calls them literally in his
own words, miracle, fat loss cures. Sure.

469
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,330
And then it turns out they don't reduce
fat at all. They literally do nothing.

470
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,720
And then he's in trouble for that.
That's important, right? I mean,

471
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,600
isn't that what they're worried about
with this stuff that someone can tell you,

472
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:13,320
hey man,

473
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,100
we're going to take some part of your hip
out and we're going to fix your spinal

474
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:18,870
Bifida.
We're going to fix your scoliosis,

475
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:21,120
we going to fix whatever the hell you got.
We're going to inject in India.

476
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,880
And it turns out it's not doing
Jack Shit. Yeah. You know,

477
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,030
there might be some sort of a placebo
effect that some people report.

478
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,770
So you have some conflicting evidence,

479
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,090
but is it an important that there's some
sort of a government regulatory or at

480
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:38,091
least a board of physicians
who are knowledgeable in
whatever field that approve

481
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,910
or disprove any sort of procedure?
Isn't that important?

482
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,200
I think these kinds of
things are important and,

483
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:48,100
but it's even more important to hit
restart once in a while. Okay. So if,

484
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,380
if people want to stop,
uh,

485
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,710
you know what you're doing that you
like about the reinjection of the blood.

486
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,850
I've never heard of this. They can
call forth a rule, uh, you know,

487
00:28:57,851 --> 00:29:02,851
written in 1975 that the people that
wrote those rules were not able to predict

488
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,950
this innovation that happened in
2014 or whenever it happened. Right.

489
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,570
And the idea is with a new
blue fluid rules on the ocean,

490
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:13,390
we have to start again with
a new regulatory structure.

491
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,340
And this happens naturally when there's
competition against, against monopolies.

492
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,021
So in a sense,

493
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:21,930
you're trying to do what the founding
fathers of the United States did.

494
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,340
They tried to see what's going
wrong in Europe and what,

495
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,050
what they don't like about the, the
system that they were a controlled under.

496
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,530
They leave, they come to America,
establish this new country,

497
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,680
set forth these new rules
and regulations is new ideas.

498
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,440
And then a couple of hundred years
later they turned a dog. Shit. Yeah.

499
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,280
Whenever it's a monopoly and it
ends up turning into deduction,

500
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,190
how do you stop that
from happening on Jamie?

501
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:51,040
See stead because Jamie looks
like a goddamn dictated to me.

502
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,330
I think you get that guy out there on
the sea. He's got his own little island.

503
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,660
Next thing you know, he's banging all
the women. It's like Waco in the ocean.

504
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,640
Yeah,

505
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,250
and I'm glad you're putting this in the
perspective of the United States because

506
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:05,740
I think of the United States, it was
a giant life raft where, you know,

507
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,480
tens of millions of people who are misfits
in their home countries came here to

508
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:13,860
try out their crazy ideas and they
discover new ways of living together that

509
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:15,150
ended up changing the whole world.

510
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,150
And if they're never been this giant life
raft where people could try something

511
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:21,600
new right now, we'd be arguing,
you know, which works better,

512
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:24,960
communism or Mara and Arche,
they'll be the only options that we have.

513
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,370
The United States discovered new things
that people just take for granted. Like,

514
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,340
you know, democracy in women's rights
and things like this. It, it, it,

515
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,320
it happened all over the world.

516
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,270
Now Jamie goes out on the ocean
and starts his own, cease dead.

517
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,320
Uh,

518
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,820
he's not claiming some giant bunch of
land with a bunch of captive citizens that

519
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:45,690
he can control.

520
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,700
He has to convince people that he sees
dead can make a profit that is cced. Ed.

521
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:54,680
Can provide blue drops and attract
people out there that his sees Stenvall

522
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,690
survive a competing with other seats,
debts.

523
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,070
And imagine an environment where
citizens at anytime can detach, uh,

524
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,520
from a CSWE dead and float
to a different system.

525
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,110
But can they really? Because if you
have a c stead, say if you ha what's,

526
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,230
let's define a c stent,
because I'm thinking it's a floating city,

527
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:16,950
but the floating city flooding
cities have condos, condos. You buy,

528
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:19,620
you're stuck there. You've got a
mortgage. You're not going anywhere.

529
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,980
You're stuck on is floating city.
Jamie goes crazy. He's doing math now.

530
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,690
God dammit, I got a Goddamn condo on this.
Meth heads. See stead. I can't get off.

531
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:31,260
I owe this money. I'm upside down
on my loan. What am I going to do?

532
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,780
I have a family.
My kids go to school and the sea stud.

533
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,020
Yeah. That's what happens in
land based governments, right?

534
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,340
One way to think about this
is, is the Dutch, you know, uh,

535
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:44,240
their country is sinking. Uh,
they're building floating homes.

536
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,340
They built a floating pavilion. They're
working on a fallen. Sure, they're,

537
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,410
they're there. They're there.
They've been fighting, uh,

538
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,190
against the water for a hundred
years. Building dams, you know,

539
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,740
little Dutch boy that
plugged the damn finger, uh,

540
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,030
there they're so accustomed to the water
when you go there and suggest we need

541
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:05,150
to build a floating cities and
they don't think it's crazy. Uh,

542
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,030
and the company we're working
with on our floating city project,

543
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,590
Delta Sync Syn see,
speaks explicitly about,

544
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,370
uh,

545
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,370
the mobility of moving units forming
floating cities and how this will create a

546
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:22,190
kind of market of competitive
governments that would be peaceful,

547
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:26,870
that would empower citizens
and disempowered governments
so that governments are

548
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:28,310
going to be constantly aquatic.

549
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:33,140
Governments will be hustling to attract
citizens rather than hustling to seize

550
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:33,974
control of them.

551
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,230
Because the ocean is such a
fundamentally a different medium,

552
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,040
which

553
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,010
human nature can compete now. Have
you ever, I'm sure you have Sydney.

554
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:47,180
Me. I thought, wait, what about crop?

555
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,870
Like how are you going to
protect citizens from invading,

556
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:52,790
sees debtors from pirates?

557
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,540
How are we not going to have
like waterworld first of all?

558
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,860
Yeah. Yeah. We get this a lot. And, and,

559
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,950
and one way to think about it is that
there's about a hundred thousand boats on

560
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:07,370
the sea right now. And
civilization required. Yeah.

561
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:10,940
Like at this moment riding around
the whole world. I think so. Yeah.

562
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,450
Seems like there'd be more than that criss
crossing and most of them are in docs

563
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,370
and they're dropping stuff off.
And you know,

564
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,920
if it weren't for all this fluid
commerce, the, the, you know, the,

565
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,350
the world economy would collapse.

566
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,320
I thought it was way more than a hundred
thousand votes on the whole planet.

567
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,990
Three quarters water. Yeah. It doesn't
matter. And, uh, if you think about it,

568
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:30,170
yeah,

569
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,370
all those boats have to have some
form of security. And when you,

570
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,480
when you hear about violence,

571
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,020
you almost always hear about land
based governments involved in violence.

572
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:43,040
You rarely hear about violence and
crime on ships though it occurs.

573
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,960
So all civilization requires some kind
of security and all these boats have

574
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:52,700
water propulsor and they
have sound propulsion. They
have, they have armed guards.

575
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:57,180
I think at this point,
75% of, of, uh, of, um,

576
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,340
container ships have a
armed patrols on board.

577
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,850
And I've written cruise ships,
I've walked around American cities,

578
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,460
cruise ships or the size of skyscrapers,

579
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,920
and they're a lot safer than some
of the American cities I've been in.

580
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,420
So security is really not a problem
if you're going to, uh, you know,

581
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,810
make a new floating nation,
you should have some security.

582
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,370
But if you think about Iceland,
Malta, Bora, Bora, Bora, Barbados,

583
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,840
there's so many islands out there,

584
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,890
defenseless against the big nations
Cayman Islands as an example. Uh,

585
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,300
they have no standing army.
A lot of,

586
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,270
a lot of island nations
have no standing army.

587
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,050
They do business with the big nations.
And the way I put it is, you know,

588
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:37,490
if you're going to found your see stead,

589
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,600
think like a cleaner fish in
the world of sharks. You know,

590
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,040
China's not invading Hong Kong. The United
States is invading the Cayman Islands.

591
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,830
Uh,
Malaysia hasn't invaded Singapore.

592
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,630
When new island nations provide huge
economic value to the big nations,

593
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,070
they do quite well.

594
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,820
So the idea is that just there'll be,

595
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,040
it'll be some sort of a benefit that
the rest of the countries have, uh,

596
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,150
by these competing governments.
Don't,

597
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:07,180
but don't you think that they would find
that these competing governments put

598
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:09,610
pressure on them to sort of
innovate and that they would,

599
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,640
they would want to stifle
that and some sort of way?

600
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,000
Well, we shall see because that's one of
the key ideas. I mean, people little, uh,

601
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,680
understand the power of small island
nations to change the policies of great

602
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:25,020
nations.
And there are numerous examples of this.

603
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:28,050
The most obvious one would be Hong Kong.
You know,

604
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:32,190
Hong Kong gained some level of
independence from China, uh,

605
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,790
was sort of an interesting
hybrid called East meets West.

606
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,350
And it created like wealth in a
very short period of time, uh,

607
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,370
embarrassing China into
changing its policies.

608
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,930
And China has a lot of problems, but by
opening its markets with a, you know,

609
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,270
d din chow pains, open door policy, it's,

610
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,850
it's caused at least a half billion
Chinese to, uh, to escape poverty.

611
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,850
Um,
because of the example set by Hong Kong.

612
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,940
And there examples like
this over and over, um, uh,

613
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,810
Portugal decriminalized drugs,
uh,

614
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,400
scientific American published the
fabulous effects and you know,

615
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:14,340
that's changing policies and the rest of
the world. I can go on and on with this.

616
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:19,080
Estonia with the flat tax little island
nations innovate in ways that large,

617
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,150
uh, continental nations, uh, imitate.
And we want to create more of these.

618
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,510
Uh, when we look at like the
African island of Mauritius,

619
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,700
when we look at Hong Kong,
when we look at Singapore,

620
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,710
when we look at the Isle of Man,

621
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,550
all these places have innovated and
effected and been used as, uh, uh,

622
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,730
examples of policies that have
been instituted by larger nations.

623
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,400
Now when it comes to a practical
application of this, well,

624
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,830
how far away do you think we are
from a legitimate see stead nation?

625
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,860
And it depends on how
you define a c stead. Uh,

626
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,840
right now we're working on the floating
city project, which we're getting the,

627
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,080
the Dutch company I mentioned
before, Delta Sync, uh,
created a feasibility study.

628
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,950
So we hope to have a small,
uh,

629
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,140
floating a floating
city with some level of,

630
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,570
uh, independence in a, a host nations
territorial waters, hopefully by 20,

631
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:19,200
20. If all goes according
to plan six years. Yeah.

632
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,220
And this will be in the territorial,
uh, shallow waters. Right. Okay.

633
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,620
So it'll be under the jurisdiction
of that particular government.

634
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,860
It'll be under the jurisdiction of that
particular government. And we've got, uh,

635
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,023
uh,
you know,

636
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,860
we're closing in on deals with those
governments willing to offer us some level

637
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,680
of independence to see what we can create.

638
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,440
And this is not a radical idea.
I mean,

639
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:45,000
the special economic zone movement that's
happening across developed nations is

640
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,950
all based on this idea of we'll,
we'll,

641
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:51,180
we'll create one little space where people
can experiment with new rules because

642
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,040
even we politicians or recognize that
our government is screwed up. Uh,

643
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,180
we'll see what kind of wealth
can be created. I mean,

644
00:37:57,181 --> 00:38:00,870
Hong Kong started a movement that's
happened all across the world where now

645
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:03,780
we're proposing, let us do a floating
one. We don't need any year land.

646
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,690
Let's see what we can create me,
but we can hire some local people.

647
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,350
So we went to create a
demonstration, cease dead, uh,

648
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:14,190
that'll attract some attention and
attract more brains to the problem.

649
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,540
And then hopefully we'll be able to
move further out and solve the remaining

650
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:23,160
engineering challenges of
floating breakwaters and a
large enough see steads to

651
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:27,890
remain stable on the high seas.
And this is, um, this, this is, uh,

652
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,360
an engineering challenge
that remains to be solved.

653
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,250
But if you think about Shell's prelude is,
um,

654
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,330
larger than the empire state building.

655
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,110
It's a floating oil and
gas facility that'll,

656
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,250
they've built the hall and it
should be on the water by 2017. Um,

657
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,450
it's going to be an international
waters for 25 years. Um,

658
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,670
all the technologies are
sort of closing in on,

659
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,090
on solving the problem of creating
a floating structure on the sea.

660
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,870
And I think the more creative
people we attract to this problem,

661
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:01,870
I think the quicker we'll solve the
problem and have a floating city,

662
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:06,100
I think it will happen in the next couple
of decades and it's easier to float

663
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,240
than fly. Uh, we have space
stations floating above us.

664
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,860
We can certainly makes these stations.

665
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,570
It's just the people have been
more sold on the idea of space. Uh,

666
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,950
they haven't been sold on
the idea of floating cities.

667
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,120
This is a pretty radical proposition to
invest a significant amount of your time

668
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:26,920
and like what, what led you down
this road? Because this is, I mean,

669
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:28,660
this isn't just like,
hey man,

670
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:31,750
let's move to Vancouver because the
United States sucks. This is like,

671
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:36,250
let's start our own thing and let's
do it in it's very radical way.

672
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,350
What, what was it that made you want to,
you know, invest so much of your time? Uh,

673
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:46,410
being part of Silicon Valley and seeing
that so much innovation comes from

674
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,640
people being able to freely compete
and come up with new innovations,

675
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,090
and all of a sudden,
I'm using instantaneous global telepathy,

676
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,410
which we call Twitter.

677
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,270
I never would have imagined such a
thing could exist 20 years ago. Um,

678
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,890
and I think we radically underestimate
the potential for innovation.

679
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,031
Uh,

680
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:12,031
and I'm very excited about the future
of technology and I'm in deep despair

681
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,200
about the future of governance.
Uh, and when I saw that,

682
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:17,860
uh,

683
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,860
mobile nations on the sea that can
disassemble and be reassembled elsewhere

684
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:27,880
according to the decisions of the
citizens, uh, I realized, wow,

685
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:32,080
this is a fundamentally different way
in which human nature can compete.

686
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,010
That would be much less about conquering
and killing and much more about

687
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:39,880
creating value and attracting
people to move there. And you know,

688
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:44,650
we're living in a world where, you know,
you and I are a member of the global 1%.

689
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,510
You know, the World Bank, uh,

690
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,780
estimated that if you make
34,000 US dollars a year,

691
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,050
you're a part of the global 1%.
Meanwhile,

692
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,530
we have this bottom billion who worked
for less than a dollar 25 a day.

693
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,590
$34,000 a year is a global 1% yes.

694
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,780
That's,
that's what the World Bank estimated.

695
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,910
Another group estimated about 55.
That's unbelievable if shive k yeah.

696
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,080
And it's so it's like Americans have
taken the upper part of the hockey stick

697
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,800
and just chopped off the 1% of that
and start complaining about that.

698
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,380
It's not hilarious. Yeah. So we are,

699
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:24,880
we are fabulously wealthy with our access
to institutions and there's another

700
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,330
billion people or 800 million depending
on how you look at it and who don't have

701
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:32,820
access to this. And a
Gallup poll in 2009, uh,

702
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,400
there was 700 million
people who told this poll,

703
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,920
I want to leave my country forever.

704
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,960
Get the hell Outta here
and go somewhere else.

705
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,000
And all the existing nations are acting
as gated communities, locking them out.

706
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,370
This is not counting the people that say,
oh,

707
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:53,150
I want to go somewhere for a short period
of time, make my money and come back.

708
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,520
And these are all the people.
Like tomorrow I will leave my home.

709
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,180
So there's desperate people
who want to go somewhere. Um,

710
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,130
I think see, steads won't be able
to survive without immigration,

711
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,140
without attracting immigrants.

712
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,610
So a lot of seeds sitters or
are interested in aquaculture,

713
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,580
creating vast, uh, seaweed farms
on the sea, vast algae farms, uh,

714
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,900
to provide the world with food and fuel.

715
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,360
The great thing about algae is that they
grow their own bio mass with a carbon

716
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,570
and nutrients,
both of which are polluting the oceans.

717
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,220
So you could in a sense feed and
fuel the world with greenhouse gas.

718
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,390
If you could ramp up these,
uh,

719
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,060
ocean farms to the scale
needed to feed people,

720
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,920
you'd need to hire millions of
people, uh, to have these farms.

721
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:45,080
I don't think you and I are
going to go work an algae farm,

722
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,500
but I think people in Yemen or Somalia
or Afghanistan would gladly take a jobs

723
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:53,300
there.

724
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,960
I mean there's migrant workers are
fleeing their countries and trying to find

725
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:59,000
better lives everywhere. And I, and I'm,

726
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,150
one of the reasons I'm interested in
seasteading is I think we have the

727
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:06,050
potential to uplift a significant
proportion of the bottom billion.

728
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,160
If you did develop this,

729
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:14,190
how would you or would you at all
control immigration to your c Stud?

730
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,910
I mean, how do you, how do
you weed out the undesirable,

731
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,290
how do you keep people that are murderers
and criminals from other countries

732
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,960
that are fleeing jurisdictions
of wherever they're from?

733
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,020
They get in a boat and they show up at
your c stead and just fuck the whole

734
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:29,854
thing up.

735
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,780
Security. Hopefully like you can
imagine you start a avast algae farm,

736
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:38,770
you're going to be interested in, in being
safe. And there's, there's already, uh,

737
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,680
numerous,
uh,

738
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,810
security industry's working the oceans
that provide security for all sorts of

739
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,910
ocean going vessels so that,

740
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,990
that industry already exists and it does
a better job than, you know, land based,

741
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:54,640
uh, cops and military is actually,
um, but if you offer a better jobs,

742
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,650
if you offer a blue jobs to vehicle,
uh, they'll take those jobs.

743
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,070
Um, especially when you consider,
they were talking twice,

744
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:06,430
the population in the United States
has announced that they're ready to go

745
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:10,390
somewhere else. Um, there's not,
there's not many places they can go.

746
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,430
And you know, I was talking to
a, uh, a woman from Senegal.

747
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,730
[inaudible] got weighed
and she was telling me, you
know, people from my country,

748
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,710
they a stowaway on boats.
Um, and they, and they,

749
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,290
you know, they die. They drown.
She says there are fish food.

750
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,660
There are people so desperate
to get out of their countries,

751
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,000
they're jumping on boats,
not knowing where they're going to go.

752
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,530
Just get me anywhere,
get me out of this hell hole.

753
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,520
And those people will take
a better opportunities. Um,

754
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,390
just like, you know, I'm
Irish a hundred years ago, uh,

755
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,640
my ancestors were extremely poor. They
took better jobs in the United States,

756
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:49,220
low paying jobs,
and now they're,

757
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,060
their grandchildren are living lives of
fabulous prosperity and we need to keep

758
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:56,880
this going. We need more life rafts
out there for the bottom billion.

759
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,450
So would you have any sort of a
filtering system to keep people out?

760
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:05,270
Would you verify passports
and do background checks
on people before you allow

761
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:06,870
the man mean?
What's the idea behind that?

762
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:11,040
It was just going to be open and figure
out how to do it along the way when,

763
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,690
when things go bad. I mean,
what's the, and you've got to,

764
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,750
and one way to think
about this is it's not a,

765
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,360
it's not about designing a society.
I have no ability to design the society.

766
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,080
Uh, I'm working to provide the technology
so that other people can design their

767
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:27,000
societies,
um,

768
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:32,370
and the like new countries created
in the past few decades, uh,

769
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:37,080
apply more modern rules to their founding
and they do better jobs that, you know,

770
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:41,370
there's been a something like 29
new countries since like 1990.

771
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,180
I hope I'm getting those numbers. Really.
Yeah. There's, there's been like, um,

772
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,680
where are they? They're like 6 cents
a, you know, 2000 to really yeah.

773
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,770
People don't realize new countries are
created all the time and people have to

774
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:57,270
say that. I've never even heard mostly
countries breaking up into smaller pieces.

775
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:02,700
Um, and um, are any
promising? Oh yeah, yeah,

776
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,320
yeah. I think, uh, East Donia
is incredibly exciting and it's,

777
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,480
it's innovating in ways larger
countries are not, you know,

778
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:13,970
they've innovated in the realm of a
flat tax, which was unthinkable. Um,

779
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,690
and I think I counted something like,

780
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,680
since Estonia innovated in
the area of the flat tax,

781
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,570
they grew it like twice the rate of
surrounding European nations causing

782
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:29,430
arguments among their politicians to,
to, to, uh, instantiate a flat tax.

783
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,190
I kind of like 22 countries that have
adopted, he's Stoney is innovation.

784
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,040
So new countries innovate, old
countries do not. And New Co,

785
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,800
the new startup countries set
the examples that change things.

786
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,740
So why are we waiting
for historical accident?

787
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,640
I'd like to create thousands of these.
So the,

788
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,200
the place where you have to let go of
the desire for control is to realize it's

789
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:58,980
going to be up to the founders of these
societies how they're going to provide

790
00:46:58,981 --> 00:46:59,814
security.

791
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,030
It's going to be up to the founders
who they're gonna hire and what they're

792
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:06,630
going to pay them there.
There were not controlling,

793
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:08,970
we're empowering people to try things.

794
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,480
And the reason I'm less afraid of aquatic
nations than continental nations is

795
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,580
because aquatic nations will have
to attract people to live there.

796
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,990
You're not going out and you're,

797
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,080
you're not conquering some place
where people live and saying,

798
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,430
I'll keep everyone safe.

799
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,000
You're saying I got to provide you
an incentive to come live with me.

800
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,490
And then there'll be other see
steads for the same workers,

801
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:33,580
for the same innovators,
for the same doctors and lawyers.

802
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,300
If they provide better and cheaper
services than people will detach and move

803
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,134
there.

804
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,640
We're in a situation where there's nothing
stopping the inexhaustible growth of

805
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:45,070
governments because they
are monopolies and we,

806
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,430
I think humanity has to innovate in this
space and it requires this deep mind

807
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:55,510
flip to think about the difference
between competing over land and competing

808
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:59,710
over fluid.
Think of them as houseboats on a,

809
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,620
on a liquid. It's much harder to
seize monopoly control with your,

810
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:05,820
with your military over

811
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,000
a bunch of boats on the ocean.
Is it though?

812
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,060
I mean it seems like they were just kind
of surround you like if you tried to do

813
00:48:11,061 --> 00:48:12,290
a Waco in the ocean,

814
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,950
it seems that if you had like the
branch Davidian complex out there in the

815
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,720
middle of the ocean,
like I know Jamie's planning,

816
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,620
we'll get that motherfucker look
at him over there. He's planning.

817
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,010
If you decided to do that and build some
city and put up giant barbwire fence

818
00:48:25,011 --> 00:48:29,840
and have sex with everybody, his wife
and the in store a lot of weapons,

819
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,060
the government would probably come
in. I mean, if you say security,

820
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:36,840
and I'm obviously playing devil's
advocate here, but if you say, uh,

821
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,560
everyone will be responsible for
security and your, she's dead. Well,

822
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,430
at what point does security become an
army? Like, are you allowed to have a jet?

823
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,580
Are you allowed to have nuclear weapons?
Are you allowed to have, you know,

824
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:48,500
if you innovate to the point where you're,
you're,

825
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,800
you're building some fucking Tesla
weapons out in the middle of the ocean,

826
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:53,870
they can shoot down anything
that comes anywhere near you.

827
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:57,620
At what point is the government gonna
feel threatened by you and move in?

828
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,750
How big can you get? I mean, do you,

829
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,400
does every seasteading nation have to be,
um,

830
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,090
sort of either like a
satellite of a larger nation?

831
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,840
You know what I'm saying?

832
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,970
Well, um, conquerors have incentives.

833
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:14,000
And the way to think about how this
works is to think about precedents that

834
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:18,370
already exist. Um, so let's see.
It's, is it the islands of, um,

835
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:23,120
Barbados and Bora Bora that are just a
few miles off the coast of Venezuela,

836
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:28,530
a independent countries that are much
wealthier and Venezuela doesn't attack

837
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:31,280
them? Uh, the Cayman Islands, you know,

838
00:49:31,281 --> 00:49:34,830
in many ways takes a spiteful stance
towards the regulatory structure.

839
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,360
The United States welcomes
lots of, you know, uh,

840
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,570
physician mavericks and Financial
Mavericks to their shores.

841
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,660
The United States doesn't
attack the Cayman Islands.

842
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,710
Right. But they're not 200 miles off
shore with nuclear weapons. I'm just, yes,

843
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,690
I'm sort of saying if you just established
a city that became a country that's

844
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:55,850
floating off shore,
that's heavily armed.

845
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,870
Right.
So you have to ask,

846
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:02,910
how are a continental nations
in control of nuclear weapons?

847
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,830
Why aren't, uh, island
nations in controlled?

848
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,490
Small island nations don't have nuclear
weapons and most of them don't have

849
00:50:08,491 --> 00:50:11,100
standing armies.
You have to pay for that stuff.

850
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,400
Like for me to go attack
someone and kill someone,

851
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,610
there has to be a financial
incentive for me that I feel like,

852
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,240
or whatever incentives incentive of
power that I feel like the cost of the

853
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:26,241
invasion is going to pay back and some
great thing I'm going to get like the oil

854
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,100
or the,
or any other natural

855
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,570
resource that might be within that nation.
A small island nations like Hong Kong,

856
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,740
they don't have any natural resources
except a big port and they're able to

857
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,930
create all this wealth through
trade and through policies.

858
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,620
So how does a cease dead get
enough money to get a, um,

859
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:48,910
to build up a giant nuclear warhead or
something and launch it from the seas?

860
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,760
Couldn't Hong Kong store to do that
with all the money that Hong Kong is

861
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:53,570
generated whenever they
started building an army?

862
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,180
I think that would probably be a
huge issue. Don't you think if,

863
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:01,100
and yet they don't because they,
if you own a continental nation,

864
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,420
you like say China,

865
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,710
you have a control over
a captive population,

866
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,580
you can fleece, uh, and
pay for whatever you want.

867
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,170
So you have an amazing amount of capitol,

868
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:19,040
brain power and money to
build your nuclear weapons.
And this is why these large,

869
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:19,973
um,

870
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,410
these large governments to me are much
more of a threat to the world and some

871
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:29,390
floating island that has to, you know,
not go bankrupt as it gets started.

872
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,580
What is the major roadblock as far as
technical capability of creating something

873
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,060
along those lines? I mean, how has,

874
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,120
has the technology been invented in order
to create a safe floating city or is

875
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:48,920
this completely theoretical?

876
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,700
The key enabling technology at this
point is how do you create something that

877
00:51:55,401 --> 00:52:00,260
can float on the high seas
that is affordable by say,

878
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,810
you know,
the average middle class American and I'm,

879
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:07,320
am I right also in thinking that you
don't have to worry about waves like uh,

880
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:12,370
as far as like rogue waves or tidal waves
cause those more effect like land than

881
00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:15,740
they do the actual ocean itself.
Like if you're floating,

882
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:19,820
you just kind of like Bob up and down
a lot, you wouldn't get swamped. Yeah.

883
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:22,880
I think you're talking
about tsunamis rogue waves.

884
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,560
Like what was that stupid movie with Mark
Mark. Perfect. Perfect. Starbucks store.

885
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,220
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. As, as tsunamis
are harmless on the deep sea,

886
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:33,550
people are shocked to hear that soon.
Like A,

887
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:37,490
a tsunami wave can literally be thousands
of miles long. So if you're on a boat,

888
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,370
you know, you, your book,
over the course of a day,

889
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:43,190
your boat goes up about Demeter and goes
down to meet her and you can easily not

890
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:44,024
notice it.

891
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,560
Tsunamis become deadly when they hit
land and they start to roll and pitch and

892
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:50,220
bury a city.
Uh,

893
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,380
there was a report that I really love
where there's scuba divers off the coast

894
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:59,070
to some, uh, Thailand, uh, city.
Uh, they were underwater, uh,

895
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,340
just swimming around having
a vacation and they say, hey,

896
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:03,830
there's a weird discoloration in
the water and there's a little,

897
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,080
there's a little undulation
happening. Oh, well.

898
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,930
And they go back to scuba diving
that come back to the surface.

899
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,190
And the hotel where they ate breakfast
in is destroyed. The city is destroyed,

900
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,460
their swimming, they swam through us
and I'm in and didn't notice it. So, uh,

901
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,590
coastal cities are sitting
ducks for tsunamis.

902
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:25,770
If you're going to be subjected to a
tsunami, you'd be safer. A sea stead.

903
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,913
Huh?

904
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,450
So those big crazy ways from a perfect
storm, like if something comes,

905
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,870
so that, so that is the fundamental
engineering challenge. Huge waves.

906
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,441
On the ocean.

907
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:40,400
So we have the technology to create a
floating city in shallow territorial

908
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:43,430
borders. And we're going to
do that soon. Hopefully. Uh,

909
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,390
the engineering challenge to be solved
is how do you create permanent structures

910
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:52,220
on the water, um, that, that
are, that can stay out there.

911
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,080
Like you can create boats,

912
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:57,740
but the problem is boats have to come
to shore every decade or two decades to

913
00:53:57,741 --> 00:54:00,170
get cleaned, right? You've got to
have something permanent out there.

914
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,210
And there's numerous technologies
like, um, one that's been in a,

915
00:54:05,211 --> 00:54:09,890
um, commission been in operation
since 1962 was the flip ship.

916
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,710
It's basically shaped like a baseball bat.

917
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:18,130
You tow it out into the ocean and then
use ballast tanks so that it flips and

918
00:54:18,441 --> 00:54:19,550
then it stands up.
Right?

919
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:23,900
So say like one sixth of the ship of
this big baseball bat is above the water

920
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:24,771
and five,

921
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:29,771
six is below the water and it's described
as being a stable as a fence post.

922
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,250
Uh, and these were on the water in
1962. They're still on the water.

923
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,280
So most of it is under the water.
Most of it doesn't have what he,

924
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:40,910
essentially the anchor that would be
the route that would be the route.

925
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,480
And so it can sit there among the waves
and you're on this thing or underwater,

926
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,790
you can imagine looking at a
window at a permanent aquarium.

927
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,640
Jamie's got a photo of it that he just
pulled up here. This is what it is.

928
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,680
Yeah. That's what the top
part of it looks like. Oh. Uh,

929
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:01,270
so most of convincing people of the
potential of [inaudible] stead involves

930
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,300
telling them about what
already exists. I mean, that,

931
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,750
that thing is older than I am.
It's been around. Really? Yeah.

932
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:12,610
So it's expensive. It's too
expensive for regular people to use.

933
00:55:12,611 --> 00:55:15,600
It's used by the military.
It's used by scientists. Uh,

934
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,350
but you're seasick free on that thing.

935
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,370
Now imagine you make four
of them or three of them.

936
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:26,290
You can build a platform on it. Uh,
you can build floors below the ocean.

937
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:30,070
You can build the floors
above the ocean. So, um,

938
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,510
of many of the C's dead designs you can
see on our website are built in such a

939
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:38,890
way that the, uh, it
looks like they're, uh,

940
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:43,810
on pillars, on like land in shallow
water, but they're actually not.

941
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:47,950
If you build your pillars deep enough
and buoyant enough, you can set your,

942
00:55:47,951 --> 00:55:49,900
see stet up, say, you know,

943
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:54,760
50 feet from the surface of the ocean
and the ocean waves are moving underneath

944
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,540
the sea stead and its remit
remaining relatively stable,

945
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,280
uh,
on these pillars that are just in water.

946
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:07,450
And the pillars go down much further
than you would normally think.

947
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:10,930
It's kind of like building
a foundation in a swamp

948
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,140
saw something where they made it so
they figured out a way to make things so

949
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:20,550
stable that they, you can play
billiards on a, on a boat.

950
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:26,210
They figured out a way to stabilize
like a pool table to the point where it

951
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:31,711
reacts instantaneously to the movement
of the ocean and the ship itself where

952
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,630
you can see it stays constantly balanced.

953
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,810
Yeah. There's so much I
can tell you about. I mean,

954
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,640
I wrote on a cruise ship and Alaskan
cruise ship and a month ago I was on a

955
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,490
Galapagos cruise ship and you
can have your Martini glass,

956
00:56:44,491 --> 00:56:48,710
you pour the Martini glass, you set
it on the table. It's not, you know,

957
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,470
it's not rolling over. It's like
the larger you make your C's dead,

958
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,250
the more stable it is in the waves. Those
bolts are kind of see steads, right?

959
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,450
I mean if you really think about it,

960
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,080
well that's the precedent we use is to
get people thinking about cruise ships.

961
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:02,970
I mean, they're the size
of skyscrapers. I mean,

962
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:05,820
you can look at pictures on the Internet
and realize those tiny little answer

963
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:09,930
people and everything people do in cities
they're already doing on cruise ships,

964
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:13,340
you know, simulated skydiving.
They have rock concerts on them.

965
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,641
Yeah.

966
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:18,641
Here's this video of these guys playing
pool on a cruise ship and the boat is

967
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:22,670
moving,
but yet the balls are,

968
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,210
are rolling perfectly because the,
the ship,

969
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:28,520
if he could see the ship is moving,

970
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:31,640
but the table stays completely level.

971
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:36,080
So it adjusts with the,
the movement of the ocean.

972
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:41,081
The table consistently constantly adjusts
so that the floor may be moving but

973
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:45,110
the balls are never
rolling and I incredible.

974
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,030
That is incredible.

975
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:49,780
And that would obviously be on like a
smaller boat where it's not naturally

976
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:52,480
stable anyway because I've been in cruise
ships where people are playing pool,

977
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,640
you know,
you can't even tell you on the water.

978
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:59,710
But if you think about the
sinking of that Russian sub,

979
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,720
uh,
you know,

980
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:06,721
they had to find a company to lift that
thing off the water without causing off

981
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:11,530
the bottom of the ocean without causing
a disaster. Glo Mar situation, uh,

982
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,630
this was a long time ago.
It was a few years ago,

983
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,260
I think it was called the [inaudible].
And the company is called Memo Matt,

984
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,060
I don't know how to pronounce these
things because they're in different

985
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:23,110
languages, but they had to lift
this thing centimeter by centimeter.

986
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,340
And they had to do,

987
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,380
they had to create a platform on the
top of the water and create virtually

988
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,040
perfect stability while while they
lifted this thing slowly off the Bot,

989
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:37,750
you know, a nuclear sub off the bottom
of the, uh, of the, uh, of the ocean, uh,

990
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:42,250
in order to lift it up. And it was
a tremendous engineering feat. Um,

991
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,220
we can go on and on like this
and we might bore your listeners,

992
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:50,020
but there are multiple technologies
that are all closing in on, hey,

993
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:53,180
we can get something permanent on
the sea. And it looks like, um,

994
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,580
Shell is gonna is gonna build one
soon. So the, the question is,

995
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:02,560
now how do we make it cheaper?
How do we attract more brains to this?

996
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,890
How do we get a kind of x prize,
uh,

997
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:08,320
attracting people to solve
this engineering challenge?

998
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,190
I think once we solve this challenge,
seasteading will,

999
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,530
will drive itself.

1000
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:19,170
Shell is going to build one and they're
building an oil refinery that floats.

1001
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:19,880
Is that what the want?

1002
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,800
Yeah. Uh, and it's not, they're
not calling it a see stead,
but it will be, you know,

1003
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:27,590
200 miles off the coast of Australia.
Uh,

1004
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,680
it's built in like South Korea and it's
bigger than the empire state building.

1005
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:39,220
You can fit several football fields on
it and it's going to be in international

1006
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:44,030
waters for up to 25 years. So pretty
much any time a city is it, I mean,

1007
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,410
think of it as like a giant,
uh,

1008
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,640
I'd like a giant skyscraper on the water.

1009
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,930
Will be reasonably self sustaining or is,

1010
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,950
is it going to rely on constant visits by,

1011
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,060
by freighter ships? Like all
ships in islands, everywhere.

1012
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:02,840
It requires on constant visits
and trade and, but this is like,

1013
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,660
they don't think of it as
an independent country.

1014
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:09,830
They think of it as a shell
prelude fling facility.

1015
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,600
I'll give the size of that
thing. It's gigantic. Um,

1016
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,510
bigger than the empire state
building. Yeah, more massive.

1017
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:20,720
And see if I can remember how many
football fields on it you could play.

1018
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,300
I think it's five like
football games in a row.

1019
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,100
So it's,
it's doable.

1020
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,680
It's just still too expensive.
The shell can afford that and they can,

1021
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,090
and they can pay it back. So
our skyscrapers, right. I mean,

1022
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:39,170
you and I can't go out and build a
scotch grabber. Right. But we could,

1023
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:42,650
if we had a great idea for a business
that would work a board of floating

1024
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:46,040
skyscraper, like, like
a gigantic hospital,

1025
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:52,130
um, uh, floating Cayman Islands.
You know, one of my heroes,

1026
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,450
uh,

1027
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:57,450
who's building a health city in the
Cayman Islands is named a Debby Shetti.

1028
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,530
Uh, he did create name. Yeah. He's a,

1029
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,280
he's an Indian guy and he did
amazing stuff with, you know,

1030
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:05,900
he'll offer Americans,
uh,

1031
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,810
heart surgery for one 10th the
price with the best doctors,

1032
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,500
and that makes them enough money where
he can offer a medical insurance to rural

1033
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:15,440
Indians, uh, for 25 cents a month.

1034
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,500
So he plays this kind of
jurisdictional arbitrage.

1035
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,970
So now he's moving to the Cayman Islands
and building what are called health

1036
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,950
cities ready to catch the wiving,

1037
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,990
the rising wave of Americans who are
going to be dissatisfied with their

1038
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,950
healthcare and when a faster,
quicker and cheaper and we'll fly there.

1039
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:39,020
And I, I've been looking at him as a
guy that seems like he understands what

1040
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:39,831
seasteading would be.

1041
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:43,730
He seems to understand the principles
and he's applying them by using real

1042
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:44,564
islands.

1043
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:48,110
And I've always fantasized if I could
talk to him and get him to like invest in

1044
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:49,740
a cced dead.
And you know,

1045
01:01:49,741 --> 01:01:53,900
I almost peed my pants a few months ago
where he was in the news and he said,

1046
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:58,480
you know, the best place
to have a floating hospital
would be on a ship, you know,

1047
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:02,900
off the coast of a major American city.
Given that we don't have that,

1048
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:05,750
I'm going to build one in the Cayman
Islands. And I'm like, oh my God.

1049
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:10,460
Like there's so many people thinking
along these lines. Like, if we could just,

1050
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:15,050
we have innovations and technologies
moving forward and we have regulatory

1051
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:19,130
structures and government's holding it
back and the world can't be held back.

1052
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,790
The world has to move forward.
Well,

1053
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:23,610
you don't want to overthrow
governments that's violent.

1054
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:28,850
You want to innovate and compete with and
embarrass governments the way you know

1055
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:32,730
Singapore and Hong Kong and
the island man have done

1056
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,200
well.
And I'm on a small scale.

1057
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:37,700
When you see certain laws
that are in place that are um,

1058
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,890
very restrictive and
they don't make sense.

1059
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:44,220
And then you see states that take
chances like Colorado with their medical

1060
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:49,221
marijuana practices or rather a legal
marijuana where they're making untold

1061
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:53,190
amounts of money. Now, I mean
far past what they projected.

1062
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:56,790
And now other countries are starting to
look at the revenue that's being brought

1063
01:02:56,791 --> 01:03:00,150
in hundreds of millions of dollars
in tax revenue. And they're saying,

1064
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,210
you know what? This is, why would
we avoid this? This is crazy.

1065
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,250
Like what are we seeing
as far as violence?

1066
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:06,720
What we're seeing a drop in violent crime?

1067
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:09,720
What are we seeing as far as drunk
driving and driving accidents?

1068
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:11,610
We're seeing record lows,

1069
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,600
record lows as far as like traffic
fatalities and drunk driving.

1070
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,850
Why aren't you know? That's exactly what
happens. Someone comes along and says,

1071
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:23,580
listen, the laws that are in
place, they don't make any sense.

1072
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,580
The the structure that's in
place, it's, it's antiquated,

1073
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,210
it's archaic and it doesn't match
up with what we know about medicine,

1074
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:33,270
what we know about physiology, what
we know about life. Let's change it.

1075
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,030
So they're changing it and you've seen
the benefits and now all these other

1076
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:40,890
states are now first switching to medical
marijuana and projecting legalized

1077
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:44,460
marijuana all throughout
the entire country. It's the
same sort of a situation.

1078
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:46,470
It's,
it's these archaic,

1079
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,490
very restrictive laws that don't make
any sense and there's no competition

1080
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,670
because of the monopoly of government.
These laws are in place and people say,

1081
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:54,600
well,
you could vote him out.

1082
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,030
Do you know how many much fucking money
is spent keeping those laws in place?

1083
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:03,300
Do you know how many people
lobby the prison guard unions,

1084
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:05,130
pharmaceutical companies,
et Cetera, et cetera.

1085
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:09,000
So many different companies lobbying and
spend millions of dollars of money to

1086
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:13,860
keep the laws in place. If you could
have one state, just one state,

1087
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,410
you know, let's say South
Dakota says, you know what,

1088
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,950
we're not so happy with
the way things work. Well,

1089
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,830
we're going to do is we're going to open
up South Dakota to a complete Utopian

1090
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:23,341
society.

1091
01:04:23,341 --> 01:04:27,780
We're going to just start from scratch
instead of seasteading wants to come over

1092
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,200
to South Dakota and Char tribe
rebuilding society over here.

1093
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,110
Would you be interested in something
like that or do you think the only way to

1094
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:37,260
do this is to do it in the ocean? Uh, I

1095
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,690
ran my first podcast last
week and I interviewed, uh,

1096
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,350
Zachary because Sarah's who
welcome to the club, you know,

1097
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,190
welcome to the pod class clown.
Yeah.

1098
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,790
First one is my first one you got in
there and it was a marvelous interview.

1099
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:54,480
He's a fascinating dude and he
founded the startup cities institute.

1100
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,780
Now, uh, the special economic zones,

1101
01:04:57,781 --> 01:05:00,930
there's actually thousands of them all
over the world is places like India,

1102
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,510
South America, China are all like, yeah,

1103
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,900
it's embarrassing to be in a
country that's not performing well.

1104
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,350
Let's create special little zones
where we can start over with new rules.

1105
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:14,400
And there's, you know, they're called free
cities, they're called free ports. So,

1106
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:18,900
you know, Zach has been, um,
pushing for pushing the F uh,

1107
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:23,050
in Guatemala. The idea of the
Morse free cities, you can create,

1108
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,860
the more innovation you can
create, the more, uh, uh,

1109
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:30,370
wealth you can create for poor people if
they choose to move there and take the

1110
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:34,910
jobs. And our whole discussion was,
which is a bigger challenge, the,

1111
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:39,820
the engineering challenge of building
something on the sea or the challenge of

1112
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:43,260
working at a deal with existing
comp, uh, governments and,

1113
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,780
and asking them for a piece
of their land. Right. Um,

1114
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,300
and some of these places have
been very successful, you know,

1115
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:52,150
Shinzen across the bay from Hong Kong,

1116
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,720
given the example that Hong Kong set,
you know,

1117
01:05:55,721 --> 01:06:00,580
China agreed to create a little special
economic zone called Shinzen and you

1118
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,860
know, creating, once
again, spectacular wealth.

1119
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:07,300
So now they've allowed more of these
experiments. So the way you know,

1120
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:10,450
in industry isn't working as if you
have to argue about it. You know,

1121
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:13,330
in our arguments don't matter.
Our, our experiments matter.

1122
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:17,620
And the reason we have to argue about
politics is because it's not innovating

1123
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:18,880
and everyone is frustrated.

1124
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,540
And the more startups
societies we can create, um,

1125
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:28,180
the more we'll empower innovators to come
up with ideas. We haven't thought of.

1126
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,960
The best solutions always come
from outside our, our heads.

1127
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,870
So I'm a big supporter of startup cities.

1128
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:39,880
Startup cities are people that are a big
supporter of seasteading and you know,

1129
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:42,270
may the best societies when,
hmm.

1130
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,170
Um,

1131
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,060
but your idea is primarily to build it
in the ocean and if you do build in the

1132
01:06:48,061 --> 01:06:48,960
ocean,
what,

1133
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,640
what are the potential natural disaster
worries you have to worry about?

1134
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,880
If you don't have to worry about waves,

1135
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:57,060
you do have to worry about like things
like hurricanes and things like that.

1136
01:06:57,061 --> 01:07:01,440
Right? Would you have to engineer the
building's very specifically to deal with

1137
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:03,240
tropical storms and
things along those lines?

1138
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,360
See steads our mobile,
uh, the people that are,

1139
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,750
that are sitting ducks in the face of
a hurricane or is anyone that's like

1140
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:14,920
nailed to a,
to a coastal nation and he's cities,

1141
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,670
all the mega cities in the world are
springing up along the coast and many of

1142
01:07:18,671 --> 01:07:22,720
them are susceptible to hurricanes.
If you're a cease dead, uh, you know,

1143
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,540
I grew up in the east coast, I was
subjected to a few hurricanes, you know,

1144
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,870
about them a few days before they come
and then it's battened down the hatches,

1145
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:31,870
get in the basement, you know, whatever
you have to do if you're a c stayed,

1146
01:07:31,871 --> 01:07:34,690
you could potentially just move
out of the way as boats do.

1147
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:40,130
So you would just, I mean there's some
of them that are just massive though.

1148
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:44,600
I mean there's, there's like Katrina,
I mean, how many states was Katrina?

1149
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:47,520
How many states wide was Katrina
before it hit? It was enormous.

1150
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,570
Is enormous. And I'm curious
to know, um, how much,

1151
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,630
how much lead time did people
have in the warning of that

1152
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,780
you're leading me to talk about,
you know,

1153
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:01,990
I have to get bigger and bigger
with w c sittings a big subject.

1154
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:06,220
And the thing I want to tell you about
now is we'll start with the fact that

1155
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:11,050
hurricanes don't cross the equator.
A lot of people don't know that, uh,

1156
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:14,530
there's never been evidence of a hurricane
crossing the acquaintance south to

1157
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:17,210
north across the other
one. Like going, yeah,

1158
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,600
you mean like go along the vertical
access to the equator or go above it,

1159
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,530
go above the equator or go below the
equator. Really? Yeah. Why is that a,

1160
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:29,090
I don't know. The coal, the role
is for, I have no idea. But um,

1161
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:34,340
so there's this Guy Patrick Takahashi
who's like a biochemical engineer from

1162
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:38,930
Hawaii and numerous people like that are
pushing forward this technology called

1163
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:39,764
Otec,

1164
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,840
e c a and it's basically ocean
thermal energy conversion.

1165
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:50,270
And it basically takes advantage of
the fact that the surface of a tropical

1166
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,920
ocean is very warm and a thousand
feet down. It's very cold.

1167
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,860
And you get like a huge
temperature differential,

1168
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,720
which can drive a gigantic steam engine
and basically use the ocean itself as a

1169
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:05,450
solar panel, uh, to, you know,

1170
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:09,020
power and ocean city or an
ocean plant ship as he calls it.

1171
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:11,990
And also power the land
based nations of the world.

1172
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,890
We can completely replace a fossil fuels,
um,

1173
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:20,600
with a clean green renewable energy
of Otec. Does it sound futuristic?

1174
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,130
Uh, they built a working one in 1979
during the Carter administration,

1175
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,400
uh,
as it was part of the oil crisis.

1176
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,270
And then soon after that when oil
prices fell, Otec was abandoned.

1177
01:09:32,271 --> 01:09:33,800
No more OTEC plants were built.

1178
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,030
Now there's a whole company's
involved with building Otec.

1179
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:41,040
They're going to build one off
the coast of China. Numerous, uh,

1180
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:45,950
island nations have commissioned, um, uh,
OTEC plants to be built off their coasts.

1181
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,940
The Bahamas is going to build to,
so why did I go to this?

1182
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:52,700
We're talking about hurricanes
crawling quarter. Yeah.

1183
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:55,280
So the best place to build these

1184
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:59,540
gigantic Otec plants is on the equator.

1185
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,510
Cause that's where the surface water
is warm mist. And as an added benefit,

1186
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:09,710
you're safe from hurricanes for the
most part. So the equator itself,

1187
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,070
how wide is the equator?
Like what's considered the equator?

1188
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:18,050
I mean it's not a line, right? Yeah, it's,
it's a, it's, it's where the, you know,

1189
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:22,940
the earth spins on its axis and it's
where it's basically the earth that spends

1190
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:27,800
the most time closest to the sun. Uh, uh,
you know, there must be a height though,

1191
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,350
right? Yeah, that's a
good question. It's funny,

1192
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,590
I was just at the equator when I went to
the Galapagos islands on my little trip

1193
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:38,160
and, uh, I don't think
there's an official width, uh,

1194
01:10:38,161 --> 01:10:40,280
of the equator,
you know,

1195
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,360
I have no idea or height and it seems
like there should be, yeah, I don't know.

1196
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:48,830
I think it's just the line
where the earth's spends
the most time closest to the

1197
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:52,250
sun. You know, everywhere else we have
seasons because the earth is on a wobble.

1198
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:57,720
It has length, no width or
depth. That makes sense. A line.

1199
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:01,610
It's just a very fine line with no
hide at all. It's an abstraction.

1200
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:06,140
A strange,
so you'd have to like be on that line.

1201
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:07,760
What if you went up too high?

1202
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,720
One of like the northern tip of your
sitting at fucked by a hurricane. I mean,

1203
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,240
that could happen because a lot of, you
know, a lot of hurricanes are caused by,

1204
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:19,410
you know, very warm water and put some
still bizarre that it would not cross.

1205
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,360
Yeah. Like starts, you know,

1206
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:24,660
sort of near the equator and then
it moves either north or South. Wow.

1207
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,080
That's so weird. Yeah. And I don't
understand why I'm, I'm just, uh,

1208
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:33,360
it's one of those things I've been taught
by the numerous aquaponic or as I've

1209
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:38,720
spoken to the thing that makes seasteading
that shows that it's a Meta idea is

1210
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:41,340
all the diverse people
that come to seasteading.

1211
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,000
What their unique solution that no one
who talked about seasteading is thought

1212
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,070
of. Um, you know, on the,

1213
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:50,100
on the website we have this thing called
the eight great moral imperatives of

1214
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:51,270
seasteading and each of them,

1215
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,450
it's a little video thing that I made
to try to introduce people to the key

1216
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:56,730
ideas.
Each video is like five minutes long.

1217
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,520
And each of them features and Aquaponic,
sure.

1218
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:02,490
That didn't even know
about the other guys.

1219
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,040
But here's about seasteading
and comes to us with,

1220
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,930
I have an idea for this seaweed farm and
this is how we could lower the carbon

1221
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:13,460
acidity of the ocean and I could do this
on a massive scale and blah, blah, blah,

1222
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,540
blah. And then we have
another guy, you know,

1223
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:18,930
one of my favorites is a Neil sims who,
who,

1224
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,640
who runs the Velella, uh,
research project. He has, um,

1225
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:28,710
fish cages that a school
with the moving fish.

1226
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,920
So he literally see if I
can describe this to you.

1227
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,150
Think of the Hawaiian islands
as, um, rocks in a stream.

1228
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,270
And as the ocean comes by the islands,

1229
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,370
it creates a little eddies
behind these islands,

1230
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,840
like little leaf floating around.

1231
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:47,460
So he's got these circular fish cages
where he keeps the fish inside them.

1232
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:50,220
So the fish just kind of
school in a circle and the,

1233
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,890
the cages move with the schooling
fish around in a circle and you,

1234
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:57,960
and he has a gps on the cage.
So the fish are out there.

1235
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:01,740
There's no environmental or negligible
unmeasured on measurable environmental

1236
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:06,380
impact. The Fisher on the deep
sea living as if they're wild. Um,

1237
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:11,010
these are crazy ideas
and, but they require, uh,

1238
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,940
being out in the place where there is
no government jurisdiction for the most

1239
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,710
part.
I mean off the coast of Hawaiian islands,

1240
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:19,220
there is some government
jurisdiction, but we have, you know,

1241
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,960
45% of the world's surface
unclaimed by existing, uh,

1242
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:27,980
governments where people are innovating
in these unique ways to feed the world

1243
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,870
with sustainable sashimi
on the deep oceans.

1244
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:36,350
Is the idea of managing people just an
archaic idea and is what you're saying,

1245
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:39,420
what you're talking about
when you're talking about
micromanaging the government,

1246
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:44,040
trying to manage all these things and
in fact fucking them up with too many

1247
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:44,874
regulations.

1248
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:50,030
Is it impossible to really regulate human
behavior and it's at a certain point

1249
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,330
or to really regulate,

1250
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,320
especially when it comes to things
like innovation when it comes to, uh,

1251
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,350
I mean is our regulations,
in fact,

1252
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,810
roadblocks to innovation,

1253
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,340
the creativity of 7 billion
people is unpredictable.

1254
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,050
And there's always something new coming,

1255
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,080
especially as a c center where people
come to me and tell me about things that

1256
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:11,860
could use seasoning for him.
Like I had no idea,

1257
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:13,810
I can't believe you're telling
me this is very exciting.

1258
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,620
So I've had to embrace my humility
that I don't understand what's coming.

1259
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,600
So people are afraid,

1260
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:22,960
people want regulations and rather
than take a position on whether we need

1261
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:23,980
regulations or not,

1262
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,510
we should all agree that the way to
create sound regulations is not to simply

1263
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:33,100
create a monopoly that has permanent
control over any particular industry and

1264
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,860
writes a bunch of rules,
passes a bunch of laws,

1265
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:40,720
accumulating thousands and thousands
of more laws. And you know, those,

1266
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:45,010
those more laws don't keep pace with
Moore's law to make upon, I mean,

1267
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:47,290
we have, uh, thousands,

1268
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:51,220
tens of thousands of regulations written
in the 70s that are still constraining

1269
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,520
innovation and those people were not
capable of predicting innovations that

1270
01:14:56,771 --> 01:15:00,190
we're going to come in the 21st century.
So if you want regulations,

1271
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,020
you need them as organic and dynamic
as the industries they regulate. Right?

1272
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:06,010
But how does that work?

1273
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:09,720
I mean, how does anyone calculate
the sort of regulations to,

1274
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:14,670
especially an incredibly
fluid and dynamic industry,

1275
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:19,590
the technology industry that most people
like say if you're trying to regulate,

1276
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:23,580
you know,
certain aspects of cell phone development.

1277
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:26,040
Most people just are just not
qualified to understand them.

1278
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:29,250
They just don't know what
they're talking about, right?

1279
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:33,420
You're talking about something that's
changing year to year. If you, if you, uh,

1280
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:38,190
made regulations as far as the development
of cell phones back when the Motorola

1281
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:41,880
Startac was state of the art and he tried
to apply those same innovations today

1282
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:44,760
with the Samsung galaxy s
five. I mean, Holy Shit,

1283
01:15:44,761 --> 01:15:46,380
you're dealing with a
completely different animal.

1284
01:15:46,381 --> 01:15:50,400
One of them is essentially a computer
that could run your whole life and check

1285
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:52,920
your heart rate and do
all kinds of nutty shit.

1286
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:57,921
Locate it's got a gps on it and can
tell you where to go and navigate you.

1287
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,200
And the other one was just a
simply a way to call people,

1288
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,380
right? And the, the humility. We have
to embrace this. We don't know, right?

1289
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,460
We don't know how to regulate
the future. Uh, and so if you,

1290
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,850
if you confront the fact there is no
human being that can pre irregulate the

1291
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:16,180
innovations that are
happening in a decade, you,

1292
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,020
you realize that the way to solve these
problems is not to simply create a

1293
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:23,230
permanent monopoly that you know,
rights.

1294
01:16:23,231 --> 01:16:27,130
What may more way more laws than it,
than it allows to go away.

1295
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,620
You need to break up those monopolies.
You need a competing jurisdictions.

1296
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,140
If, uh, uh, sort of like a, I
think of it as fluidly overlapping,

1297
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:41,820
uh, um, uh,

1298
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:45,800
a market of developing
regulations on the ocean, uh,

1299
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,620
initiated by the industries.

1300
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:52,990
And we see this in lots
of other industries where
regulations develop over time

1301
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:53,973
from within.

1302
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,580
A lot of people don't know that a lot of
the things we take for granted, aspirin,

1303
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:03,640
a knee operations, lots of
heart surgeries, they just
came from the ground from,

1304
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:06,470
from, from doctors experimenting. Um,

1305
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,650
so every country goes through this cycle.
It's,

1306
01:17:09,651 --> 01:17:13,960
it's such a constant cycle that it's
actually a cold. What is it called?

1307
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:14,900
Cardwell's law.

1308
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:18,800
There's like an official name for it
that you start out with these blossoming

1309
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:23,570
industries. Uh, there's some disaster
that happens that causes regulation.

1310
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:28,430
In the case of medicine, it
was the thalidomide scandal
that happened, you know,

1311
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,140
decades ago.

1312
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,400
So then these regulations come in
place to protect people from disasters.

1313
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:38,480
But by creating a monopoly
of regulation production,

1314
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,680
the regulations just accumulate and
accumulate and none of them ever go away.

1315
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,500
So you, the, the, uh,

1316
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:50,060
the bureaucracy rides on this wave of
innovation and then it starts dragging it

1317
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:54,260
down because there's just no incentive
for the regulators to cut back on their

1318
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:57,080
regulations and you ended up killing
the goose that lays the golden egg.

1319
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,003
But essentially

1320
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:02,000
the balancing act is between
safety and innovation. Right?

1321
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:03,210
That's the balancing act when,

1322
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:07,490
especially when you talk about things
like thalidomide, um, how do you,

1323
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,340
how do you sort of manage that?

1324
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:15,080
How do you manage the balancing act of
safety and innovation? Because in the,

1325
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:19,550
in terms of especially some
untested medical procedure,

1326
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:24,170
like I have a friend who, um,
got a stroke from Vioxx was some,

1327
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,350
some, uh, arthritis medication.
And you know, I was a young guy.

1328
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:31,190
He got a stroke.
It's pretty crazy.

1329
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:34,640
And they pulled it off the market and
now it's illegal and it was lawsuits and

1330
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:36,530
all this jazz.
But what,

1331
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:41,560
what do you do to ensure
that one of those things, uh,

1332
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:46,570
the, the most beneficial, whether it's
like the most beneficial, innovative, uh,

1333
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,030
technology arises or do you,
you know,

1334
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:53,330
err on the side of caution at all costs
and make sure that no one becomes a

1335
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:57,980
victim of some emerging idea that
hasn't been vetted out yet? The,

1336
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:01,690
we have a monopoly. They ere strongly in
the side of the precautionary principle.

1337
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:06,010
So the, the, uh, regulators
are in an impossible position.

1338
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,840
They have no way of evaluating all the
new stuff that, that comes online. Uh,

1339
01:19:10,841 --> 01:19:12,850
they don't,
they just don't have the resources.

1340
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:16,870
So they have to do it in consultation
with the dominant industries who

1341
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:21,400
invariably lean them towards, uh, you
know, don't allow this innovation through.

1342
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:25,240
What if a disaster happens and regulators
are blamed for disasters and they

1343
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:27,410
don't get credit for through all
the innovations that come, I'm

1344
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,680
through.
But on the flip side,

1345
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,990
aren't the people that are
coming up with these innovations,

1346
01:19:30,991 --> 01:19:35,991
wouldn't they try to influence them to
any regulatory body to let them slide

1347
01:19:36,631 --> 01:19:41,580
through because he's be
extremely profitable and wouldn't
they say, hey, you know,

1348
01:19:41,581 --> 01:19:44,440
this is all safe when maybe in
fact it hasn't. And how them,

1349
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,750
there've been a bunch of
different medications that
have been released onto the

1350
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:51,210
mark of it turned out like I remember,
um,

1351
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,590
fen phen you remember that show people?
Uh, I remember this girl, she was about,

1352
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,300
she was a pretty girl, but she was like,
man, I'm 30 pounds plus overweight.

1353
01:20:00,301 --> 01:20:03,510
And then one time I saw her and it
wasn't that long. It was, you know,

1354
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:06,840
a few months later and all of a sudden
she's as skinny little bombshell. Yeah.

1355
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,070
I like,
what the fuck is going

1356
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,090
on? I'm like, what'd you do? Oh,
I'm on phen phen six months later,

1357
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:16,320
heart problems, all these health
issues. She balloons up again.

1358
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,790
But I guess I would on Finfin
too. Yes, it was. It wasn't easy,

1359
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:24,930
but we should confront the fact like
our minds always go to this bad story.

1360
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:29,100
And so we see the thalidomide
baby right from the 60s,

1361
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,560
but we don't see the tens
of thousands of people,

1362
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,320
hundreds of thousands and some
estimate even more than that,

1363
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:39,540
that have died as the result of medical
innovations that are available, uh,

1364
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:43,530
often in other countries and are already
approved that are not approved say in

1365
01:20:43,531 --> 01:20:48,150
the United States. Right.
Uh, so we don't need to,

1366
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:52,050
you and I are not going to agree on a
balancing act and impose it on the world,

1367
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,780
but we should recognize
that there's a cycle,

1368
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:58,920
that it starts out being protective and
then it becomes over protective and then

1369
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:02,370
it prevents and quashes innovation.
And when it's a monopoly,

1370
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:06,090
it never innovate.
It never stops writing new rules.

1371
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,720
And once it's controlled
by dominant interests, uh,

1372
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:13,980
new people that don't have $1 billion
or 10 years to wait to get their drugs

1373
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:18,840
through the process. And that is the, the
conservative estimate. 10 years. Yeah,

1374
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,300
10 years.
Um,

1375
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:24,720
so all sorts of new players innovating
and interesting spaces, like for instance,

1376
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:29,670
in stem cells, uh, are
not able to, uh, compete.

1377
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:32,070
So we don't get the
innovations that they have.

1378
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,320
So there should be some regulation.

1379
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,500
There should be something and it
shouldn't just be the market decides.

1380
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,990
It shouldn't just be,
you know,

1381
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,620
we'll let when people start dying and
people stop using it and then, you know,

1382
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:46,350
now we know you can't. It can't be that,
right? I mean, the more time goes by,

1383
01:21:46,351 --> 01:21:50,580
the more I'm impressed with the power
of the market to, to regulate itself.

1384
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,870
But in terms of medical things, I mean,
the people will become victims. I mean,

1385
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:59,010
the market will regulate itself, but is,
are you, are you comfortable making that,

1386
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:01,050
that distinction?

1387
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:06,530
I think right now we're victims of
being denied the innovations that are

1388
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:11,190
available that will let her held up or
preventing innovators from discovering

1389
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:15,770
new things. Um, and you know, if you,

1390
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:16,770
you know,

1391
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:21,030
the same reason you put out a product
that isn't poison and you put effort into

1392
01:22:21,031 --> 01:22:24,030
your, um, podcasts at the
beginning to assure people,

1393
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,040
I want to build a relationship with you,
and if you don't like it,

1394
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,340
I'm going to give you your money back.
That's, that's a kind of regulation.

1395
01:22:29,341 --> 01:22:32,880
Like you're incentivized
to provide a good service.

1396
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,130
If you put something out to kill somebody,
you're in a,

1397
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:36,180
you're in a lot of trouble.

1398
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:41,390
And I think people underestimate the
power of that kind of market force to

1399
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:46,050
incentivize people to not poison
their patients. I agree with you.

1400
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:48,480
But then even with all
the regulation in place,

1401
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:50,820
you still have this
doctor Oz type situation.

1402
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,630
You still have someone who's profiting
off of something that doesn't do Jack

1403
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:58,140
Shit and is on television calling
it a miracle. Yeah. You know,

1404
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:02,340
so I've been waiting for Doctor Oz to
go down and I, I'd be, I'd be curious,

1405
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:07,750
which came first was it
was, uh, a journalist, uh,

1406
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,720
exposing him and then,
uh,

1407
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:14,650
governments came in and snapped him
down. I don't know what happened. I mean,

1408
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:15,720
our idea is always that

1409
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:20,280
it's doctors, it's A. Dot. It was actually
a medical student that chased it down.

1410
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,660
There was a whole article about it
that was on, um, here, I'll pull it up.

1411
01:23:24,661 --> 01:23:25,590
Medical student.

1412
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,700
So that, that, if that's true,

1413
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,430
that's an example of a market
regulation that occurred.

1414
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:34,080
Right. But how many people got
fleeced before that happened?

1415
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:38,320
Meet the medical student who wants to
bring down Doctor Oz. This is the guy, um,

1416
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,173
who,
uh,

1417
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:44,360
his name is Benjamin Maser
and Benjamin Maser is a,

1418
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,230
the student that saw,

1419
01:23:46,231 --> 01:23:49,350
I guess he was watching all these
different claims and he's like,

1420
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:53,610
this is all horse shit. So
he, um, he chased it down.

1421
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,060
Yeah. And Doctor Oz. I mean, he's a good
example of the point I'm trying to make.

1422
01:23:58,061 --> 01:23:59,920
I mean,
he's in a regulatory structure.

1423
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:04,750
He's completely ensconced and what
he was doing wasn't stopped. It took,

1424
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,520
uh, someone, you know,

1425
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,350
coming from the ground up and analyzing
and himself probably a competitor and

1426
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:16,210
exposing them as a fraud. I don't
know if it's hurt his career. Um,

1427
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,630
but I'm sure people are reacting
against him. This is a good thing.

1428
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,220
So we're describing, uh, the essence
of a market regulation right here.

1429
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:28,300
I has the, has anyone from the
government come in and find Doctor Oz?

1430
01:24:28,301 --> 01:24:29,380
Has he been imprisoned?

1431
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:33,780
Well, I know he was brought in front
of Congress. Aha. Yeah, it was a,

1432
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,460
it was a big story. It was all
over the news, but he was, uh, uh,

1433
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:43,230
on that, uh, what's that show? Um, the new
HBO show, the gentleman with the glasses,

1434
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:47,440
John Oliver, John Oliver
did a whole piece on, uh,

1435
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:52,020
on Doctor Oz and Dr Oz being brought in
front of Congress and Doctor Oz saying

1436
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:57,021
one thing on his television show and then
saying completely contradictory there.

1437
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:01,230
Dr Oz grilled and Congress had
missed admits weight loss products.

1438
01:25:01,231 --> 01:25:03,780
He touts don't pass scientific muster.

1439
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,750
So we're, we're looking at, I mean,

1440
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,880
we're looking at examples
of market regulation. Uh,

1441
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,720
I'm not even going to take a hard
stance that we don't need any, uh,

1442
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,080
regulations by, you know,
a central authority.

1443
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,490
I'm maybe going to take
a hard stance on that.

1444
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:24,080
I'm asking people to look at the power
of these kinds of things to regulate

1445
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:27,170
itself. And the problem with, uh,

1446
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:31,010
just accumulating thousands and thousands
of rules that prevent anyone from

1447
01:25:31,011 --> 01:25:33,920
trying something new.
And that's the situation we're in.

1448
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:39,260
Yeah. I mean, I'm not a big
government guy. I'm not a
fan of big fan of government,

1449
01:25:39,261 --> 01:25:43,430
but it's just the devil's
advocate position I think
has to be sort of addressed

1450
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:48,431
in these sort of scenarios because I
think there is the potential for fuckery.

1451
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,540
And it's like how do you protect citizens
from things that they're not entirely

1452
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:54,374
educated in?

1453
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:58,790
What laws do you establish that
protect people from someone?

1454
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,880
Victimizing someone with some sort of
an unproven product. Like, you know,

1455
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:07,400
bad luck, job medicine that
leaves people crippled. There's,

1456
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:08,910
there's that out there.
Yeah.

1457
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,920
How do you deal with that and this
seasteading world and how do you keep,

1458
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,720
you know,
how do you keep order?

1459
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:16,450
Well,
it's the same way.

1460
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:19,570
It's the same reason I don't put
out a book with no words in it.

1461
01:26:19,571 --> 01:26:22,510
And you don't put out a podcast
with just a bunch of Farts,

1462
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,200
right? Uh, yeah. I mean, we,

1463
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:31,750
we don't have monopoly
control over what we do.

1464
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,570
There's other authors competing
to get you to read their books.

1465
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:37,990
There's other podcasters competing to get
me to listen to them and I listened to

1466
01:26:37,991 --> 01:26:39,570
you instead.
Uh,

1467
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:45,130
it's not about standing is not about
here's the list of rules we're going to

1468
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:46,240
impose on the ocean.

1469
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:50,050
It's confronting human nature and
there's always potential for fuckery.

1470
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:51,310
People do shitty things.

1471
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:54,880
And the way to solve that problem is
not to just take some of those shitty

1472
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:57,970
people and give them absolute
power over everybody else.

1473
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,060
And then they promised to make
everyone behave better. Uh,

1474
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:06,090
I think governments will evolve and
innovations will occur if there's

1475
01:27:06,191 --> 01:27:11,020
decentralized power among multiple people
who can only profit and be selfish by

1476
01:27:11,021 --> 01:27:12,730
finding ways to serve
and please each other.

1477
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,320
And that includes producing
regulations by which we behave.

1478
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:18,401
That's fascinating.

1479
01:27:18,401 --> 01:27:23,401
So what you're essentially doing is
you're providing a method for new

1480
01:27:25,211 --> 01:27:30,040
civilizations to innovate. You're
not proposing any sort of guidelines.

1481
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:35,070
You're not proposing any sort of
a new structure for government,

1482
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:38,890
new structure for finances.
What you're doing is you,

1483
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,960
you are sort of opening up the door and
allowing a wide variety of people to

1484
01:27:45,191 --> 01:27:49,450
come through and allow the
best ideas to float to the top.

1485
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:53,230
Yeah. Seasteading is not about seizing
power from your political opponents.

1486
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:57,880
It's about seeding power to your
political opponents to try their ideas

1487
01:27:57,881 --> 01:28:01,300
elsewhere, to see if they can create
something that will surprise you.

1488
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:06,310
And you can laugh at the fiascos if
you want. Uh, but the more experiments,

1489
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,400
the more likely we are to
discover solutions. And that's,

1490
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:12,460
that's the truth of politics.
You know,

1491
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,460
society is more complex
than this microphone.

1492
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:18,970
I can't design this microphone.
Uh,

1493
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,620
but I think I can design society through
my political opinions and the only tool

1494
01:28:23,621 --> 01:28:24,770
I have to do that is for.

1495
01:28:24,771 --> 01:28:28,360
So that forces me to fight over who's
going to control the government,

1496
01:28:28,361 --> 01:28:31,600
to force other people who disagree
with me to do what I want.

1497
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:35,020
I don't think anyone
knows how to run society.

1498
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:39,460
I think the solutions to humanity's
deepest challenges are discovered,

1499
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:43,210
uh, and they're discovered by lots
of people trying lots of crazy ideas.

1500
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:47,720
Well, I think one of the big issues in
society is what I call the quantity of

1501
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:52,130
variables is that when you have
a very small group of people,

1502
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:56,660
the variables are not that large.
And you can handle 20 people.

1503
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:59,750
If we had a relationship with um,

1504
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:03,450
19 other folks and we were all
living together on a, you know,

1505
01:29:03,451 --> 01:29:07,530
a large patch of land that had a good
amount of natural resources where that no

1506
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,820
one had to worry about starving and death.

1507
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:10,770
Why someone else lived high on the hog.

1508
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:15,030
If everyone was even with the distribution
of natural resources and wouldn't be

1509
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:16,830
that hard,
they wouldn't be a lot of conflict.

1510
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:22,400
The real conflict comes when you have a
quantity of variables when you have 350

1511
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:24,810
million people and then you
have things like immigration,

1512
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:28,960
you have things like the stock market,
you know,

1513
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:34,150
the things like do you know weird things
that go down in terms of loans and

1514
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:41,751
terms of credit cards and there's so many
variables that that's when it becomes

1515
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:47,811
incredibly difficult to manage a society
when no one person can be aware of all

1516
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:49,531
the variables.

1517
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:52,400
The quantity of variables gets
outside of the realm of comprehension.

1518
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:53,320
Yes.

1519
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:57,310
And everything that works out well for
us is outside the realm of comprehension.

1520
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:01,660
I, I could not possibly make this table
or that water bottle or that computer.

1521
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:04,900
You can make this table. I know the
dude made it. It's not that hard. Okay.

1522
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:07,360
Well I wouldn't know where to get the
wood. I wouldn't know how to make it.

1523
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,490
So there's no varnish. This is raw. That's
why it's called coffee stains. Yeah.

1524
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,840
You could, uh, you could figure this
out, but I know what you're saying.

1525
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:16,630
I wouldn't be able to make, you wouldn't
be able to make the microphone. Yes.

1526
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:20,110
I think you make the table. I couldn't
make the microphone. You're a smart dude.

1527
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:25,350
And uh, I appreciate how
the solutions, uh, emerge.

1528
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:27,460
They're not, you know,
imposed by somebody.

1529
01:30:27,461 --> 01:30:32,461
They emerge from the kind of global
ecology of voluntary transactions that

1530
01:30:33,221 --> 01:30:37,420
produce the solutions. And the more
people you have trying different things,

1531
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:40,150
the more peacefully they can
pick compete in the market,

1532
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:42,460
the more likely these
solutions already would emerge.

1533
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,510
And we need to update the governance,
the technology of governance,

1534
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:50,350
just like other technologies.
And we can't do that through monopolies.

1535
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,280
Is this something that you do full time?
I do it full time.

1536
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:57,100
You're involved in seasteading fulltime?
Yes,

1537
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:01,060
and it's the first real job I've ever had.
So I've always been a writer.

1538
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:03,850
I tell stories.
I started out as a novelist.

1539
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:08,710
I eventually became a science writer
once I was captivated by the seasteading

1540
01:31:08,711 --> 01:31:09,544
story.

1541
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:14,230
Once I met the people I called
Aqua panners with all their ideas,

1542
01:31:14,231 --> 01:31:18,550
I realize this is the most important
story I could possibly tell. Uh, so I,

1543
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,960
you know,
I've written the book,

1544
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:23,350
it's going to come out next year
about seasteading, but I, I got,

1545
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:26,560
I became such a sea Vangelis
I talked about it so much.

1546
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:31,390
You have so many of those blue jobs.
See Evangelist.

1547
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,960
Yeah. Aqua openers. Yeah. I'm a
professional bullshit artists.

1548
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:39,490
The nerds in Silicon Valley need me
to sell their shit to the, to the,

1549
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:41,260
to real people.
Um,

1550
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,940
so they kind of brought me on to the
seasteading institute to talk about

1551
01:31:45,941 --> 01:31:47,350
seasteading. I, you know,

1552
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:51,010
they were smart enough to see that I'm
driven by it and I'm passionate about it.

1553
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,760
So, you know. And where does your money
come from, if you don't mind me asking?

1554
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:58,030
Well now I'm working for
a nonprofit and I, I,

1555
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:03,120
I'm a paid speaker and a nonprofit
is seasteading seasteading institute,

1556
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,800
which was founded by Peter
Teal and Pantry Friedman.

1557
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,190
So you get paid to evangelize,
see setting,

1558
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,940
essentially I get paid to,
you know,

1559
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,570
do lots of things with
regard to the nonprofit. Um,

1560
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:18,810
and the money comes from donations
be money comes from donations.

1561
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:23,810
So we have over a thousand donors or
a thousand people who have donated.

1562
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:29,200
Uh, and we have hundreds of volunteers
that have gotten involved and we have

1563
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:32,880
probably 85 ambassadors.
Uh,

1564
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:36,070
W I'm getting so many
ambassador applications right
now. I can't keep up with it.

1565
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:39,370
I want to be an ambassador.
Yeah, you, you should be,

1566
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,960
you shouldn't serve on our board or
something. So imagine that kind of time.

1567
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,430
Imagine a regular middle class person
who donates money to the seasteading

1568
01:32:48,431 --> 01:32:53,060
institute. I mean, people get infected
with this idea. They realize it.

1569
01:32:53,061 --> 01:32:56,530
Rather than arguing about my political,
my particular political problem,

1570
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:02,220
I go deeper and realize it's the structure
itself that we just don't have the

1571
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:05,020
innovations. We just don't have, um,

1572
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,080
a numerous people experimenting
with new ideas. We got to,

1573
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:13,450
we got to go deeper and, and, and hit
restart on multiple small governments,

1574
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:17,380
micro countries on the sea,
and we'll discover solutions
we're not imagining now,

1575
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,500
just like the United States discovered
solutions that were not in the

1576
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:23,380
imaginations of monarchists
in previous centuries.

1577
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:28,570
So explain to me how this works.
Like if someone says,

1578
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:33,310
I think she's studying is a good idea.
Is there a Kickstarter page? Is there,

1579
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:35,980
uh, do you have a paypal link? I mean,

1580
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:40,120
how does someone donate to this
where it winds up being your income?

1581
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:43,390
We have a donation page on the website.
Uh,

1582
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:45,910
every time we send out our
newsletter to our fans,

1583
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:49,930
we put a little donation link
there. We accept bitcoin. Um, it's,

1584
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:52,980
it's pretty easy to donate
to the seasteading institute
if that's what you want

1585
01:33:52,981 --> 01:33:56,980
to do if you go to the website and are
inspired by it. And what is the website?

1586
01:33:57,190 --> 01:34:00,250
A seasteading.org and uh,
you know,

1587
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:03,400
I strongly recommend checking out
the eight grade moral imperatives,

1588
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:07,450
which is one of the problems
the seasteading institute
has had is that it's been

1589
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:09,970
very technical and it's talking to,
you know,

1590
01:34:09,971 --> 01:34:14,350
aquatic engineers and there's legal
scholars talking about stuff and people go

1591
01:34:14,351 --> 01:34:17,650
and they're kind of overwhelmed by the
information and they don't know where to

1592
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:21,920
start. So I've tried to popularize
the idea and create, you know,

1593
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:27,120
eight little videos explaining just
the basic angles from which people are

1594
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:30,900
approaching seasteading to solve global
challenges that people care about.

1595
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:36,030
So the eight great moral imperatives you
have as a video on seasteading and what

1596
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:38,110
is a, it's only a minute, right?

1597
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:41,290
Each one is probably about
five minutes on average. Uh,

1598
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,080
the introduction is a minute,
the introduction is a minute.

1599
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,080
And then you can click on
any of the eight and it's,

1600
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,390
and it's a list of things
like, do you, what do you see?

1601
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:51,310
If you name me something you care about,

1602
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:54,880
I can tell you about an aqua Opendoor
that's trying to solve that problem. Well,

1603
01:34:54,881 --> 01:34:58,010
let's click on the link. Jamie, go
to the eight great moral imperatives

1604
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,440
and let's just play the introduction.
Um,

1605
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:04,340
if you just Google the eight great
moral imperatives, it'll show up.

1606
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:06,350
It's the first, uh, the first link,

1607
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:11,351
but it's on seasteading.org and
there is a 53 second video that will,

1608
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:15,870
uh, sort of, uh, introduced
this idea. Got It.

1609
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:21,860
That that is the issue,
right? Moral imperatives.

1610
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,903
That's the issue.

1611
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:27,410
We got to get down past the divisive
political language and just talk about

1612
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:29,960
human values that, you know,
conservatives, liberals,

1613
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:34,370
Libertarians and anarchists and
everyone else shares for the most part.

1614
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,473
Let's hear this.

1615
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:40,670
When we listened to the sea,
we know what our moral imperatives are.

1616
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:46,490
Feed the hungry, enrich
the poor here, the sick,

1617
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:51,230
clean the atmosphere,
restore the oceans.

1618
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:56,450
Live in balance with nature,
power, civilization sustainably.

1619
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:57,853
Stop fighting.

1620
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:04,040
I want to tell you about eight aqua up
honeymooners who plan to fulfill these

1621
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:07,820
moral imperatives by building
floating cities on the seat.

1622
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:13,750
Click on the issue you care about below
and maybe we can convince you to join

1623
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,980
our growing seasteading community.

1624
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,000
What is the timeline on,

1625
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,940
on implementing this sort of a thing?
Like,

1626
01:36:23,941 --> 01:36:28,941
if you had to be realistic and you had
to make an estimate as to fuck how long

1627
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,830
between now and when there really
is a floating civilization.

1628
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,640
I've been, I've enjoyed. Um, well,

1629
01:36:37,641 --> 01:36:41,570
one way we can think about it is when
do we have to get one of these things

1630
01:36:41,571 --> 01:36:46,140
going? Uh, and I was very
impressed that the aqua partners,

1631
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:50,980
I interviewed like six of them,
independently cited 20, 50, uh,

1632
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,710
as a time where this is where we're
going to run out of fresh water. Uh,

1633
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:56,420
this is when we're going
to run out of phosphate.

1634
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:59,480
This is where we're going to reach peak
oil. You know, whatever people say.

1635
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,180
And you know,
I'm not qualified to judge whether 20,

1636
01:37:02,181 --> 01:37:07,070
50 really is a deadline for humanity,
like a pinch point. And in several, uh,

1637
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,500
key commodities,
humanity needs to survive.

1638
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,450
But so let's say we have no choice but
to find solutions to global problems by

1639
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:16,040
2050 and say,

1640
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:20,420
I'm saying we can solve these problems
by engaging the power of the sea. Uh,

1641
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:24,140
so that's, that's the
timeline. So I think,

1642
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:27,170
I hope by 2020 we'll have a demonstration.

1643
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:31,490
A see stead within the territorial
waters of a, of a host nation.

1644
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:35,180
And if we can hire some local people,
create some blue jobs,

1645
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:40,010
absorb a costal runoff, uh,
and turn that into algae,

1646
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:45,350
that'll attract more ideas.
Um, I'm hoping maybe, you know,

1647
01:37:45,351 --> 01:37:49,070
you can imagine 20,
35 you have something on the deeper ocean.

1648
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,240
People come up with a break water.

1649
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:55,920
We have people contacting us right now
about you can create a solid break water

1650
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,170
too to protect a city. Some nice. Yeah,

1651
01:37:59,171 --> 01:38:02,130
I'd have to be an incredibly cold
environment and apparently not.

1652
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,840
Apparently you can get one
in the tropical oceans.

1653
01:38:03,841 --> 01:38:05,310
I'm not even going to
go into detail on this.

1654
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:10,020
I'm using this as an example of like
qualified engineers that are coming to us

1655
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:12,420
with ideas for how to,
how to do this on the Osha.

1656
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:17,420
So you would use solar power to power
some sort of a freezing element that no,

1657
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:24,120
apparently I, I'll have to point
you to his, his proposal. I mean,

1658
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:28,440
apparently ice can sit for a very long
time if it's solid enough in even in

1659
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:31,290
tropical borders, but, but
whatever, it's just one idea.

1660
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:37,370
I like the Otec idea using the ocean as
a solar panel to replace fossil fuels.

1661
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,920
Uh, a key idea to think
about, uh, ocean crops.

1662
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:43,140
So something to think about.

1663
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:48,200
70% of the world's fresh water is used
for agriculture between like a quarter

1664
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,910
and a half of all land is used
for agriculture. Where we're,

1665
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:53,180
we've depleted the top soil,

1666
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:56,010
we're using up the freshwater
populations are going up,

1667
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,710
we're facing a water crisis by 2050.

1668
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:02,940
Then you think about the
fact that a algae crops, uh,

1669
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:07,920
see farms require no fresh
water whatsoever. They
require no soil whatsoever.

1670
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,520
Uh, and we haven't actually
reached pizza peak phosphate.

1671
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,630
We've just taken it out of the soil
and dumped it into the oceans. Well,

1672
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:19,500
what absorbs, uh, all these
nutrients that are the oceans? Well,

1673
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:24,240
uh, algae farms, so we can park.

1674
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:25,320
A lot of people are opposing that.

1675
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:28,620
We park a algae farms around
the dead zones off the coast of,

1676
01:39:28,621 --> 01:39:30,000
of various cities in the world.

1677
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:33,690
Absorb all that nutrient
and carbon pollution,

1678
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,810
turn it into food and fuel over the
long haul. Um, that's just one problem.

1679
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:41,480
Be Heavy metals though. I mean, when
you have you met artisan problem,

1680
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:45,330
things along those lines, like you would,
you would be feeding that to people.

1681
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:47,930
You can't extract that.
Well, you can't extract it.

1682
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:52,440
Apparently there's people trying
things with muscles and various natural

1683
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:57,120
organisms that remove these things from,
from uh, um, you know, there's the,

1684
01:39:57,150 --> 01:40:01,650
it's weird how many like bacteria and
small little creatures process this stuff

1685
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:04,200
and people are talking about
we need to farm on that level.

1686
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,700
We need to farm on these
tiny little levels.

1687
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:10,110
So you would get some sort of organisms
that take out the heavy metals and then

1688
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:14,670
the other organisms would eat the carbon
right and turn that into fuel. Well,

1689
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:19,410
people are trying to create these,
um, you know, cyclical little systems.

1690
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:23,250
They're already doing it on a small
scale, you know, involving muscles that,

1691
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:27,780
that uh, um, you know, filter
feeders. W with this kind of fish,

1692
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:28,890
with this kind of algae,

1693
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:33,840
algae haven't undergone all the
artificial selection that makes wheat,

1694
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:37,980
corn and soy so productive and
get allergies a lot healthier.

1695
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:42,230
And a lot of people react and they say,
eh, algae, I don't want to eat that. Uh,

1696
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:46,770
but most people don't know that algae is
already in most of the foods we eat. It.

1697
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:50,730
It's, it's a fertilizer that
nourishes the land crops we use.

1698
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:55,170
It's in toothpaste, it's in beer,
it's an ice cream. You know,

1699
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,100
Carrageenan and Aguilar,

1700
01:40:57,101 --> 01:41:00,160
and I don't even know how to pronounce
all these aspects of then seaweed as well.

1701
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:05,230
The seaweed is, is huge. Um, and it's
very healthy and it's very healthy.

1702
01:41:05,231 --> 01:41:08,500
It has a, it's probably the
healthiest plant in the world.

1703
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,340
It has all the amino acids,
depending on the species.

1704
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:16,960
A has a lot of fiber. You know, fish
don't synthesize their own Omega threes.

1705
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:21,130
They get it by eating algae. Um, and
when you consider that, you know,

1706
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:24,760
corn was this tiny little ugly
thing that no one wanted to eat.

1707
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:28,180
Wheat is this, if you showed
someone a wheat stalk, they'd say,

1708
01:41:28,181 --> 01:41:32,590
I don't want to eat that. Uh, but you
just a few generations of artists,

1709
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:37,020
official selection, you can create
all this marvelous stuff. We'd, uh,

1710
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,700
we can do the same thing with,
uh,

1711
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:42,490
with algae that we're already using
in our foods. And, uh, you know,

1712
01:41:42,491 --> 01:41:46,440
the bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation helped, uh,

1713
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,070
Ricardo Radulovich, the founder of the Sea
Gordon's project. He's big on creating,

1714
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:53,350
he wants to create a
seaweed farms on the sea.

1715
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:59,070
He mixed a seaweed flower
with wheat flour, uh,

1716
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:01,120
sending it to the developing world.

1717
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:04,270
It does a lot for malnutrition
among those people.

1718
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:09,570
There's so many ways you
can use the healthier plants
at the sea to feed people.

1719
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:14,520
Uh, and, and you don't need
to use fresh water. Uh,

1720
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:19,530
so a lot of people say agriculture needs
to become aquaculture and we can give,

1721
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,700
you know,
Kansas back to the songbirds.

1722
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,020
That's funny. Um, that's,
uh, it's a fascinating idea,

1723
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:31,070
the idea of seasteading and um,
it's,

1724
01:42:31,071 --> 01:42:35,940
it's also fascinating to try to reverse
the process that we've already begun as

1725
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:40,260
far as destroying the oceans as far as
the amount of pollution that were leaking

1726
01:42:40,261 --> 01:42:40,811
into the ocean,

1727
01:42:40,811 --> 01:42:43,890
as if that could actually benefit
some life forms in some sort of way.

1728
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:47,920
And then we could sort of turn that
back around and get something out of it.

1729
01:42:47,921 --> 01:42:48,754
And that way.

1730
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:51,910
Yeah. I mean [inaudible] has been the
keystone of the global carbon cycle,

1731
01:42:51,911 --> 01:42:55,630
you know, for three and a half billion
years, you know, it knows what it's doing.

1732
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:59,500
And we've been working against the carbon
cycle and just like screwing up the

1733
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:03,550
whole planet, we can turn that wheel
back around. If we base our food on,

1734
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:04,410
on the ocean,

1735
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:08,230
I've read something about dumping scrap
iron into the ocean to reaction Jane

1736
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:12,020
oxygenate the Ocean because
dumping scrap iron to the ocean,

1737
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:15,880
it would serve as a base for
algae to start growing on.

1738
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:16,780
Yes.

1739
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:21,780
So Patrick Takahashi and others propose
that for the OTEC supported plant ships

1740
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:25,390
that you, you might have
to seed some iron. I mean,

1741
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:29,410
there's ways this have to be tweaked
and when we get to this level of detail,

1742
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:30,990
I just refer you to,
you know,

1743
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:35,500
the experts who were talking about it
and we never know what's going to work.

1744
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:38,080
You know, all these people are
thinking about these ideas,

1745
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:40,000
experimenting with them on a small scale.

1746
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:44,320
All this hopeless or hopeful stuff is
going on like what you just described.

1747
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,850
And the idea is we need to open up this
frontier for people to experiment on.

1748
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:52,070
We need to allow the ocean, uh, to,

1749
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,560
to let civilization.

1750
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:58,790
We need to base civilization on the ocean
because the fact that so much of it,

1751
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:01,890
it's such a resource.
The ocean, uh, you know,

1752
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,560
most of the oxygen comes from the ocean.
Life comes from the ocean.

1753
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,270
Most of the oxygen comes from
the ocean as far as like,

1754
01:44:09,271 --> 01:44:14,190
like you mean seep seaweed
and things like that?

1755
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,233
Yeah.
I mean,

1756
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:19,200
seaweed forest make the world's rain
forests look like potted plants is what I

1757
01:44:19,201 --> 01:44:23,700
always say. When you consider like the
amount of carbon they store, the amount of

1758
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:29,010
oxygen they produce. Yeah. Wow.

1759
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:32,410
I know. I had no idea. I had
always assumed it was just forest.

1760
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:37,670
No, it's mostly, uh, ocean crops
that, uh, keep the world in balance.

1761
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:40,730
And the more, the more you, uh,

1762
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:45,470
forest the oceans with say,
seaweed crops,

1763
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:48,270
the more carbon to build their bio mass,

1764
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:50,630
they have to pull this carbon
and nutrient out of the water,

1765
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:54,440
which lowers the acidity of the ocean,
which is exactly what we need to do.

1766
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:59,090
The more carbon you pull out
of the ocean, the more, uh, uh,

1767
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:02,240
carbon the oceans pulls out of the air.
Um,

1768
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:07,340
so you could reverse the whole carbon
problem by just creating a massive seaweed

1769
01:45:07,341 --> 01:45:10,940
farms on the ocean. And people have
calculated about how much he would need.

1770
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:13,700
And it'd be the size of this
state of the size of this country.

1771
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:18,740
And nobody really knows. But the fact is,
if we start ramping this up, uh, we could,

1772
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:24,020
you know, soy, corn, wheat, it's
not that, not as healthy as like,

1773
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:24,950
as like seaweed bread.

1774
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:30,630
Isn't it amazing when you see issues
that pop up technological issues,

1775
01:45:30,841 --> 01:45:35,430
whether it's, uh, you know,
uh, pollution or what have you.

1776
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,960
And then the,

1777
01:45:36,961 --> 01:45:41,190
these innovations come along to try to
deal with the solutions or to try to

1778
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:43,290
create a solution for these issues.

1779
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:48,180
And it seems like that's one of the
things that people do, like they seem,

1780
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:52,290
it seems that people need to be in the
face of some sort of a problem to solve

1781
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:53,460
in order to truly innovate.

1782
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,390
And when you think of this Otec thing
and that this Otec thing happened during

1783
01:45:57,391 --> 01:46:01,530
the Carter administration, when the gas
problems were at the peak for that time,

1784
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:04,710
changed the motor industry,

1785
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:08,910
the automotive industry was forced to
make much more fuel efficient cars,

1786
01:46:08,911 --> 01:46:12,540
compact cars all came out of that,
you know, before the American cars,

1787
01:46:12,541 --> 01:46:17,430
these big V 10 pigs.
And then all of a sudden we had an issue.

1788
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:20,070
And then innovation
springs from that issue.

1789
01:46:20,490 --> 01:46:22,410
And you look at all the
things that's going on today.

1790
01:46:22,411 --> 01:46:26,740
Like there's a young man who
invented some sort of, uh, uh,

1791
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:31,770
at least a theoretical design to clean
up the plastic patch in the middle of the

1792
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:36,360
Pacific garbage patch. Boyan Slat, I
think is his name. I don't know his name,

1793
01:46:36,361 --> 01:46:41,280
but a amazing idea that in a short amount
of time would be able to filter out

1794
01:46:41,281 --> 01:46:44,490
all that plastic and then perhaps
that plastic could be reused.

1795
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:46,830
Perfect. Perfect idea. So yeah,

1796
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:50,280
the seasteading institute gets proposals
about to clean up the great garbage

1797
01:46:50,281 --> 01:46:54,990
patch, right? And as a generalist who
tries to put this all together, uh,

1798
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:56,700
someone described a,

1799
01:46:56,740 --> 01:47:00,720
an expert as someone who can describe to
you in great detail why something can't

1800
01:47:00,721 --> 01:47:04,890
be done. So I get humbled often
by experts that describe, well,

1801
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:05,970
that's never going to work.

1802
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:08,790
It's too hard to build a permanent
structure on the high seas.

1803
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:12,690
And here's all the reasons why I look
at all this esoteric language I use.

1804
01:47:12,691 --> 01:47:14,310
That intimidates you went
to thinking I'm right.

1805
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,840
And then a year and a half later,

1806
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:19,410
I find out shell prelude is building
the fucking thing on the ocean.

1807
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:22,220
So it turns out to Ken work.
Um,

1808
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:24,900
so buoyance a slat is an example of this.

1809
01:47:24,901 --> 01:47:29,901
So he designed this system to
basically clean up the garbage patch,

1810
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:32,160
the great [inaudible] pitch.
This is the system.

1811
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:36,360
And he had a huge Ted talk that went
viral and went all over the world.

1812
01:47:36,361 --> 01:47:40,440
And what's so remarkable about him as the
only 19 years old, after a few months,

1813
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,070
huge backlash,
uh,

1814
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:46,050
people who knew better started criticizing
him and saying he doesn't know what

1815
01:47:46,051 --> 01:47:49,080
he's talking about and people fall for
these stupid ideas. And I'm like, well,

1816
01:47:49,081 --> 01:47:52,440
that's kind of embarrassing. I'm glad
I didn't like feature him too much.

1817
01:47:52,441 --> 01:47:54,780
I guess he is just a kid who doesn't
know what he's talking about.

1818
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:57,840
So he rose to the challenge.
He got some funding,

1819
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:02,280
he's out there on the water experimenting
and now the backlash has backlash.

1820
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:04,920
Now people are saying, oh,
it is going to work. Uh,

1821
01:48:04,921 --> 01:48:08,670
we could ramp this up and clean the
great garbage patch. And guess what?

1822
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:13,440
Nobody knows. We don't know. All we
know is he's proposed this thing.

1823
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:15,510
It's attracting a lot of
brains to the problem.

1824
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,420
People are inspired to get it done.
There's a backlash.

1825
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:22,800
The backlash people were shown to be
demonstrated with an experiment on the

1826
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:24,270
water that they were mistaken.

1827
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:28,710
So he went out and did a small scale of
this and he was able to clean up some

1828
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:32,160
stuff.
So if we scale this up a little work look,

1829
01:48:32,161 --> 01:48:34,490
cause another problem that
won't work is it, it, it,

1830
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,420
it could even be a terrible idea.

1831
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:41,190
But by galvanizing and being a
lightening rod for this problem,

1832
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:46,490
it attracts new innovative minds to
update his solution and find the real

1833
01:48:47,011 --> 01:48:49,260
solution.
This is how the x prize works.

1834
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:53,930
One of the biggest issues with human
civilization in regards to the ocean.

1835
01:48:53,931 --> 01:48:56,480
It's overfishing. It's a huge, huge issue.

1836
01:48:56,900 --> 01:49:01,070
What ideas have been
proposed that makes sense,

1837
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:04,280
that you,
you're aware of that deal with that?

1838
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:05,790
Well, I spoke about, uh,

1839
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:09,330
Neil sims in the velella research
project a moment ago and I'm,

1840
01:49:09,331 --> 01:49:13,710
and I'm not doing justice to, to, to
what he's doing. So mobile fish cages,

1841
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:19,170
uh, and it blurs the line between
fish farming and wild fish.

1842
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:23,730
So fish farming gets a bad rap
because, you know, fish farms,

1843
01:49:23,731 --> 01:49:25,140
they're bolted to the coasts.

1844
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:28,650
The fish swim in their own
poop that can't go anywhere.

1845
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:31,440
They're not living normal lives.
Then you have to have, you know,

1846
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:33,210
Bile Fallon's and all this stuff.

1847
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:37,680
So he's just required us to completely
rethink what fish farming is.

1848
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,010
And he takes it out in the deep
ocean where it's below the water.

1849
01:49:41,011 --> 01:49:43,290
You can't even see it.
The,

1850
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,770
the cages float around in
Eddie's behind giant islands.

1851
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,460
The fish float around

1852
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:53,230
in there. Um, and there's, the
fish is healthy. It has no mercury.

1853
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:57,340
It's higher Omega three content
than the wild version of that fish.

1854
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,100
It's a totally new kind of fish,
a Kona [inaudible].

1855
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,160
Why is it higher in Omega
three than the wild form fish?

1856
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:07,630
Because apparently the fish live better,
uh, on the deep sea when they're like, uh,

1857
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:11,920
fed, uh, by humans periodically,
like the wild, the wild.

1858
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:13,630
I have no idea.
What are they feeding them?

1859
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:17,830
They're feeding them a mix
of a fish meal and soy.

1860
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:23,260
Uh, and then finishing it off
with fishmeal at the end. And, um,

1861
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,330
uh, Sashimi guys, a guy named Wong in, um,

1862
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,810
in Hawaii or declaring it,
you know, a great sashimi.

1863
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:34,750
They've had taste tests with his
fish where the experts can't tell the

1864
01:50:34,751 --> 01:50:37,720
difference between farm
fish and wild fish.

1865
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,690
So if this becomes profitable,

1866
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:45,730
you're talking about creating huge
numbers of fish, uh, on the oceans.

1867
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,470
And the problem is,

1868
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:51,190
is that we treat the oceans like a giant
Commons and we're like hunter gatherers

1869
01:50:51,191 --> 01:50:55,510
out there exterminating them.
Um, we're not farming fish,

1870
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:56,261
you know,

1871
01:50:56,261 --> 01:51:00,340
a hundred gatherers homosapiens left
Africa and just exterminated all the

1872
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:04,510
megafauna on every continent. You know,
hunting fish is not the way to go.

1873
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:09,070
We proved that with bisons mastodons,
even ducks. The way to, uh,

1874
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:12,490
increase the biomass of the oceans is the
way we've increased the biomass of the

1875
01:51:12,491 --> 01:51:14,860
land,
which is to farm animals.

1876
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:18,790
And Neil Sims is trying to do
this in a humane way. Well,

1877
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:21,650
what was done with bisons
is lack of regulation.

1878
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,530
What's been done with other animals,

1879
01:51:23,531 --> 01:51:28,060
game animals in this country is left
more dear in this country right now than

1880
01:51:28,061 --> 01:51:32,890
were there when Columbus landed. There's,
there's a way to manage wildlife.

1881
01:51:32,891 --> 01:51:34,840
There's a way to manage
certain amount of animals.

1882
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:39,220
The problem is if everyone was hunting,

1883
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:41,680
there would be no more wild animals.

1884
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:45,760
The reality of wild animals is there's
not enough wild animals in relationship

1885
01:51:45,761 --> 01:51:49,180
to the amount of people that are
here is 350 million Americans.

1886
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:52,360
They would require a lot of wild
animals if that's all we ate.

1887
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:55,600
There's a way though to regulate.

1888
01:51:55,660 --> 01:52:00,660
And what the problem I think is least
as it's been understood as it's been

1889
01:52:00,671 --> 01:52:01,540
explained to me,

1890
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:06,590
is that with fish you're dealing
with international waters.

1891
01:52:06,591 --> 01:52:09,400
So you're dealing with a bunch
of different nations. I mean,

1892
01:52:09,401 --> 01:52:13,060
they have an issue with the Japanese
crews that won't stop wailing.

1893
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:17,800
They wail under the false pretense of
doing research, scientific research,

1894
01:52:17,801 --> 01:52:22,600
and then sell the whale carcasses. Having
these, there's these boats that the,

1895
01:52:22,601 --> 01:52:23,580
um,
um,

1896
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:28,360
the sea shepherds have a attacked and
have shown like time and time again.

1897
01:52:28,361 --> 01:52:31,720
Like these guys are fucking wailing.
They're not doing any experiments.

1898
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:34,660
They're not doing scientific research.
But that's the loophole.

1899
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,700
The loophole is that these Japanese boats
can still kill whales as long as it's

1900
01:52:39,701 --> 01:52:43,200
for quote unquote scientific research.
So they're just killing whales. Right.

1901
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:46,130
You know, so the, the ocean,
that should not be a wild

1902
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,840
west. It should be civilization.
It should be a part of, yeah.

1903
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,290
Right. But if there's 7
billion people that want fish,

1904
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,900
we have no choice but to farm fish.
Right.

1905
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:59,770
It's like more than a billion people
get their main sustenance from fish and

1906
01:52:59,771 --> 01:53:02,100
that is going to go up. I mean, uh,

1907
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:06,400
Lockheed Martin is
actually, um, funding, uh,

1908
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,750
Neil Sims is, uh, experiments, uh,

1909
01:53:09,751 --> 01:53:13,330
as is like the copper industry and all
these different players are coming in

1910
01:53:13,331 --> 01:53:17,470
because they see the future of food is
in aquaculture. I mean, a lot of this is,

1911
01:53:17,471 --> 01:53:20,710
we get, we have no choice. It's
like we, you know, over the last,

1912
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:24,890
what 50 years or century have exterminated
like 90% of the fish, the sessions,

1913
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,720
it's like we either we turn that
around and we're going to have hunger.

1914
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:33,710
Is there a way that they can somehow
another repopulate the wild populations of

1915
01:53:33,711 --> 01:53:38,540
these fish, like tuna have drastically
reduced. Did you see Jiro Dreams of Sushi?

1916
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:41,680
No. Documentary.
Fascinating documentary. Um,

1917
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:45,810
one of the sad aspects of it as he talked
about what it used to be like, it's,

1918
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:50,820
it's about a guy who's been doing sushi
forever and it's all about his obsession

1919
01:53:50,901 --> 01:53:54,410
with creating the perfect dishes and
it really interested, well, maybe I did

1920
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:58,070
see that. Is, is it set in? Um, it's,
it's just about this one Sushi chef.

1921
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,200
I watched that with my wife.
We had mesmerized.

1922
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:04,800
Yeah. Fascinating, right? Yeah.
The old man in Tokyo, um, in, uh,

1923
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:07,860
in the subway station. He's
a very small place. Um,

1924
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:10,340
I thought it was so my wife
wanted me to watch, I'm like,

1925
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:12,930
I'm not Washington fucking guide,
make Sushi. He gives a shit.

1926
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:17,030
And then more and more people told me,
it's not about that. You gotta see,

1927
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:19,410
you gotta check it out.
And I watched it. Uh,

1928
01:54:19,411 --> 01:54:24,411
but the saddest thing was like showing
photos of the fish markets from the 1950s

1929
01:54:24,991 --> 01:54:27,960
and sixties,
and there was just fish everywhere.

1930
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:31,500
And he was just talking about the
wide variety and the large numbers.

1931
01:54:31,501 --> 01:54:36,480
Enormous tuna were everywhere. It was just
insane. And now it's one 10th of that.

1932
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:40,540
Yeah. And, and, and, um, Neil
sims refers to himself as a,

1933
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:44,230
as a passionate environmentalist
and he went back and read about fish

1934
01:54:44,231 --> 01:54:46,740
populations in the world and you know,

1935
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,980
he's a great fish kind of sword fish
lover. And when he talks about fish,

1936
01:54:49,981 --> 01:54:53,740
he salivates he's so excited about how
they behave and what they do and, and uh,

1937
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:54,311
yeah,
you like,

1938
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:57,940
you can hear the pain in his voice when
he talks about what the fish populations

1939
01:54:57,941 --> 01:55:01,450
were like in 1920 and we can't I long ago.
Yeah.

1940
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:05,740
And we can't keep treating the oceans
like a toilet and like a thing where we

1941
01:55:05,741 --> 01:55:10,360
can just hunt as much fish as we want.
The fisheries have to be managed. Uh,

1942
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:15,190
fish farms can help with that and we
have to repopulate the oceans with fish.

1943
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:20,080
Yeah. Not just farm fish, but wild fish.
Like, that was what the question was,

1944
01:55:20,081 --> 01:55:20,670
was he,

1945
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:25,670
do you know of any methods that are
being contemplated for repopulation

1946
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:27,620
repopulating the wild fish?

1947
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:32,870
The only way it would work is if it's
profitable to have lots of wild fish.

1948
01:55:34,290 --> 01:55:35,050
Um,

1949
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:35,591
so true.

1950
01:55:35,591 --> 01:55:40,000
And then you would also have to stop
certain people from different nations.

1951
01:55:40,001 --> 01:55:43,860
You'd have to have some sort of an
agreement with a fisherman everywhere.

1952
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:48,900
Yes. And, and people don't, don't realize
the, the oceans already, you know,

1953
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:53,770
uh, there's like the United Nations
law of the seas, there's all these, um,

1954
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:57,630
legal frameworks that already operate on
the ocean and allow people to interact

1955
01:55:57,631 --> 01:55:59,540
with each other and there's,
you know,

1956
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:04,440
overlap in the jurisdictions and
it mostly gets worked out and it's,

1957
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,720
Eh, the oceans is, you know,

1958
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:11,850
sort of civilized and it's ready for
the next layer of legal evolution. Uh,

1959
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:16,700
which I think is a stewards of the ocean,
I think.

1960
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:20,880
I think we're ready for a kind of a new
evolution in market based evolution on

1961
01:56:20,881 --> 01:56:24,860
the water. I'm a marketplace
regulation on the water and,

1962
01:56:24,861 --> 01:56:27,420
and sovereign nations market based.

1963
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,300
But the problem is that's how people
feed their families, make their profit,

1964
01:56:31,301 --> 01:56:34,300
run their business. They run their
business by pulling fish out of the water.

1965
01:56:34,301 --> 01:56:36,130
You would have to tell them
you're going to make less money.

1966
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:40,500
Yeah. Pulling less fish. Right.
And that's hard to do. Yes.

1967
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:44,010
And sims tells a story about
trying to work with, you know,

1968
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:48,600
poor fishermen in the Cook Islands
and how there's just an incentive for

1969
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:53,430
everyone to just take as much fish as
they can out of the comments. Um, and,

1970
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:56,640
and so it's like if I don't grab the fish,
the other, the guys I'm competing with,

1971
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:59,070
good.
Grab the fish and you can say yes,

1972
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:02,460
but we'll need more fish for
next year if you killed them all.

1973
01:57:02,461 --> 01:57:06,420
Now we won't have any fish next season.
You know, so we have to have rules.

1974
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:10,290
But then the complex reasons
why people behave, you know,

1975
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:11,820
follow the rules and why they don't.

1976
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:16,050
And the problem with it just being a
Commons where everyone's competing to get

1977
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:20,880
fish out, everyone has an
incentive to cheat. So what,

1978
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:25,890
what is the means by which you get people
to cooperate? To preserve the fish.

1979
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:30,510
Longterm resources have to be managed
or they go away. Uh, the, the,

1980
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:34,410
the present way we're dealing with
the oceans is obviously not working

1981
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:37,800
right. And we would have to make
some sort of an agreement worldwide.

1982
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:41,970
And that seems to me to be one of the
most difficult aspects of trying to fix

1983
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:43,350
the whole po whole problem.

1984
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:48,740
I think so, but it's, it's gotta be
worked out. Otherwise we'll run it a fish.

1985
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:53,210
Yeah. And I hope they don't run
out of fish first and then say,

1986
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:57,770
what do we do? You know, how do we fix
this? Right. I mean, even in areas where

1987
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,380
they have brought back certain animals,
um,

1988
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:06,830
to the animals that were
on the verge of extinction,

1989
01:58:06,831 --> 01:58:08,240
you still have to worry about poaching.

1990
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:12,830
And I was still an issue all throughout
Africa with a lot of endangered species.

1991
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,790
Obviously we know about this with
the rhino that even to this day,

1992
01:58:16,791 --> 01:58:20,120
even though all the knowledge that
everyone knows that rhinos are dying off,

1993
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:21,320
there's still poaching.

1994
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:22,160
Yeah.

1995
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:27,160
And I was reading a recent explanation
lately about elephants in Africa and they

1996
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:31,400
were contrasting Kenya with
a nation that's next to it.
And I forget what it is.

1997
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:34,370
And you know, in, in one country,

1998
01:58:34,371 --> 01:58:38,330
the populations of elephants went up
and in another country the population of

1999
01:58:38,331 --> 01:58:43,210
elephants went down. And it was kind
of counterintuitive. Um, and you know,

2000
01:58:43,211 --> 01:58:43,351
the,

2001
01:58:43,351 --> 01:58:46,120
the place where the population
of elephants went down
was where there was just

2002
01:58:46,121 --> 01:58:47,860
like a government monopoly controlling,

2003
01:58:47,861 --> 01:58:51,820
which was the easily corrupted the
place where the populations went up.

2004
01:58:51,821 --> 01:58:55,390
And it would, it would, it was sort of
pseudo public but also privately owned.

2005
01:58:55,630 --> 01:59:00,630
So they'd sell a certain
amount of poaching where it
becomes somebody cash cow

2006
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:06,010
to have elephants there. Cause you can't
just protect elephants and allow the, uh,

2007
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:09,460
populations to grow as much as
you want. Right. So, I mean,

2008
01:59:09,461 --> 01:59:14,461
we can drill down and discuss
how regulations can evolve
to increase populations

2009
01:59:15,641 --> 01:59:18,830
of wild animals in a manageable way.
Um,

2010
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:23,050
but you and I don't need to settle it now.
The fact is we need more solutions.

2011
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,350
Well,
Africa is a very interesting analogy.

2012
01:59:26,351 --> 01:59:30,700
It's very interesting to compare what
they've done with wild animals in Africa

2013
01:59:30,701 --> 01:59:32,740
to what,
what needs to be done in the ocean.

2014
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,970
Because there were many animals in Africa
that were on the verge of extinction

2015
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,940
and now are quite,
quite common.

2016
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:44,020
But they're quite common in these high
fence operations where they hunt them.

2017
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:46,000
It's really weird,

2018
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:50,200
like the populations of boomed on a lot
of animals that were almost in danger

2019
01:59:50,201 --> 01:59:54,550
just a few decades ago.
And now there's many of them,

2020
01:59:54,551 --> 01:59:57,850
like the highest numbers they've ever
recorded in Africa and some of these

2021
01:59:57,851 --> 02:00:02,260
species, but they're in these high fence
operations and that's a weird sort of a

2022
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:07,180
contradictory situation when they've
become manageable, profitable,

2023
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:10,660
they've, they've become a resource. Yeah.

2024
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:14,350
It'd become a resource that you
can manage. And once that happens,

2025
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,850
that's when their populations go up.
But then everyone's like, but no,

2026
02:00:18,851 --> 02:00:23,770
they're hunting them. Yes,
but there's more of them, but
they're killing them. Yes,

2027
02:00:23,771 --> 02:00:28,630
but there's more of them to kill. Right,
okay. It's not as a, it's a weird line.

2028
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:31,750
And again, it's, it's the superstition
that I, as a cease dinner,

2029
02:00:31,751 --> 02:00:32,800
I'm always trying to get around.

2030
02:00:32,801 --> 02:00:37,801
The way you solve a problem is to create
a monopoly of Nice people who will make

2031
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:42,850
everyone else be good. Uh, and we're,
we're talking about the same thing.

2032
02:00:42,851 --> 02:00:46,840
So some of the elephant populations
that are controlled by say a government

2033
02:00:46,841 --> 02:00:47,800
monopoly and nothing else,

2034
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:52,300
those populations keep going down because
there's no one really incentivized to

2035
02:00:52,301 --> 02:00:56,590
protect against poaching. And you can,
if you, if your work for that monopoly,

2036
02:00:56,591 --> 02:00:58,270
you essentially have ownership over this.

2037
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:01,360
So there's all sorts of reasons
to take payoffs and bribes.

2038
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:06,130
It's also problem where the elephants,
um, uh, interact with people and,

2039
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:09,960
and elephants are dangerous and elephants
knocked down trees. Um, you know,

2040
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,370
elephants will,
will attack people.

2041
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:16,600
And then in these other places in Africa
where I guess you described them as

2042
02:01:16,601 --> 02:01:19,520
high fence operations,
you make it so that a,

2043
02:01:19,521 --> 02:01:23,540
a stable elephant population is profitable
to the people who live there. Right?

2044
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:25,540
So they say, all right,
we'll have like 5%.

2045
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:29,750
We'll let people poach for a high number.
Well, they're not poaching. It's there.

2046
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:31,450
That's actually illegal legal hunting.

2047
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:35,220
I shouldn't say names. They pay like
$50,000 and they go kill an elephant.

2048
02:01:35,221 --> 02:01:36,420
It's kind of fucking crazy.

2049
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:40,490
Yeah. But then the people in
charge of that are like, okay, now,

2050
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:45,920
I mean there's either elephants or
hunted or elephants become overpopulated.

2051
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,900
Yeah. Um, so there has to be a way
that these populations are managed.

2052
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:55,070
It's not just a simple manner
of illegalizing the all
the killing of elephants.

2053
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:57,380
And this is the hard thing for
people to get their minds around.

2054
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:00,710
The hard thing for people to get their
minds around who love animals. Yes.

2055
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,300
If you really truly want these
animals to have large populations,

2056
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:07,190
you have to manage those populations.

2057
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:09,680
And that's not something that
anybody wants to hear. Yeah.

2058
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:12,970
And I love animals and my wife
is an animal fanatic. And,

2059
02:02:13,050 --> 02:02:16,340
and if we care about
animals continuing to exist,

2060
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:20,600
we have to confront the fact that you
don't just protect them and allow their

2061
02:02:20,601 --> 02:02:25,601
populations to exponentially grow until
they starve or come in contact with

2062
02:02:25,791 --> 02:02:27,950
villages and kill people.
Well, that's a problem.

2063
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:31,780
What we have in California with this,
this,

2064
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:36,840
the government has outlawed in California
killing of a lot of predators that are

2065
02:02:37,211 --> 02:02:41,440
in large populations now.
Like most particularly mount mines,

2066
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:45,640
there's a large population of mountain
lions in California now and subsequently

2067
02:02:45,641 --> 02:02:49,450
the deer population has dwindled.
They have dropped substantially.

2068
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:54,100
And there's a place that I go to
called to hone ranch on one waterhole.

2069
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:58,690
They have a trail camera that's photograph
16 different mountain lines. I mean,

2070
02:02:58,691 --> 02:03:00,160
that's fucking crazy.

2071
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:04,180
That's 16 different animals that are
killing something virtually every day.

2072
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:05,710
So every day,

2073
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:10,980
16 different mean killing machines and
mount line is a machine and they kill

2074
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:15,190
pigs, deer, elk, whatever
they can get ahold of.

2075
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:20,140
And they're just decimating the deer
population decimating, you know, any, any,

2076
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:24,100
any game animal they can get ahold
of and it's illegal to hunt them.

2077
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:27,220
And it's not regulated. It's
not, it's not being managed,

2078
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,960
it's not being managed correctly.

2079
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:31,090
And one of the reason is
because public opinion,

2080
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:35,050
public opinion based on
ignorance, they think, oh,

2081
02:03:35,051 --> 02:03:38,560
these asshole hunters want to
kill mountain lions. Well, no,

2082
02:03:38,561 --> 02:03:42,190
but you have to manage the
populations of all of these animals.

2083
02:03:42,191 --> 02:03:45,150
If we're going to be stewards
of the land you need,

2084
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:48,580
they all need to be kept in check
and they all need to be monitored.

2085
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:53,440
And it's not being done with these
specific predators just because of what I

2086
02:03:53,441 --> 02:03:55,240
believe is an ignorant public opinion.

2087
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:56,060
And I,

2088
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:59,910
and I agree with you and what people
are working so hard to do with elephants

2089
02:03:59,911 --> 02:04:00,721
and mountain lions,

2090
02:04:00,721 --> 02:04:04,320
it needs to be done with fish on
a massive scale and massive scale.

2091
02:04:04,590 --> 02:04:07,190
Bringing it back to what I care,
it should be a huge part of

2092
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:08,940
what the government and the,
you know,

2093
02:04:08,941 --> 02:04:11,760
like it should be a huge
part of what we planned for.

2094
02:04:11,761 --> 02:04:15,900
And as far as like looking towards
the future, I mean, look at how,

2095
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:19,800
what percentage of our diet is based
on seafood. It's gotta be enormous.

2096
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:21,060
It's a huge percentage.

2097
02:04:21,061 --> 02:04:24,160
And we don't even realize that when we
eat some broccoli or we eat, you know,

2098
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:28,230
a cow that, that the, uh, many
of the crops that, you know,

2099
02:04:28,231 --> 02:04:32,610
the cow ate or that came from the
bralette came from a allergy fertilizers,

2100
02:04:33,330 --> 02:04:37,740
you know, fuel feed and, um,

2101
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:42,570
food, uh, are, are very largely
supported by ocean crops.

2102
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:46,740
Do you live by the ocean? I,
yes, I do. You notion freak.

2103
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:50,640
You're like one of those dudes out
there. I'm an ocean freak. Yes. This,

2104
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:53,520
was this a part of your life always
or is this something that's sort of

2105
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:58,380
developed? Um, I love the outdoors.

2106
02:04:58,950 --> 02:05:02,670
I was an eagle scout. Uh,
I love Forrest as well.

2107
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,700
I do love being on the ocean.
I think I'd like to live on the ocean.

2108
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:08,190
I think the first, you know,
if we get a good stead going,

2109
02:05:08,191 --> 02:05:12,930
I'd consider living there. Um,
but yeah, I'm having a backyard.

2110
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:18,150
Sure. Ocean, I was just on
a boat, um, for, you know,

2111
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:22,440
10 days or something a few weeks ago in
the Galapagos Islands and man sitting on

2112
02:05:22,441 --> 02:05:26,490
a boat and looking at it to see, you want
to talk about contemplation, relaxation,

2113
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:30,840
you know, some nice breathing. It doesn't
take any discipline. It just happens.

2114
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:31,441
You know,

2115
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:36,441
the human mind I feel like is meant to
stare at fire and water and sky and then

2116
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:39,720
it gets you to in mountains and
it gets you in a good place. Yeah.

2117
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:41,340
Isn't that strange?
It's like these,

2118
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:46,350
it's essentially artwork that's
designed by the universe. You know,

2119
02:05:46,351 --> 02:05:49,350
the thing that people love about artwork
is you get to look at something like

2120
02:05:49,351 --> 02:05:52,750
that, boot, that boot over there. You
look at it and go, wow, that's amazing.

2121
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:56,130
That's really cool. If somebody built
that and that's so cool. Look at some,

2122
02:05:56,131 --> 02:05:57,100
it may not.
Well,

2123
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:01,500
what a mountain is essentially
the most incredible artwork ever,

2124
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:05,070
but it's completely natural. It's there
all the time and no one can own it.

2125
02:06:05,071 --> 02:06:07,560
And you can move, move around it,
look at it from different angles,

2126
02:06:07,561 --> 02:06:10,500
but it's essentially just like artwork
and gives you the same feeling that you

2127
02:06:10,501 --> 02:06:15,140
get when you look at a beautiful painting,
but magnified tenfold. A thousand fold.

2128
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:20,040
I think so. I mean, we were staying
in a place in Colorado, my wife and I,

2129
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:23,640
and I spent hours staring at a big man,
like it was a TV.

2130
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:26,650
So that's deep in me. It was just, I,

2131
02:06:26,730 --> 02:06:29,460
I couldn't believe the comfort I got from
sitting on the porch and just looking

2132
02:06:29,461 --> 02:06:33,120
at this magnificent thing in
Colorado. Yeah. Um, so I don't know,

2133
02:06:33,121 --> 02:06:36,920
that's just a primal thing.
And I think the oceans men,

2134
02:06:36,970 --> 02:06:40,200
it affected me every time I'm on the
water and I'm just looking at the sky,

2135
02:06:40,201 --> 02:06:42,000
looking at the water, I feel like, wow,

2136
02:06:42,001 --> 02:06:44,480
I'm turning into a better person
just by sitting here. Yeah.

2137
02:06:44,481 --> 02:06:48,310
I have a friend who has a beach house and
we sometimes go to hang out with their

2138
02:06:48,311 --> 02:06:51,210
place. And, uh, when we,
uh, when we go there,

2139
02:06:51,211 --> 02:06:55,110
it's just amazing how
everything just Sorta, ah,

2140
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:57,150
just sit there like looking at the water,

2141
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:00,240
splashing up against the rocks
and everybody's just chilled out.

2142
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:04,590
It's almost like it has some sort
of a tranquilizing effect on,

2143
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:08,760
on everyone around it. He beach
communities are notoriously relaxed.

2144
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,600
When was the last time you were in
a really hectic beach community?

2145
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:15,720
They essentially don't exist and,
and you know,

2146
02:07:15,721 --> 02:07:18,960
there's always island paradises with like
people tell you it's just super mellow

2147
02:07:18,961 --> 02:07:22,770
people. Yeah. Hawaii.
I mean, Hawaii, look,

2148
02:07:22,771 --> 02:07:25,260
there's a lot of fights in Hawaii,
you know,

2149
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:28,450
but you're also dealing
with Polynesian people,

2150
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,990
some of the greatest warriors
throughout civilization.

2151
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:34,980
So gangster that they got on
these little fucking canoes,

2152
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,690
travel thousands of miles
across the ocean. I mean,

2153
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:40,700
they're just very aggressive people.
Yeah.

2154
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:44,710
But still pretty cool. I'm pretty
chilled out for the most part. Yeah.

2155
02:07:44,730 --> 02:07:48,090
I'm thinking about like little as like
the Seychelles islands and you know,

2156
02:07:48,091 --> 02:07:50,590
the people that live there.
I've never been to these places,

2157
02:07:50,591 --> 02:07:54,040
but I'm told by people who go there that
it's just like everyone is chill and

2158
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:57,610
calm and it might be because they're
just looking at water all the time. Yeah.

2159
02:07:57,611 --> 02:07:59,650
And looking at the vastness of the ocean,

2160
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:03,940
which sort of falls in the face
of any ideas that you have,

2161
02:08:03,941 --> 02:08:07,900
any delusions of grandeur or any, you
know, when you start looking at your life,

2162
02:08:07,901 --> 02:08:09,310
what's important,
what I need to do,

2163
02:08:09,311 --> 02:08:11,350
I need to get this done and
this deal needs to be made.

2164
02:08:11,351 --> 02:08:15,920
And then you look out the
ocean, like actually in the
greater spectrum, you know,

2165
02:08:15,921 --> 02:08:20,710
if you look at it in perspective, like,
come on, you're just a little blip,

2166
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,950
little tiny little thing out there and
just maybe just enjoy it a little bit

2167
02:08:23,951 --> 02:08:28,120
more. Yeah. We, we, we evolved
from, uh, the ocean and the,

2168
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:30,720
we'd have to complete the
cycle and get back to, uh,

2169
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:34,780
get back to the ocean and become
a homo aquatic us or something.

2170
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:37,420
Homo is on another one. You're
going to coin another. I just,

2171
02:08:37,421 --> 02:08:42,070
I just coined that just now.
Have you ever, uh, read the,

2172
02:08:42,071 --> 02:08:46,510
um, the theory about the aquatic ape?
Yes. I wrote a chapter about it in a book,

2173
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,780
the aquatic ape hypothesis. What
do you think about that? Well,

2174
02:08:49,781 --> 02:08:51,820
explain it to people who don't
know what it means. Well,

2175
02:08:51,821 --> 02:08:55,450
it's this uncanny fact that human beings,

2176
02:08:55,510 --> 02:08:58,580
what makes us different from
other large apes and, uh,

2177
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:03,340
other primates is that we share all
these qualities with marine mammals that

2178
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:08,290
only occur among marine mammals.
And it includes a subcutaneous fat,

2179
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:10,720
you know, a chimp stores. All
this fat between is Oregon's.

2180
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:13,810
We have it just beneath our skin,
just like a manatee or something.

2181
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,390
We have voluntary breath control.
We can,

2182
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:20,440
we can jump in the water and swim
around. Uh, we have a diving reflex,

2183
02:09:20,441 --> 02:09:21,750
which otters have,
you know,

2184
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:24,790
if you dive automatic shuts off your
nose and all this sort of stuff.

2185
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,630
Chimp falls in the water drowns in
mere minutes, you know, uh, we're,

2186
02:09:29,631 --> 02:09:31,810
we're comfortable in water.
We're hairless.

2187
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:37,570
Most mammals that are hairless
are our aquatic mammals.

2188
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:42,730
Uh, and you start listing the more you
list all these qualities, people are like,

2189
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:46,960
oh my God. We went through a stage
where we were like aquatic apes.

2190
02:09:46,961 --> 02:09:50,530
That's what made humans different.
Um, and it's one of the,

2191
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:54,610
I think the aquatic ape hypothesis is
an excellent example of the difference

2192
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:57,400
between a hypothesis and a theory.

2193
02:09:57,820 --> 02:10:01,920
Because what it has going for it is
tremendous explanatory power. It,

2194
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:05,890
we don't have hard evidence
like a webbed hominid foot,

2195
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:11,440
by the way. Um, 7% I think of human
beings are born with web toes.

2196
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:16,260
That's one of the things people
don't know why, but yeah, 7%. Yeah.

2197
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:19,570
See if that's still true.
It was true when I wrote my look it up.

2198
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:25,000
Wow. So what I was researching this, you
know, whatever, six or eight years ago,

2199
02:10:25,210 --> 02:10:26,460
yeah, that was true. And I,

2200
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:30,670
and I cited the reference web toes.

2201
02:10:30,671 --> 02:10:34,340
So then you think about, all right,
you take a uh, orangutan baby,

2202
02:10:34,341 --> 02:10:39,170
throw it into the water. It drowns
very fast. You take a human baby,

2203
02:10:39,171 --> 02:10:42,020
throw it into the water,
it knows how to hold its breath.

2204
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:45,860
It waits till it comes to the surface and
then it naturally floats and kicks its

2205
02:10:45,861 --> 02:10:46,694
feet.

2206
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:51,440
So there's all this weird like where
did we get all these qualities?

2207
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:56,120
It's actually one in 2000
to 2,500 live births.

2208
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:57,590
Well that's close enough.

2209
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,910
Yeah. Well, you know, it's pretty small.

2210
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:10,010
It's a one in 2001 and seven.
We're 7%.

2211
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:14,390
What do you stickler for? Yeah, I'm
a stickler for facts. I'm crazy.

2212
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:19,550
But it still is a, it's interesting
that it, I mean even that one in 2000,

2213
02:11:19,551 --> 02:11:22,790
it's fairly common.
I wonder if it's one in 2000.

2214
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:25,070
That's more like a weird monopoly anomaly.

2215
02:11:25,071 --> 02:11:28,730
If it's something that's way more
common, like 1%, that could be something,

2216
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:33,380
you know, atavistic like the appendix
something left and right. Right, right.

2217
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:37,910
One of the other, um, things about the
Aquatic Cape theory that are compelling,

2218
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:43,700
uh, some I should be an
oh, even large brains. Um,

2219
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:48,320
the mammals with the largest brains are
mostly in relation to the rest of their

2220
02:11:48,321 --> 02:11:52,880
body are mostly aquatic animals.
Apparently dolphins, whales,

2221
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:56,360
horcose also that we're,
um,

2222
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:59,120
we're evolved to process and use,
you know,

2223
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:03,680
fish fats really efficiently and
you're really, really well. I'm like,

2224
02:12:03,681 --> 02:12:04,550
why is that true?

2225
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:09,890
All I know is the aquatic eight proponents
keep lining up all these things.

2226
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:14,480
And in some cases, the only animals
that have these things in common are,

2227
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:19,420
you know, aquatic mammals
and humans. So it, it,

2228
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:20,870
it has to do with,
um,

2229
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:26,060
the main ones are like hairlessness
and subcutaneous fat. What are the, uh,

2230
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,950
country,
what are the arguments against this?

2231
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:32,210
The arguments against it are we have
not found a single fossil that would,

2232
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:34,580
that would support this,
this hypothesis.

2233
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:36,800
So that's why it remains
officially a hypothesis.

2234
02:12:36,801 --> 02:12:39,980
Not An actual theory of the
fossils are really hard though.

2235
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:41,870
That's the difference between,
you know,

2236
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:46,010
one of the things about fossils is that
something has to happen in order to

2237
02:12:46,011 --> 02:12:48,440
create a fossil. For the most
part, most people that die,

2238
02:12:48,441 --> 02:12:53,210
your body is going to be absorbed by
the animals, the biology, by bacteria,

2239
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:57,560
by rodents, scavengers, there'll
be nothing left. It has to,

2240
02:12:57,561 --> 02:13:00,890
something has to happen. You have to
be trapped in a mudslide. Volcano,

2241
02:13:00,891 --> 02:13:05,240
whatever it is, it's like covers you.
It's something that preserves you. Yeah.

2242
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:10,430
I think the chapter aqua ape that I wrote
for that book is available online and

2243
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:13,400
people can go check it out. I think I'm
going to have to, I'm gonna have to,

2244
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:15,980
I can add that.
Now I've got to research this 7% thing.

2245
02:13:15,981 --> 02:13:18,440
Am I gonna have to update that?
You're going to have to update that.

2246
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:22,520
It is a fascinating thing though.

2247
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:27,560
The idea that the reason why people are
so different and why we like if you take

2248
02:13:27,831 --> 02:13:29,450
a baby and throw a baby in the water,

2249
02:13:29,451 --> 02:13:33,480
they immediately know the hold their
breath. It's a, it's instinctive. It's,

2250
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:37,130
it is weird. And I'm like, why do we
have all these weird qualities? Yeah.

2251
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:41,340
And then also the fat thing that if
you take a champ like a little baby,

2252
02:13:41,341 --> 02:13:43,380
chimps are hard,
hard little muscle.

2253
02:13:43,390 --> 02:13:47,640
Thanks baby babies are just floaty
little suckers. They're floaty. Yeah.

2254
02:13:47,641 --> 02:13:50,430
They're built with all this fat,
this fat. And then, you know,

2255
02:13:50,431 --> 02:13:52,810
if an orangutan gets really fat,
you,

2256
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:57,360
you don't go up and squeeze fat on
the outside of its body. You know,

2257
02:13:57,390 --> 02:14:02,040
we store all this fat outside, uh,
our Oregon's, you know, in our,

2258
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:06,080
in our, beneath our skin, this sort of
subcutaneous they call it. And that's a,

2259
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:07,960
that's a quality of aquatic mammals.
It's,

2260
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:10,740
it is weird that we have all
these qualities, but there's no,

2261
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:13,050
there's just no hard evidence
is the thing. So it's,

2262
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:16,620
and this massive attraction to
the, uh, to the ocean. I mean,

2263
02:14:16,621 --> 02:14:21,621
you don't see a bunch of baboons sitting
out there staring at the ocean and all

2264
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:26,590
communities are founded, you
know, next to oceans. We,

2265
02:14:26,591 --> 02:14:27,660
we love the water.

2266
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:32,300
Yeah. It's fascinating stuff. The Quad
Gate Theory and looking at it folks,

2267
02:14:32,301 --> 02:14:35,030
it's very interesting. Listen,
man, this is a great podcast.

2268
02:14:35,031 --> 02:14:39,260
I really enjoyed this very much as well.
It's a fascinating subject. Um, I think,

2269
02:14:39,261 --> 02:14:40,400
uh,
I think,

2270
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:45,050
I think there's massive potential
for all of this and I think that, uh,

2271
02:14:45,051 --> 02:14:49,550
it's really cool that you were investing
so much time and so much energy and to

2272
02:14:49,551 --> 02:14:54,080
promoting these ideas and
a, I hope anybody listening
to this a explores further,

2273
02:14:54,081 --> 02:14:54,351
you know,

2274
02:14:54,351 --> 02:14:59,351
go to seasteading.org and check out the
website and see what they have to offer.

2275
02:15:00,651 --> 02:15:05,000
And a seasteading. Is it just seasteading
on um, on Twitter? What is the, uh,

2276
02:15:05,001 --> 02:15:08,720
the Twitter handle? I think it's
the CC sending institute. Yes.

2277
02:15:08,721 --> 02:15:13,020
That is a seasteading institute on
Twitter. Thanks man. I had a great time.

2278
02:15:13,021 --> 02:15:14,930
There's a lot of fun.
Yeah, I appreciate it.

2279
02:15:15,590 --> 02:15:19,190
Is there anything else you want to
direct people to or tell people about?

2280
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:22,930
Go to the seasteading institute,
uh, checkout our, our,

floating city. We have a donation page,
