1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,080
Three,
two,

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,540
one,
boom.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,430
And we're live.
Hello Godfather.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,330
How are you,
sir?

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,710
Good to see you buddy.
You too.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,660
Thank you for having me again.
My pleasure.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,210
What's up?
What's up with you?

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,520
Well,
before we start for Easter,

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,170
I'm doing well.
People ask me,

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,800
how do you define wealth?
You define wealth when you're young.

11
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,634
Daughter,
before you step on the Joe Rogan 

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,450
Platform,
writes this to you.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,530
She wrote,
I love you.

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,450
That's very cute.
That's wealth.

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,150
Other billionaire?
Yeah.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,980
It's a valuable.
Wouldn't say it's wealth.

17
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,290
I think not being accurate with your 
words.

18
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,020
By the way.
I will probably keep this forever bore.

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,861
You should.
Yeah,

20
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,720
definitely don't put in your pocket.
What if you sweat on it?

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,750
Okay,
I'll leave it to you.

22
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,613
How's that?

23
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,760
So,
uh,

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,593
we were talking right before the podcast
started about what I was just talking 

25
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:03,240
about in the previous podcast about 
Patriot and what Patrion is done.

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,173
Two d platform Sargon of a cod in what?
I think we both agree was sloppy use of 

27
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,150
language on his part,
but he was,

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,160
I don't believe he was saying something 
racist.

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,083
He was using a racist word though it was
using it to describe someone who is 

30
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:19,914
actually using it against white 
nationalists against white supremacists 

31
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,284
and and saying how ridiculous they were 
being in that they were being exactly 

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,143
what they describe and when they're 
using racist terms to describe black 

33
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:34,224
people,
but he did it using those terms and it 

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,993
wasn't a good speech like what he said 
and one of the things that I'd said on 

35
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,760
the previous podcast is when you do 
podcast,

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,550
you're not mapping out what you're going
to say.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,413
You're free flowing.
Sometimes words come out clunky and I 

38
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:52,884
think that was what what was going on in
the case with him in this particular 

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,533
conversation that he had.
There wasn't even on his page and 

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,883
patriot and decided to ban him and I 
think for him that was something to the 

41
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,460
tune of a $12,000
or more a month.

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,590
Yeah.
So quite a bit of his income.

43
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,323
You know,
a lot of us then suggested that people 

44
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:14,904
move to subscribe star,
which was a another platform that came 

45
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,790
out of nowhere and they've now been shut
down.

46
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,220
How'd they get shut down?
I don't know the details,

47
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,054
so I hope I'm not misspeaking,
but I think paypal and stripe decided 

48
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,064
that somehow they're violating their 
terms of their terms of service for 

49
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,064
whatever reason and uh,
apparently any payouts that have gone 

50
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,410
out are safe,
but you,

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,380
it won't happen through paypal or 
through stripe,

52
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,720
so you have to find some alternate 
platform,

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,950
I think pioneer or something,
uh,

54
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,943
so it's getting difficult to,
to even receive the generous donations 

55
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:53,724
from people.
So a lot of people that are doing 

56
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,890
podcasts and doing these youtube shows,
they operate

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
on donations,
which is a really fair way to do things 

58
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,413
because you're.
If say if you have a subscription based 

59
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,184
service and you're asking people like 
save for Sirius satellite radio or 

60
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,624
something like that,
you might not be happy with the content 

61
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,664
and you might,
you might choose to cancel your 

62
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,544
subscription,
but these people can get what they get 

63
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,630
already for free.
Right?

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,840
They choose to donate because they think
it's valuable to them.

65
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,110
Which was really interesting.
I liked that,

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,670
that format,
that model,

67
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,803
because for the longest time people were
trying to figure out how could you make 

68
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,410
money off the Internet?
Well,

69
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,180
the,
the idea was advertising revenue and Sam

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,013
Harris has a lengthly rant that's very 
accurate about this that he puts on his 

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,200
podcast may often.
It's like a seven minute rant explaining

72
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,034
why he doesn't use ads and why he 
prefers to have people just donate what 

73
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:55,654
they were like.

74
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,390
And he was one of the biggest patrion 
people.

75
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,850
He was one of the biggest accounts on 
Patriot.

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,530
He pulled his Patriot on two days ago.
Right.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,240
And you know,
that was a huge statement because to him

78
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,074
that is incredibly valuable.
I'm really curious to know what Jack 

79
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,680
Conte,
the founder of the have patriot,

80
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,093
what his ultimate trajectory is going to
be as someone who teaches psychology of 

81
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,074
decision making was studies,
decision making who's housed in a 

82
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,680
business school.
Uh,

83
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,673
um,
I think it would be a wonderful case 

84
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,614
analysis down the road,
follow the Harvard will teach it of 

85
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,190
whether he just doubles down,
which it seems like this is what they're

86
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,024
doing because they released a statement 
that didn't seem to suggest that there 

87
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:40,030
was any sort of possibility of 
reflection on their part.

88
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,460
Do you have a sense of whether the 
market will allow him to sort of realign

89
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,294
his thinking or do you think he's just 
going to double down all the way to 

90
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:48,430
hell?

91
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,820
I think he's going to weather the storm 
if I'm going to be completely honest,

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,750
not what I would like.
What I would like is for them to support

93
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,584
free speech and for them to make a 
differentiation between what is the 

94
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,010
actual hate speech and what is a clunky 
use of language,

95
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,860
which is what I think Sargon did,
right?

96
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,920
It was a clunky use of language and I 
think Sargon is a very intelligent guy.

97
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,020
I've had him on the podcast,
I've talked to him.

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,060
He's a very bright and he had been on 
the show several great point.

99
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah,
he's a very smart guy.

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Um,
when he was on it,

101
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,550
just what is on someone else's show 
doing that,

102
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,841
uh,
you know,

103
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,674
I felt like,
and this is one of the things I said in 

104
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,384
the last podcast,
I feel like if people decide that what 

105
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,284
he did was offensive to them to the 
point where they decided to not renew 

106
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:40,240
their subscriptions or not continue to 
send him money through patriots,

107
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,890
that's probably the best use of that 
format and the best way for them and the

108
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,350
market to decide.
That's really,

109
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:48,430
I think,
how it should be done.

110
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,060
Incidentally,
regarding the n word,

111
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,290
and I'm sure Jamie will now double check
what I'm saying as he always does a,

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,130
there was a dean

113
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,820
at some university,
I think out maybe in Seattle,

114
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:06,410
I could be wrong,
that at some point had suggested a,

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,333
someone had asked which book a student 
that asks which book should I read or I 

116
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:10,904
can't remember the exact story.
And I think the title of the book was 

117
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,550
the n word.
And she had,

118
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,860
I think the dean was a,
was a woman,

119
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,540
like if I'm not mistaken,
uh,

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,240
had simply recommended that book.
But she said the word out loud said,

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
and she,
he or she,

122
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,240
I can't remember again,
the person's sex got into trouble.

123
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,380
So,
you know,

124
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:37,280
I wonder if we shouldn't just sort of 
demystify this word in an if,

125
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,210
if,
if,

126
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,750
if people weren't so.
I mean we have to now say the n word,

127
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,270
right?
We have to say the r word.

128
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,104
I got banned from twitter for 12 hours 
because at one point I was interacting 

129
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,901
with some schmuck who I called retarded,
the generate a whatever it was.

130
00:06:59,121 --> 00:06:59,954
I can remember the exact combination of 
consulting and I was banned for using 

131
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,810
the r word.
So I mean,

132
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,380
where does this anime?
What,

133
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,610
how many more words do we have to remove
from the lexicon?

134
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,470
I mean,
don't give these words so much power.

135
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:13,760
Don't,
don't be so sensitive.

136
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:15,620
I mean,
I know we've talked about these kinds of

137
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,220
issues in the past,
but does it not seem too outrageous that

138
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,180
someone who recommends a book with the 
title being the n word

139
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,970
gets into trouble and made some saying,
well,

140
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:24,804
as an even better one netflix.
There was an executive at Netflix that 

141
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:28,944
was forced to resign due to my friend 
Tom Seger is comedy special and my 

142
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:39,861
friend Tom Segura has a bit in his act 
about how there's certain words that are

143
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:46,650
just gone you can't use anymore,
and he says retard.

144
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
He's like,
that word.

145
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,920
You can't use that word anymore.
And he goes,

146
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,120
and it's not about using that word.
What?

147
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,420
He's basically,
he's not like,

148
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,943
he's not justifying the use of the word.
He just simply stating that this is a 

149
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:00,864
word that you could no longer use.
So they get attacked a bunch of letter 

150
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:09,030
writing campaign from mental health 
organizations and you know,

151
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,130
people dealing with people that have 
disabilities and are saying that you're,

152
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,183
you're being abelist and your being 
discriminatory and all these different 

153
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:16,620
things.

154
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,360
And they're basically trying to silence 
him.

155
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,030
Even though if you look at the actual 
bid itself,

156
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:21,864
he's not using it to describe a person.
He's just essentially it acknowledging 

157
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:26,754
that the word exists.
So this guy who was an executive at 

158
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,534
Netflix says in a meeting,
you can't use that word because that 

159
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,084
word.
It's like saying nigger around black 

160
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:39,470
people,
right.

161
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,800
Just says that you're going to get in 
trouble now.

162
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,550
No,
I said it in the earlier show too.

163
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,250
I'm just saying when I read Sargon of 
our cods thing,

164
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,670
I said it's preposterous to say the n 
word and I've said the n word before and

165
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,680
in most cases I say it,

166
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,940
but he actually said the word and the 
reason why he said the word,

167
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,783
the reason why I just said the word is 
because he was trying to demonstrate 

168
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,733
that this is an offensive thing,
like saying retard is just like saying 

169
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,874
that he gets fired for that,
for simply making this comparison that 

170
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,793
you know,
and we're talking about uncensored 

171
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,800
standup comedy.
By the way,

172
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,873
this is a network that features that 
were prominently on several different 

173
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:29,580
comedy specials in multiple situations,
whether it's cat williams,

174
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,510
multiple uses of the word Dave 
Chappelle.

175
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,220
I mean that word gets thrown about like 
a beach ball at a fucking concert.

176
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,323
That word gets tossed around a lot,
but this guy saying it because he's 

177
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,650
white.
He enough of your work here,

178
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,860
sir.
Speaking of comedy and sort of political

179
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,510
correctness with comedy,
uh,

180
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,493
and in my forthcoming book,
I have a section where I talk about 

181
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,910
professors who got into Trello.

182
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,743
I mean we've all heard about the 
comedians getting into trouble for 

183
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,340
violating some politically correct 
victim,

184
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,770
but professors,
many cases,

185
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,633
very,
very high profile professors getting in 

186
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,154
trouble for incredibly innocuous jokes.
And actually I brought a list of names 

187
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,630
because I thought I might not remember 
them.

188
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,850
Can I mentioned a few,
a few of the cases.

189
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,660
So Lasar Greenfield,
who was the,

190
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,494
uh,
president elect of the American College 

191
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,930
of surgeons and the editor and chief of 
a journal called General Surgery News.

192
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,403
W had written an editorial a few years 
ago where he was talking about the 

193
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,433
antidepressant benefits of coming in 
contact with sperm and other words at 

194
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,193
it.
And this was based on a peer reviewed 

195
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,630
scientific paper.
Actually,

196
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,990
two of the authors of that paper are 
folks that I know quite well,

197
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,830
friends of mine,
and they had demonstrated that women who

198
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:53,664
have protected sex versus unprotected 
sex and up scoring differently on these 

199
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,920
depressive measures.

200
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,813
In other words,
there was some sort of protective 

201
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,720
element to actually being exposed to 
sperm and so in his editorial,

202
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,630
he made a joke.
It wasn't during Valentine's,

203
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,673
he said,
so now there is a gift that a man can 

204
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:16,080
give a woman that's beyond flowers or 
chocolates or something to that effect.

205
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,840
He had to step down from being president
of the American College of surgeons.

206
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,703
He had to step down from being an editor
in chief because a whole bunch of women 

207
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,260
were very offended by that sperm joke.
Now,

208
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:29,094
the,
the,

209
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,993
the authors of the paper and question 
wrote a brilliant response response 

210
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,050
where they said,
how,

211
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,983
how could he be treated in this way when
all he was doing is actually literally 

212
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:41,904
reporting the data,
the findings from our peer reviewed 

213
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,740
study.
So that's one example.

214
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,850
Another example is a certain,
uh,

215
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,540
I think it's third.
Tim Hunt,

216
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,380
who was a Nobel Prize winner in 2001.

217
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,730
I remember this one.
Yeah,

218
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,760
right.
Who,

219
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,350
who he basically,
he was a speaking fee in Korea at a,

220
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,583
you know,
women in science conference where he 

221
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,310
very in a jocular way said,
you know,

222
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:08,710
it's a real problem when you have women 
in your lab.

223
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,830
They fall in love with you,
you fall in love with them,

224
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,230
and so it's better to have segregated 
labs.

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,580
His wife,
by the way,

226
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,414
is a staunch feminist who's a very 
prominent scientist and she confirmed 

227
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,100
that he's hardly,
you know,

228
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:24,890
a rabid sexist.
He went through all sorts of health.

229
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,780
Yeah,
I remember that.

230
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,290
And he was joking and he was joking.
And I.

231
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,060
In the book I discussed several other 
other of these examples,

232
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:31,894
so,
so imagine you would think that a 

233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,073
unblemished exemplary career as a 
scientist up to getting a Nobel prize 

234
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,163
could potentially protect you.
But one comment that someone decides 

235
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,353
can,
can unleashed a tsunami of outrage and 

236
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:48,964
you're dead.

237
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,803
Well,
I think the problem is reacting to the 

238
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,750
people that are reacting to the camera.
It's not the common itself,

239
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,570
it's the cowards that are running things
that give into that.

240
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,490
And the Netflix thing is particularly 
disturbing because it was internal,

241
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,353
it was people that were working in this 
department that apparently went and 

242
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:08,584
protested and they just decided that his
use was egregious and he shouldn't be 

243
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:15,140
able to say those sounds with his face.
See,

244
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,243
see I,
I get a lot of letters from people 

245
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:18,410
asking me,
well,

246
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,140
you know,
I'm facing a similar situation.

247
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,940
What should I do?
A professors out?

248
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,163
And my answer is fight back hard.
So I've had a couple of these 

249
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:29,230
situations.
I had a guy on twitter,

250
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,064
the guy,
the guy who many refer to as a retard 

251
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,420
started,
started contacting my university,

252
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,613
trying to get me fired when,
when it wasn't working with his tagging 

253
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,120
my university on twitter,
he actually contacted the HR department,

254
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,340
Human Resources Department at my 
university.

255
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,380
This is a random person.
What's a troll?

256
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,890
You got in touch with a troll and you 
gave him what he wanted attention.

257
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,510
And then he,
he started to run with it.

258
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,550
You basically gave him an opportunity to
score.

259
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:59,200
It's playing a video game.
Exactly.

260
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,213
But now here's what happened.
The university's hr person contacts me 

261
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,114
after hours.
I mentioned this actually recently on 

262
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,390
the Rubin report,
the,

263
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,020
the,
the,

264
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,720
the lady in question contacts me to say,
look,

265
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,430
here's a complaint that's been filed 
against you now.

266
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,160
My first instinct was,
oh,

267
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:20,161
someone in my job as a professor at the 
university has complained about me,

268
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:22,150
which I couldn't think who that would 
be,

269
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,860
but I would think that that's where the,
the,

270
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,850
the template of their influence over me 
would reside.

271
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,803
No,
they had actually taken seriously a 

272
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:32,194
random person on twitter contacting them
and filing a complaint under the guise 

273
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,900
of he's a student.
Well,

274
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:39,450
he's not my student,
right?

275
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,690
I mean,
if a student,

276
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,660
uh,
costs me in an alley to Mug me,

277
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,030
I can't fight back because Bruh,
he's a student or I'm allowed to,

278
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,030
to deck him.
Right?

279
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,040
So this is a guy that I'm just having 
fun.

280
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,980
I mean,
I'm doing it

281
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,560
with a smile.
We're going back and forth the size that

282
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,890
he's willing to go as far as try to get 
me fine now,

283
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:58,724
let's suppose that he had succeeded.
Let's suppose that I hadn't fought back 

284
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,220
because basically what I did with the 
university,

285
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,073
I said,
are you literally thinking that it is 

286
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,284
reasonable for you to be monitoring what
I do on my twitter account and the 

287
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,140
example I gave her as an analogy,
I said,

288
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,543
if if I see you coming out of a pharmacy
with your daughter and I feel that 

289
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:17,924
you're speaking to her in a current 
manner that I don't agree with as a 

290
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:23,150
parent,
can I report you to the university?

291
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,490
And that pretty much ended the 
conversation very quickly,

292
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,324
but the fact that they felt sufficiently
embolden to actually reach out to me to 

293
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:34,010
address this complaint shows you how 
chilling the environment is.

294
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,080
It is.
Right,

295
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,490
but let's play devil's advocate.
Sure.

296
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,583
If I was someone who was taking your 
class or if I was someone who is very 

297
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:48,734
sensitive or someone who has certain 
ideals and morals and the professor 

298
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,000
who's teaching the class that I take 
called somebody a retard,

299
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,020
I would.
I mean just being honest and I love you.

300
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,540
They.
I would.

301
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,950
I would say,
why is this guy doing that?

302
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,813
Like that's a stupid thing to do,
like why are you engaging with these 

303
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:12,071
people online and these,
these base insults like that distasteful

304
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,870
insults.
Fair enough.

305
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,733
And why engage with people like that.
And I mean literally the reason I do it 

306
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:19,784
as once in a while my wife falls asleep.
I don't feel like working on my 

307
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:25,250
scientific papers or my boat crash or 
whatever.

308
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,084
I'm tired and I'm on twitter and I hated
your advice to try to not engage with 

309
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:31,340
people.

310
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,370
Some idiots catches my eye.
Oh Gee,

311
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,213
I used the word idiot.
You're allowed to say idiot for some 

312
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:36,520
strange reason.
Okay,

313
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,070
okay.
You just can't call them.

314
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,110
So someone,
someone or where it catches my attention

315
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,760
and I decided to spar with them.
You,

316
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:44,594
you,
you like to get into the octagon and do 

317
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,860
an aspiring.
I go on twitter and I have fun with some

318
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:49,640
idiot.
Right?

319
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,930
But when I just enjoy it and usually we 
both laugh it off and we move on.

320
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,660
It's just part of my personality,
right?

321
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,603
I'm a fun guy.
I could be deadly serious and very 

322
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,510
academic and scientific and as you've 
correctly pointed in the past,

323
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,940
I could not take myself seriously.
It'd be just one of the guys,

324
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,013
so this is a manifestation of that now 
that this person felt sufficiently in 

325
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:13,790
bolden and his indignation that he would
try to fire me.

326
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,400
That's where you should be focusing on 
sort of.

327
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,234
I don't think that's real.
I don't think he really felt so 

328
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:21,494
emboldened.
I think what it was is he recognized 

329
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:27,170
that there is a climate today where a 
person like yourself,

330
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,004
who is a professor who uses a certain 
word that is deemed to be offensive by 

331
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:31,934
society,
that he can call you on that word and 

332
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,454
get you caught.
You got caught up in a net of your own 

333
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,610
doing,
sir.

334
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,840
Well,
I'm,

335
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,430
I'm,
I'm still here smiling and looking fan,

336
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,380
so that's okay.
Do you do look tan?

337
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,643
Do you regret using that word at more 
than anything I regret that ever get 

338
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,220
sucked

339
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,850
into these battles?
That's it as much because again,

340
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,810
it's a slippery slope today.
It's retard tomorrow.

341
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,510
It's more on the next day.
It's schmuck.

342
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,231
Yeah.
Well,

343
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:59,064
that is true in terms of like were 
people don't understand calling someone 

344
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,344
a retard,
like say if you're a 30 year old person 

345
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,640
today or 25 year old person,
let's try 25.

346
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,760
You realize that that is a forbidden 
taboo when you and I were 25,

347
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,770
that word was nothing,
right?

348
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,620
That word you would to get called it by 
your teacher.

349
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,983
I mean it's true.
That was new and it was known to be 

350
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:25,884
someone who was retarding your growth or
retarding the class or saying things 

351
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:36,720
that were retarding development of ideas
and,

352
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,120
and logic moving forward that you're,
you're,

353
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,300
you're a roadblock.
You're a pile of rocks in the road,

354
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,980
right?
You fucking retard.

355
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,900
Like that's how people talked about it.

356
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,823
Like that's how they said it,
but then it's become a new word that's 

357
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,074
victim to this war on words because 
you're not saying you have down 

358
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:56,604
syndrome,
right.

359
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,250
What you're saying is you're a dumb 
person,

360
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,340
you know,
and that terminology,

361
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,840
like especially the word retarded,
it is not even used medically.

362
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,883
Right?
So it's not a word and the to say that 

363
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,813
there's no nuance and this word cannot 
be used again about a really stupid 

364
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,850
fucking person.
Right?

365
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,380
You know,
I,

366
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,213
I,
as you know,

367
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,063
you probably know because I've sent you 
some clips of my infant of soccer 

368
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,640
skills.
Uh,

369
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,610
I used to be a very serious soccer 
player.

370
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,310
Now if you,
you,

371
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:30,370
you know this as someone who follows the
MMA,

372
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,820
there's a lot of trash talking,
right?

373
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,970
So the amount of nine this time nominate
professor and so on.

374
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,430
But the amount of trash talking that I 
both dished out and was the recipient of

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,040
actually allowed me to be a better 
person today.

376
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,750
It's,
it's a form of antifragility,

377
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,271
right?
I mean by.

378
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,520
Yes.
So,

379
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,640
so when you create a sanitized 
environment,

380
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,020
you're creating a fragile system.
You're creating fragile human beings.

381
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,730
So if,
if the,

382
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,683
if the worst stain in my 54 years on 
earth is that I use the word retard on 

383
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,610
this person.
I'm doing pretty well.

384
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,530
Well,
I'm sure it's not the worst day,

385
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,390
but uh,
yeah.

386
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,253
It's not that it's not that big a deal.
The only reason why it's a big deal is 

387
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:10,560
because the climate,
right.

388
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,900
You know what you're saying is this is a
stupid person.

389
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,210
You're.
You're not accusing him of having a.

390
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,073
you're not mocking a,
a mental disease or disorder genetic 

391
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:20,334
disorder.
It's not what you're saying and 

392
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:22,734
everybody knows that,
but they're just decided that this is a 

393
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,654
new word that is now taboo.
A new sound you can't make with your 

394
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,450
face.
Yeah.

395
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,300
I want to move onto other chore.
So first I wanted to say that I was very

396
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,890
excited last year.
It's completely different.

397
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:38,790
This is a very hard segue with last 
year,

398
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:43,791
one of my former professors at Cornell 
won the Nobel Prize in economics.

399
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,340
That's pretty powerful.
First semester

400
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,870
at Cornell,
I took his course.

401
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,780
His name is Richard Thaler.
Maybe you should look into inviting them

402
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:53,660
here.
Uh,

403
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,870
I'll add an ofi he does a lot of these 
podcasts,

404
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:56,410
but,
uh,

405
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,243
he should do your podcast.
And he won the Nobel prize for really 

406
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,453
the,
the area that I started off in before I 

407
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,000
developed all the evolutionary stuff 
that I'm most known for.

408
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,140
I came out of a tradition called 
behavioral decision theory.

409
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,550
Is that,
does that ring a bell at all?

410
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,050
Have you?
Do you know that is at all?

411
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,350
I'm really not totally.
No.

412
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,760
So classical economists have this,
uh,

413
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,130
if you like stylized homo economic,
this,

414
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,003
this vision of how someone who is 
rational ought to behave and they are 

415
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,970
these axioms of rational choice.
So for example,

416
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,000
if I prefer car a,
car B,

417
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,160
and I prefer carby to Carsey,
I must prefer car,

418
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:36,650
a third car.

419
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,620
See,
that's a,

420
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,573
that's called the transitivity action.
Someone who doesn't abide by this is 

421
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,720
behaving irrationally.
If I tell you,

422
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,440
what do you think of this hamburger that
has 90 percent fat free,

423
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,770
it's the same thing as telling you that 
this hamburger has 10 percent fat.

424
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,100
Those are two isomorphic statements.
It shouldn't alter your preference.

425
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,323
Yet we see repeatedly that people don't 
behave in the manners prescribed by 

426
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,810
classical economic theory,
by,

427
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,703
by homework analogous.
So Dick Thaler is the gentleman who 

428
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,953
demonstrated how many of these axioms of
rational choice are violated in 

429
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:13,930
behavioral finance.
And for that,

430
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:14,764
he won the Nobel Prize in economics and 
he came after the ones who originally 

431
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:24,061
wanted in 2002 Daniel Conaman.
You probably know his book thinking fast

432
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:25,740
and slow is I ring the bell.
Yes.

433
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,750
Right.
So Daniel Conaman and his collaborator,

434
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:31,720
Amos Tversky were the pioneers of that 
field.

435
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,580
And that's really the tradition that I 
came out of.

436
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,443
My doctoral supervisor was part of that 
gang of guys who spent their careers 

437
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:41,560
demonstrating that classical economists 
are wrong.

438
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,873
In my case,
I became frustrated with that whole 

439
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,660
paradigm because it became clear that 
yes,

440
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,830
economists have it wrong.
How many more demonstrations can we show

441
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:51,664
that they are wrong?
I was much more interested in knowing 

442
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,500
why the brain is structured the way that
it is enhanced.

443
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,030
That's how I got into evolutionary 
theory,

444
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,313
but I just thought that I would give 
them a shout out since he was a former 

445
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,680
professor of mine.
That's pretty awesome.

446
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,543
I'm just happy there's people out there 
trying to figure these things out so I 

447
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:08,620
can read what they say and repeat it.
I know what I'm talking about.

448
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,060
Um,
I want to go back to target things being

449
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,920
fragile and antifragile.
I mean,

450
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:15,754
I think that's a really important point.
Develop and I don't mean develop thick 

451
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:19,444
skin,
like become accustomed to racism or 

452
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:24,370
sexism or homophobia or rudeness.
It's just,

453
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,463
I'm not saying that we should just 
tolerate those things and we shouldn't 

454
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,190
seek to improve our culture.
We definitely should.

455
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,850
But as a human being,
this celebration of all things,

456
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:46,070
triggering this,
getting upset at every single thing

457
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,750
that comes your way and making it out to
be some massive complication.

458
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,140
I think it's a direct result of how easy
society is and how simple our lives are.

459
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,220
Complicated in intellectual ways,
complicated in emotional ways,

460
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,413
complicated in psychological ways.
Because I think a lot of the way people 

461
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:08,234
live their life is very unnatural but 
simple in terms of not worrying about 

462
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:13,340
predators,
not worrying about real violence,

463
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,830
not worrying about real strive,
never worrying about food.

464
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,963
I mean,
it's very rare that people in this 

465
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,690
culture,
in this day and age are starving.

466
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,903
You know,
it's a huge problem for most of human 

467
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,234
civilization.
Most of human civilization people had a 

468
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:30,440
struggle to find food.
Now,

469
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:31,274
for the most part,
it's very rare and I think all of these 

470
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,114
things have led us to seek enemies where
there are none and to go out and find 

471
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,350
these problems that really are not that 
big and make them out to be huge.

472
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,223
Right?
Because they're fragile and you know 

473
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,480
this.
The idea that let's.

474
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:53,330
One of the reasons why I like that 
expression snowflake,

475
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,373
like some,
some people get really upset if you 

476
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:56,264
throw that word.
So the idea is that every snowflake is 

477
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,670
unique and special,
right?

478
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,630
Right.
That's the idea.

479
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,330
And that you,
you are unique and special.

480
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,880
Maybe.
Maybe you're just lazy.

481
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,860
That's true too.
You know this.

482
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:14,861
This is our word for word and say that 
either

483
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,543
I could link what I just mentioned about
classical economists to the social 

484
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,210
justice warrior ethos.
So classical economists viewed the human

485
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:30,140
condition through very cold 
calculational calculus.

486
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:33,770
You certainly like humans are these,
they,

487
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,853
they,
they instantiate these algorithms 

488
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,030
without any emotions,
right?

489
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,030
If I prefer to be up for paccar beater 
car seat,

490
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:44,480
I much prefer a two car seats.
All axioms of rational choice.

491
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,523
There are no emotions in these models.
At the other end of that continuum lies 

492
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:51,074
the social justice warrior because all 
of life is through only the triggering 

493
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,023
of the emotional system.
There is no engagement with your 

494
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:02,090
cognitive resources.
It's all about outrage,

495
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,920
anger,
frustration,

496
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,500
and so in a sense they're antithetical 
to each other.

497
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,340
The classical economists and his world 
view,

498
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,273
there are no emotions.
The social justice warrior in his 

499
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,480
worldview,
there is no cognition.

500
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,314
Of course,
the the right way to be is somewhere in 

501
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,044
the middle.
The right way to be is to know when to 

502
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,250
engage your cognition and went to engage
your emotions.

503
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,680
Yeah.
Isn't that the issue,

504
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:24,514
right?
Is that there's always the middle and 

505
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,280
that things are rarely black and white 
or one and zero often very complicated.

506
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,490
Well

507
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,550
bottle.
Going back to aristotle had argued about

508
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,240
sort of what we now with color,
I would call the inverted u shape.

509
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,160
So for example,
if most things,

510
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,260
the middle is the right place to be.
All things in moderation,

511
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,730
right?
If you have too little of something,

512
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,950
it's not good.
If you have too much of something,

513
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,784
it's not good.
Somewhere in the middle is where the 

514
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:56,940
right virtuous and aristotle had thought
of that several thousand years ago.

515
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:57,774
I'll give you a specific example.
I'm not sure if I've mentioned that 

516
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,050
before.
In this podcast.

517
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,830
Perfectionism right follows an inverted 
u shape.

518
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,873
If you have too little audit,
you're not sufficiently detailed 

519
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,600
oriented.
Your work suffers.

520
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,640
If you have too much of it,
which I'm happy not happy on.

521
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,723
This police report is me.
Then it could be stunting because I 

522
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:19,284
checked my work 73,000
times before I sent it off because God 

523
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:23,604
forbid I might have a comma wrong that.
So there is some happy medium of proof 

524
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,410
on the perfectionism scale where we 
should all strive to be.

525
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,720
Well,
Aristotle said that for most traits,

526
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,860
that's where the optimal is.
That's where the inflection point is.

527
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,400
That makes sense.
I mean,

528
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,623
I'm not one to argue against aristotle.
I thought you were gonna say you're not 

529
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:47,184
one to argue against me.
I'm not one to argue against either one 

530
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:51,820
of you.
I,

531
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,653
I just think most issues that people are
arguing for or against one of the real 

532
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:02,160
problems is that they are married to 
their initial point.

533
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,123
Yeah.
And they argue that looking for a 

534
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:07,950
victory,
they're trying to move a ball across the

535
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:11,250
line and they do it by any means 
necessary,

536
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,563
including by mislabeling people,
by mischaracterizing your positions on 

537
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,264
things and categorizing you in some 
really easy to dismiss place like you 

538
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,500
are all right or you're,
you know,

539
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,633
you're a fringe right person or I mean,
how many people have been called a Nazi 

540
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,870
over the last couple of years you've 
been called the Nazi.

541
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,560
So when I was supposed to speak,
and August 2017,

542
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,213
uh,
at a event titled The stifling of Free 

543
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:47,490
Speech on university campuses,
it was on a university campus.

544
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,130
It was shut down.
The irony was hilarious.

545
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,470
It was with myself,
Jordan Peterson,

546
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,433
uh,
another clinical psychologist or an MFA 

547
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:56,130
and faith,
Goldie,

548
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,810
a journalist.
Uh,

549
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,400
anyways,
uh,

550
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,210
and then we held the event about three 
months later,

551
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:08,270
but the people who shut us down had put 
out a facebook page where they said,

552
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:13,170
we don't want these white supremacist 
Nazis and Toronto.

553
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,440
This is to a Jewish person who escaped 
persecution in Lebanon.

554
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,023
So yeah,
it's,

555
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,460
it's insane.
It's cute.

556
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,700
It's cute.
It is.

557
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:23,660
I mean,
they can't,

558
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,050
they can't be honest.
I mean this is not,

559
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:27,620
they don't honestly believe what they're
saying,

560
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:29,990
but they don't care because they're just
trying to move that ball.

561
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,883
Right?
And the fact that that's tolerated in 

562
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:33,974
that not just tolerated,
but it actually influenced your speech 

563
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:41,240
and you guys weren't allowed to put on 
that event being shame.

564
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,290
Shame on the university for giving in 
shame on them,

565
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,124
for not putting their foot down.
Shame on them for not examining who you 

566
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:49,270
are,
who Jordan is,

567
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,570
who one of those people are,
and realizing,

568
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:53,380
no,
you're lying you,

569
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,243
you are a problem.
You calling these people white 

570
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,004
supremacists and Nazis your a problem 
and you're a liar and you're defaming 

571
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:02,890
these per.
This is defamation.

572
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,840
This is your,
your light bulb.

573
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,733
This is terrible.
What you're doing is something that we 

574
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:08,284
should shun,

575
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,433
but I think it speaks to what you said 
earlier when you said it's all about 

576
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:13,690
winning,
getting the ball across a.

577
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,703
that's a.
that's another thing that I talk about 

578
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:16,724
in the book is the difference between 
the ontological ethics and 

579
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,384
consequentialist ethics.
The anthological ethics is where you 

580
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:26,390
have moral absolute.
It is always wrong to lie.

581
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,980
That will be at the into logical 
statement.

582
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,770
A consequentialist bent would be.
Well,

583
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,130
it depends on what the consequences of 
the liat is,

584
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:34,650
if,
if,

585
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,610
if it were to spare someone's feelings 
than it might've been okay to lie.

586
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,970
Right,
and so I argue that a lot.

587
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,863
The problem with a lot of these enemies 
of reason is that they have a 

588
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,480
consequentialist relationship with 
truth,

589
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,690
right?
It doesn't matter if you violate truth,

590
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,720
if there is some greater goal that you 
are pursuing.

591
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,840
Whereas I come from a deontological 
perspective when it comes to truth.

592
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,630
Truth is truth.
No matter who,

593
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,523
whose feelings it hurts,
and so I truly think certainly as a 

594
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:03,524
scientist,
you truly have to have a the 

595
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:06,404
anthological relationship with truth.
This is precisely why when a lot of 

596
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,070
people ask me,
do you think that there is for a bit,

597
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,320
and I think we even mentioned that last 
time I was on your show 16 months ago.

598
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,483
Uh,
is there any forbidden knowledge that 

599
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:18,434
you shouldn't do as a scientist?
And my answer is always an unequivocal 

600
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,100
no.
As long as you are a honest,

601
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,703
adherent to the scientific method,
you should be allowed to traverse any 

602
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,690
intellectual landscapes.
Intellectual

603
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,543
landscapes can be problematic when they 
deal with things that are very 

604
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:39,160
uncomfortable for people.
A big one is Iq,

605
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,383
right?
That's a giant one and that one has 

606
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,560
triggered so many accusations of racism 
and

607
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,370
whether it was good.
There was a gentleman,

608
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:54,950
I just covered him on my,
on my youtube channel.

609
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,530
I don't know who he is.
His name is.

610
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,880
I think noah.
Carl.

611
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,470
He's a young,
I think postdoc at Cambridge University,

612
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,693
who from all I know is a very reasonable
gentleman who had been invited to speak 

613
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,790
at a conference on intelligence.
And because of that,

614
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,923
a bunch of folks decided to put together
an open letter arguing that Cambridge 

615
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,640
University should not hire this guy.
And so on.

616
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,880
This has now become the standard way by 
which the baits are our resolve.

617
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,450
You signed these open letters,
so for,

618
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,940
had another guy on and you should 
definitely check this guy out.

619
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,170
His name is Alice stromeyer.
Uh,

620
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,030
he is a,
do you know this case?

621
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,163
No.
He's a physicist at the University of 

622
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,410
Pisa who was also a,
who was a research scientist at cern,

623
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,900
the,
the nuclear research center in Geneva.

624
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,310
He was invited to speak at a gender and 
theoretical physics conference.

625
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,240
Everything is about identity politics.
And of course the narrative was going to

626
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,280
be,
you know,

627
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,670
women are discriminated against in 
physics and you know,

628
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,260
we need to help them improve their lot 
and physics and so on.

629
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,880
So he got up and he presented 
bibliometric data.

630
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,320
So let me just,
for your viewers,

631
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:18,230
explain what that is.
Maybe we'll metric data is,

632
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,340
is a data that quantifies science.
So for example,

633
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:25,880
if I want to know which disciplines 
sites,

634
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:26,714
which other discipline,
I will look at citation patterns across 

635
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,090
disciplines.
Does economics oversight physics,

636
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,800
physics oversights a economics,
right?

637
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,753
So bibliometric data is a way to 
parametrized science and so what he did 

638
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,820
is he looked at for a given job in 
physics,

639
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,210
if a woman gets a job versus if a man 
gets a job,

640
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,670
how many citations did they have?

641
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,110
Citations.
Basically.

642
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:50,570
How many other people have cited your 
work when you published it?

643
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,270
So you and I might have,
I have published 50 papers each,

644
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,160
but you've been cited 10,000
times.

645
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:55,994
I've been cited 2000 times.
Therefore your work is more influential 

646
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,280
even though we've both published the 
same amount of papers and he,

647
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,420
he showed through very objective data 
that for a given position,

648
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,630
women were getting the jobs at much 
lower citations while that was construed

649
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:12,644
as terribly offensive,
terribly sexist Nazi like and so over 

650
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:22,901
1600 scientists using the the 
Appalachian particles for justice.

651
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,073
I'm not making this up.
What you can go particles for just 

652
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:31,640
young.
Jamie can check it out.

653
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:32,450
Yeah.
And you can,

654
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,270
you can read their letter and it 
includes,

655
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:40,271
I think one or two of your former guests
who have become a very antiphonal auntie

656
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,700
fan,
not Antifa,

657
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:44,970
uh,
uh,

658
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,010
because to me they're sounding like 
intellectual cowards and Fools.

659
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,510
Who were these people?
Uh,

660
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:53,370
I think one of them is Sean Carroll.
Uh,

661
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,141
you know,
that is,

662
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,160
I think he's been on several times.
Yeah.

663
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,480
So he's on that list and I don't know,
I don't want to misspeak,

664
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:02,210
but I think maybe Neil degrasse Tyson is
on it,

665
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:03,380
but maybe not.
So that one,

666
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,530
that one,
I'll,

667
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,600
I'll,
I'll hold off on that one.

668
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,590
But definitely Sean Carroll is on it 
because I've even tagged him and I said,

669
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:10,460
hey,
come on my show.

670
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,294
That's discuss it.
So the letter was basically it starts 

671
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:17,360
off and it says we will not tolerate 
that.

672
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:18,940
Someone within our community,
I'm,

673
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:19,774
I'm paraphrasing,
will question the humanity of anyone 

674
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,400
based on their race,
their gender,

675
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,860
their gender orientation.
He did no such thing.

676
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,023
All he did was report bibliometric data 
to either support the contention that 

677
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,920
women in physics were being 
discriminated against or not.

678
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,100
That

679
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,100
should not yield a an open letter that 
chastises him and the way that they did,

680
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,520
not the only thing that he did 
incorrectly and my view,

681
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:52,500
and he's admitted to it.
He came on my show recently at one point

682
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,334
during the presentation,
he showed his bibliometric profile 

683
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,310
versus to other women that had gotten a 
job over him,

684
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,820
so he personalized it and and and doing 
that.

685
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,270
Some people thought that that was 
inappropriate and that's fair.

686
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,104
Maybe it's not a nice thing to do to 
present your cv versus someone else and 

687
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:17,790
a public conference.
Maybe we can discuss that,

688
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,953
but the idea that we can't use 
bibliometric objective scientific data 

689
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,620
to either prove or disprove a narrative 
is insane and yet 1600 people decided to

690
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:30,600
sign that letter.
That does seem ridiculous,

691
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:32,850
especially when it's an accusatory 
narrative.

692
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,340
You're accusing people of sexual 
discrimination and then the,

693
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,290
the scientific data shows otherwise 
exactly what they're looking for,

694
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,520
equality of outcome,
right?

695
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,353
They're looking for an equal amount of 
female physicists and solid that that's 

696
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,200
you just you're not going to get an 
equal amount of people interested in it,

697
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,034
so then you,
you really have to show is you have to 

698
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,074
determine that there's been something 
that's holding those people back from 

699
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,314
achieving that goal because if some sort
of a concerted effort to keep women out 

700
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:58,734
of that field,
that's what should be demonstrated and 

701
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:03,930
when you demonstrate that,
I think here's the,

702
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,420
here's the glass half full version of 
that.

703
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,510
You're looking at that big blue biblio 
metric data.

704
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,523
What that shows is that people are 
encouraging women to get into this 

705
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,620
because it's the opposite.
That instead of them being held back,

706
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:17,451
they're actually,
they're,

707
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:21,240
they're looking to even out the playing 
field and help these women along.

708
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,690
The problem with that is then it makes 
it look like the women aren't as capable

709
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:25,524
as the medics that were not as effective
as the men with their work and you know 

710
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,610
that's bad for everybody.

711
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,640
That's bad for women and for men.
It's bad for science because it makes it

712
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:35,250
look like you're not being objective,
which is what all we want.

713
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,070
Every everyone who's not a scientist 
like myself,

714
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,270
what I want more than anything is to 
know that you're.

715
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:43,104
If you're a scientist,
I want to know that what you're telling 

716
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:45,894
me is a fact.
What I don't want is your own political 

717
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:50,274
spin on that fact because you don't want
to be criticized at work by radical 

718
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:53,964
feminists or radical leftist or any 
people that might in some way 

719
00:37:57,481 --> 00:38:02,481
potentially misconstrue your actions and
your thoughts as being sexist or what,

720
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,500
or fill in the blank,
homophobic,

721
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,430
transphobic,
whatever,

722
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:06,960
whatever the fuck it is that you're 
scared of.

723
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,153
I don't want to hear that.
What I want to hear is that you're 

724
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:10,944
looking at reality.
There are brilliant women out there 

725
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,723
that's brilliant men out there and a lot
of those brilliant women choose not to 

726
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:22,281
do the same fields is brilliant men and 
as long as no one's holding them back,

727
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,233
that shouldn't be a problem.
The problem is got to be in someone 

728
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,500
being held back,
someone discriminating,

729
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,334
someone trying to keep you out and you 
you're going to have to demonstrate 

730
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:35,980
that,
and I'm sure

731
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,600
that exists.
I'm sure that exists.

732
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,673
I'm sure there's women out there that 
are hearing this right now that have 

733
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,060
experienced all sorts of discrimination,
sexual discrimination,

734
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:43,894
sexual harassment,
and they have their own personal 

735
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:46,660
stories.
This is true,

736
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,400
but that is not necessarily why the data
reflects that.

737
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,290
There's more men that are successful 
with this.

738
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,393
It could seriously,
this is what people are really 

739
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,040
uncomfortable with.
Seriously represented.

740
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,920
There's differences in the sexist and I 
know that's so hard to.

741
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,223
Well,
this is so hard from the first time I 

742
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:09,100
think that I came on your show when I 
probably first discussed my evolutionary

743
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:10,750
psychology research.
I mean,

744
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:11,584
it's a fundamental tenant of 
evolutionary theory that there are 

745
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,960
sexual dimorphism.
When I appeared in front of the Canadian

746
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,793
Senate,
I had to sit there and lecture these 

747
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,460
senators that there is such a thing as 
male or female,

748
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,743
but meanwhile,
while many of them scoffed and laughed 

749
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,370
and tried to mock me,
uh,

750
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,230
it turns out a few days ago,
there's now an elementary school.

751
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,190
You're teaching young kids that boys to 
menstruate.

752
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,270
So literally every satirical,
every s,

753
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,283
I always joke,
I always say that I have prophetic 

754
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:45,271
satire because every time I try to look 
for something that is so outlandish that

755
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:49,300
it can enter into my satire,
two months,

756
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,500
three months,
eight months later,

757
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:51,760
it proves to be true.
So for example,

758
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:52,594
at one point I argued that I wanted to 
compete in the octogenarian under 120 

759
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:00,274
pound category in the judo cause you 
identify first because I that the files 

760
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,180
add 20 pounds.
But also I'm trans gravity.

761
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:11,080
I set my weight at whatever my weight is
there therefore,

762
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,093
and then because I can change my 
identity on a daily basis because 

763
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:15,934
Harvard University thought is that I'm 
later going to fight in the under 18 

764
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,030
year old category.
Hold on.

765
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,870
Harvard allows you to change it on a 
daily basis.

766
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,713
Harvard University came out that's 
actually discussed this in my Canadian 

767
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:28,510
Senate testimony.

768
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,343
Harvard University's Lgbtq a a plus a 
plus stars infinite to the Hashtag 

769
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,420
prime.
Exactly.

770
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,600
They came out with a pamphlet that said,
not only can we change our heart,

771
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,330
our gender identity,
but it can fluctuate on a daily basis.

772
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,540
Right.
So I could be he she or Monday,

773
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:53,530
Tuesday,
Wednesday.

774
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,870
And so I took this idea and I said,
well,

775
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,030
I identify as an 80 year old under 120 
pound Monday,

776
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,670
but then I'm going to fight in the judo 
competition.

777
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:04,504
I use Judah because my brother was an 
Olympian in judo as I think we might 

778
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:07,754
have this discussed.
I'm going to fight and the under eight 

779
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:14,290
category on Tuesday because I self 
identify on Tuesday as being a child now

780
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:19,291
it sounds satirical and insane.
A Dutch gentlemen who's 69 years old,

781
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,123
did you know the ages and he just.
He decided that he identifies with 

782
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,350
someone 20 years younger and he wants to
use it on dating apps and changes,

783
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,740
and then that would change his pension 
thing.

784
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,130
Well,
one,

785
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,960
it was so,
so then.

786
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,103
Then I introduced a new term and then 
that proved to be prophetically 

787
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,043
satirical.
I coined a new condition called 

788
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,900
transgenderism by proxy,
so,

789
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,803
so if,
if,

790
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,790
if,
if you're watching now,

791
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,330
enjoy this.
If Joe and God have sex,

792
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
if I self identify you as a woman,
then I'm engaging in heterosexual sex.

793
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,490
So it's not about me self identify me.
Yeah,

794
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,260
I can change my identity exactly on your
own interpretations of.

795
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,280
Exactly.
So it's not,

796
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,173
it's not that my self identity changes 
into a woman that the guy that I'm 

797
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:14,510
having sex with,
I self identify as a female.

798
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,120
Well,
a few weeks,

799
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,920
maybe not even.
A few weeks later,

800
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,250
some trans activists on twitter came out
and said,

801
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,600
ew,
disgusting.

802
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:24,434
Transphobes.
Just because you have a excuse the term 

803
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,500
a dick in your mouth doesn't mean that 
that's a dick.

804
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:33,940
If it's a woman and I called this trans,
uh,

805
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:39,440
cunnilingus volume,
it doesn't mean it's a dick.

806
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,630
If that person that identifies as a 
woman,

807
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,120
so just because you have a dick in your 
mouth,

808
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,310
it doesn't mean it's a deck because 
that's a woman.

809
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,530
You are giving sex to a woman.
Do you know?

810
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,220
Yeah.
There was a nine inch penis in your.

811
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:51,710
In your thing,
but it's a vagina.

812
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,370
Yale put.
They put tampons in the men's room.

813
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:56,330
Yes sir.
Of course.

814
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:59,790
I said that not only women.
Of course I.

815
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,890
that's true.
That's my.

816
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,170
That's my daily life.
That's called Tuesday for me,

817
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,013
man.
I have a hard time getting that out 

818
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:08,620
because of my women aren't the only ones
who menstruate.

819
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,680
What?
Yes they are.

820
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,990
Yes,
they are.

821
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,120
God dammit.
What?

822
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,950
Boys can have periods to children to be 
taught the latest victory for trend.

823
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:18,140
There you go.
I love how they say that.

824
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:20,270
The latest victory,
right?

825
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,090
Latest victory for who wrote that story?

826
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,920
Who wrote that?
Vox.

827
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,240
Who?
Halena.

828
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,010
Hey Halena.
Fuck off.

829
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,100
That's not a victory.
That's nonsense.

830
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,820
That is God damn nonsense,
but can I tell you what's not victory?

831
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,320
That's crazy.
Kids.

832
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,453
Kids don't know if you want to tell kids
that sometimes people are born in the 

833
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:43,670
wrong bodies.
That seems to be true.

834
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,060
There seems to be real evidence to that 
in terms of the way the brain works.

835
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,770
Sure.
I mean you,

836
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:53,890
if you want to call it the problem is 
distinguishing it from normalcy in a way

837
00:43:58,101 --> 00:43:59,770
that makes it look inferior.
Right?

838
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,460
Right.
Isn't that the real problem?

839
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:02,294
So if someone has this condition,
they shouldn't feel inferior and you 

840
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:06,074
shouldn't be bigoted towards them and 
they shouldn't live in a being exposed 

841
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:10,064
to any of discrimination,
but we shouldn't change our 

842
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:15,830
understanding of reality to celebrate 
your unique personhood.

843
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,720
Exactly.
Incidentally,

844
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,190
one of the things I talk about in the 
book,

845
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,113
all of these idea pathogens,
I argue some of them come from really 

846
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,870
noble places,
high strung,

847
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:25,490
so as well.

848
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,170
Yeah.
So let's cover a few of these.

849
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,891
So,
for example,

850
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:30,860
the empty slate premise,
Tabula Rasa,

851
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:34,890
we're with empty minds,
is a profoundly idiotic position,

852
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,993
but it really stems from the noble 
hopeful position that if we're all born 

853
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:40,794
with equal potentiality,
we could all reach the same end 

854
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,544
trajectory.
If only the environment were conducive 

855
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,190
for us being top athletes,
top scientists stopped mathematicians,

856
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,293
then we would have reached it.
There is nothing inherently at the 

857
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,144
start,
at t equals zero that differentiates of 

858
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,100
now,
that's insanely stupid and wrong.

859
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,230
But it is a hopeful message.
Now,

860
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,180
extend this to other contexts,
right?

861
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,273
Uh,
it shouldn't be that you're defined by 

862
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:09,240
your biological sex.
You could change it in any way you want.

863
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:10,740
That sounds very liberating,
right?

864
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,160
So I think a lot of these idea 
pathogens,

865
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,610
what I call these,
these parasitic ideas really come from a

866
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:18,444
notion of trying to liberate people from
otherwise they're the shackles of 

867
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,274
reality.

868
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,340
So it's insane.
It's a form of,

869
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,720
of delusional thinking,
but that is rooted in its genesis,

870
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:32,420
comes from a good place.
I,

871
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:37,540
I couldn't agree with that more and 
gender dysphoria used to be considered a

872
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,690
used to be considered a mental disorder.
Right,

873
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,190
but isn't it right?
Well,

874
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,180
listen,
but what is it?

875
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,710
Okay,
but let's be honest,

876
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,930
if it's not,
if it's,

877
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:50,970
is it a physical disorder?
What is it?

878
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,790
I'll put it in a very charitable,
politically correct way.

879
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,620
It's certainly not part of the default 
value of human expressions.

880
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,700
Do you see what I'm saying?
Male and female is the default values.

881
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:03,534
We are a sexually dimorphic species now 
for all sorts of reasons until genetic 

882
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:08,784
developmental reasons.
When the brain is getting typed in 

883
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:11,514
Utero,
things can happen that altered those 

884
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:17,790
default values.
Now you come out with gender dysphoria.

885
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,380
You shouldn't be discriminated against.

886
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,180
You should be treated with complete 
respect.

887
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,223
You should be free of bigotry.
That doesn't mean that there is a 

888
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,930
spectrum of possibilities of which that 
one is one of the default values.

889
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,570
It's simply isn't it's wrong to argue 
that,

890
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:34,703
but in the same way that feminists like 
to argue that there are no innate sex 

891
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:42,441
differences because that they think 
would help alter the sexist status quo.

892
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,790
This is what's happening with Trans 
Activism.

893
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,120
That's why they are consequentialist 
when it comes to truth,

894
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,820
screw truth,
screw reality,

895
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:55,821
screw biological common sense in the 
pursuit of freeing the world of bigotry.

896
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,703
You should be able to free the world of 
political bigotry without constantly 

897
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:03,540
attacking truth.
Well,

898
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,240
and here's the other question.
If it is not,

899
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,070
this is what I was getting at.
It is,

900
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,380
if it's not a mental disorder,
what is.

901
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:14,880
Is it a physical disorder?
Is it a disorder at all,

902
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:17,790
and if it's not a disorder,
why must it be treated medically?

903
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,580
Why must it be gender reassignment 
surgery?

904
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:23,910
Why must there be exogenous hormones 
introduced into the body?

905
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,870
Why is all that happening?
Rhetorical question or are you asking me

906
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,240
to just

907
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,840
walk up to them?
I mean,

908
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:33,400
it's kind of rhetorical.
There's no one here,

909
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:34,234
but if it's not a disorder than why are 
these gender reassignment physicians 

910
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,880
here?
If you,

911
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,900
if you don't have to have a sex change 
to be a woman.

912
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:47,950
If you're a woman with a big Dick and 
broad shoulders and a big hairy chest,

913
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,620
but you're a woman,
right?

914
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:50,913
Well,
what is the need for the doctor then if 

915
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,420
you're already a woman,
if we decided that you're a woman,

916
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,373
so you just want to change your 
appearance to outwardly match how you 

917
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:01,450
feel.

918
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,320
Well that seems a disorder.
I wonder.

919
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,910
I'm not sure,
so I don't want to misspeak,

920
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,430
but I wonder if.
I think in the DSM five,

921
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,160
gender dysphoria is listed as a 
condition.

922
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:13,020
Is that,
is that correct?

923
00:48:13,021 --> 00:48:13,650
It is

924
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:14,483
it as a condition,
but it's not accepted by that in terms 

925
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:17,864
of public perception and certainly in 
terms of trans activists or lbgt 

926
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:26,420
activists or anybody who talks about 
these things in a progressive way,

927
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,493
that is a taboo.
Like the actual medical nomenclature 

928
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:33,440
that's used to describe those conditions
is taboo.

929
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,240
Well,
there's,

930
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,440
I don't know if you heard about this 
case.

931
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:36,603
There was a physician research 
scientists at Brown University who 

932
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:44,560
published a paper,
very serious data scientific data.

933
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:47,170
I think her name is Lisa.
Simple or liberal.

934
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,380
I can't remember her name.
Uh,

935
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,290
it was published I think in a plus one,
you know,

936
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:56,080
very serious scientific journal where 
she looked at the social contagion.

937
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,270
You don't have a sort of transgenderism.
How,

938
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,120
if you know,
there definitely seems to beat well.

939
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,313
Well,
literally that is social contagion 

940
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:08,680
effect.
Now that paper was published,

941
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:09,514
Brown had advertised,
it was published in a Peer Review 

942
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,870
Journal while the Trans activist game 
after that paper and Brown decided to at

943
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:23,050
least pull it off of it's sort of 
promotional plan.

944
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,910
Uh,
I reached out actually to,

945
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,450
I think her name is Lisa,
to get her on the show,

946
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:30,600
but as you might imagine,
she was a bit tested.

947
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,280
Yeah.
She's probably shell shocked.

948
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,330
She's shellshocked and so I'm not sure 
if she'll come,

949
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,373
but again,
here's a serious person who probably 

950
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:38,440
isn't as liberal.
She's a,

951
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,780
she's a physician who deals with these 
issues,

952
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:41,883
who was simply talking about the fact 
that there's definitely a social 

953
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:48,390
contagion effect that is taking place.
She's the Nazi.

954
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,580
Yeah.
There's people just

955
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,790
really,
really crazy when it comes to gender.

956
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,013
That seems to be the battle ground,
the battle ground between logic and 

957
00:49:58,841 --> 00:49:59,674
science.
It rests in gender and I have this 

958
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:06,721
conversation with a friend of mine about
the gender pay gap and he was arguing it

959
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,483
as if it was a thing where there was a 
man and a woman working right next to 

960
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,970
each other doing the same job and the 
woman was making seventy eight cents.

961
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,650
The man is making a dollar and he's a 
smart guy and I had to explain to him,

962
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,120
I said,
this is not the case.

963
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:24,310
I go there.
They're doing different jobs.

964
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,140
They're working different hours.
I go,

965
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:27,200
you're,
you're spitting out.

966
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,010
Propaganda is

967
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,860
if it's true,
and he was reluctant to believe me.

968
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,420
He was like,
are you serious?

969
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,490
He any leary said this.
He goes,

970
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,890
I'm going to be very upset if I find out
that you're,

971
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:37,970
you're,
you're lying to me.

972
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,890
I go that I'm lying to you.
I go,

973
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:41,240
this is adorable.
You're,

974
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,860
you're going to be.
You don't even know what the fuck you're

975
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:46,580
talking about and you're going to be 
upset if you find out that online,

976
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,180
I'm going to be upset if you don't have 
fucking apologized to me when I show you

977
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:50,820
this.
So that,

978
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,810
so I know he did not.
I sent him the information,

979
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:58,370
I sent him many articles on it and I 
sent him many critiques of the way.

980
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,160
Even the president of United States was 
discussing this because they're doing it

981
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:04,160
in a very politically correct way that 
is actually disingenuous.

982
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,580
I showed him the actual raw data that 
shows that men work an average of.

983
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,053
I forget what the percentage is,
more hours that they are more likely to 

984
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:16,850
die on the job.
They pick more risky jobs.

985
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:17,684
It's a totally different thing.
This is not discounting actual sexual 

986
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,640
discrimination at work,
which I'm sure exists,

987
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,980
but this is not when you're looking at 
the raw data,

988
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,310
which is what they're trying to say,
the seventy eight cents to a dollar.

989
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,550
They're saying this is just systemic 
sexism across the board.

990
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,473
There's no other explanation for it.
So I showed him know there is other 

991
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:38,150
explanations form.
It's different jobs.

992
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,790
It's working different hours.
It's.

993
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,760
There's probably a bunch of factors,
testosterone making you more aggressive,

994
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,980
making you more risk of or more a risk 
taker.

995
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,940
Risk taking.
There's all sorts of different factors.

996
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,613
His response was sometimes the 
perception of something is as important 

997
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:55,574
as the fact I'm like you motherfucker,
I'm going to come to your house and 

998
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,270
smack you in the face in front of your 
woman.

999
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,233
You know,
but it's interesting that you say this 

1000
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:06,260
because what you are trying to do there 
is use information.

1001
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,333
Hopefully it's tsunami of information to
get them to move away from is anchored 

1002
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,394
position,
which is something that I discussed in 

1003
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:12,614
great detail in my book and I think I've
come to a similar realization to you 

1004
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:20,510
regrettably,
and that that is that oftentimes all the

1005
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:22,370
information,
the world is not going to help.

1006
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,620
It's not going to help.
He didn't want to lose.

1007
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,400
He didn't want to lose and it really is.
You're putting your hands in your lap.

1008
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,563
What he was trying to find a way to say 
by him saying that perception is 

1009
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:35,690
sometimes more important than the actual
facts.

1010
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:36,524
I'm just trying to say that he was 
trying to say that women are 

1011
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:39,884
discriminated against because these 
facts are paraded around in a way that 

1012
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:45,284
make women feel bad and because women 
feel bad that they're making seventy 

1013
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,690
eight cents to the man's dollar.

1014
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,990
That is just as important as the actual 
reality of how much they make.

1015
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,490
Am I?
God dammit.

1016
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,290
This is.
You just spun a Web.

1017
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,200
You spun a bullshit web and your.
Your legs are all trapped up in it.

1018
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,250
You can't go anywhere now.
Well,

1019
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,800
it speaks to another thing that I 
discussed in the book.

1020
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:06,080
So are you familiar with poppers,
falsification,

1021
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:06,914
principal?
No.

1022
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,320
So Karl popper was a philosopher of 
science.

1023
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:13,130
As a general rule,
I hate to read most philosophers because

1024
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:13,964
they engage in a lot of highfalutin 
bullshit that really doesn't get us 

1025
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:17,054
anywhere,
but philosophers of science actually 

1026
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:22,190
quite helpful and that they really help 
us understand the epistemology of how to

1027
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,380
learn about knowledge,
create knowledge,

1028
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,393
tests,
knowledge,

1029
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,220
and so Karl

1030
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,790
popper argued that if you really want to
test a theory,

1031
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,653
you have to be able to falsify the 
theory that which cannot be falsified 

1032
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:35,460
cannot be considered a scientific 
theory.

1033
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,950
Right?
If the observation is this way,

1034
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:38,963
it supports the theory of the 
observation is this way at falsifies a 

1035
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,690
theory.
So for example,

1036
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,870
fate is not a scientific theory,
right?

1037
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:49,200
Because if I step out of my house today 
and the truck hits me,

1038
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,183
it was my faith.
If I step out of my house and the truck 

1039
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:53,580
doesn't hit me,
it was my faith.

1040
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:57,960
So there are no conditions of the world 
where whatever is instantiated is not my

1041
00:53:57,961 --> 00:53:59,010
faith.
Therefore,

1042
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,030
fatalism is not part of the epistemology
of science.

1043
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,050
Right.
Well,

1044
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,120
so to speak to that point that we were 
talking about earlier,

1045
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,040
how when someone is anchored in a 
position,

1046
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,180
you can get them away from it.

1047
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,283
So I talk and I have a section of my 
book that is currently titled All Roads 

1048
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,820
Lead to bigotry.
All right,

1049
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:16,830
so let me give you an example.
A few examples of these.

1050
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,820
If you say that you don't want to have 
sex with overweight women,

1051
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,040
grossly overweight women,
500 pound women,

1052
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,380
then the argument is you're a fattest 
right?

1053
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,490
You are judging us based on the folds of
our skin and you're demonizing us.

1054
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,773
If you are someone who is specifically 
looking to have sex with someone who is 

1055
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:41,490
overweight,
you are fetishizing our skin folds.

1056
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,730
So if I love having sex with a fat 
woman,

1057
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,653
I'm a bad person.
If I don't want to have sex with a fat 

1058
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:48,480
woman,
I'm a bad person.

1059
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,553
And I demonstrate through many of these 
examples how all roads lead to 

1060
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:53,844
victimhood,
right?

1061
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,773
I give the example.
I think the last time I was on the show 

1062
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,760
have a woman who had done a study 
demonstrating that,

1063
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,170
uh,
uh,

1064
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,120
soldiers,
Israeli soldiers,

1065
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,180
had never raped a Palestinian woman.

1066
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,200
Do you remember that case?
Did.

1067
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:08,723
Now she,
she had done the study hoping to show 

1068
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:12,450
that there was rampant rape of senior 
women.

1069
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,463
She couldn't uncover a single documented
case of a Palestinian woman being raped 

1070
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,490
by IDF soldiers,
Israeli Defense Forces,

1071
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,740
soldiers.
What did you conclude from that?

1072
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:23,783
While the IDF soldiers are so racist,
that they demonize these women so much 

1073
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,510
that they're not even worthy of being 
raped.

1074
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,660
So if you rape the Palestinian women,
you're an evil Jew.

1075
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,880
If you don't rape any of the Palestinian
women,

1076
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,290
you're an evil Jew.
And so through all of these examples,

1077
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:45,150
I demonstrate that all states of the 
world lead to you being a bigot.

1078
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,180
And that if you like,
fails poppers,

1079
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:49,210
falsification,
principle,

1080
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,230
because I kept.
Yep.

1081
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,020
Except the state of not choosing it all.
Meaning meaning if you like,

1082
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,183
if you don't choose between a fat woman 
or if you don't love a fat woman or you 

1083
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:04,760
don't not want to have sex with a fat 
one,

1084
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,980
you just have sex with anyone who wants 
to have sex with you.

1085
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,130
Right?
Like that's the equal outcome.

1086
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,083
I mean,
essentially that's what they're looking 

1087
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:12,764
for it because if you don't choose.
But what's really interesting about 

1088
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:21,080
people is if someone doesn't have your 
principals ideologically,

1089
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,820
you're allowed to shit on them and body 
shamed them.

1090
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,100
Like how many people called

1091
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,963
Trump's disgusting and made fun of his 
little hands and how many liberals left 

1092
00:56:27,691 --> 00:56:29,380
wing people's talking about how much,
much,

1093
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,230
much.
He Ha must obviously have a little dick.

1094
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,370
Right?
Right.

1095
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,510
It's like,
yeah,

1096
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,730
it's horseshit.
Yeah.

1097
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,560
I mean,
hypocrisy is across both aisles,

1098
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,440
right?
Yeah.

1099
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,413
Speaking of which,
I don't know if you want to get into 

1100
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:42,394
this at all,
but uh,

1101
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,130
what did you think,
I know it's a bit old news now,

1102
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:45,790
but,
uh,

1103
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,070
what'd you think of some of our common 
friends?

1104
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,370
His response to the threat cavenaugh 
situation,

1105
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,410
our common friends responses.
Some of some of our common friends,

1106
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,560
I thought the not respond well,
they did not follow the into logical,

1107
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:05,200
he fails as far as I'm concerned,
like for example.

1108
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:08,080
So for example,
the presumption of innocence,

1109
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,030
it should be something that is so 
profoundly a nonstarter in terms of ever

1110
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:13,864
violating that,
that tenant that to the extent that we 

1111
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,154
didn't come infinitely close to 
establishing that he was guilty of 

1112
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:25,210
anything.
It's a nonstarter that you don't.

1113
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,373
There is no repercussions that should be
followed him and yet many folks that 

1114
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,570
both of us.
No,

1115
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,670
we're not of that opinion.
So for example,

1116
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,890
one of the,
one of our friends thought that,

1117
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,140
well,
this wasn't a criminal case,

1118
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,273
this was a job interview,
and so we don't need to reach the same 

1119
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,720
exact thing,
level of evidence,

1120
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,990
evidence to determine for him to be 
potentially guilty.

1121
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,710
I thought that was grotesque who said 
that?

1122
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,260
Uh,
his name rhymes with Sham Paris.

1123
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,083
Well,
I think people were rightly concerned 

1124
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:05,370
about Cavanaugh's ideology in terms of 
his record on privacy.

1125
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,950
Uh,
his promotion of the Patriot Act.

1126
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:11,920
There was a bunch of issues that people 
had real concern.

1127
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,670
Those seem to go away while this was all
going on,

1128
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:16,504
which is really confusing to me,
like there's real reasons to be 

1129
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:21,340
concerned about this guy.
A Jordan Jordan said,

1130
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,233
put out a tweet and I might've been the 
first one to two a critique him for 

1131
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,610
where he said,
if Kevin is confirmed,

1132
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,180
he should step down.
I thought that that was insane.

1133
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,390
Why?
Why did he say?

1134
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:37,420
He said,
well,

1135
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,450
you know,
subsequently he said,

1136
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,610
oh,
it was a thought experiment and no,

1137
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:44,500
there's no thought experiment,
right?

1138
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:45,334
I mean there wasn't any sane person 
would think that someone coming out 36 

1139
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:53,794
years after the fact,
five minutes before there's going to be 

1140
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,020
the volt saying,
well,

1141
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,100
somewhere somehow someplace.
Not sure he may have been.

1142
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:03,934
The one is not going to.
She was saying he may have been the one 

1143
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:11,110
she was saying he was the one and she 
was saying that he covered her mouth and

1144
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:14,450
that he was trying to get her pants on,
but she was wearing a one piece swimsuit

1145
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,210
and yeah,
I read into it.

1146
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,380
I don't know what happened.
That's the real problem.

1147
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,010
No one knows what happened other than

1148
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,910
her and him and both of them are dealing
with 36 year old memory,

1149
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:29,010
but I'm saying right here.
I've already said this on my show.

1150
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,130
I remember,
I think it was in 1983.

1151
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:37,131
I was at summer camp and Hillary Clinton
took me to the side and had my way.

1152
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,990
Pretty sure it was 1983 maybe in 1984.
She had her way with you.

1153
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,170
Sure.
Yeah.

1154
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,550
I'm pretty sure it was hillary.
Pretty sure.

1155
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:47,860
Uproot kindness kind of confident was 
her.

1156
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,980
Yeah.
Look,

1157
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:50,843
Elizabeth Loftus,
who is someone that I know well who's a 

1158
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:53,964
professor at Uc Irvine,
who is the preeminent researcher on 

1159
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:01,540
memory and eye witness testimony,
uh,

1160
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,440
as someone who has demonstrated through 
many,

1161
01:00:04,441 --> 01:00:09,441
many decades of research that our memory
is unbelievably inaccurate.

1162
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,183
Unbelievably.
Our ability to remember sort of to 

1163
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,080
identify someone in I testimony four 
weeks ago is unbelievably suspect,

1164
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,300
let alone 36 years ago.
That's true.

1165
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,530
So where was the science?

1166
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,653
Let me pause right there.
Because there are traumatic events that 

1167
01:00:29,691 --> 01:00:32,990
you can remember very well.
Particularly if someone tries to assault

1168
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:36,440
you or something happens to you that did
get seared into your brain.

1169
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,870
That's a fact.
I mean,

1170
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:39,890
I remember,
uh,

1171
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:41,870
I remember being beat up when I was 
seven.

1172
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,060
Right?
I'm ever being humiliated.

1173
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,460
My step dad and mom wasn't even really 
beat up.

1174
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,294
My Kid,
he'll hit me like once or twice or 

1175
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:49,520
something like that,
but I didn't do anything about it.

1176
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:52,190
I froze and I remember my stepdad came 
and rescued me.

1177
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:54,590
I remember that.
Don't remember all the details,

1178
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,070
but I do remember that I felt humiliated
and that I lost.

1179
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,740
And I do remember that my Stepdad had a 
rescue me.

1180
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:01,783
I remember that.
Like you can remember stuff from 36 

1181
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,750
years ago is.
It is possible.

1182
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,440
But the problem with this story is that 
they were drinking.

1183
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,140
There were underage.
They were really young.

1184
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,093
Okay.
So you're dealing with all these 

1185
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:18,614
factors.
There was some sort of interaction 

1186
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,270
physically,
you know,

1187
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:27,860
was she somewhat willing?
Will she somewhat into him?

1188
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:31,010
Was she completely resistant to it?
I don't know.

1189
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,840
She doesn't know.
He doesn't know,

1190
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,800
but there's no demonstrated pattern of 
him doing awful things.

1191
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,080
And then on top of that,
there was a couple,

1192
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:47,170
at least two people that had completely 
fraudulent claims that came out and they

1193
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,910
were ideologically,
ideologically opposed to him.

1194
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,230
So they had concocted these stories that
turned out to fall apart.

1195
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,460
Here's my feeling on that.
If someone does that intentionally,

1196
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,040
they should receive the same kind of 
punishment.

1197
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,920
I could not agree with that.
Someone would get,

1198
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,143
if they were convicted of those acts 
written an article on this actually 

1199
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:08,640
strips.
If you,

1200
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,120
if you falsely accuse someone of rape,
intentionally,

1201
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:14,600
falsely accuse someone of rape,
you are literally subjecting them to the

1202
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:17,300
punishment of rape.
What if the prosecution goes through?

1203
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,950
What if that person winds up getting 
incarcerated,

1204
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,890
locked in a cage,
separated from their family,

1205
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,260
kids taken away their ability to earn a 
living?

1206
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,190
You should be treated the same way you 
were trying to get them to be treated.

1207
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,190
I think it is almost an equal act to 
rape itself.

1208
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,970
You know,
and I hope I almost,

1209
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,000
I hope not,
doesn't have physical violence.

1210
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,400
I'm going to go further than you.
Maybe it's going to get me into trouble.

1211
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,473
I almost would argue that it is more 
diabolical because the rapist does a 

1212
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:43,734
horrific act on you once every single 
morning that you wake up as a false 

1213
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,193
accuser knowing that you have put this 
person in prison and you go about your 

1214
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:54,354
day,
you're engaging in this form of rape if 

1215
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:56,664
you'd like,
so I would disagree with that because I 

1216
01:02:58,081 --> 01:02:58,914
think if you rape someone,
that person who got raped has to deal 

1217
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:02,304
with that.
The real pain of being physically 

1218
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,060
violated.

1219
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,700
The guy who was in prison for 25 years 
in getting raped by seven guys,

1220
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:13,200
guys got to learn how to fight and keep 
your butt cheeks closed and keep moving.

1221
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:15,780
And by the way,
both of them are awful.

1222
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:19,530
I think the rapist is far more awful 
because it's physically doing something.

1223
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,670
I had a guy on my show maybe you know,
I've had maybe not as many people as you

1224
01:03:23,671 --> 01:03:24,504
have,
but I've had quite a few amazing people 

1225
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:26,484
on my show.
One of the most poignant ones was a 

1226
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:33,060
gentleman that I invited and I was lucky
that he accepted my invitation.

1227
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,400
Was his,
I think his name is David Mccallum.

1228
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:39,400
Mccallum a sort of maybe last January.
He had just.

1229
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,373
He had been released from I think almost
three decades in prison for a murder 

1230
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:47,070
that came up.
That wasn't him who did it.

1231
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,700
Now.
The reason why I invited him a more than

1232
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,534
just because it's an incredible story is
that I had seen his response to the 

1233
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,100
unimaginable injustice that he had gone 
through.

1234
01:03:59,100 --> 01:03:59,933
I think he went in when he was 17 and 
now he was in his late forties and he 

1235
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:08,160
had such grace,
such lack of anger.

1236
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:09,623
I mean it literally was.
He was Buddha and so I thought how 

1237
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:13,524
powerful it would be to have this person
come on my show if only to tap into 

1238
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,380
this.
Unbelievable.

1239
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,180
I mean,
and I told them,

1240
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:25,800
I think on the show that if it were me,
I would be so eaten up by anger,

1241
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:30,490
by a sense of revenge.
I want to burn the whole planet down a.

1242
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,550
anyways,
this is a great guy.

1243
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:34,670
You should definitely check him out.
He's written a book about it.

1244
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,830
It's really an amazing story.
Yeah.

1245
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,733
False accusations are awful and and and 
people who are people who lie to try to 

1246
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:43,734
punish someone who didn't do anything,
that's an awful crime and I think it 

1247
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:47,844
should be equal in punishment to the 
crime that you are falsely accusing 

1248
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,890
someone of doing.
I really do.

1249
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:53,993
I think that's the only way to stop it.
The real problem was with false rape 

1250
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:57,924
accusations is that there's very little 
punishment at all that happens to the 

1251
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:03,390
women for the most part,
or the men,

1252
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:06,000
men who are accused men of falsely 
raping them.

1253
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,820
There's very,
very little happen.

1254
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:08,820
Why?
Why do you think that is?

1255
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,220
I don't know.
I don't understand.

1256
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,054
I don't understand why people don't 
think about it as the horrific thing 

1257
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:16,890
that it actually is.
I think it's partly because people are

1258
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,550
of doubting someone who has been raped,
if you will.

1259
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,660
One of the more horrific things you 
could do is like imagine if you had been

1260
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:26,494
raped and then you told your story and I
came along and I have no knowledge of 

1261
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:34,360
the actual event and I come along and I 
go,

1262
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,970
God's a liar.
This is bullshit.

1263
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:39,190
It never happened.
Nothing happened to him,

1264
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:41,530
he's just a baby.
He just wants attention.

1265
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:44,830
So he's running around here.
He was wearing a short skirt and he went

1266
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:46,980
out that night and you know,
and that's,

1267
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:52,170
that is something that does happen.
So I think that is so disgusting.

1268
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,860
Someone who doubts someone who has 
actually been a victim,

1269
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,173
that people are scared of that.
And then also there's the kid gloves 

1270
01:06:00,761 --> 01:06:01,594
approach.
We don't treat women accusing men of 

1271
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:09,511
things the same way we accused women 
accused men accusing women of things.

1272
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,060
Men accusing women to things where if a 
man accuses a woman of violence,

1273
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,850
will you okay dude,
you're going to be fine.

1274
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,730
If a woman beats up her husband,
which does happen.

1275
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:19,923
I mean I know a guy whose girlfriend 
used to punch the shit out of him and I 

1276
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:22,960
was like,
Bro,

1277
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,470
you got to get out like you are.
You're literally being abused.

1278
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,403
You're,
you're being domestically abused and no 

1279
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:31,900
one's even going to care.
Do you understand that?

1280
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:34,030
You've got to get out of this 
relationship because look,

1281
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,370
if you are hitting her,
if a man is hitting a woman,

1282
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:39,370
then I'm locked that motherfucker up.
That's how I feel,

1283
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,830
and I'm sure that's how you feel too.
That guy's a piece of shit.

1284
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,590
But if a woman hits a man,
I'm like,

1285
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:44,800
just keep your hands up,
man.

1286
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:45,634
Don't let her hit.
Yeah,

1287
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:49,390
I just,
but this is from me.

1288
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,260
A man whose friend was murdered by his 
wife.

1289
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,080
One of my good friends.
Oh,

1290
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,990
Phil Hartman.
More by his wife.

1291
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:02,350
So this is a woman who was always 
insulting him,

1292
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:07,530
always publicly humiliated.
Saw this during her publicly humiliated,

1293
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,310
insult him.
I sought many times.

1294
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,940
She's a very angry person.
She had a cocaine problem.

1295
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:16,450
She was also on Zoloft.
They want some sort of a settlement with

1296
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:17,284
zoloft.
The family did because she was doing 

1297
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:22,750
cocaine and Zoloft at the same time and 
it's known to have a psychotic reaction,

1298
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,000
but she shot him in his fucking sleep,
man.

1299
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,590
I mean,
women do commit violence.

1300
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,080
It's not as common,
but it's still gross.

1301
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:29,943
It's still an egregious crime,
but good luck trying to go get someone 

1302
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:33,184
locked up for it.
Good luck getting anybody to be 

1303
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:36,190
sympathetic.
Even me.

1304
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,083
Did you ever.
I mean,

1305
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:37,880
not that I have your.
Well,

1306
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,410
I met your wife.

1307
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,210
She's a lovely woman.
If she kicked your ass,

1308
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:42,210
I'll probably be on her side.
You're probably wondering how.

1309
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:45,140
How is someone so gorgeous as her choose
me?

1310
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,520
You're,
you're thinking that I know.

1311
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,140
Have you out of here.
Thank you buddy.

1312
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,420
I wanted to actually share with you and 
I was.

1313
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,040
I was hoping to only discuss this for 
you to only see it in the book,

1314
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,290
but I can't.
You open me up,

1315
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,120
Joe Rogan.
I can't help but cheer.

1316
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:07,000
I came close to probably being a victim 
of some very serious.

1317
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,920
I've never been sexually abused or 
anything,

1318
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:12,270
but I think I escaped one narrowly,
uh,

1319
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,840
when I was a child in Lebanon.
Oh,

1320
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,100
so this was during

1321
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,340
the civil war.
This is all discussed in the intro to my

1322
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:20,750
forthcoming book.
Uh,

1323
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,393
it was during the height of the Ami,
the start of the civil war where nobody 

1324
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:27,110
would leave the house.
I mean,

1325
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,340
everybody's been butchered,
left,

1326
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:28,881
right,
and center.

1327
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:31,790
We're trying to leave Lebanon for 
obvious reasons.

1328
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,790
My father had been stuck out of the 
country.

1329
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:38,210
He couldn't get back into Lebanon.
It was myself,

1330
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,710
my mother,
uh,

1331
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,583
I believe my sister was there and a male
friend of ours who was stuck at our 

1332
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:47,120
house.
And in the middle of the night there's a

1333
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:50,960
knock on our door now.
This is in the middle of the most brutal

1334
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,510
civil war you could imagine.
So if somebody knocks at your door,

1335
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:56,450
it's usually not a good thing.
And the,

1336
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,810
I go to the door to answer,
speaking about remembering,

1337
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,190
you were saying earlier,
this is,

1338
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,920
I'm 11 years old,
uh,

1339
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,080
or at least at the cusp of turning 11,
uh,

1340
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:07,250
I get to the door.

1341
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,810
Who is this?
Uh,

1342
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,733
the gentleman says it's me.
I can't remember if his name was 

1343
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,370
Mohammed,
one of the two.

1344
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,140
He says,
it's so and so.

1345
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,690
Who's this now?
At the time in Lebanon,

1346
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,553
in our kitchen we had.
Do you remember how in restaurants in 

1347
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:23,930
the old days you'd have these in the 
bathrooms,

1348
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:28,190
you'd have these sort of towels that you
could use to wipe your hands?

1349
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,060
Not,
not,

1350
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,510
not disposable time,
actual cloth towels.

1351
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,793
So we had a service where this gentleman
with come and in our kitchen we had one 

1352
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,540
of these days he would pick them up,
launder them,

1353
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,493
and then bring them back.
So this gentleman who that's our only 

1354
01:09:44,511 --> 01:09:45,344
relationship with him,
knocks at our door with some other guys 

1355
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,511
and says,
hey,

1356
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:53,030
open the door now.
This is in the middle of the civil war.

1357
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:55,850
Now if at that moment I opened that 
door,

1358
01:09:55,851 --> 01:09:58,100
if I don't have the instinct to go call 
my mother,

1359
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,470
I don't know what the trajectory would 
be,

1360
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,150
so I go to get my mother and now the 
guy's growing more insistent.

1361
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,643
We call anyways.
There's a whole interaction that takes 

1362
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:10,280
place,
but we refuse to open the door for him.

1363
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,870
At the time there was still some sort of
police presence in Lebanon.

1364
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:16,103
The unit used to be called 16 in Arabic.
The number 16 maybe for the precinct or 

1365
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:21,950
whatever we call them up.
They come over,

1366
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,580
the guy comes in and the the policeman 
says to him,

1367
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,443
what are you doing here?
Knocking on people's door in the middle 

1368
01:10:28,621 --> 01:10:29,960
of the civil war says,
oh,

1369
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:34,700
we went up to the mountains.
We brought some Pama grades for them and

1370
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:35,534
so the police man looks at him and says,
you don't know these people other than 

1371
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:43,160
changing their towel in the middle of 
this brutal civil war.

1372
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,310
You're coming here to give them these 
fruits.

1373
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,020
If I ever catch you here again,
you know,

1374
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,240
whatever.
And then the guy looks at us and says,

1375
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,970
I'll be back for you or something.
That.

1376
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,013
And within a week or two,
I can't remember the exact time period 

1377
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:00,710
we had left.
Now I'm almost certain,

1378
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,180
I don't know,
I'm surmising,

1379
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:07,430
but I'm almost certain that this guy 
with his buddies was coming over,

1380
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,670
not because he wanted to share a coffee 
and cookies and my feeling is some bad

1381
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,120
stuff would have happened that night.
But through the grace of the cosmos,

1382
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,920
we were protected.
So because I've.

1383
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:20,754
I've often been asked what was the 
scariest moment you had in the civil 

1384
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:24,990
war,
and there were many,

1385
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:26,370
many,
many things that I saw,

1386
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:27,204
but nothing scared me as much as that 
interaction because I sort of pretty 

1387
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:32,814
much knew what was in store for us.
Dehumanizing that happens during war 

1388
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,240
leads to all sorts of horrific acts,
you know,

1389
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,480
it's disgusting and scary,
you know,

1390
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,151
uh,
you,

1391
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:43,770
uh,
you probably dodged a bullet.

1392
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,680
I related the logical and we're so 
fortunate to have left.

1393
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:47,523
I've,
I've actually been asked to go back to 

1394
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:52,950
Lebanon many times and at this point by 
some pretty prominent people,

1395
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:56,700
big politicians and so on,
and I really have a mental block.

1396
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:58,920
I even get Lebanese folks saying,
listen,

1397
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:01,230
we,
we know people who will protect you.

1398
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:01,980
And so on.
I do.

1399
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:02,813
Do you live in Canada?
Announced one of the greatest countries 

1400
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:05,460
in the world's ever known.
Why?

1401
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:06,241
Go back?
Yeah.

1402
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:08,280
Fuck that.
You guys come to me.

1403
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,040
Come visit Toronto.
The Fuck Outta here.

1404
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,610
Toronto's amazing.
He likes it.

1405
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,630
I love it.
It's one of my favorite cities.

1406
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,190
You know,
one of the things I love about it,

1407
01:12:17,191 --> 01:12:20,610
it's like a big city,
but the people are friendly,

1408
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:22,410
like it's a small town.
Right?

1409
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,390
I don't know how the hell you guys 
pulled that off.

1410
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,790
We're just good people.
Do you feel.

1411
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:30,090
Do you feel a difference between 
Montreal and Toronto?

1412
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:31,860
Because Toronto better.
Sorry,

1413
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,790
Montrio.
You heard me pull?

1414
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:36,940
I do.
I like what?

1415
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,460
What is it that you don't like about 
Michelle?

1416
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,200
I do love Montreal.
Montreal.

1417
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,970
It is the conflict.
Like the French English.

1418
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,170
Yeah.
That conflict seems to me silly.

1419
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,790
Ridiculous.
The idea that you're going to succeed.

1420
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:51,990
Yeah.
Good luck.

1421
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,150
Yeah,
get you're going to leave Canada.

1422
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,043
Okay.
Congratulations going to be your own 

1423
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:57,310
country that nobody goes to.
Right?

1424
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,800
We're going to make everybody speak 
French.

1425
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,520
That's so stupid.
In the main.

1426
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,463
They put French signs everywhere I get.
They're trying to like cling onto their 

1427
01:13:04,081 --> 01:13:06,000
culture.
I get it and the culture is wonderful.

1428
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,610
The food's fantastic.
There's great people in Montreal.

1429
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,560
Beautiful women.
Yeah,

1430
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:11,280
they're beautiful.
I Love Montreal,

1431
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,710
but I love to run a more.
Sorry.

1432
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,760
Incidentally,
I'm,

1433
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,100
I'm,
I learned French before I did English,

1434
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:17,934
so I'm a more francophone through,
through history and I fully agree with 

1435
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:23,970
you about the stupidity of the French 
protection.

1436
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,490
So I,
so yeah,

1437
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:29,370
I was invited once.
This was probably in the late nineties.

1438
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,250
I had been a professor a few years.
I was invited by,

1439
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,303
uh,
one of the big business schools in 

1440
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:35,410
Montreal.
AGC,

1441
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,290
uh,
which is a French acronym.

1442
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:38,423
I'd been invited to give a talk there.
They were interested in potentially 

1443
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,730
making me an offer and so I said,
are you,

1444
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,650
I'm,
I'm assuming that I'm getting my talking

1445
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:47,790
in English,
right?

1446
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:48,624
Because I mean,
my whole scientific career has been in 

1447
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:51,420
English even though I'm fluent in 
French.

1448
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,121
He said,
no,

1449
01:13:52,121 --> 01:13:52,381
no,
no,

1450
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,210
we'd really like you to give it in 
French.

1451
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:58,080
And I thought that that was so paisanos 
parochial.

1452
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,270
It was so small minded.
Right.

1453
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,153
I mean,
I mean,

1454
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,390
you don't see Israeli people saying,
hey,

1455
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,090
how come we're not doing this in Hebrew?
You don't see the Japanese saying,

1456
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:08,220
why isn't this happening in Japanese?
Right.

1457
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,520
The two groups that I see doing this are
the Germans

1458
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,390
and the French,
uh,

1459
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,210
but whether it be in Quebec or in 
France,

1460
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:20,350
and I think it's in part because they 
don't accept that they no longer the big

1461
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:22,450
bully of the world.
Right.

1462
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:26,470
The positive side would be that they're 
just celebrating this language.

1463
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:28,143
They appreciate their heritage,
but you shouldn't be protecting your 

1464
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:33,190
heritage through draconian means.
Correct.

1465
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:37,060
So when you have language police going 
around measuring whether the French sign

1466
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:40,480
is bigger than the English one,
you're getting stuck in the weeds,

1467
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,081
right?
Yeah.

1468
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:41,914
That is a weird one that they do,
but it's such a beautiful city and the 

1469
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:48,910
people were really nice there too.
And they're hardy people in Montreal and

1470
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,310
Toronto.
They're hardy folk because the winter,

1471
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:52,380
I think it mentioned,
yeah,

1472
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,343
you got to deal with shit.
You got to deal with adversity over 

1473
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,520
there.
But it's interesting in that there is so

1474
01:14:57,521 --> 01:14:58,354
much nicer than the people that deal 
with the adversity in the cold climates 

1475
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:02,680
in,
in America.

1476
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:03,903
There's something about the United 
States when you deal with the cold 

1477
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:07,750
climate,
people are mean.

1478
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,350
I've been asked,
and I don't think I had an answer,

1479
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:13,030
maybe,
I think it was rubin who asked me,

1480
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:14,123
why do you think that many of the sort 
of people on the forefront of the 

1481
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,390
freedom of speech,
you know,

1482
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:24,430
the debate all stem from Canada and I 
don't think I had a good reason.

1483
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:25,504
Do you have any,
any thoughts as to why is it just a 

1484
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:29,930
freedom of speech laws,
right?

1485
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:33,490
That's one of the reasons so that it 
does not have a first amendment.

1486
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,383
So Canada is not have the same with what
we have here in the United States is 

1487
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:39,604
fucking beautiful.
It's one of the only places on earth 

1488
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:44,703
where it is literally a part of our law 
that you should be able to express 

1489
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:54,211
yourself freely and that this ethic is 
something that permeates our culture.

1490
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:57,820
It permeates our identity.
It's something that we all cling to.

1491
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,893
Freedom of speech is a very important.
And this is one of the reasons why we 

1492
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:03,304
get so stunned when we see censorship 
and when we see censorship that's just 

1493
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,980
doesn't make any sense,
right?

1494
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:13,240
It's not justified.
Um,

1495
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,810
what you guys have over there is a much 
more slippery slope,

1496
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:17,853
human rights councils and all that 
weirdness that we've seen time and time 

1497
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,780
again with people getting fined for 
jokes.

1498
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,100
You know what I mean?
There's,

1499
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:27,963
there's a lot of like very,
very weird stuff that you guys have to 

1500
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:34,210
deal with up there because you simply 
don't have a first amendment.

1501
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:35,650
So you're saying that,
that,

1502
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,573
that causes more people to come out of 
kind of the defending freedom of speech 

1503
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:42,880
because because you realize how 
important it is and you're right next to

1504
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:43,540
us,
right?

1505
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:44,373
You're right.
We're all spouting off at the mouth and 

1506
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:47,950
fucking shoot nuclear bombs into the 
atmosphere.

1507
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:48,880
I mean,
this,

1508
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,120
you're living next to a bunch of fucking
wild hillbillies is what it's like.

1509
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,760
This is what it's like.
If you're living in Canada,

1510
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:55,594
you're living next to the United States.
Like what are those fucking crazy 

1511
01:16:57,581 --> 01:17:00,310
assholes doing?
But at least those crazy ass schools can

1512
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:02,050
say whatever they want.
Right?

1513
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,183
I mean,
who knows if this podcast would be even 

1514
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:08,770
possible in Canada,
I don't know.

1515
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,070
I,
we could have gotten

1516
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,500
in trouble for some of the things that 
we've said along the way.

1517
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,900
It's entirely likely a speaking of,
uh,

1518
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,060
because you,
you mentioned the human rights tribunal.

1519
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:25,061
I think at one point a I discussed on 
the show the indigenous woman who argued

1520
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,080
that she should get tenure despite not 
having published anything.

1521
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:30,980
Do you,
do you know that story?

1522
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,330
Don't let me,
let me,

1523
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:38,000
let me restate that story or maybe state
it for the first time because it,

1524
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,600
it relates to something bigger than I'd 
like to discuss in the Canadian context.

1525
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:42,973
So there's this now push and Canadian 
universities to have what's called to 

1526
01:17:46,551 --> 01:17:50,180
indigenize.
The university's okay.

1527
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:53,360
To indigenize means many things.
So in one case,

1528
01:17:53,361 --> 01:17:55,400
the case that I just mentioned briefly 
before,

1529
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,503
you had a professor in the law faculty 
at the University of British Columbia 

1530
01:17:59,601 --> 01:18:02,780
who was an indigenous woman who had not 
published much,

1531
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:04,660
if anything and had got,
had,

1532
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,980
had been given every single opportunity,
you know,

1533
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,320
extensions on her tenure clock and so 
on.

1534
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:11,650
And then finally,
when she didn't get tenure,

1535
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,493
she filed a complaint with the British 
Columbia human rights tribunal arguing 

1536
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:18,374
that her tradition is an oral one,
and therefore by forcing her to write 

1537
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:23,750
things down,
you know,

1538
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:26,840
as a,
as an academic wise,

1539
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,400
right?
I mean it's unbelievable.

1540
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:33,590
So saying her tradition is being on land
and you shouldn't be forcing you to swim

1541
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,020
in a swimming event.
Exactly right.

1542
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:40,520
By the way,
Judaism is based also on oral tradition.

1543
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:41,354
So by that logic,
all those Jewish scientists who won 

1544
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:44,114
Nobel prizes,
but the more nefarious manifestation of 

1545
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:51,770
and the generalization,
while there are two other instances,

1546
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:55,280
one annoying but not so serious,
and one I think very serious,

1547
01:18:55,610 --> 01:19:00,170
the annoying but not so serious is where
now at every single event and can't.

1548
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:02,720
And Canadian University,
let's say you're giving out diplomas,

1549
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:08,050
you have to first sell flagellate at an 
apologize for sitting on stolen land,

1550
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:09,080
right?

1551
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,080
So here are students who have spent 
years getting their degrees.

1552
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,780
This is their moment to shine.
This is about them.

1553
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:15,853
But you have to first hear about why 
we're all evil because we've 

1554
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:22,310
transgressing on native land.
That's one example.

1555
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:23,563
The more serious example is where it is 
no longer appropriate to say that the 

1556
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:33,731
scientific method is the way of knowing 
that there are alternate ways of knowing

1557
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:36,590
that are just as valid and what are 
those.

1558
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:39,380
So for example,
in the indigenous way of knowing,

1559
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:40,663
uh,
now I've argued that when it comes to 

1560
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:45,740
content specific knowledge,
for example,

1561
01:19:45,741 --> 01:19:46,574
if you're going to study something in 
the deep north where the inuits have 

1562
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:51,914
lived for thousands of years,
they're going to have local knowledge 

1563
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,610
about the flora,
about the fauna.

1564
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:02,360
That is truly a valuable.
But that's,

1565
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,270
that is in fact scientific knowledge.
But exactly,

1566
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,670
that's exactly what.
But,

1567
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,900
but,
but I'm saying that,

1568
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,780
that's why I'm saying it's a content 
specific.

1569
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,023
Okay.
We should be appreciative of that 

1570
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:15,234
knowledge and listened to it,
but that doesn't mean that speaks to 

1571
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:21,450
your point that it is outside the 
purview of the scientific method.

1572
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:26,451
There is no episode homology that there 
is no Lebanese Jewish way of knowing.

1573
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:27,804
There is no Joe Rogan way of knowing.
There isn't any transgender way of 

1574
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:32,874
knowing this information.
It's just the scientific method that's 

1575
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:37,770
the only game in town.
While they're arguing that,

1576
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:38,604
no,
there are ways of not just like the 

1577
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:43,260
Hashtag science must fall.
I mentioned this on the Ruben report,

1578
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:46,260
judge agreement with this Hashtag 
seismic fault.

1579
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,880
Yeah.
This is what's going to rise.

1580
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,510
They're called,
they're called [inaudible].

1581
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,393
Actually this is.
This came out of the University of Cape 

1582
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:54,623
Town,
one of the top universities in South 

1583
01:20:55,770 --> 01:21:00,770
Africa where the students were arguing 
that it is ridiculous that we only abide

1584
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,970
by the scientific method.

1585
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:06,750
There are all sorts of other Booga Booga
ways of knowing that are just.

1586
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:07,613
I mean,
I'm using google.

1587
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:08,483
Yeah,
but you know what I mean,

1588
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,363
right.
You could dance and make the rain come 

1589
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:11,950
down,
you know,

1590
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,420
whatever.
I mean it like spiritual shamanism,

1591
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:16,254
ways of knowing that are,
that are outside the purview of the 

1592
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:19,494
scientific method and that is grotesque.
And so one of the things that I argue 

1593
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,063
probably doesn't make me a lot of 
friends at the university is that there 

1594
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:29,850
is no indigenous way of knowing,
please.

1595
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:32,850
She's Google.
Hashtag science must fall.

1596
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,713
I need to remember those.
He a website for know your meme and I 

1597
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:37,530
got the video of where it starts.
There you go.

1598
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,520
See,
doctor,

1599
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,290
sad proves to be true.
Again,

1600
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:43,480
I have a feeling this is a four Chan 
thing that's real,

1601
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,433
or three years old.
He's made that largest in my shitty 

1602
01:21:47,581 --> 01:21:47,820
eyes.

1603
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,000
Could read it.
Science must fall as a Hashtag mocking a

1604
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:52,740
movement to abolish the science.
Oh,

1605
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:53,730
it's marketing.
No,

1606
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,170
but the original idea is that you should
decolonize your mind.

1607
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,060
I understand,
but it's mocking that movement,

1608
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,953
mocking a movement to abolish the 
scientific method and replace it with a 

1609
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:04,314
new understanding of scientific inquiry.
This movement was started by a group of 

1610
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:07,974
students known as follows at the 
University of Cape Town who want to 

1611
01:22:10,571 --> 01:22:11,404
decolonize science from Western 
modernity as an offshoot of the ongoing 

1612
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,160
fees must fall movement protesting 
increases in university tuition.

1613
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,100
That's one thing.
Can I ask going forward to know that you

1614
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:28,101
guys have tuition way lower healthcare 
and student.

1615
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,000
We pay for it with taxes,
right?

1616
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:31,380
Yeah,
but it's worth it.

1617
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,910
I mean,
I've said time and time.

1618
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,630
Look,
I,

1619
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:39,270
I believe in the hybrid form of,
of governing.

1620
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,600
In a hybrid form of culture,
and I think that,

1621
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:45,390
um,
I've supported a lot of socialized ideas

1622
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,543
and one of the reasons why is because I 
see socialism work with the fire 

1623
01:22:48,871 --> 01:22:50,730
department,
with the police department,

1624
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:51,863
with,
with things that we all agreed that 

1625
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:53,964
we're going to chip in and pay for,
and the fact that we don't do this with 

1626
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,870
healthcare,
that,

1627
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,880
you know,
if my neighbor gets sick,

1628
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,950
the community has to chip in.

1629
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,813
God dammit,
that guy's been paying taxes his whole 

1630
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:06,370
life.
He's a viable part of the community.

1631
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:07,443
We should be taking care of our own.
This should be a primary thing like 

1632
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:12,250
this.
To strengthen our community,

1633
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:15,600
to strengthen our civilization.
One of the primary things you wish you'd

1634
01:23:15,601 --> 01:23:20,601
be taking care of each other physically.
There should be like above.

1635
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:22,540
All right?
Education.

1636
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,310
You shouldn't have to fucking be in 
debt.

1637
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:26,920
A quarter million dollars.
If you get a fucking education.

1638
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:28,023
Don't we want less losers?
Don't we want more people to have 

1639
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:33,100
education?
Do we want more people to have some sort

1640
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:37,450
of pathway to success?
Wouldn't that just logically lead to a,

1641
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:41,290
a stronger economy,
a stronger communities?

1642
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,960
Stronger civilization when it was that 
logical.

1643
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:48,961
Let me give a devil's advocate advocate 
answer to the extent that they are now,

1644
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:52,630
no longer any barriers to entry to get 
into university.

1645
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,550
Certainly in Canada at least not a 
financial one.

1646
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:55,803
You get,
I think a misallocation of talent and 

1647
01:23:59,051 --> 01:23:59,884
resources where everybody feels 
compelled to go to university where in 

1648
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:06,100
reality many of the folks in question 
and believe me,

1649
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:08,290
I'm the last guy to argue against 
education,

1650
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:09,970
right?
I'm all about lifelong learning,

1651
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:14,950
but it doesn't have to be through the 
formal channels of getting a degree,

1652
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:15,813
but that's not compulsory at.
Well it is compulsory unofficially in 

1653
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,764
that it is now no longer acceptable to 
not have at least some entry level 

1654
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:25,923
degree.
Well then we should concentrate on that 

1655
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:28,060
as an issue.
Right?

1656
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:29,230
Okay.
That should be the issue.

1657
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:30,064
Not this idea that somehow or another 
education should be expensive so it 

1658
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:36,750
should be difficult.
So it should be something that it's only

1659
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,830
sought out by people.
Fair enough.

1660
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:40,000
So.
So I agree.

1661
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:41,740
It should.
The barrier to entry shouldn't be that,

1662
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:42,653
you know,
it's the finances that don't allow you 

1663
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,150
to pursue your interests,
but I know,

1664
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:48,670
I mean just as a professor for 25 years 
now,

1665
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,103
there are students that I see very early
and in a given semester that I know 

1666
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:58,270
they're not there or they're not there 
for intrinsic reasons.

1667
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,823
They just don't have the sparkle in 
their eyes and no amount of coaxing on 

1668
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:05,200
my part is ever going to bring them out.
I mean I try,

1669
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,063
I think everybody's redeemable,
but you can tell that they're there 

1670
01:25:08,321 --> 01:25:11,800
because they don't have.
Maybe those people would have had a much

1671
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:16,900
more lucrative trajectory where they 
pursue trade school.

1672
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:18,503
So.
So I think we have to also be careful 

1673
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:22,480
about how to allocate the talent that we
have.

1674
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:23,883
I know that that absolutely makes sense 
and I think that is most likely played 

1675
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:31,260
out over the difficulty of pursuing an 
education.

1676
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,220
Right?
Just like it is with everything else.

1677
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,720
Everything else,
like whatever,

1678
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,370
whatever you want to be a standup 
comedian.

1679
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:39,130
It's not everybody gets to do Carnegie 
Hall.

1680
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,630
Like there's,
there's a,

1681
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:41,973
there's a weeding out process of the 
difficulty of achieving success and 

1682
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,713
there's a lot of people that fall by the
wayside and don't make it and this is 

1683
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:50,590
just natural.
It's a natural part of the process,

1684
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:52,600
but if you say not everybody is a 
comedian,

1685
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,673
that's true,
but open mike nights available to 

1686
01:25:55,571 --> 01:25:56,404
everybody.
True and that's why there's so many 

1687
01:25:57,701 --> 01:25:58,534
comedians that actually are good because
they do find it through because there's 

1688
01:26:01,211 --> 01:26:03,920
no financial barrier to entry.
If it

1689
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,833
costs $35,000
a year to pursue an education in comedy 

1690
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:10,124
and you had to be $200,000
in debt before you could make a living 

1691
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:12,914
on the road,
right?

1692
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,083
There wouldn't be a goddamn thing.
The laugh at there wouldn't be none of 

1693
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:18,434
us.
There'd be zero of us and that's not a 

1694
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:21,554
good x.
it's not a good example because 

1695
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:27,170
obviously comedy is one of the rare 
things that is self-educated process.

1696
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:29,060
You have to yourself taught.
There's no other way.

1697
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,223
You just have to pursue it,
but I think there's the rigidness of 

1698
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:35,640
university studies,
you know,

1699
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,493
the rigidness of courses of,
of determining what people should and 

1700
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:40,544
shouldn't learn what they should and 
shouldn't be educated in who also the 

1701
01:26:45,171 --> 01:26:47,360
randomness of the professors that you 
get.

1702
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:51,030
Like you could get you and get a 
wonderful education I'm sure.

1703
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,043
Or you get some dipshit and get taught 
about how gender is a social construct 

1704
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:57,913
and you know,
you're sitting in class all baffled 

1705
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:00,134
looking at your penis going,
what have you done to me fucking 

1706
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:03,164
monster.

1707
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:04,363
You know,
it's,

1708
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:05,783
I'm at the point now in my career as a 
professor where I'm facing a bit of a 

1709
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:15,671
fork and that I remain as passionate 
about teaching students,

1710
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,110
but the meat,
this medium,

1711
01:27:18,111 --> 01:27:18,944
right.
Appearing on Joe Rogan and then having 

1712
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:25,970
10 million people watch and maybe maybe 
be excited about evolutionary psychology

1713
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:27,433
is so much of a bigger platform that it 
causes me at times a bit of an angst 

1714
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:33,824
when I have to put in all the efforts 
that I have to put in to teach a class 

1715
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:38,084
of 14 people.
Not that each of those mines is not 

1716
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:44,210
worthy of being educated and being 
inspired and so on.

1717
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,373
Uh,
but I am facing at this point in my 

1718
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:47,931
career,
you know,

1719
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:48,764
I'm a mid career point in my life where 
I could turn on my laptop and put up 

1720
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:55,850
anything and you know,
25,000

1721
01:27:55,851 --> 01:27:57,800
people will watch it.
This is nothing compared to your farm,

1722
01:27:57,801 --> 01:28:01,490
but it's $25,000
in terms of his classroom size.

1723
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,800
Exactly.
Arena full of people.

1724
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,960
And so I think that's one of the things 
that,

1725
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,670
uh,
I now struggle with.

1726
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:10,760
I always remain as passionate once I 
walk into class.

1727
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:12,920
I'm just as passionate just as 
committed.

1728
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:16,100
But to the extent that we have this 
fixed pie of time,

1729
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:21,430
it becomes so difficult to ever have the
twelfth students went out against the 12

1730
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:22,980
million students.

1731
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:23,813
Here would be my perspective and maybe 
this can enhance this experience for 

1732
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:29,594
you.
I would treat it the same way that a 

1733
01:28:31,881 --> 01:28:32,714
comedian treats performing live.
Like I do this podcast and every time I 

1734
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:38,720
do this podcast,
I'm reaching millions of people.

1735
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:39,590
What if I decided,
well,

1736
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,720
you know what?
I can't do the improv anymore.

1737
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:44,510
It's only 190 people do the comedy 
store.

1738
01:28:44,511 --> 01:28:46,570
It's only 400 people in the main room.
That's not,

1739
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:48,650
that's too good analogy.
Too small,

1740
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,680
but doing that,
doing,

1741
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,730
you know,
the belly room,

1742
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:54,650
70 people in the comedy store,
belly room,

1743
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,470
doing those little small room hones your
skills.

1744
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,990
It actually keeps you tied into people 
too.

1745
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:02,220
It keeps you engaged with individual

1746
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,020
human beings.
It keeps you real.

1747
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,130
It's interesting that you say that is 
because uh,

1748
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:06,810
this,
uh,

1749
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:07,643
I had an MBA,
I was teaching mba course this semester 

1750
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:13,140
where we had to miss two classes,
one because it was Canadian thanksgiving

1751
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:13,974
on a Monday,
and then there was the provincial 

1752
01:29:15,781 --> 01:29:18,120
Canadian thanksgiving can.
What does that mean?

1753
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:23,121
The real Thanksgiving first or ours?
Ours is the second Monday in October.

1754
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,800
That's ridiculous,
right?

1755
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:30,180
Yours is also called a Greenbay plays 
Dallas.

1756
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:31,493
That's called American thanksgiving 
called November 24th mother fucker or 

1757
01:29:36,091 --> 01:29:38,190
whatever it is,
Thursday,

1758
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:39,023
November.
So this Mba class was being taught on 

1759
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:40,494
Monday.
So I missed one Monday because of 

1760
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:42,533
thanksgiving.
And I missed the second Monday because 

1761
01:29:44,101 --> 01:29:44,934
it was the official provincial election 
in Quebec and by university decree we 

1762
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:49,854
had to cancel classes.
And so the way that I made up those 

1763
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:53,730
classes and I asked the students as I 
said,

1764
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:54,803
well,
you could come in on a Sunday as the 

1765
01:29:56,821 --> 01:29:59,040
university has dictated or we,
I could post them,

1766
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,200
post the lectures online.

1767
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:02,423
And then eventually I asked them would 
you prefer if I posted all my lectures 

1768
01:30:06,271 --> 01:30:07,104
online and then I came in and did other 
stuff in class or would you prefer that 

1769
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:13,050
I actually deliver the material live in 
front of you?

1770
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,410
And actually a lot of them answered in a
way similar to what you just said,

1771
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:21,411
which is there is something intimate 
about delivering the message right there

1772
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:22,830
physically,
tangibly,

1773
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:27,480
that you can't capture online 100 
percent live performance in any way,

1774
01:30:27,481 --> 01:30:30,570
shape or form.
Whether it's music or comedy or,

1775
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,051
uh,
I mean,

1776
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:34,110
I think teaching is informed a form of 
live performance,

1777
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:34,944
but is when you have someone who's 
disinterested and listless and just say 

1778
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,540
they have no energy and they're teaching
even if the information is fascinating.

1779
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:43,374
It's very difficult to absorb,
whereas if you have someone like 

1780
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:45,984
yourself who's passionate and engaging 
and articulate and they have live to 

1781
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:50,400
you,
like it's fun.

1782
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,990
It makes the educational experience 
something that it.

1783
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,630
It's,
it's,

1784
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:56,400
it's a performance art.
It really is.

1785
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,293
It is.
You know what pisses me off when I 

1786
01:30:58,741 --> 01:31:01,110
received the teaching evaluations,
I usually,

1787
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:02,280
I get there.
They're great.

1788
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:03,703
I scored very well,
but once in a while you get someone who 

1789
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,540
enters something that you know is a lie.
So I'll give you an example.

1790
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:13,380
Someone says he wasn't accessible to his
students.

1791
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:14,483
Well,
the reality is there wasn't a single 

1792
01:31:16,591 --> 01:31:21,591
time that a student ever asked to meet 
me either during office hours or if they

1793
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:24,360
can't make office hours outside of 
office hours,

1794
01:31:24,361 --> 01:31:26,100
we could do a skype chat,
we could do a phone chat.

1795
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,210
I've never said I'm not meeting you.
I don't have time with.

1796
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,063
It's never happened yet.
Someone because they are protected by 

1797
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:33,714
the cloak of anonymity because the 
teaching evaluations are done 

1798
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:36,773
anonymously,
can write whatever they want and there 

1799
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:40,980
is no opportunity for you to reboot.
Now,

1800
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:41,873
of course,
the reality is this has no effect on my 

1801
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:44,880
career.
I mean I could easily say,

1802
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:47,910
who cares what they say,
but I do care because probably like you,

1803
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:48,963
you'd like to think that every single 
person in that audience is going to 

1804
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:53,400
hopefully find you funny and they walked
away,

1805
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:54,770
entertained,
you know,

1806
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,410
because of your set and there's no way 
for me to rebut them.

1807
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,010
Well,
especially when someone's

1808
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,350
lying about that,
that's really annoying,

1809
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,560
but I feel like it's like yelp scores.
You ever ever read yelp reviews?

1810
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:11,680
Like you read them and you'll see all 
these wonderful reviews.

1811
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:15,250
The restaurant was incredible.
The food was fantastic.

1812
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:17,500
The decor,
everything about it.

1813
01:32:17,501 --> 01:32:18,334
The waitress was amazing.
The chef came over to our table and 

1814
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,443
greeted us.
It was so good and then you'll see one 

1815
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:25,780
person,
everyone was rude.

1816
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:30,070
My food was like,
wait when it was this the same place.

1817
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:32,740
And then.
So what I always love to do,

1818
01:32:32,741 --> 01:32:33,574
one of my favorite things to do on yelp 
is I will go to a restaurant and if I'm 

1819
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:39,550
interested in this restaurant and go,
wow,

1820
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:41,530
look at this,
got four and a half stars,

1821
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,980
that's fucking great,
and then I'll find a one star and I go,

1822
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:45,883
okay,
let me click on their profile and you 

1823
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:52,501
will see a fucking tornado of one star 
reviews of everybody with everything.

1824
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:56,110
Fucking laundromats.
Grocery stores.

1825
01:32:56,111 --> 01:32:59,080
They hate everything.
It's so universal.

1826
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:02,500
It's so common.
And then occasionally like one four star

1827
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:05,310
review of something like a movie theater
or something like that.

1828
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,720
They're probably on adderall that day or
something.

1829
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,700
It's.
It's fucking weird.

1830
01:33:09,701 --> 01:33:10,534
It's weird how many malcontents are out 
there just bouncing off of things and 

1831
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:14,704
just angry at the world,
honking their horn and traffic and 

1832
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,820
writing one star reviews.

1833
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,793
I've actually thought of starting a 
project and I had a research assistant 

1834
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:25,110
look at it.
Preemptive,

1835
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,173
not exploring it for me.
You tell me what you think of this 

1836
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:34,680
hypothesis.
So you have one star to five stars,

1837
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:37,080
let's say on Amazon,
on travel,

1838
01:33:37,081 --> 01:33:38,160
expedia,
whatever it's called,

1839
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:39,570
hotels,
restaurants.

1840
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:40,973
Do you think that the amount of words 
that people use across the five stars 

1841
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,240
changes?
In other words,

1842
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:49,223
for example,
hypothesis might be the more negative 

1843
01:33:51,631 --> 01:33:54,140
the review,
the more words are used because.

1844
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:55,733
And so probably I hope nobody steals 
this idea because that's an idea that 

1845
01:33:58,141 --> 01:33:59,850
I'm hoping to test a soon.

1846
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,080
Oh,
scientifically.

1847
01:34:01,081 --> 01:34:01,914
Right?
So if you look.

1848
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,200
Yeah,
I know what I'm saying.

1849
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:04,530
So yes.
Yeah.

1850
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:06,480
So you.
So your prediction would.

1851
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:10,450
There's a thing on it already.
No Way.

1852
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:14,430
Statistical difference between one star 
and five star reviews on yelp.

1853
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,230
There we go.
Make that large place.

1854
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:18,900
What year was this?
Twenty 14.

1855
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:20,610
You're way behind,
bro.

1856
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:24,390
Many businesses in the real world 
encourage customers to rate on yelp.

1857
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:25,283
Yelp,
the best way to find local businesses 

1858
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:29,580
relies on user reviews to help the 
viewers find the best places.

1859
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:32,100
Both positive and negative reviews are 
helpful in this mission.

1860
01:34:32,101 --> 01:34:35,310
Positive reviews on yelp.
I go back to what the thing was.

1861
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:36,260
Yeah,
no,

1862
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:37,133
but what I'm seeing or statistical 
differences in the amount of text just 

1863
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:41,431
text,
right.

1864
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:45,180
It's not a part of this.
Is that a part of the review?

1865
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:48,270
Is that what they're saying?
Put it up,

1866
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:53,040
getting into types of words,
generalize the language,

1867
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:55,020
present.
Um,

1868
01:34:55,021 --> 01:34:55,411
but,
but blah,

1869
01:34:55,411 --> 01:34:55,780
blah,
blah,

1870
01:34:55,780 --> 01:34:59,000
Blah and one,
125,458

1871
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,013
yelp reviews using the data sheet 
containing reviews of businesses and 

1872
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:04,154
Phoenix,
Asa,

1873
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:05,013
blah,
blah blah.

1874
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,133
Okay.
When comparing the most frequent two 

1875
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:08,990
word phrases.
Okay,

1876
01:35:08,991 --> 01:35:13,160
but this is just the content,
but that's also probably safe Jamie,

1877
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:18,220
but look at that one star is so there's 
certain words that come up and run star.

1878
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,230
That's not what it is though.
Good,

1879
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:23,780
great.
Happy and contrast at one star.

1880
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:25,290
Yelp reviews,
uh,

1881
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:29,690
use very little positive language and 
instead discuss the amount of minutes,

1882
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:33,890
presumably much for this first section 
is only two word reviews.

1883
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:35,870
The next section here is three word 
reviews.

1884
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:37,170
And so he goes on further.
Yeah,

1885
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,760
go back to where I was reading there.
It says very little.

1886
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,840
So five star yelp reviews contain many 
instances of good.

1887
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,673
Great,
good.

1888
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:47,840
Contrast the one star,
yelp reviews,

1889
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:49,220
but,
but here's what's interesting.

1890
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:50,413
Use very little positive language,
but instead discussed the amount of 

1891
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:56,420
minutes,
presumably long and unfortunate waits at

1892
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:57,830
the establishment.
That's interesting.

1893
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,903
Las Vegas,
one of the cities where the reviewers 

1894
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:00,644
were collected,
which is why appears prominently so I 

1895
01:36:03,871 --> 01:36:05,660
don't have more people have to wait.
Yeah,

1896
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:06,710
that's,
if that makes sense.

1897
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,730
You were talking about the amount of 
words in the review itself.

1898
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:11,973
Let me take,
let me throw that in there at all the 

1899
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:15,100
size of the,
um,

1900
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:18,740
just the size of their review because 
this is a statistical analysis of the,

1901
01:36:18,741 --> 01:36:20,680
uh,
the words content you.

1902
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:24,200
Exactly.
But anyway,

1903
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:25,423
let me tell you the background.
So I published a paper in 2014 in a 

1904
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:34,040
journal called evolution human behavior 
where we looked at.

1905
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:38,030
Just give me a chance to give you a bit 
of background.

1906
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,580
So remember I talked earlier about the 
framing effect.

1907
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:41,414
If she,
if I tell you that a burger is 10 

1908
01:36:42,351 --> 01:36:46,310
percent fat versus 90 percent fat free,
it's the same description.

1909
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:48,300
It's just one way you frame it 
positively,

1910
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:49,173
negatively.
So I took this idea with one of my 

1911
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:54,890
former doctoral students and we applied 
it to the context of mating.

1912
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:55,733
So for example,
if I tell you you can go out on a date 

1913
01:36:57,921 --> 01:36:58,754
with this woman and seven out of 10 of 
her acquaintances thinks she's 

1914
01:37:01,671 --> 01:37:02,504
intelligent.
This is exactly like telling you that 

1915
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:07,520
three out of 10 of her friends didn't 
think she's intelligent.

1916
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:08,354
Right?
So I could either frame the information 

1917
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:11,300
positively or negatively.

1918
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,133
It's the exact same information and this
is called the framing effect because 

1919
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:18,800
just how you frame something causes 
people to change their evaluation of the

1920
01:37:18,801 --> 01:37:19,634
person.
Okay.

1921
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,013
And so what we want to know is whether 
men or women are more likely to succumb 

1922
01:37:25,911 --> 01:37:28,370
to the framing effect within a meeting 
context.

1923
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:29,780
Do you follow what I'm saying?
Yes.

1924
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,810
Well before I.
I'm not to put you on the spot,

1925
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:33,644
but I guess I will.
Can you predict which of the two sexes 

1926
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:41,450
is more likely to fall prey to the 
framing manipulation specifically in the

1927
01:37:41,451 --> 01:37:43,970
main context?
Emails fairy good.

1928
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,580
You're an evolutionary psychologist.
White women or men don't mind.

1929
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,420
And then.
Well that's not quite friends.

1930
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,450
Say she's a con.
Yeah,

1931
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,700
but that's because she's got no,
none of that's not.

1932
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:52,803
That's not the reason.
The reason is because negatively framed 

1933
01:37:55,891 --> 01:37:56,550
information,

1934
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,100
and this is how I'm going to tie it to 
the study.

1935
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,280
Negative information,
right?

1936
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,383
Negatively framed information looms 
larger and the psyche of women 

1937
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,393
specifically in the mating domain 
precisely because making a poor choice 

1938
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:14,040
has greater consequences evolutionarily 
speaking for the woman,

1939
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:15,083
the exactly.
So this is called the parental 

1940
01:38:15,961 --> 01:38:16,794
investment theory,
so we took parental investment theory 

1941
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,433
and applied it in this context to the 
framing the decision and showed that 

1942
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:25,500
when it comes specifically to the 
maitland context,

1943
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,320
women are more likely to succumb to the 
framing effect that makes sense.

1944
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:31,290
And and,
and the reason again stems from the fact

1945
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:35,610
that there is what's called a negative 
negativity bias for this.

1946
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:39,930
The same valence information looms 
larger when it's negative.

1947
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:40,764
Then it's once Fazio,
precisely because we've evolved to pay 

1948
01:38:44,011 --> 01:38:47,550
more attention to negative information 
rather than positive information.

1949
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,410
And so that got me thinking about that 
hypothesis that I just told you,

1950
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:53,543
which is in the consumer context,
do I spend more time as a consumer 

1951
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,840
trying to justify my very negative 
decision?

1952
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,630
And therefore that's why I got the word 
hypothesis.

1953
01:39:03,631 --> 01:39:04,464
If any bastard steals that hypothesis,
I'm going to know the godfather always 

1954
01:39:08,461 --> 01:39:09,294
knows there's more into this is a very 
long article that it doesn't do what I 

1955
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:15,654
believe it does right here is the amount
of words in the review has a lesser 

1956
01:39:19,081 --> 01:39:22,900
negative affect review that is 333 words
indicates a onestar decreased,

1957
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,430
but the average amount of words in the 
yelp reviews 130 words.

1958
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:29,970
So the more words,
the more likely it is to have a negative

1959
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,370
one star review.
So it's already there.

1960
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:36,120
So they aren't they.
They did a multifaceted analysis.

1961
01:39:36,121 --> 01:39:36,954
The model experienced 25 point 98 
percent of the variation in the number 

1962
01:39:40,021 --> 01:39:43,230
of stars given in a review.
This sounds like a low percentage,

1963
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:44,064
but it's impressive for such a simple 
model using unstructured real world 

1964
01:39:47,311 --> 01:39:48,144
data.
Right?

1965
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:49,471
This,
this,

1966
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:50,304
by the way,
comes from a another principle which 

1967
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:53,184
basically says that when companies are 
trying to pay attention to people how 

1968
01:39:56,851 --> 01:40:01,851
satisfied they are,
one dissatisfied customer ends up having

1969
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:02,844
much larger influence than one satisfied
customer because if you like the metric 

1970
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,520
velocity of someone who's pissed as much
greater than the possible certainly,

1971
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:12,354
and that's why people were terrified of 
bad reviews and you know they don't 

1972
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,080
really take too much.

1973
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:18,600
Here's a problem.
This is a real problem.

1974
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:19,723
I'm fake reviews.
There's a lot of companies and employ 

1975
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:24,203
these really unscrupulous humans who 
will write fake reviews for your 

1976
01:40:29,311 --> 01:40:30,144
business.
They were really positive reviews and 

1977
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:32,874
make it look like your business is 
amazing and I guarantee you they use 

1978
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:38,370
very few words because they just try to 
bang them out.

1979
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:39,263
They just have a bunch of fake bullshit 
accounts and you can pay someone and 

1980
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,150
there's.
There's services that do that.

1981
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:46,343
Is there any way your restaurant,
is there any way to algorithmically 

1982
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:54,130
identify who the fake review because of 
the structure

1983
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,880
of the words they use are the 
grammatical.

1984
01:40:55,881 --> 01:40:56,714
So where you know at somehow fake is.
I don't think so because I don't think 

1985
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:00,544
the fake reviews are done with a Bot.
I think it's done with actual human 

1986
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:05,584
sitting.
Okay.

1987
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:06,503
Honestly,
I mean maybe if you notice it's in 

1988
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,200
English because they're all done in 
India or something like that.

1989
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:16,230
I think a lot of it is just people 
finding a loophole in the system.

1990
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:19,000
I actually heard someone discussing it 
in a restaurant.

1991
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,373
We in a restaurant waiting to seat and 
this guy was telling the owner of the 

1992
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:24,970
restaurant,
you know,

1993
01:41:24,971 --> 01:41:29,260
I have a service that can,
that I know of that can help you,

1994
01:41:29,261 --> 01:41:31,890
and they'll just leave you great reviews
and it's an a,

1995
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,880
you know,
you have an amazing restaurant.

1996
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:34,714
I mean,
you should,

1997
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:35,643
you should use this and he.
It's not like you're lying to the 

1998
01:41:37,781 --> 01:41:38,050
people.

1999
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:38,883
The food's good.
Like people have all these weird 

2000
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:40,624
justice,
but that again speaks to 

2001
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,300
consequentialism versus the 
anthological.

2002
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:46,900
Right?
Sure.

2003
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:47,733
I mean,
if I were to point to a fault that I 

2004
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:55,000
have,
it's probably other than perfectionism,

2005
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:56,223
is that my mother used to always say,
you need to realize that the world is 

2006
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:03,790
not as pure as the purity bubble that 
you live in,

2007
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,253
and so for example,
for me to lose weight through a 

2008
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:13,830
liposuction is a form of cheating 
because if I don't go through the actual

2009
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:20,050
process of consciously altering my 
behavior,

2010
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:23,260
I don't care about the end result.
The fact that you will say,

2011
01:42:23,261 --> 01:42:24,550
Hey,
you look really nice and thin.

2012
01:42:24,551 --> 01:42:27,670
Now the fact that I did it through quote
an artificial way,

2013
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:31,930
to me it doesn't count.
Do you think that that's too brutal of a

2014
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:34,060
standard or would you support.
Now,

2015
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:35,970
not only is it not too brutal of a 
standard,

2016
01:42:35,971 --> 01:42:36,804
it's actually based in logic because the
people that don't alter their behavior 

2017
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:40,713
but instead get liposuction almost 
always wind up putting that fat back on 

2018
01:42:44,471 --> 01:42:46,390
because they have to change your 
behavior.

2019
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,100
Right?
They have an issue with their patterns.

2020
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,080
Yeah.
You know the number one pattern.

2021
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:51,610
If someone is thinking about losing 
weight,

2022
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,473
the number one pattern that I would 
always encourage people to do besides 

2023
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:58,840
changing their diet to a reduced 
radically reduce the amount of sugar and

2024
01:42:58,841 --> 01:43:03,310
bread and pasta they which will in and 
of itself eliminate a lot of weight,

2025
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:08,440
is intermittent fasting,
meaning have a timed feeding window,

2026
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,920
give yourself eight hours a day and eat 
what you want to eat for eight hours,

2027
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,130
but when that eight hours is done,
you don't eat for 16 hours and that is.

2028
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:19,840
That is law,
so you just decide what that time window

2029
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:20,674
is.
You decide when you're going to start 

2030
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:24,310
eating during the day,
based on when you want to eat dinner and

2031
01:43:24,311 --> 01:43:26,140
when you're done.
When you put that fork down,

2032
01:43:26,141 --> 01:43:29,650
there is 16 hours between then and the 
time you ever stuff food in your face.

2033
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:31,180
Again,
just doing that,

2034
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,163
you will lose a lot of weight and it's a
healthy way to do it and and it's and 

2035
01:43:35,381 --> 01:43:40,160
it's mimicking or closer mimic of our 
evolutionary reality.

2036
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:41,890
Yes,
our evolutionary reality.

2037
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:42,724
You did not have shelves where food was 
available everywhere in pantries and 

2038
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:48,490
refrigerators and superimpose a strong 
proponent.

2039
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:51,190
This is a plug for,
for a friend,

2040
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:52,100
uh,
who's

2041
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:56,900
the antifragile guy,
Nassim Taleb as a WHO's also Lebanese by

2042
01:43:56,901 --> 01:43:57,734
the way,
uh,

2043
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,740
someone who's into this intermittent 
fasting.

2044
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:02,570
And I think he swears by it,
if I'm not mistaken,

2045
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:04,520
the yes,
a lot of people do.

2046
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,710
I do a,
I've had many,

2047
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:07,544
many nutritionists and people that study
the science of nutritional absorption 

2048
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:12,374
and science of fasting.
There's a real science to fast and Dom 

2049
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:20,390
D'agostino has done some extensive work 
on the positive benefits of fasting.

2050
01:44:20,391 --> 01:44:22,640
So it was Rhonda.
Patrick has discussed this in depth,

2051
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:27,260
but I'm intermittent fasting.
And that timed feeding window is just,

2052
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,300
it's so critical if you can just do 
that.

2053
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,373
I had a friend of mine,
his dad just lost 100 pounds doing that 

2054
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:33,590
over the last year and a half.
Yeah.

2055
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,460
He alters diet,
you know,

2056
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,333
just decided he needed to lose weight.
But the big one is he had a time to 

2057
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:42,350
window and that time to Windows eight 
hours per day.

2058
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:44,730
I organized in,
um,

2059
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:45,983
I think it was in April,
a mini summit on health promotion from 

2060
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:50,504
an evolutionary perspective,
and so I invited several physicians who 

2061
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:55,160
are very sympathetic to the evolutionary
approach,

2062
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:58,130
uh,
in terms of identifying ways by which we

2063
01:44:58,131 --> 01:45:02,060
can promote health whilst recognizing 
some of these evolutionary imperatives.

2064
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:03,700
Maybe I could share one or two.
Sure.

2065
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:06,800
So it turns out,
for example,

2066
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:08,240
that Gino,
who is the,

2067
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:12,320
when you look at young men who suffer 
from erectile dysfunction,

2068
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:16,280
do you know what's the one behavior that
these young men,

2069
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,143
because usually of course did I tell 
this function is something that is more 

2070
01:45:19,251 --> 01:45:20,084
prevalent as you get older,
for you to have to suffer from this 

2071
01:45:23,301 --> 01:45:24,134
condition as a young man is an anomaly.
What do you think is the one behavior 

2072
01:45:27,681 --> 01:45:28,514
that they share?

2073
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:34,230
Um,
it's quite obvious what.

2074
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:37,490
So a behavior that's really the true 
mental to your health.

2075
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,470
Think of the worst one.
Alcohol,

2076
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:42,110
no worse.
Lack of sleep.

2077
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:45,140
Worse drugs,
smoking,

2078
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,340
smoking.
Yeah.

2079
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:51,730
So heavy smokers are likely to be the 
ones who are a director.

2080
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,570
As far as young people.
Overall vitality has probably decreased.

2081
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:59,210
And that's one of the side effects,
or their body is probably like,

2082
01:45:59,211 --> 01:46:00,140
bitch,
you're so sick,

2083
01:46:00,141 --> 01:46:02,230
you shouldn't be breeding as a matter 
fact,

2084
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,740
there's some interesting studies looking
at,

2085
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:04,720
uh,
you know,

2086
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,460
how erect your penis has as a function,
I say,

2087
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:10,280
as a metric of your overall health.
But anyways,

2088
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:11,353
uh,
and so I had mentioned this in several 

2089
01:46:15,231 --> 01:46:19,760
lectures and then it actually came out 
in a promotional campaign.

2090
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:21,540
I don't know if they watch my lectures.
This is,

2091
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:25,370
I think Health Canada where they had a,
uh,

2092
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:29,810
advertisement with simply a cigarette 
that's limp.

2093
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:30,733
That was it.
That's the whole now that is exactly 

2094
01:46:33,741 --> 01:46:37,340
what an evolutionary health promotion 
approach would be like.

2095
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:40,910
And let me explain why.
The typical approach with these types of

2096
01:46:40,911 --> 01:46:41,744
social marketing campaigns is provide 
people with more information and that 

2097
01:46:45,801 --> 01:46:50,670
would cause them to alter their behavior
if they're behaving in a maladaptive

2098
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,503
way,
if you like.

2099
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,130
It's because they didn't know any 
better.

2100
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:57,660
So tell them the likelihood of them 
suffering heart disease when they're 73.

2101
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:00,480
But the reality of course,
is that when I'm 21,

2102
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:03,420
73 is a long time away,
I'm a mortal.

2103
01:47:03,421 --> 01:47:07,260
I'm never going to suffer from these 
realities,

2104
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:08,094
right?
So I can easily discount that 

2105
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:10,680
information.
But tell me,

2106
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:11,514
show me vividly that I might not be able
to perform with my really hot 

2107
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:15,930
girlfriend.
Well,

2108
01:47:15,931 --> 01:47:16,764
it doesn't take much of an evolutionary 
psychologist to understand that people 

2109
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:19,704
will respond to this.
Just to draw another parallel from the 

2110
01:47:21,990 --> 01:47:22,823
women's part.
Women turn out to be the ones who are 

2111
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:29,580
overwhelmingly most likely to expose 
themselves to the sun,

2112
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:33,420
whether either the actual natural sun or
artificial sunbeds,

2113
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:38,160
even though they're much more 
knowledgeable than men about the effects

2114
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:40,350
of sun exposure.
So it's not because they didn't know any

2115
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:41,184
better than they were doing the behavior
because they know more than men and yet 

2116
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:46,260
they do it more so they do it more 
because of an aesthetic reason,

2117
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:48,870
because they think that they're going to
get that health glow.

2118
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:49,703
I'm going to be at tonight's party,
Tony's going to be there and I need to 

2119
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:53,723
look good for Tony.
So if you simply tell them that when 

2120
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:56,634
you're going to be 74,
you might suffer a greater incidence of 

2121
01:47:58,291 --> 01:47:59,550
melanoma.
Who Cares?

2122
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:00,683
On the other hand,
if you show them aesthetic ravages to 

2123
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:05,124
your skin,
that increases their attention to your 

2124
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:11,730
message.
So the bottom line is learn what are the

2125
01:48:11,731 --> 01:48:12,564
evolutionary triggers that get people's 
attention and use that rather than 

2126
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:17,010
simply provide them with more 
information.

2127
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:21,300
So that is one applied the reality of 
this approach.

2128
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:22,163
What are the evolutionary triggers that 
cause people to smoke in the first 

2129
01:48:23,821 --> 01:48:25,220
place?
Well,

2130
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:27,480
I don't think that's necessarily an 
evolutionary trait.

2131
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:32,160
I think it's just because tobacco is,
I mean is addictive,

2132
01:48:32,161 --> 01:48:32,994
right?
And so,

2133
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:36,440
but that doesn't explain the initial 
first time,

2134
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,430
start smoking the first time you smoke.

2135
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:40,800
It's disgusting.
Yet what I saw,

2136
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:42,630
I'm going to.
I'm going off the cuff here.

2137
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:44,850
So I don't know because I haven't 
thought about that exact question.

2138
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:46,043
It turns out as you probably know,
that if you don't start smoking by the 

2139
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:51,630
age of 19,
I don't know why the number 19,

2140
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:53,190
maybe it's because it's the teenage 
years.

2141
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:56,430
You're almost guaranteed to never smoke.
Right?

2142
01:48:56,431 --> 01:48:57,264
So.
So the tobacco companies really have to 

2143
01:48:58,861 --> 01:49:01,610
get you when you're a kid.
I know a guy who started when he was 14,

2144
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:02,340
actually.
I'm like,

2145
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:03,173
Mike,
I have a cousin who started at 33 so 

2146
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:06,720
that they are anomalies.
That's so crazy,

2147
01:49:06,721 --> 01:49:09,020
isn't it?
So my feeling is it's probably a form.

2148
01:49:09,021 --> 01:49:12,900
So if I'm going to link it in some way 
to an evolutionary mechanism,

2149
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:15,690
it's probably just pure conformity,
right?

2150
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:20,400
To the extent that that young kids think
that the school to smoke,

2151
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:23,580
they were just going to imitate others.
What do you think?

2152
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:26,060
Um,
I think they want to look cool.

2153
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:26,913
They see that character that's smoking 
and just takes that big deep drag in 

2154
01:49:30,781 --> 01:49:33,090
that exhale and they're slipping a 
rebel.

2155
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,800
They don't even give a fuck about their 
health.

2156
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:36,750
Looking at them out there just smoking 
cigarettes.

2157
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:38,310
Right.
Probably wearing leather,

2158
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:42,030
looking like a crazy person.
Do you know what?

2159
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:43,860
I've never taken a single puff of my 
entire life.

2160
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,150
Congratulations.
Have you?

2161
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:47,680
Fuck you.
I'm not talking about drugs.

2162
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:48,040
Just

2163
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,591
smoking.
Oh yeah.

2164
01:49:48,591 --> 01:49:49,001
Okay.
Yeah,

2165
01:49:49,001 --> 01:49:49,511
yeah.
No,

2166
01:49:49,511 --> 01:49:49,951
I've,
I've,

2167
01:49:49,951 --> 01:49:52,030
uh,
I smoked a cigarette when I was 15.

2168
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:54,340
I didn't like it.
I quit my sister,

2169
01:49:54,341 --> 01:49:56,710
stuck with it for a long time.
We did it together.

2170
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,090
I was 15,
she was 14.

2171
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:01,210
She smoked for a long time after that.
So why did you see the first time?

2172
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,120
Um,
I would have to go back to the time when

2173
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:08,170
I was 15 and asked myself.
I probably just wanted to try it.

2174
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,660
I thought it was cool.
It was the adult thing.

2175
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:12,720
We did a lot of adult things that were 
gross,

2176
01:50:12,721 --> 01:50:14,800
like we tried liquor and like,
you know,

2177
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,233
there's a lot of things that we did that
you were supposed to do because it was 

2178
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:21,370
supposed to be like a cool person thing,
but it's gross.

2179
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,593
Um,
I've done it since then before shows 

2180
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:29,710
because I have friends that were smokers
and uh,

2181
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,553
I had read that there's a nootropic 
benefit to nicotine and that one of the 

2182
01:50:33,971 --> 01:50:36,940
things that Steven King said when he 
wrote his book on writing,

2183
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,340
um,
one of the more.

2184
01:50:38,410 --> 01:50:39,243
It's a great book by the way,
on writing if anybody's interested in 

2185
01:50:40,751 --> 01:50:43,010
writing,
but coming from a real master,

2186
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:43,844
a guy who's been incredibly prolific,
but his attitude and his philosophy on 

2187
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:48,940
writing is pretty unique.
Um,

2188
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:49,803
but one of the things that he said that 
he struggled after he quit smoking 

2189
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:54,350
because of the synaptic,
the,

2190
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:56,260
the synaptic benefit,
the,

2191
01:50:56,280 --> 01:51:00,130
the cognitive benefits of smoking was 
really beneficial for his writing.

2192
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:00,983
It like really fired up his writing.
And so a couple of times back when my 

2193
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:08,380
friend Tony Hinchcliffe,
he quit recently quit like a,

2194
01:51:08,381 --> 01:51:10,760
about a year or so ago.
Uh,

2195
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:11,673
but he would smoke and I,
and a couple of times he would be 

2196
01:51:13,721 --> 01:51:15,640
smoking before a show.
It's a give me one of those things.

2197
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:16,683
We try that I have no fear at all,
that I would ever be addicted to 

2198
01:51:20,651 --> 01:51:22,030
cigarettes.
I have zero fear.

2199
01:51:22,031 --> 01:51:22,864
It's not possible.
There's no way in my mindset that I 

2200
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:26,860
would ever allow myself to be physically
addicted,

2201
01:51:26,861 --> 01:51:30,340
but using it as a tool right before I 
went onstage,

2202
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:32,500
I've found it to give me a little bit of
a charge.

2203
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,550
I was like,
it's kind of interesting,

2204
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,743
not valuable enough for me to pursue and
not necessarily even better than other 

2205
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:45,010
nootropics or other cognitive enhancing 
things like coffee or,

2206
01:51:45,011 --> 01:51:45,844
you know,
for me the real one is breathing and 

2207
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:48,304
moving around.
I just like to get my blood pumping and 

2208
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:54,130
take some big deep breaths and fire my 
brain up and get my,

2209
01:51:54,131 --> 01:51:54,731
like,
like here,

2210
01:51:54,731 --> 01:51:56,680
we already,
I had a cup of coffee earlier.

2211
01:51:56,681 --> 01:51:57,514
But the stimulation of actual dialog of 
talking to somebody and talking to an 

2212
01:52:03,101 --> 01:52:04,780
intelligent,
beautiful personally yourself,

2213
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:07,600
aren't you lucky this is a,
it's exciting.

2214
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:10,960
It gets you fired up and it gets all the
cylinders pumping.

2215
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:14,380
Um,
but there is something to cigarettes.

2216
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,570
There's definitely something I've 
founded,

2217
01:52:16,571 --> 01:52:17,404
a stimulated.
What is it that made you feel so 

2218
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:23,020
confident that you would not fall prey 
to it's addictive properties?

2219
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:23,854
Why do you think that?
I am confident that I'm not a loser 

2220
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:26,793
period.
I'm not doing anything stupid with my 

2221
01:52:28,631 --> 01:52:29,464
body.
I don't,

2222
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,390
I don't.
I'm not doing that.

2223
01:52:31,391 --> 01:52:36,100
But you don't think that not trying 
could over overwhelm your willpower.

2224
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,370
Impossible doesn't exist.
There's no door.

2225
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:42,100
You're not getting in La,
it's not,

2226
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:46,170
there's no fucking way I'm going to get 
addicted to cigarettes and people

2227
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:46,501
like,
Yo,

2228
01:52:46,501 --> 01:52:49,100
man,
you see the openness to shut up,

2229
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:51,230
buzzy.
It's not happening.

2230
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:52,610
So you could call somebody,
push you,

2231
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:54,010
but I can't call them the r word.
Yeah,

2232
01:52:54,011 --> 01:52:56,790
it's crazy.
That's how it works.

2233
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:58,940
The double standards.
Well,

2234
01:52:58,980 --> 01:52:59,813
pussies also good.
That's the problem with pussy is 

2235
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:03,043
ridiculous as a,
as an insult because it's one of the 

2236
01:53:04,401 --> 01:53:08,120
most wonderful things the world has ever
seen at speaking of policies.

2237
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,980
Did you see?
My.

2238
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:13,570
Probably not,
but I put out a sad truth clip where I,

2239
01:53:13,571 --> 01:53:14,404
um,
regrettably apologize to the Trans 

2240
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:17,234
community because it turns out that I 
didn't know that my marriage was 

2241
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:20,774
transphobic.
Do you know why your marriage is 

2242
01:53:22,221 --> 01:53:23,054
transphobic?
Yes.

2243
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:24,733
Because some trans activists have argued
that it is ridiculous for heterosexual 

2244
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:33,701
men to strictly want to mate because 
when we're talking about pussies,

2245
01:53:34,410 --> 01:53:35,243
so strictly want to mate with women who 
have pussies when there are some women 

2246
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,780
who have nine inch penises that are just
as much of a women.

2247
01:53:43,090 --> 01:53:43,923
Uh,
and I argued that now that I've learned 

2248
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:47,204
this,
it's ridiculous that I focused on 

2249
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:50,003
building a life as a heterosexual man 
with a woman that has a vagina and not 

2250
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:56,900
with a woman that has a nine inch penis.
And therefore,

2251
01:53:56,901 --> 01:53:58,670
I apologize for my transphobia.
Well,

2252
01:53:58,671 --> 01:53:59,504
that doesn't make any sense because 
shouldn't it be just like with the fat 

2253
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:06,470
thing that you just just choose whatever
and then be happy with what you got that

2254
01:54:06,471 --> 01:54:09,200
there's no discrimination at all.
You just managed to fall in love.

2255
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:12,580
You just got lucky and it's an actual 
lots of vagina male,

2256
01:54:12,581 --> 01:54:16,100
a woman who has a vagina that's not 
surgically created.

2257
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:20,130
But had I been more progressive and open
to the early now,

2258
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:22,180
did you ever date a trans person?
No.

2259
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:24,620
So there you go.
You don't have to date a bunch of people

2260
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,700
like that.
You know,

2261
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:28,640
like to say that you've never dated 
anybody who's over six foot five.

2262
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,750
Well,
you're tall phobic.

2263
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:32,600
That's a ridiculous statement.
That doesn't make any sense.

2264
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,040
You know,
to say that you've,

2265
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:34,874
uh,
you've never dated anybody that weighs 

2266
01:54:35,901 --> 01:54:37,180
more than 300 pounds.
You,

2267
01:54:37,181 --> 01:54:38,110
you know,
you're a,

2268
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,410
you're a mass phobic.
That's ridiculous.

2269
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:42,650
Yeah.
It's just all of it's stupid.

2270
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,890
It's stupid people telling,
but this,

2271
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:45,823
what they're doing is it's a bunch of 
people that are pushing this idea of 

2272
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:50,923
being open entirely open to all things 
trans that you as a heterosexual person 

2273
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,553
should not just recognize that this is a
woman because they transferred from a 

2274
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:02,653
male to a female,
but recognize even if they haven't 

2275
01:55:05,361 --> 01:55:09,350
transferred and recognize them in terms 
of sexual selection in terms of a date.

2276
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,363
Right.
And that's just fucking stupid because 

2277
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,870
you can decide,
right?

2278
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:14,713
You're not into certain things.
Like I'm not really into girls with 

2279
01:55:16,821 --> 01:55:19,100
short hair.
You could decide that it's not my thing.

2280
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:21,530
I don't like girls with shaved heads.
I don't find it attractive.

2281
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,633
Like a woman can say that too.
I don't like guys have creepy mustaches 

2282
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:29,540
and nobody gets mad at him.
But if a man says to certain people,

2283
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:33,470
I'm not into chicks with Dicks,
then that guy's a piece of shit.

2284
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,663
Or what about,
there's a thing called sexual racism 

2285
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:40,550
where you specifically,
you know,

2286
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:42,330
are not attracted to a particular.
You know,

2287
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:44,403
I don't like

2288
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:47,400
Asian men,
I don't like black women.

2289
01:55:47,401 --> 01:55:51,480
Right.
You're not supposed to instantiate those

2290
01:55:51,481 --> 01:55:52,314
sexual preferences.
If the racial q is the one that's 

2291
01:55:55,651 --> 01:55:57,900
causing you to either be attracted or 
not attached to someone,

2292
01:55:58,230 --> 01:55:59,670
what do you think of that?
Um,

2293
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:03,600
well there's certainly beautiful people 
of all race,

2294
01:56:03,601 --> 01:56:04,434
so that doesn't make a whole lot of 
sense to me in terms of the person 

2295
01:56:06,611 --> 01:56:07,444
selection.
Like if you tell them you've never seen 

2296
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:10,310
a beautiful black woman,
right?

2297
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:12,870
Like you're crazy.
Like you have met enough black women.

2298
01:56:12,871 --> 01:56:14,970
If you tell me 17,
a beautiful Asian woman,

2299
01:56:14,971 --> 01:56:17,040
like what,
what are you saying?

2300
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:20,790
Like there's beautiful people in this 
also,

2301
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:25,140
you should be allowed to be with whoever
you want in terms of.

2302
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:27,930
But why is it it's always sex,
right?

2303
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,960
Because like obnoxious people.
Here's a perfect example.

2304
01:56:30,961 --> 01:56:33,300
I don't like friends that are loud and 
get drunk in public.

2305
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,130
Oh,
what are you drunk phobic?

2306
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,710
No,
I just don't enjoy that.

2307
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,800
So like in terms of sexual selection,
the dates,

2308
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:42,840
I'll tell you why that analogy might 
fail.

2309
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:43,813
Okay.
Tell me the progressive's you could 

2310
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,073
alter your level of obnoxiousness.
You could grow out of your boxes as 

2311
01:56:49,261 --> 01:56:50,610
well.
I know some people,

2312
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:53,340
conceivably,
theoretically we're fucked.

2313
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:54,690
That's just who they are.
Fair enough.

2314
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:56,120
If you want to name any names,
no,

2315
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:01,350
but your race is a immutable part of 
you.

2316
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:02,610
Okay.
That's the perspective.

2317
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:05,700
I see that I'm playing devil's advocate.
I'm not agreeing with it.

2318
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,511
Okay.
Well,

2319
01:57:06,511 --> 01:57:09,070
what about a tall versus short?
Right?

2320
01:57:09,071 --> 01:57:09,904
You know what,
if you're a woman volleyball player and 

2321
01:57:11,371 --> 01:57:13,890
you're six foot three and you don't want
to date a guy was five feet tall,

2322
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:15,090
you know,
are you.

2323
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:16,350
What are you,
what are you?

2324
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:18,510
By the way,
that is one of the biggest problems with

2325
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:20,070
being a very tall woman because one of 
the,

2326
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:20,700
one of the.

2327
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:21,533
So there's something called assorted of 
mating and evolutionary theory sort of 

2328
01:57:23,851 --> 01:57:24,684
meeting is basically birds of a feather 
flock together and that's very much the 

2329
01:57:28,171 --> 01:57:31,590
mechanism that drives may choice much 
more than opposites attract.

2330
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,910
So one of the sources of mating cues 
that people most sword on his height,

2331
01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:40,050
so it's not so much that women want guys
that are only six foot or taller,

2332
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:42,720
it's just that the woman wants a guy 
who's taller than her.

2333
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:44,003
So if you look at the,
there is a study that I've discussed in 

2334
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:51,081
the past that looked at something like 
720 actual couples and I think there was

2335
01:57:51,661 --> 01:57:55,710
only a single one out of the 720 where 
the woman was taller than the man.

2336
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,650
Now once a woman gets to be over a 
certain height,

2337
01:57:58,651 --> 01:58:00,210
she's six foot two,
six foot three.

2338
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:05,130
Her potential pool of prospective 
suitors really shrinks.

2339
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:08,130
And so if you have a daughter,
you really want to pray that she doesn't

2340
01:58:08,131 --> 01:58:12,180
get too tall because boy are her choices
is going to be limited because few women

2341
01:58:12,181 --> 01:58:14,370
want to date the shorter guy than them.
Yeah.

2342
01:58:14,371 --> 01:58:17,250
When you're a six foot three,
six foot four woman,

2343
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,333
you're got to be a tough spot.
But you're basically relegated to big 

2344
01:58:21,601 --> 01:58:23,820
athletes are big giant people.
The,

2345
01:58:23,821 --> 01:58:24,350
the,
the,

2346
01:58:24,350 --> 01:58:25,183
the other place where you get this sort 
of assorted of mating is where you get 

2347
01:58:27,781 --> 01:58:30,930
women who are super educated,
uh,

2348
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:32,640
that makes sense.
The exact same thing happened.

2349
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:37,910
The more educated a woman gets,
the worse her marriage prospects because

2350
01:58:38,581 --> 01:58:39,414
the more sophisticated women are,
the more they insist on a high status 

2351
01:58:42,971 --> 01:58:44,350
male.
And therefore,

2352
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:45,363
as I get more educated as a woman,
there are just fewer men who are as 

2353
01:58:48,161 --> 01:58:53,161
educated or more than me and therefore 
I'm doomed to a life of solitude.

2354
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:56,200
That totally makes sense.
That totally makes sense.

2355
01:58:56,201 --> 01:59:00,790
Especially considering that men in 
general,

2356
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,953
they get insecure around women who are 
more successful and more educated or 

2357
01:59:06,371 --> 01:59:07,204
more intelligent.
Like very rarely are men comfortable 

2358
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:11,980
with a woman who has to explain things 
to them.

2359
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,420
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2360
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,260
By the way,
I think.

2361
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:16,780
So I have another theory which I'd like 
to at some point test.

2362
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:17,763
Maybe someone will steal it now.
So when you have a couple that gets 

2363
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:21,723
married very young,
they are judging one another based on 

2364
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:27,730
their mate value at 18 or 19.
Right.

2365
01:59:27,731 --> 01:59:28,564
So Tony is the high school quarterback 
and so he's the hot guy and I'm the 

2366
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:37,450
cheerleader and then later he stagnates.
He doesn't go on with his career.

2367
01:59:37,451 --> 01:59:40,600
Whereas I go on and become a physician.
I am a cheerleader,

2368
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:44,950
so I 29.
There is not a huge inequity between our

2369
01:59:44,951 --> 01:59:47,170
two mating values on the meeting market.

2370
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:49,150
Right.
So when we were both 19,

2371
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:51,300
the fact that we had roughly the same 
thing,

2372
01:59:51,310 --> 01:59:54,790
value made us a very attractive,
stable couple,

2373
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,800
but tony turned out to be a fucking 
loser.

2374
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:58,720
Exactly.
He's a lame duck.

2375
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,190
Exactly.
And so I.

2376
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:03,480
So I have a theory that and I'd like to 
at some point tested,

2377
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:05,490
maybe some graduate student will write 
to me saying,

2378
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,150
I'll work with this on you,
Dr.

2379
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,073
Sad.
I have a theory whereby I think that in 

2380
02:00:10,361 --> 02:00:14,140
many cases where people end up divorcing
when they married young,

2381
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:15,303
it's precisely because that which 
started as equitable mating values at 

2382
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:20,614
time t zero turned out to have huge 
divergence in our trajectory on the 

2383
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:24,643
meeting market.
And that puts a huge strain on the 

2384
02:00:26,501 --> 02:00:29,740
marriage,
especially when the wife status is going

2385
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,633
up,
that the best way to ensure that the 

2386
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:32,734
marriage ends is for the status of the 
woman to keep going up and that the man 

2387
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:40,600
to either stagnate or go down,
that's going to be doomed.

2388
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:44,590
That makes sense.
It makes sense that also,

2389
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:45,483
you know,
obviously the young marriages are rough 

2390
02:00:47,021 --> 02:00:50,500
because people grow and they don't 
necessarily grow together when you catch

2391
02:00:50,501 --> 02:00:53,740
people 10 years later and they're 
oftentimes radically different people.

2392
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:54,953
Right.
But then there's also the thing that 

2393
02:00:56,860 --> 02:01:00,250
women don't seem to,
for the most part,

2394
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,740
respect a man who's not doing as well as
them.

2395
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:03,743
Right.
You know,

2396
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:05,470
that's a,
that's a giant issue.

2397
02:01:05,530 --> 02:01:10,180
Even if the is doing okay,
like say if your guys making $50,000

2398
02:01:10,181 --> 02:01:11,470
a year,
that's a very good living.

2399
02:01:11,471 --> 02:01:15,190
He's out there doing well but you make 
300,

2400
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,970
maybe 300 grand a year and it's fucking 
losers over here.

2401
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:20,770
What is 50 grand like you're kicking 
ass,

2402
02:01:20,771 --> 02:01:21,604
you know,
like some big wig at some big 

2403
02:01:22,631 --> 02:01:27,310
corporation like that.
That seems to be a real sticking point.

2404
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:28,144
And with men,
especially if they have a household 

2405
02:01:29,591 --> 02:01:30,424
where they contributed income together,
they pile all the income and the man 

2406
02:01:34,301 --> 02:01:37,120
starts spending the woman's money on 
stuff.

2407
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:38,420
You know,
he starts buying stuff.

2408
02:01:38,421 --> 02:01:40,010
You got a new fishing rod and did you 
get

2409
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,810
that with your money or my money,
you know,

2410
02:01:41,811 --> 02:01:42,800
it gets weird,
right?

2411
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,870
And incidentally,
speaking of say,

2412
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:46,783
consumer psychology stuff that I study,
when you take a very rich woman and you 

2413
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:54,850
go out on a date with her,
even though she obviously can afford the

2414
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:58,160
dinner and she can afford anything that 
you're going to buy her,

2415
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:02,030
if you exhibit cues of frugality,
cheapness,

2416
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:05,480
that's the perfect way to ensure that 
you won't have a second date.

2417
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,980
So it's not so much a question of,
uh,

2418
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:09,910
you know,
it's an old sexist,

2419
02:02:09,911 --> 02:02:12,560
the ritual whereby men were wooing 
women.

2420
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:15,690
It really is an honest signal of your 
commitment to,

2421
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,510
to a woman.
So the best way,

2422
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:19,430
and I get many of these letters where 
people asked me,

2423
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:20,330
hey professor,
what are,

2424
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:22,550
you know,
dating advice.

2425
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:23,803
Well,
you do have to exhibit generosity when 

2426
02:02:25,431 --> 02:02:28,460
you go out with that,
the nuptial gift giving,

2427
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,150
natural gift giving.

2428
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:34,040
Is it sort of a fancy term for courtship
rituals across animal species?

2429
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:39,430
So many species you have typically the 
male engaging in some form of courtship,

2430
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,233
gift giving,
and depending on the quality of the 

2431
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:44,504
gift,
will determine whether the female will 

2432
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:46,784
mate with your not well.
So much of what we do in marketing 

2433
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:50,930
context is exactly that,
right?

2434
02:02:50,931 --> 02:02:54,110
It's the exact same phenomenon repeating
itself in the human context,

2435
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:55,780
right?
Uh,

2436
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,980
engagement rings,
right?

2437
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:59,173
The fact that you are supposed to spend 
a quarter of your yearly salary on this 

2438
02:03:02,571 --> 02:03:04,040
rock,
I really what it is.

2439
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:06,800
That's what I'm.
I don't know if everybody meets it,

2440
02:03:06,801 --> 02:03:08,130
but that's right.
It is that right?

2441
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:09,710
It's three months,
exact God.

2442
02:03:09,711 --> 02:03:11,870
When you say a quarter of the yearly 
salary,

2443
02:03:11,871 --> 02:03:15,560
it makes you just go,
what the fuck is wrong with people,

2444
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:17,990
but the reason so much money,
but here's the,

2445
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:19,190
but here's the reason.

2446
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,360
Here's the reason you ready?
It's what's called a hobby and signal.

2447
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:24,820
I don't know if I've ever discussed this
in this,

2448
02:03:24,821 --> 02:03:29,821
in this podcast is a hobby and signal is
basically the idea that for a signal,

2449
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:32,780
to be honest,
it has to be costly,

2450
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:34,490
otherwise everybody could imitate it.
Right?

2451
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,440
So,
so,

2452
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,740
so think about,
for example,

2453
02:03:36,741 --> 02:03:39,050
rites of passage in different cultures,
right?

2454
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:41,570
If you want to demonstrate that you're a
top warrior,

2455
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:45,740
the rite of passage has to be brutal.
Otherwise,

2456
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:48,560
if it's only,
we all have to do five setups than every

2457
02:03:48,561 --> 02:03:49,394
male could do it.
And then the females can determine the 

2458
02:03:51,590 --> 02:03:53,210
pretenders from the real guys.
Right?

2459
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,530
So,
so you have,

2460
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:56,240
for example,
a bullet ant,

2461
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:57,410
you know this one too,
right?

2462
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:58,663
You put your hands through.
I mean that takes a lot of courage and 

2463
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:03,340
capacity to people who don't know what 
you're talking about.

2464
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:07,310
So this is a tribe in the Amazon whereby
you take the bullet,

2465
02:04:07,311 --> 02:04:08,144
ant is supposedly the,
the biggest purveyor of pain that is 

2466
02:04:12,051 --> 02:04:14,010
humanly possible that you could 
experience.

2467
02:04:14,011 --> 02:04:15,860
My friend Steve gets done by one,
did it,

2468
02:04:15,861 --> 02:04:19,190
and what did.
He was in Bolivia,

2469
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:20,680
I believe.
And uh,

2470
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:25,310
he got stung and in his heel got them in
the heel and he said it was just,

2471
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:27,240
he was delirious.
Exactly,

2472
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:28,790
exactly.
Said it lasts for a few hours,

2473
02:04:28,791 --> 02:04:29,780
then it goes away,
right?

2474
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:30,614
So what they do in this tribe is they 
take a bunch of these ants in the order 

2475
02:04:34,551 --> 02:04:38,010
of a couple of 100.
One is enough to cause agonizing,

2476
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:39,720
impossible,
delirious pain,

2477
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:45,470
and they said date them through this 
compound a and then they enter,

2478
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:52,620
weave them in these gloves,
these a leaf gloves so that when they're

2479
02:04:52,921 --> 02:04:53,754
coming to,
they come out of their stupor and you 

2480
02:04:56,191 --> 02:04:59,760
have your hands in there,
they start viciously biting you,

2481
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:00,623
stinging you,
and you're supposed to withstand that 

2482
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:05,220
pain without screaming.

2483
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:06,053
You have to take it.
And so you sort of almost go onto this 

2484
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:11,370
religious fervor,
this kind of an incantation,

2485
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:16,790
and you have to do that ritual 20 
separate occasions at different times on

2486
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:22,200
different days,
20 slash 20 before you are admitted into

2487
02:05:22,201 --> 02:05:24,180
the tribe of Warriors,
whatever.

2488
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,700
Well now let's think back to the 
engagement ring,

2489
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:27,534
right?
If all it takes for me to convince you 

2490
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:34,500
of my honest intentions is to buy you 
flowers and now let's go back behind the

2491
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:36,420
shed and you know,
have sex,

2492
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:40,320
well then a lot of cheaters are going to
convince you of doing this one.

2493
02:05:40,321 --> 02:05:41,154
They really didn't have good intentions,
but if it takes for me to spend a 

2494
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:47,160
quarter of my salary to convince you 
that I have honestly,

2495
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:48,083
so therefore this is a form of what's 
called is a hobby and signaling because 

2496
02:05:50,331 --> 02:05:54,420
it's a hobby,
was a Israeli ornithologist that studied

2497
02:05:54,421 --> 02:05:55,254
this type of behavior,
this costly signaling behavior using 

2498
02:05:57,870 --> 02:05:59,850
Arabian babblers,
which is a type of bird.

2499
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:02,040
So here's another example of as a hobby 
having signal,

2500
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:08,440
you probably have seen this when you 
have a Predator that's looking at who to

2501
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:12,240
attack,
you often will have gazelles starting to

2502
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:17,340
actually make themselves conspicuously 
visible to the Predator.

2503
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,350
They come close to them and they start 
jumping from,

2504
02:06:19,351 --> 02:06:21,540
have you ever seen this student?
I think it's called stroking,

2505
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:22,973
not strutting.
And can you think why that would be 

2506
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:27,810
like,
why are they not hiding?

2507
02:06:27,811 --> 02:06:31,200
Why are they not making themselves a 
inconspicuously?

2508
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:32,303
Why are they drawing attention to 
themselves when they are 50 different 

2509
02:06:36,331 --> 02:06:38,310
gazelles that the Predator could be 
pointing to?

2510
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:39,510
Why?
Well,

2511
02:06:39,511 --> 02:06:40,344
because what what,
what that animal is saying is the fact 

2512
02:06:44,611 --> 02:06:45,444
that I could stand here in front of you 
and jump up and down and make myself 

2513
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:50,723
this visible suggests that it's probably
a lost cause for you to try to go after 

2514
02:06:55,981 --> 02:06:56,190
me.

2515
02:06:56,190 --> 02:06:57,900
I'm Super Fit,
right?

2516
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:03,000
It's a costly signal of my fitness.
It's an honest signal,

2517
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:03,893
right?
The one who is not doing this behavior 

2518
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:09,940
is the one that you should be paying 
attention to interest.

2519
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:13,560
So this is called and so I use this 
principle of as a hobby and signaling to

2520
02:07:13,561 --> 02:07:15,870
explain things like conspicuous 
consumption,

2521
02:07:15,871 --> 02:07:16,704
right?
The reason why you buy the fancy car 

2522
02:07:19,081 --> 02:07:21,900
that the other males can't hope to 
purchase,

2523
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:26,700
it's precisely because they can't afford
to match your signal.

2524
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:27,683
Therefore it's an honest signal.
The reason why I buy 100 million dollar 

2525
02:07:30,631 --> 02:07:35,631
painting that a monkey could have drawn 
shows how wealthy I am,

2526
02:07:36,071 --> 02:07:38,590
that I could waste $100,
million dollars.

2527
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,640
Oh,
that makes sense.

2528
02:07:41,150 --> 02:07:43,250
That makes sense.
It's all just meeting stuff.

2529
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:44,263
It's mating and food.
You don't want to become somebody 

2530
02:07:47,031 --> 02:07:47,864
dinner.
You want to find dinner and you want to 

2531
02:07:48,831 --> 02:07:50,630
have sex.
Goodnight everybody.

2532
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,740
Yeah.
Those signals are so fascinating.

2533
02:07:54,741 --> 02:07:57,680
When we see them in our culture and 
people get angry at them,

2534
02:07:57,950 --> 02:07:58,783
like you see some guy pull up in a 
Ferrari and you go look at this fucking 

2535
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:03,170
loser with those little Duke,
right?

2536
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:04,083
You're like maybe.
Or maybe a guy with a shitload of money 

2537
02:08:06,741 --> 02:08:10,370
wants to let the world know because he 
likes to fuck you.

2538
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:12,410
Right.
I've shared actually on this show,

2539
02:08:12,411 --> 02:08:13,244
I think the stories about my.
One of my brothers who was a big car 

2540
02:08:15,891 --> 02:08:17,840
collector,
three Ferrari's,

2541
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:19,033
Aston Martin Lagonda,
and I've even shared a story which I'm 

2542
02:08:22,281 --> 02:08:23,114
happy to repeat of.
We would go to nightclubs where he's 

2543
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,220
this,
this is the Olympian,

2544
02:08:28,221 --> 02:08:29,960
this is the five foot three guy,

2545
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:31,853
go to nightclubs and he would pick the 
most beautiful woman and approach her 

2546
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,780
even though she's accompanied by six 
foot four,

2547
02:08:37,110 --> 02:08:38,850
you know,
tough fucking guy.

2548
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:40,163
And he had that confidence.
I think because he had that wealth 

2549
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,940
catapulting him.
He

2550
02:08:46,130 --> 02:08:47,990
certainly helps.
It certainly helps.

2551
02:08:48,230 --> 02:08:49,400
Yeah,
it's um,

2552
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:51,273
it,
it,

2553
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,133
it is a weird ever prevalent aspect in 
the communication between men and 

2554
02:08:58,491 --> 02:09:01,460
females is how much money does the man 
have,

2555
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:02,331
right.
I mean,

2556
02:09:02,331 --> 02:09:03,164
and this is one thing that a lot of 
women hate because they don't want to 

2557
02:09:05,511 --> 02:09:07,460
feel like they can be purchased and they
can't,

2558
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:09,410
they can't,
they can't,

2559
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:13,220
some can write a lot can.
It's a factor.

2560
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:18,140
It's a big and a lot of women are very 
just rabidly ruthlessly independent.

2561
02:09:18,141 --> 02:09:20,330
They don't want that ever in their life 
and good for them.

2562
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:21,313
But,
but the reality is that's a very 

2563
02:09:23,901 --> 02:09:24,734
effective strategy.
You pull up in that Ferrari or that 

2564
02:09:27,471 --> 02:09:29,790
Rolls Royce or whatever the fuck you're 
driving and it,

2565
02:09:29,791 --> 02:09:30,624
it has a big impact and you get to that 
nightclub and those studies have been 

2566
02:09:33,591 --> 02:09:36,850
done endlessly and psychology.
So here's one example,

2567
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:39,900
and you don't need to have a signal as 
big as a Ferrari,

2568
02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:43,860
just how you dress in terms of the 
status that is exhibited.

2569
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:47,130
So there's a study that was done,
I think in the early nineties where they

2570
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:50,010
manipulated the status,
the sartorial,

2571
02:09:50,011 --> 02:09:50,844
the,
the attire of men and women into one of 

2572
02:09:53,581 --> 02:09:54,480
three different types,
you know,

2573
02:09:54,481 --> 02:09:55,314
high status,
medium and know some tee shirt or a 

2574
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,470
McDonald's uniform,
whatever.

2575
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:01,290
And then they asked men and women,
uh,

2576
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:03,460
one of six possible,
you know,

2577
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:06,750
would you go out for coffee with this 
guy when you go out on dinner,

2578
02:10:06,751 --> 02:10:08,340
would you have sex with him?
Would you marry him?

2579
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:11,760
And across all six levels of 
relationships,

2580
02:10:12,150 --> 02:10:17,150
the status of the attire of a man had a 
profound effect on the likelihood of the

2581
02:10:17,431 --> 02:10:19,980
woman saying yes,
higher status,

2582
02:10:19,981 --> 02:10:24,981
the more likely she said yes.
That same manipulation on women had zero

2583
02:10:25,891 --> 02:10:28,170
effect on men.
In other words,

2584
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:31,560
no man has ever uttered the following 
words,

2585
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,710
my God,
you've got a but,

2586
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:34,723
and I'd love to have sex with you,
but you're not exhibiting cues of 

2587
02:10:37,281 --> 02:10:39,590
ambition,
therefore no sex for you,

2588
02:10:39,591 --> 02:10:41,330
Linda.
Yeah.

2589
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:42,353
So that's a reality.
That's a reality that people are very 

2590
02:10:44,341 --> 02:10:45,174
uncomfortable with.
And I don't think women necessarily are 

2591
02:10:48,931 --> 02:10:52,560
craving the same reaction from men 
because of their ambition.

2592
02:10:52,561 --> 02:10:56,310
I don't think women are ever saying 
through my ambition,

2593
02:10:56,311 --> 02:10:58,110
I'm going to get a good man.
Right?

2594
02:10:58,230 --> 02:10:59,063
You know,
just,

2595
02:10:59,180 --> 02:11:03,930
just not a factor.
But they do say through my ambition,

2596
02:11:03,931 --> 02:11:05,910
I'm never going to need a map.
True.

2597
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:08,150
That's because that's just.
Look,

2598
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,433
the reality is there's a lot of shitty 
human beings out there and some of them 

2599
02:11:12,151 --> 02:11:12,984
have penises and if you're a woman and 
you run into too many of those or for 

2600
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:19,470
buy for whatever reason,
because of your environment,

2601
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,870
because of your behavior,
because of the circles,

2602
02:11:21,871 --> 02:11:24,960
you travel in your around too many of 
them,

2603
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,870
a large dating pool of shitheads out 
there.

2604
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:29,280
You know,
you just say,

2605
02:11:29,281 --> 02:11:31,000
I don't want this in my life.
I want.

2606
02:11:31,001 --> 02:11:33,930
I don't want to be like my mom.
I don't want to be like my sister.

2607
02:11:33,931 --> 02:11:37,950
I want to be independent.
But what you're not saying is I am going

2608
02:11:37,951 --> 02:11:42,030
to get a bar house and a baller car and 
I'm going to get me a man.

2609
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:45,990
And the only woman that I know of that 
I've ever heard say that is disgusting.

2610
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:47,910
And the only woman that I ever,
she's like,

2611
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:48,903
you know,
talking about her success and our 

2612
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:53,130
success allows her to get men.
She's a foul beast.

2613
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:54,051
Wow.
Yeah.

2614
02:11:54,051 --> 02:11:55,470
She's not.
It's not healthy.

2615
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,183
A lot of women,
it's not so much that they're 

2616
02:11:58,321 --> 02:11:59,154
interesting.
I mean resources are good only to the 

2617
02:12:01,051 --> 02:12:03,870
extent that they allow you to ascend the
social hierarchy,

2618
02:12:03,871 --> 02:12:04,610
right?
This,

2619
02:12:04,610 --> 02:12:08,130
this doesn't explain why some women are 
attracted to the starving artists,

2620
02:12:08,131 --> 02:12:08,964
right?
Because why are so many women 

2621
02:12:10,201 --> 02:12:12,000
romanticizing over the guy with the 
guitar.

2622
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:16,950
But that's because they are choosing him
based on his future trajectory.

2623
02:12:16,951 --> 02:12:18,260
Right?
I am back.

2624
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:20,093
I am banking on the fact that you 
exhibit enough talent that I suspect 

2625
02:12:24,451 --> 02:12:27,000
that by investing in you,
by choosing you,

2626
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,950
it's going to take me to that 
trajectory.

2627
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:31,440
No woman has ever uttered the following 
words.

2628
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:35,310
You have no talent.
You exhibit no ambition.

2629
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:37,740
You're never going to step out of the 
basement.

2630
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:39,100
Let's have sex.
And you know,

2631
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,133
so.
So it's not that women are only 

2632
02:12:41,521 --> 02:12:45,210
interested in money.
They're interested in a panoply of cues,

2633
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:50,070
all of which relate to the potential of 
ascending the social hierarchy.

2634
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,750
Yeah,
that makes sense,

2635
02:12:52,220 --> 02:12:57,220
but it makes sense that these things are
biologically interwoven into our psyche.

2636
02:12:57,570 --> 02:12:58,680
No kidding.
It makes sense.

2637
02:12:58,710 --> 02:12:59,211
I mean,
it just.

2638
02:12:59,211 --> 02:13:00,450
It.
It's unavoidable.

2639
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:00,850
Well,
that's.

2640
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:01,683
That's why I'm always on.
I think the first time that I came on 

2641
02:13:03,131 --> 02:13:04,090
this show,
we discussed this.

2642
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:08,380
I'm always amazed that so many people 
have such antipathy towards evolutionary

2643
02:13:08,381 --> 02:13:11,500
psychology because there is really no 
other game in town.

2644
02:13:11,501 --> 02:13:15,580
I mean it.
What else could explain the evolution of

2645
02:13:15,581 --> 02:13:19,630
the most important organ that defines 
our person had called the human mind,

2646
02:13:19,631 --> 02:13:20,440
right?
I mean,

2647
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:21,273
you're comfortable accepting that the 
liver and the kidneys and the heart has 

2648
02:13:24,341 --> 02:13:25,174
evolved through evolution,
but you can't accept that your mind and 

2649
02:13:27,851 --> 02:13:29,420
your brain has evolved through 
evolution,

2650
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:31,860
so it's really.
It's an form

2651
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:37,250
insane form of science denialism that 
I've spent 25 years fighting and I'm not

2652
02:13:38,281 --> 02:13:40,650
sure if I'm any closer to winning the 
battle.

2653
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:43,680
It's the only form of science denialism.
It's culturally acceptable.

2654
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:44,543
It's culturally acceptable because it 
defines people in a way that makes them 

2655
02:13:47,521 --> 02:13:50,550
feel like animals or makes them feel 
cheap or it makes them feel like they're

2656
02:13:50,551 --> 02:13:52,120
prostitutes.
You know?

2657
02:13:52,130 --> 02:13:52,963
It makes it,
makes people feel like they're 

2658
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:55,050
prostitutes,
and interestingly,

2659
02:13:55,051 --> 02:13:55,884
it comes a lot more for this particular 
form of science than eyes and from the 

2660
02:13:58,681 --> 02:13:59,514
left.
This is why a lot of a lot of people 

2661
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:02,460
will write me and say,
well,

2662
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:05,670
why do you seem to be critiquing a lot 
more people on the left and the right?

2663
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:08,670
That's not.
That's not showing my political colors.

2664
02:14:08,671 --> 02:14:12,030
It's simply because the ecosystem that I
navigate in,

2665
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:12,893
which is called academia,
it just so happens that most of the bs 

2666
02:14:15,391 --> 02:14:19,080
comes from the left because the academia
is laden with leftists,

2667
02:14:19,470 --> 02:14:22,380
so it's not so much that I give a free 
pass to the right.

2668
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:25,770
When you have a right wing senator who 
denies evolution,

2669
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:26,633
I'm the first to also critique him,
but the reality is when it comes to 

2670
02:14:29,371 --> 02:14:32,250
human nature,
it's really the leftists who are denying

2671
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:34,200
the biological basis of our human 
nature.

2672
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:38,910
Why do you think that this science 
denialism is so prevalent on the last,

2673
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:39,863
on the left when it comes to gender?
Because gender seems to be the 

2674
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:46,260
battleground.
It seems to be the battle ground even in

2675
02:14:46,261 --> 02:14:47,910
terms of transgender,
right?

2676
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:49,200
Uh,
but the,

2677
02:14:49,201 --> 02:14:50,034
the battleground of gender,
whether it's the gender pay gap or 

2678
02:14:53,551 --> 02:14:58,551
whether it's traditional gender roles,
this seems to be where science denialism

2679
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:04,130
lives on the left in the more,
you know,

2680
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:09,160
like what I always grew up thinking 
about the left,

2681
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,433
the left was always more open minded.
They were supposed to be the more 

2682
02:15:13,681 --> 02:15:17,010
educated and they were supposed to be 
more compassionate people.

2683
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:20,820
So something happened and I don't know 
when it happened,

2684
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:24,770
but somewhere along the line,
this science denialism and this,

2685
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,813
for whatever reason,
this idea that if it shows any 

2686
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:30,714
differences,
if there's any statistics or any data 

2687
02:15:32,701 --> 02:15:34,620
that shows differences between the men 
and the women,

2688
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:36,090
that this is somehow.

2689
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:39,013
This is somehow an example of sexism or 
patriarchal tyranny or there's a reason 

2690
02:15:46,281 --> 02:15:49,580
for this that's negative.
So I think the reason is actually quite,

2691
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:50,533
quite simple.
At the right wing folks who deny 

2692
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:57,200
science,
it's typically for religious ideological

2693
02:15:57,201 --> 02:15:58,760
reasons for industry,
right?

2694
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,863
So,
so there is some pet ideology that is 

2695
02:16:02,361 --> 02:16:03,194
threatening me and therefore I'm going 
to deny science this exact same thing 

2696
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:08,323
happening with the left.
They also have been parametize a quasi 

2697
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,040
religion.
It's called progressivism.

2698
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:15,500
Okay.
And I say progressivism in quotes,

2699
02:16:15,501 --> 02:16:16,380
right?
Uh,

2700
02:16:16,381 --> 02:16:18,500
you know,
equality of outcomes and all the rest of

2701
02:16:18,501 --> 02:16:19,310
the garbage,
right?

2702
02:16:19,310 --> 02:16:23,660
And therefore to the extent that 
evolutionary theory in general,

2703
02:16:23,690 --> 02:16:24,523
but evolutionary psychology in 
particular is a threat to my quasi 

2704
02:16:28,251 --> 02:16:30,160
religion than I will reject

2705
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:33,280
it.
This is why evolution deniers tend to be

2706
02:16:33,281 --> 02:16:37,120
on the right and evolution psychology 
that iris than to be on the left.

2707
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:39,820
They've both been parasitized by 
religions.

2708
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:41,720
They're just different religions.
That's so,

2709
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:42,753
that's a fast anyway to look at it,
that progressivism is in fact some sort 

2710
02:16:46,421 --> 02:16:47,254
of religion and it makes sense if you're
looking at the science denialism aspect 

2711
02:16:49,871 --> 02:16:54,010
of it because you're not looking at it 
in terms of an objective analysis of all

2712
02:16:54,011 --> 02:16:55,660
the facts and the data that's in front 
of you.

2713
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:56,733
You're saying what fits this construct,
what fits this pattern of behavior that 

2714
02:17:01,601 --> 02:17:02,434
I've chosen to adopt,
and then I have to show all the people 

2715
02:17:04,451 --> 02:17:08,110
that are around me like you accused Sean
Carroll of doing,

2716
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:12,760
adopting this instead of looking at the 
actual facts of this case.

2717
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,920
Postmodernism,
I think.

2718
02:17:14,921 --> 02:17:17,270
Did you have.
You had the grievance studies focused on

2719
02:17:17,271 --> 02:17:17,830
the right.

2720
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:19,240
Fantastic.
I mean Peter,

2721
02:17:19,241 --> 02:17:22,120
but goes,
I mean Kim's Lindsey,

2722
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:23,950
could you,
could you believe that?

2723
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:27,370
This is stuff that is repeatedly 
wonderful,

2724
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:28,810
right?
That podcast.

2725
02:17:28,811 --> 02:17:30,160
If you haven't heard it,
folks,

2726
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:35,161
please listen to it.
These guys and a Gal with the woman from

2727
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:38,760
Helen Blank rows,
James Lindsey and Peter Boghossian.

2728
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:39,623
Yeah.
People goes to you and James Lindsey 

2729
02:17:40,331 --> 02:17:41,380
with the one we're here.
Uh,

2730
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:43,840
the woman Helen lives in England.
Yes.

2731
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:45,333
And they came on the podcast and they 
talked about all these different false 

2732
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:50,673
studies and false papers that they 
published that were peer reviewed and 

2733
02:17:54,221 --> 02:17:55,054
published in academic journals that like
things like what was the one 

2734
02:18:01,330 --> 02:18:04,010
heteronormativity in dog parks.
Yeah.

2735
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:05,140
So,
so the,

2736
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:06,063
the humping.
And I tell you a quick funny story 

2737
02:18:07,961 --> 02:18:10,720
phobia and dog parks.
So I'll,

2738
02:18:10,721 --> 02:18:12,040
I'll,
I'll say this,

2739
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:16,870
a few folks knew about this project 
before it came out.

2740
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:20,670
One of them has a name that sounds like 
glaad slide.

2741
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:22,390
Oh,
I didn't know that guy.

2742
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:24,280
He's just glad.
Father,

2743
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:25,173
he's the godfather now.
It turns out that I didn't know the 

2744
02:18:27,791 --> 02:18:28,624
which,
which particular studies they were 

2745
02:18:29,321 --> 02:18:30,910
sending out.
I knew about the general project,

2746
02:18:30,911 --> 02:18:34,180
but I didn't know the details and so I 
wanted this project go on for,

2747
02:18:34,181 --> 02:18:36,550
I think it was maybe 18 months if I'm 
not mistaken,

2748
02:18:36,551 --> 02:18:38,110
something that order.
Well,

2749
02:18:38,190 --> 02:18:40,870
at one point I was flipping through 
something,

2750
02:18:40,871 --> 02:18:41,704
whatever,
and I saw the dog rape culture stuff 

2751
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:46,510
new.
So I contact feet.

2752
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:47,913
I go,
I just,

2753
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:50,140
there was no even sanitation,
there wasn't.

2754
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:51,400
Hi,
how are you?

2755
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:54,310
I go dog park rape you.

2756
02:18:56,510 --> 02:19:01,120
So he calls me up like within a few 
seconds he's just cracking up laughing.

2757
02:19:01,780 --> 02:19:04,180
That's the background to some of these 
stories.

2758
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:05,043
He was up for some sort of disciplinary 
review right after he left the podcast 

2759
02:19:09,281 --> 02:19:12,220
with me.
I don't know how that went or what went.

2760
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:14,040
A lot of people are gunning for him.
Yeah,

2761
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:15,910
he was.
He was explaining that,

2762
02:19:15,911 --> 02:19:20,290
but I think what he's doing is very 
valuable and I think that it needs to be

2763
02:19:20,291 --> 02:19:23,950
known and especially in terms of like 
people listening to this,

2764
02:19:23,951 --> 02:19:27,530
they're going to send their kids to 
these fucking schools and spend $50,000

2765
02:19:27,531 --> 02:19:28,364
a year.

2766
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:29,750
This is why,
by the way,

2767
02:19:29,751 --> 02:19:31,250
people,
often times people write to me.

2768
02:19:31,251 --> 02:19:33,230
Even even my wife was telling me,
well,

2769
02:19:33,231 --> 02:19:34,064
why do you care so much about this?
Is it because imagine all of these 

2770
02:19:37,341 --> 02:19:38,174
people,
they're spending their parents hard 

2771
02:19:39,021 --> 02:19:39,854
earned money.
They could have been studying tons of 

2772
02:19:41,451 --> 02:19:43,820
really interesting,
true things and I don't mean true.

2773
02:19:43,821 --> 02:19:44,654
It has to be scientific.
You could study art and you could study 

2774
02:19:47,001 --> 02:19:48,740
literature.
You could study philosophy,

2775
02:19:48,890 --> 02:19:49,723
so I'm not.
I'm not creating a hierarchy of 

2776
02:19:50,901 --> 02:19:52,220
knowledge.
It's all good,

2777
02:19:52,221 --> 02:19:55,820
but as long as you are committed to 
reason to logic and so on,

2778
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:59,540
these fields are what I call 
intellectual terrorism.

2779
02:19:59,630 --> 02:20:04,630
They're nihilists and it pisses me off 
as a professor that they've been allowed

2780
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:06,680
to promulgate for 40,
50 years,

2781
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:07,813
untouched.
And so those who argue that these guys 

2782
02:20:10,581 --> 02:20:12,050
were frauds because they,
they,

2783
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:12,501
you know,
they,

2784
02:20:12,501 --> 02:20:14,450
they submitted these papers under a 
pseudonym.

2785
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:15,950
Well,
what did you expect them to do?

2786
02:20:15,951 --> 02:20:16,290
I mean,
if,

2787
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:17,123
if you're a whistleblower,
do you not submit your complaint or 

2788
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:21,793
using the name Jane Doe?
So the fact that they use a pseudonym 

2789
02:20:24,561 --> 02:20:25,394
that's hardly fraudulent.
If you're going to demonstrate how 

2790
02:20:28,071 --> 02:20:28,904
fraudulent that whole enterprise is.
So what if you use the false name and 

2791
02:20:31,671 --> 02:20:32,780
what do you think?
Don't you agree?

2792
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:33,890
Oh,
100 percent.

2793
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,753
Yeah,
it's,

2794
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:35,593
it's important.
It's important to expose this idiocy 

2795
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:39,853
because it's so prevalent and it's so 
ridiculous and there's a bunch of fake 

2796
02:20:42,981 --> 02:20:43,814
intellectuals out there that are 
repeating all this nonsense and so when 

2797
02:20:47,661 --> 02:20:52,661
they see this and what's should be 
almost like onion level satire,

2798
02:20:53,211 --> 02:20:57,180
obvious and they don't think so.
And they rewarded and they,

2799
02:20:57,181 --> 02:20:58,014
they talk about it's one of the best 
papers they've read this year because 

2800
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:01,763
these people are preposterous and this 
is just one of those things where you 

2801
02:21:04,791 --> 02:21:07,970
let people get away with things and then
they keep pushing it,

2802
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:09,950
keep pushing it,
it goes further.

2803
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:13,490
They keep getting further with it and 
eventually they just get away.

2804
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:16,010
They're too far gone.
You can't bring them back.

2805
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:19,790
I actually told Pete and I hope I don't 
think he'll mind that I'm sharing this,

2806
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:21,653
but when,
when he was telling me about the 

2807
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:23,114
project,
one of the things that I try to temper 

2808
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:29,980
or his expectations of how much of a 
fatal blow the project would be,

2809
02:21:31,491 --> 02:21:35,990
he I had the feeling that he was 
thinking that if we are successful,

2810
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:40,670
it's the end of the bullshit,
the bullshit edifices and I kept saying,

2811
02:21:40,671 --> 02:21:41,504
look,
I think it's really important what 

2812
02:21:42,261 --> 02:21:43,094
you're doing,
and of course I supported in any way 

2813
02:21:44,331 --> 02:21:45,920
that I can help and advise you and so 
on.

2814
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:46,823
I'm there for you,
but I don't think you should think that 

2815
02:21:49,851 --> 02:21:50,684
it's going to end and I think I've been 
proven to be right because you're 100 

2816
02:21:53,031 --> 02:21:53,864
percent right,
because I think postmodernism by its 

2817
02:21:55,641 --> 02:21:58,670
very definition is almost like a snake 
that can't be killed.

2818
02:21:58,671 --> 02:22:01,350
Right.
Who are you to judge what is bullshit or

2819
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:03,740
not exactly.
I mean,

2820
02:22:03,741 --> 02:22:05,780
what percentage of an impact do you 
think it had?

2821
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:08,360
Do you think it killed one percent of 
the bullshit?

2822
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:10,070
Maybe a bit more.
Two.

2823
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:12,830
I can't put a number,
but I certainly five.

2824
02:22:12,831 --> 02:22:14,510
Let's be generous.
Let's go with five.

2825
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,820
By the way,
I've spoken to,

2826
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:19,130
you know Alan.
So the original Ho,

2827
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:21,800
do you know the,
the history of this type of hoaxing?

2828
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,693
No.
So the original hoax was done by Allen 

2829
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:26,280
Soko,

2830
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:31,280
s o k a l who is a physicist who in 1996
submitted a paper.

2831
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:33,810
He's so,
he's a physicist,

2832
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:34,500
so he's,
you know,

2833
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:36,510
hardcore scientists.
And he was,

2834
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:37,373
he was so pissed off and all these post 
modernists that he submitted a paper on 

2835
02:22:41,791 --> 02:22:42,624
the Hermeneutics of gravity,
all this kind of bs and they of course 

2836
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:47,633
lapped it up because here's a physicist 
who's now joining the Pantheon of our 

2837
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:53,430
bullshit,
therefore let's accept it.

2838
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:54,990
And then of course at that point he 
said,

2839
02:22:55,350 --> 02:22:56,183
oh,
I have something to admit to you guys 

2840
02:22:58,170 --> 02:22:59,003
now.
Him and I had communicated at one point 

2841
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:04,360
I had written an article about his hoax 
and he corrected me.

2842
02:23:04,361 --> 02:23:05,970
It was very,
very cute because I said,

2843
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:06,833
you know,
this guy created some pseudo random 

2844
02:23:08,821 --> 02:23:10,110
bullshit,
and he said,

2845
02:23:10,111 --> 02:23:10,681
well,
you know,

2846
02:23:10,681 --> 02:23:11,514
professor side,
I actually spent quite a bit of effort 

2847
02:23:14,101 --> 02:23:16,950
coming up with all these words,
so it wasn't random bs.

2848
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:17,784
It was very well thought out vs.
so this is a guy that you might want to 

2849
02:23:21,931 --> 02:23:22,764
have on.
I don't know if he doesn't any these 

2850
02:23:23,611 --> 02:23:24,510
pockets,
but he's the,

2851
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:28,920
he's the godfather of hoaxing.
This stuff.

2852
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:30,353
It's just got to be so frustrating to be
in academia and to see all this around 

2853
02:23:34,261 --> 02:23:35,094
you and see all these false thinkers,
these fake people putting this con game 

2854
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:41,813
in the middle of a real learning 
institution and not only that but this 

2855
02:23:45,151 --> 02:23:45,984
being celebrated by other true academics
because they don't want to get called 

2856
02:23:49,861 --> 02:23:53,670
out as being racist or homophobic or 
transphobic or whatever the fuck it is.

2857
02:23:53,671 --> 02:23:58,590
These morons are celebrating this.
This is a weird trickery to me.

2858
02:23:58,591 --> 02:24:02,820
It's almost like being a comedian and 
being around joke thieves,

2859
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:04,800
right?
It's like almost the same thing.

2860
02:24:04,830 --> 02:24:08,190
I know you're not the same thing as me.
You're a faker.

2861
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:10,950
You're faking this thing,
we're in this artist's colony.

2862
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:11,873
Everybody else is struggling to come up 
with material and you're just stealing 

2863
02:24:15,061 --> 02:24:15,894
it,
and this is what is going on with these 

2864
02:24:17,581 --> 02:24:18,414
gender studies.
People like you're pretending you're an 

2865
02:24:19,841 --> 02:24:22,290
intellectual.
So this is craziness.

2866
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:23,270
You're,
you're,

2867
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:25,620
you're ignoring the science.

2868
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:26,593
So I have a theory.
So the original postmodernists were all 

2869
02:24:29,141 --> 02:24:31,360
French postmodernist.
I don't know if you know their name,

2870
02:24:31,361 --> 02:24:35,680
but for your viewers to Michelle Fuco,
Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida,

2871
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:37,180
the three grand bullshitters.
Okay.

2872
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:39,550
And so I have here,
was this the seventies?

2873
02:24:39,551 --> 02:24:40,384
This is started about the sixties and 
seventies really went into full 

2874
02:24:43,181 --> 02:24:45,340
throttle.
Right?

2875
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:48,280
Now I,
I'm going to link this back to mating.

2876
02:24:48,281 --> 02:24:49,510
Remember we said everything.
Okay?

2877
02:24:49,870 --> 02:24:50,703
Now,
I genuinely think that in the deep 

2878
02:24:52,031 --> 02:24:52,864
recesses of their minds,
these three fraudsters that not believe 

2879
02:24:56,321 --> 02:24:57,154
a single thing and what they were doing,
but they quickly learned that if they 

2880
02:24:59,741 --> 02:25:00,574
stood in front of a crowd uttered some 
full profundity jibberish and you had 

2881
02:25:04,121 --> 02:25:04,954
all the hot,
beautiful young ladies sitting and 

2882
02:25:06,731 --> 02:25:07,564
looking at you as if you a deep poet,
they quickly learned that there's 

2883
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:13,083
evolutionary rewards that come with 
their full profundity and so the train 

2884
02:25:16,661 --> 02:25:21,661
was off and they weren't going to get 
off the station and then that's it.

2885
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,580
The trajectory set.
I truly believe

2886
02:25:24,910 --> 02:25:29,730
that if we could ever find some diary or
something of these rounds there,

2887
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:33,610
they probably have written my God that I
get a lot of women.

2888
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:34,593
I guess Michelle for core was gay.
Maybe a lot of young men through my 

2889
02:25:38,201 --> 02:25:39,250
trickery.
In other words,

2890
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:41,190
I think they admitted it that openly.
No,

2891
02:25:41,850 --> 02:25:42,683
I don't even in a diary.
I doubt they admitted it to themselves 

2892
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:46,510
that openly,
but so.

2893
02:25:46,511 --> 02:25:49,660
Do you think that in the deep recesses 
of their mind when they went to bed,

2894
02:25:50,050 --> 02:25:50,883
do you think that they've convinced 
themselves that they are saying 

2895
02:25:52,031 --> 02:25:54,460
something profound or they know.
I know they're locked into.

2896
02:25:54,461 --> 02:25:55,294
I think this is what I think when most 
people are engaging in that sort of 

2897
02:25:58,901 --> 02:25:59,734
deceptive behavior,
they're locked into a pattern that they 

2898
02:26:01,721 --> 02:26:02,554
know is effective.
That pattern has some sort of an effect 

2899
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:08,550
of a beneficial effect on them,
whether it's sexually,

2900
02:26:08,770 --> 02:26:11,410
whether it's in terms of the social 
dynamics that they exist in.

2901
02:26:11,770 --> 02:26:14,680
There's this pattern.
They've found this pattern that they can

2902
02:26:14,681 --> 02:26:16,300
pursue.
That's what I believe,

2903
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:17,223
so therefore they are being self 
deceptive to the point where they 

2904
02:26:20,441 --> 02:26:21,274
believe their bullshit.
Well maybe maybe not even being self 

2905
02:26:23,411 --> 02:26:25,720
deceptive,
but certainly not being self analytical.

2906
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:26,290
They've,
they've,

2907
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:28,480
they've hit this hot spot where they,
you know,

2908
02:26:28,481 --> 02:26:33,481
they lock in and then they just follow 
what's effective and what's working.

2909
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:34,881
Yeah.
Perhaps you.

2910
02:26:34,881 --> 02:26:36,760
Right.
That's what I do think though,

2911
02:26:36,761 --> 02:26:39,160
that eventually all of these guys will 
die out.

2912
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:42,280
No.
So you think the BS,

2913
02:26:42,281 --> 02:26:43,114
we'll just find a new way,
will metamorphosize into some new 

2914
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:48,220
instantiation,
but it's always,

2915
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:51,610
there's always going to be a critical 
mass of bs in the university.

2916
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:52,743
I think there's always going to be a 
bunch of people that want to believe in 

2917
02:26:55,211 --> 02:26:56,044
things that are not true because that 
makes them seem better than what they 

2918
02:26:58,841 --> 02:26:59,674
really are.

2919
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:00,693
There's a bunch.
There's always going to be a bunch of 

2920
02:27:01,451 --> 02:27:06,451
people that want to avoid the reality of
essentially lives unfair,

2921
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:11,240
a ladder system of competition.
There's just.

2922
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:13,120
It's just unfair.
It was just.

2923
02:27:13,121 --> 02:27:16,900
A lot of it is just like the natural,
the natural world.

2924
02:27:16,901 --> 02:27:19,450
Nature itself is unfair.
Just in general,

2925
02:27:19,780 --> 02:27:22,750
you know that the salmon never gets to 
eat the eagle.

2926
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:26,320
It's just not fair.
And I think there's a lot of people that

2927
02:27:26,321 --> 02:27:31,321
find these inequalities and find this 
unfairness very disconcerting.

2928
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:33,993
It disturbs them to no end and they set 
out on a quest to try to more the world 

2929
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:43,630
and to some weird utopian fantasy land 
where everything has an equal outcome.

2930
02:27:43,631 --> 02:27:46,360
It doesn't exist.
But in people that are fucked,

2931
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:47,583
you know,
you get people that look like Lena 

2932
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:51,340
Dunham and they want to like sort of 
like balance out the playing field.

2933
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:52,420
This is like,
it's not fair,

2934
02:27:52,690 --> 02:27:55,300
right?
It's like how come Scarlett Johansson is

2935
02:27:55,301 --> 02:27:57,160
a woman and how come Lena Dunham is a 
woman?

2936
02:27:57,161 --> 02:27:59,740
Like what the fuck?
Like that's not fair,

2937
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:00,760
right?
It's not,

2938
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:01,663
it's.
There's a lot of things that aren't 

2939
02:28:02,141 --> 02:28:03,280
fair.
There's a lot of things that aren't fair

2940
02:28:03,430 --> 02:28:06,550
intellectually the way people's minds 
function.

2941
02:28:06,551 --> 02:28:07,384
They're not this.
There's people that are Ilan mosque and 

2942
02:28:09,821 --> 02:28:11,780
then there's a other folks,
right?

2943
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:15,610
We just not that bright and this is just
the way the world.

2944
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:19,090
So do you think as as fighters for 
reason,

2945
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,373
our objective is to simply make sure 
that the number of bullshitters stays 

2946
02:28:24,801 --> 02:28:25,634
below certain thresholds since we can't 
eradicate them fully according to your 

2947
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:29,203
view,
at least what we could do is sort of 

2948
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:34,400
steady the tides so that they're always 
below a certain number.

2949
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:35,234
In other words,
10 percent of people are going to be 

2950
02:28:36,801 --> 02:28:37,634
bullshitters in the university and as 
long as they don't get past that 

2951
02:28:39,201 --> 02:28:40,400
threshold,
we're doing a good job.

2952
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:41,473
Whereas I'd like to be more optimistic.
I'd like to eradicate all of the 

2953
02:28:43,431 --> 02:28:45,680
bullshitters.
I don't think that's possible,

2954
02:28:45,681 --> 02:28:46,514
but I think that bullshit as a whole is 
very attractive to people and it's very 

2955
02:28:51,171 --> 02:28:56,060
attractive to people to pursue.
It's very attractive to people to engage

2956
02:28:56,061 --> 02:28:59,190
in a,
they don't like reality and they want to

2957
02:28:59,210 --> 02:29:00,043
change things.
There's a lot of bullshit that does 

2958
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:02,623
exist in our culture and it has forever.
Why the Fucker chiropractor still 

2959
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:07,530
around?
Why are psychic still around right?

2960
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:09,590
Like there's a lot of nonsense out 
there.

2961
02:29:09,591 --> 02:29:11,710
And then when you look into what those,
what,

2962
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:14,600
what real evidence there is that 
psychics are real,

2963
02:29:14,601 --> 02:29:15,700
it's almost zero.
Well,

2964
02:29:15,701 --> 02:29:17,390
and I could link it by the way to 
marketing.

2965
02:29:17,391 --> 02:29:18,410
So,
uh,

2966
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:20,150
the dove,
the Dove Company,

2967
02:29:20,730 --> 02:29:21,563
they're probably their most successful 
campaign of all time has been one where 

2968
02:29:24,081 --> 02:29:27,380
they argued that beauty is a social 
construct.

2969
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:31,340
You're all beautiful in your own way.
Now that again is a beautiful message,

2970
02:29:31,341 --> 02:29:32,900
right?
Because if am someone,

2971
02:29:32,901 --> 02:29:36,980
if I'm a woman who doesn't score well on
the typical evolutionary cues,

2972
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:38,113
then what do I want to hear?
I want to hear that there is no such 

2973
02:29:39,711 --> 02:29:42,380
thing as evolutionary accused.
It's all socially constructed,

2974
02:29:42,650 --> 02:29:43,910
right?
If I have sagging breast,

2975
02:29:43,911 --> 02:29:47,780
if I have poor skin and so on,
if I have wrinkly skin,

2976
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:48,853
I'd like to believe that there is no 
such thing as an universal beauty 

2977
02:29:51,741 --> 02:29:52,574
standards,
and in that sense dove has been 

2978
02:29:54,831 --> 02:29:58,190
incredibly successful because by 
peddling false hope,

2979
02:29:58,610 --> 02:30:02,510
they've actually been able to tap into 
women's insecurities and incense.

2980
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:03,430
That's good marketing,
right?

2981
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:04,323
Did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan 
magazine that was widely criticized 

2982
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:14,830
because they had a morbidly obese woman 
on who was a bikini plus size model?

2983
02:30:15,801 --> 02:30:16,430
Yeah.
Yeah,

2984
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:17,263
and they were challenging beauty norms 
like this is a person that's eating 

2985
02:30:20,931 --> 02:30:21,860
themselves to death.

2986
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:22,693
You've got fucking assholes and so your 
lack of discipline and your desire to 

2987
02:30:28,671 --> 02:30:29,504
shame people who exercise and is what 
you're doing to make them feel bad 

2988
02:30:33,711 --> 02:30:34,544
because you feel bad that you can't put 
the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes 

2989
02:30:37,671 --> 02:30:38,504
down as a lead you to try to push this 
ridiculous standard and one of the 

2990
02:30:44,001 --> 02:30:44,834
things my point of view was,
could you imagine if the cover of men's 

2991
02:30:47,541 --> 02:30:51,410
health had an enormous fat guy with his 
gut hangover,

2992
02:30:51,530 --> 02:30:52,363
his belt,
and and people were saying the new 

2993
02:30:53,781 --> 02:30:54,614
standards of attractiveness for men have
been changed by Mike who just drinks 

2994
02:30:58,611 --> 02:31:00,500
beer and eats cake.
You'd be like,

2995
02:31:00,501 --> 02:31:02,570
get the fuck Outta here.
That's never going to fly.

2996
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:03,433
It's not going to fly with men,
but it does fly with women and by the 

2997
02:31:05,451 --> 02:31:08,480
way they go.
The Fat Acceptance Movement doesn't just

2998
02:31:08,481 --> 02:31:09,314
argue that you know not being 500 pounds
is unattractive because of the 

2999
02:31:13,521 --> 02:31:14,354
patriarchy.
They actually argue that the medical 

3000
02:31:16,251 --> 02:31:20,640
evidence suggesting that there is a link
between obesity and downstream

3001
02:31:20,730 --> 02:31:22,590
bad effects is all bullshit.

3002
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,590
They're not,
not just that they.

3003
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:25,713
They also point to one incredibly flawed
study that has been wildly disproven 

3004
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:31,523
that says that there's some sort of 
vigor or vitality involved in being 

3005
02:31:34,231 --> 02:31:37,560
overweight because they they get sick 
less.

3006
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:40,170
There's no,
no truth to that whatsoever.

3007
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:41,033
They only,
they only analyze people who were 

3008
02:31:42,601 --> 02:31:45,030
healthy at the time,
like it's there's.

3009
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:49,740
You can go and Google the study and find
out the criticism of that study,

3010
02:31:49,741 --> 02:31:52,920
but it's 100 percent horseshit folks 
being fat's not good for you.

3011
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:53,783
It's really bad for you when you're as 
big as that woman on the cover of 

3012
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:59,280
Cosmopolitan magazine.
She's literally morbidly obese.

3013
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:03,330
She's fucking dying.
She's addicted to food in a horrible way

3014
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:04,373
and to promote that and pretend that 
somehow or another this is okay and 

3015
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:08,743
we're going to.
We're going to show new standards of 

3016
02:32:10,471 --> 02:32:11,520
beauty.
You Go,

3017
02:32:11,521 --> 02:32:15,600
you giant gelatinous bag of meat and 
tissue.

3018
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:16,793
No,
that's a dying person who's addicted to 

3019
02:32:18,031 --> 02:32:19,560
food.
She doesn't want to look like that.

3020
02:32:19,670 --> 02:32:22,580
I feel as though given that on one of 
these shows,

3021
02:32:22,581 --> 02:32:24,650
you spend about 45 minutes fat shaming 
me,

3022
02:32:25,490 --> 02:32:26,323
that they talked to you about your diet.
There hasn't been a recognition of your 

3023
02:32:29,541 --> 02:32:31,700
slimness much,
much slimmer.

3024
02:32:31,701 --> 02:32:32,370
You are.
Slender,

3025
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:34,580
felt a bit of drool coming.
When I first came in,

3026
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:37,040
there was a bit of drool on the side of 
your thing when you saw me.

3027
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:38,800
You ridiculous.
No drawer.

3028
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:40,170
I'm happy for you.
Thank you.

3029
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:41,810
There's no drill.
How much weight have you lost?

3030
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:44,000
About 30.
That's nice.

3031
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:45,063
That's very good.
And I have to register as a dangerous 

3032
02:32:46,851 --> 02:32:47,601
weapon.
Wow.

3033
02:32:47,601 --> 02:32:48,500
Thirty more.
Yeah.

3034
02:32:48,590 --> 02:32:50,720
You're on the door.
What are you doing different?

3035
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:55,820
Great question.
At being accountable to the scale.

3036
02:32:56,270 --> 02:33:00,020
Being accountable to how many things go 
in my mouth.

3037
02:33:00,290 --> 02:33:05,240
So meaning every Friday,
no matter what I get on the scale,

3038
02:33:06,350 --> 02:33:07,130
you see what I'm saying?

3039
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:12,130
So I've put on three pounds,
therefore I intercept that trajectory at

3040
02:33:12,141 --> 02:33:12,974
three pounds rather than in four years 
when I get on the scale and I'm all 32 

3041
02:33:16,551 --> 02:33:19,820
pounds overweight.
So number one being a,

3042
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:22,610
you know,
privy to that information.

3043
02:33:22,611 --> 02:33:24,140
Secondly,
my wife,

3044
02:33:24,141 --> 02:33:24,974
whom you've met many times,
enters all my stuff and my fitness 

3045
02:33:28,011 --> 02:33:29,990
pal.com.
So at the end of the day,

3046
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:34,430
at the end of the day,
she tells me you've eaten 1,792

3047
02:33:34,431 --> 02:33:37,340
calories and you've exercised 400 
calories.

3048
02:33:37,341 --> 02:33:38,960
You had 1300 calories.
Good.

3049
02:33:39,380 --> 02:33:43,400
Now you might say that's not sustainable
to be so sort of Nazi,

3050
02:33:43,401 --> 02:33:45,320
like in terms of your accountability for
your whole life.

3051
02:33:45,321 --> 02:33:50,321
But for me that really works because I'm
very objective oriented.

3052
02:33:50,750 --> 02:33:51,583
If I let it slide,
then I can wake up one day and I'm 30 

3053
02:33:54,441 --> 02:33:54,960
pounds overweight.

3054
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:57,130
I don't think I've seen you.
Now that I think about.

3055
02:33:57,150 --> 02:33:57,983
I'm just trying to show you anything 
about your back and you couldn't get on 

3056
02:34:00,541 --> 02:34:02,430
my machine.
That's what it was.

3057
02:34:02,431 --> 02:34:03,880
I don't think we even talked about your 
weight.

3058
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:06,240
We did.
We were spending about 40 minutes,

3059
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:07,283
40 minutes.
You.

3060
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:09,480
As a matter of fact,
I remember that.

3061
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:11,250
I know that you don't read your 
comments.

3062
02:34:11,251 --> 02:34:12,084
I had gone to check some of the comments
that some people were quite upset at 

3063
02:34:14,281 --> 02:34:15,114
you.
Fat People for no for you that I'll 

3064
02:34:17,651 --> 02:34:18,400
maybe

3065
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:20,230
get off your ass.
You fat fucks.

3066
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:22,750
Lazy Bitch.
I knew it was coming from.

3067
02:34:23,250 --> 02:34:26,520
Was coming from concern and love Cyprus.
I didn't take it badly.

3068
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:28,540
Have you looked at what Jordan Peterson 
is doing?

3069
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:30,400
A lot of the meat stuff,
right?

3070
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:31,960
Yeah.
The carnivore diet,

3071
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:35,140
so very fascinating.
He's lost 50 pounds.

3072
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:38,290
He looks amazing.
He said he's at his intellectual peak.

3073
02:34:38,291 --> 02:34:41,470
He sees overrunning with energy.
It doesn't take any supplements,

3074
02:34:41,471 --> 02:34:43,420
doesn't take anything,
just eats meat.

3075
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:45,040
Wow.
It's astounding.

3076
02:34:45,230 --> 02:34:46,810
Do there.
I know that.

3077
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:48,520
Is that sorta the Quito thing,
right?

3078
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:49,840
There's no,
it's not.

3079
02:34:49,841 --> 02:34:50,674
It's different because of glucogenesis.
When you have a Quito is more fat than 

3080
02:34:55,031 --> 02:34:57,250
anything.
It's more fat even than proteins.

3081
02:34:57,430 --> 02:35:01,990
He's eating mostly protein and fat,
but much more protein that you would get

3082
02:35:01,991 --> 02:35:03,310
an acute agentic diet.
I see,

3083
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:05,530
so he's not necessarily in a state of 
ketosis.

3084
02:35:05,531 --> 02:35:06,364
I mean we probably have some of the time
when your body has a large quantity of 

3085
02:35:09,551 --> 02:35:10,384
protein,
your body converts that protein into 

3086
02:35:12,041 --> 02:35:13,960
glucose into glucogenesis.

3087
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:14,793
It's a very interesting process,
but it's one of the reasons why if you 

3088
02:35:18,281 --> 02:35:19,114
eat too much protein,
it knocks you out of ketosis because 

3089
02:35:20,741 --> 02:35:22,600
your body changes.
It turns it into glucose.

3090
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:25,930
What he's doing is essentially an 
elimination diet.

3091
02:35:25,931 --> 02:35:26,764
He's only eating meat and when I've 
talked to like actual real nutrition 

3092
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:33,850
experts who really understand the 
process,

3093
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:36,040
they do not recommend what he's doing 
great,

3094
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:36,933
but I think maybe that's because it 
hasn't been done and studied on a wide 

3095
02:35:41,111 --> 02:35:41,944
scale before.
There have been a few anecdotal reports 

3096
02:35:44,681 --> 02:35:49,300
about people have eating just meat for 
20 years and they're real healthy.

3097
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:53,590
It seems to really be effective with 
people that have autoimmune issues.

3098
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:54,693
People that have psoriasis,
people that have various autoimmune 

3099
02:35:56,921 --> 02:35:57,754
conditions.
It seems that cutting out all 

3100
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:03,100
inflammation causing foods,
meaning dairy,

3101
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:06,760
sugar,
all the pasta and bread,

3102
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:11,290
all those things seem to have a profound
effect on certain people.

3103
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:13,060
His daughters,
one of them,

3104
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:15,880
he's one of them and I know some other 
people as well.

3105
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:16,833
I know some really smart people that 
have gotten into that and they've 

3106
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:23,080
experienced profound changes in their 
body composition.

3107
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:24,700
They have lost a tremendous amount of 
weight.

3108
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,670
Even people that are eating a large 
amount of meat.

3109
02:36:28,450 --> 02:36:30,010
It's not something that's attractive to 
me.

3110
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:32,110
First of all,
I think fiber's important.

3111
02:36:32,111 --> 02:36:35,500
Phytonutrients that report and there's a
lot of stuff you get from vegetables and

3112
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:36,343
also I don't have a negative reaction to
vegetables doesn't seem to be affecting 

3113
02:36:40,121 --> 02:36:40,954
me,
but some people I think it's entirely 

3114
02:36:42,731 --> 02:36:43,564
possible do right and I think if you do 
have some really profound autoimmune 

3115
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:49,893
issues,
particularly it seems to be effective 

3116
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:54,250
with certain types of arthritis.
It's not the worst thing to give a shot.

3117
02:36:54,430 --> 02:36:58,420
I would definitely recommend that if you
did do something like that,

3118
02:36:58,570 --> 02:37:02,050
that you would supplement and I don't 
think Jordan's doing that at all.

3119
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:02,943
I don't think there's any harm 
whatsoever in supplementing with 

3120
02:37:05,171 --> 02:37:07,690
multivitamins,
getting your essential new nutrients,

3121
02:37:08,110 --> 02:37:12,850
essential fatty acids from fish oil,
the vitamin B Complex d complex,

3122
02:37:12,851 --> 02:37:16,010
make sure you've got all your bases 
covered nutritionally and then if your

3123
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,370
body just responds really well to only 
eating meat,

3124
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,520
I'm Jordan,
looks fantastic.

3125
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:23,713
Every time I talk to me it looks better.
I would be curious to know though what 

3126
02:37:26,151 --> 02:37:28,460
some of his metrics are.
The LDL hdl.

3127
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:31,190
Well,
here's the thing about that,

3128
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:36,520
you know that is very poorly understood 
and almost always misinterpreted the ldl

3129
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:37,933
hdl correspondence and what it means in 
terms of like whether or not you're 

3130
02:37:40,941 --> 02:37:44,870
healthy,
arterial plaque is important,

3131
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:45,733
and then there's.
There's all sorts of markers that can 

3132
02:37:47,931 --> 02:37:50,510
show inflammation,
inflammation in your body,

3133
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:52,123
what your blood pressure is,
how some people react much differently 

3134
02:37:56,391 --> 02:37:58,190
to the various foods,
right?

3135
02:37:58,191 --> 02:38:01,960
We obviously know that some people were 
to certain nuts this.

3136
02:38:01,970 --> 02:38:02,803
There's the people very biologically,
so much that one of the things that 

3137
02:38:07,111 --> 02:38:11,270
needs to do nutrition experts are saying
that if you just have your body consumed

3138
02:38:11,271 --> 02:38:13,430
just one thing and this elimination 
diet,

3139
02:38:13,820 --> 02:38:14,653
it eliminates so many different 
processes that your body has to engage 

3140
02:38:18,261 --> 02:38:19,094
in in order to break down all the other 
different things and then it eliminates 

3141
02:38:23,091 --> 02:38:26,270
all the different reactions that you get
from all these various foods.

3142
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:27,283
Your body's only concentrating on one 
food all the time and it seems to 

3143
02:38:31,461 --> 02:38:32,294
alleviate a lot of these conditions.
There's also the fact that when you're 

3144
02:38:35,961 --> 02:38:39,650
eating just meat,
you're not going to be as hungry.

3145
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:43,520
You're not going to.
You're not going to overeat as much.

3146
02:38:43,521 --> 02:38:48,260
It's it's much less likely that you 
overeat with protein than it is that you

3147
02:38:48,261 --> 02:38:49,094
overeat with pasta breads and sugars and
things along those lines in terms of 

3148
02:38:52,101 --> 02:38:53,300
caloric intake,
just you,

3149
02:38:53,301 --> 02:38:54,134
you hate,
you reach your satiety point very 

3150
02:38:55,581 --> 02:38:56,480
quickly.
Yes,

3151
02:38:56,540 --> 02:38:57,373
and that is probably a factor as well 
because Jordan has lost a tremendous 

3152
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:03,830
amount of weight and I think in losing 
that weight,

3153
02:39:03,831 --> 02:39:08,750
his body is less inflamed.
He has less fat that's in inhibiting his

3154
02:39:08,751 --> 02:39:11,760
motion and you know his arteries and his
body is.

3155
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:15,320
His limbs aren't as fat.
It's faces on fat.

3156
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:17,900
He's not snoring anymore,
which indicates that he was.

3157
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:18,913
He probably had some fat in his face and
it was kind of blocking and and 

3158
02:39:22,070 --> 02:39:25,160
constricting his breathing.
It's all really interesting.

3159
02:39:25,310 --> 02:39:28,280
There's a gentleman I not sure if I'm 
going to get his name right.

3160
02:39:28,281 --> 02:39:32,720
He's a nutritional psychiatrist at 
Columbia University.

3161
02:39:32,721 --> 02:39:33,554
I just discovered it recently while 
working out on the elliptical through 

3162
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:37,633
the a big thing series and he's got a 
couple of short clips where he talks 

3163
02:39:42,681 --> 02:39:47,030
about how he incorporates nutrition 
within his psychiatric practice.

3164
02:39:47,031 --> 02:39:47,864
I think his name is drew Ramsay.
He seems like a guy that would be 

3165
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:51,374
unplugging so many people.
You probably a few too many buddies 

3166
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:54,793
seemed like a a booking agent right now,
but I mean he seems like a really 

3167
02:39:59,751 --> 02:40:02,550
interesting guy because he shows you.
Here's a psychiatrist who,

3168
02:40:02,570 --> 02:40:03,403
who thinks ultimately that a lot of our 
mood related issues relate to what we 

3169
02:40:08,331 --> 02:40:09,080
put in our bodies.

3170
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:09,913
Well,
there's no question that inflammation 

3171
02:40:10,911 --> 02:40:15,911
has a direct result or a direct action 
on how you think and feel.

3172
02:40:16,710 --> 02:40:20,670
Inflammation makes people irritated.
It makes people with magic does a lot of

3173
02:40:20,671 --> 02:40:24,060
terrible things to just your body in 
general,

3174
02:40:24,061 --> 02:40:25,920
which affects your brain,
which is a part of your body.

3175
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:27,263
You know the idea that somehow or 
another non interchangeable is pretty 

3176
02:40:29,221 --> 02:40:30,054
preposterous and people that don't take 
care of their body but want their brain 

3177
02:40:32,701 --> 02:40:34,420
to be healthy.
That is like,

3178
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:35,760
you want your cake and you want to eat 
it.

3179
02:40:35,990 --> 02:40:37,470
Me,
it's like you don't.

3180
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:40,440
You don't make any sense.
You're not looking at it holistically.

3181
02:40:40,450 --> 02:40:44,430
So someone who is as passionate as you 
are about these issues.

3182
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,593
If someone in your family,
whether it be your wife or your 

3183
02:40:47,881 --> 02:40:49,890
children,
we're not doing the right choices,

3184
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:53,430
does that cause you to be that much more
irate because they're sort of within the

3185
02:40:53,431 --> 02:40:57,000
purview of your influence or how do you 
steer rebelling?

3186
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:59,610
I would think that maybe I'm being an 
overbearing asshole.

3187
02:40:59,611 --> 02:41:00,444
I would look at it internally first and 
then I would look at them and try to 

3188
02:41:04,291 --> 02:41:06,420
figure out like what?
What is,

3189
02:41:06,421 --> 02:41:07,650
what is?
What's wrong here?

3190
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:10,710
Is this simply a dietary thing or is it 
a psychological thing?

3191
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:11,963
It will become a big project for sure.
I mean when there's a loved one that's 

3192
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:16,680
essentially eating themselves into poor 
health,

3193
02:41:17,070 --> 02:41:19,800
which is really common.
It's more common than.

3194
02:41:19,801 --> 02:41:20,940
It's not.
In fact,

3195
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:24,450
I think the most recent estimate google 
this,

3196
02:41:24,451 --> 02:41:26,070
if you will,
young Jamie,

3197
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:26,963
I think the most recent estimate is that
the United States is above 50 percent 

3198
02:41:30,541 --> 02:41:32,340
obesity rate.
That's incredible.

3199
02:41:32,370 --> 02:41:34,020
Which is stunning.
I actually,

3200
02:41:34,021 --> 02:41:36,900
when I was at the Canadian Senate 
hearings,

3201
02:41:37,290 --> 02:41:40,800
actually argued that if we wished to get
rid of bigotry,

3202
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:42,053
then when we'd get a lot more bank for 
our buck if we went after fat bigotry 

3203
02:41:47,610 --> 02:41:48,443
rather than transgender bigotry because 
they are so few people who are 

3204
02:41:51,511 --> 02:41:55,830
transgendered and even though we should 
condemn any bigotry they face,

3205
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:59,220
they make up a very small portion that I
was being facetious,

3206
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:01,410
but I was basically arguing that,
look,

3207
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:06,480
if you really want to have these bills 
that try to stamp out bigotry,

3208
02:42:06,481 --> 02:42:07,314
you should be going after fatphobia 
because most Canadians are also obese 

3209
02:42:11,070 --> 02:42:11,220
now.

3210
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:13,500
They didn't get.
I said it's a sizable problem.

3211
02:42:13,501 --> 02:42:18,501
Many obesity United States here goes a 
2018 course behavioral risk factors.

3212
02:42:21,060 --> 02:42:24,510
Adult obesity raised now exceed 35 
percent in seven states.

3213
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:26,370
Yeah.
But what about children as well?

3214
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:27,233
I think they're talking about overall.
I think overall I think children are 

3215
02:42:30,931 --> 02:42:33,210
more fat now than they've ever been 
ever.

3216
02:42:33,270 --> 02:42:34,350
Well,
I had a moment.

3217
02:42:34,351 --> 02:42:38,550
I mentioned earlier that I had read all 
that kids get the actual numbers again.

3218
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:42,960
So the uh,
adult obesity exceeds 35 percent,

3219
02:42:42,961 --> 02:42:44,160
30 percent,
29 states,

3220
02:42:44,161 --> 02:42:44,994
25 percent in 48 states.
West Virginia has the highest adult 

3221
02:42:47,161 --> 02:42:49,290
obesity rate,
38 percent,

3222
02:42:49,650 --> 02:42:54,300
Colorado lowest at 22.
Shout out to Colorado adult obesity rate

3223
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:56,220
increased in Iowa,
Massachusetts,

3224
02:42:56,221 --> 02:42:57,420
Oklahoma,
Rhode Island,

3225
02:42:57,421 --> 02:42:59,310
South Carolina.
What is it by,

3226
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:02,820
for not just adult obesity,
but overall obesity.

3227
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:04,153
That's fine.

3228
02:43:07,430 --> 02:43:10,940
What is the obesity rate in America?
One hundred and 60 million people.

3229
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:12,910
It is 160 million

3230
02:43:12,910 --> 02:43:15,610
people in America are either obese or 
overweight.

3231
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:19,390
Nearly three quarters of American men 
and more than 60 percent of women,

3232
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:23,410
more than 60 percent of women are 
overweight.

3233
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:24,730
Thirty percent of boys

3234
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:30,010
and girls under the age of 20 are obese 
or overweight.

3235
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:30,933
So remember I was mentioning earlier,
I was mentioning the a health summit 

3236
02:43:34,091 --> 02:43:37,390
that I held at my university at one of 
the guys.

3237
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:41,620
His name is Robert Lustig.
He's a pediatric endocrinologist.

3238
02:43:41,890 --> 02:43:42,723
He was red.
He was saying that many instances of 

3239
02:43:45,821 --> 02:43:46,654
diabetes and other really high blood 
pressure that you would never ever see 

3240
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,530
in young children is now very,
very common.

3241
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:55,420
So 25,
30 years ago,

3242
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:56,433
he would never have a single patient who
is under a certain age and now it's 

3243
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:00,910
every,
every day.

3244
02:44:00,911 --> 02:44:01,490
Basically.

3245
02:44:01,490 --> 02:44:04,400
It's a stunning statistic.
It's disgusting.

3246
02:44:04,401 --> 02:44:06,110
It's sad to see,
and it's,

3247
02:44:06,170 --> 02:44:07,003
it's,
uh,

3248
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:08,053
you know,
people are prisoner of their diet and 

3249
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:12,710
that's most of it.
And you know,

3250
02:44:12,711 --> 02:44:16,880
exercise plays a factor for sure it 
speeds up your metabolism,

3251
02:44:16,881 --> 02:44:17,714
but the bottom line is you've got to 
stop eating shit and you got to stop 

3252
02:44:19,731 --> 02:44:22,400
eating so much.
But it's so satisfying to people,

3253
02:44:22,610 --> 02:44:23,443
especially people that feel,
they just feel unsatisfied and 

3254
02:44:27,861 --> 02:44:28,694
unfulfilled and unhappy and they're 
medicating themselves with food because 

3255
02:44:32,421 --> 02:44:33,254
they get this little charge every time 
they stuffed a cake down their mouth or 

3256
02:44:36,111 --> 02:44:40,490
they eat a sandwich or they eat a giant 
bowl of unhealthy stuff.

3257
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:41,443
I feel like you're going to break out 
into being Kevin Spacey in the movie 

3258
02:44:43,881 --> 02:44:44,714
seven where he goes out killing people 
who wrote the law governing the way 

3259
02:44:50,571 --> 02:44:54,980
you're speaking with such a disdain 
because it's not.

3260
02:44:55,010 --> 02:44:56,300
It's not necessary,

3261
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:57,203
right?
This is a disease that you're giving 

3262
02:44:58,141 --> 02:45:01,160
yourself.
This is what's sad is like,

3263
02:45:01,370 --> 02:45:05,580
and I understand if you don't have an 
education on this and some people don't,

3264
02:45:05,730 --> 02:45:07,950
but that's not the case with most 
people.

3265
02:45:07,951 --> 02:45:10,290
Most people understand that what they're
eating is bad for them.

3266
02:45:10,530 --> 02:45:11,363
They do it anyway.

3267
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,580
Well,
which shows you that it's not only about

3268
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:15,953
you,
you don't do bad things simply because 

3269
02:45:17,221 --> 02:45:18,420
you didn't know any better.
Right?

3270
02:45:18,510 --> 02:45:19,321
Yeah,
for sure.

3271
02:45:19,321 --> 02:45:19,891
It's exactly.
Well,

3272
02:45:19,891 --> 02:45:21,840
psychology is very.
Human.

3273
02:45:21,841 --> 02:45:22,674
Psychology is so unbelievably 
complicated and that's why I love my 

3274
02:45:26,821 --> 02:45:28,200
life.
That's why I love my profession.

3275
02:45:28,201 --> 02:45:30,690
Every day I wake up and I'm in a 
playground,

3276
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:33,900
what's the next problem that I'm going 
to tackle and have fun studying?

3277
02:45:34,410 --> 02:45:36,360
That's why I love my life and I hope 
everybody.

3278
02:45:36,510 --> 02:45:38,370
I often get people who write to me and 
say,

3279
02:45:38,610 --> 02:45:40,410
what's the secret?
Why are you always smiling?

3280
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:41,490
I'm always smiling.
Well,

3281
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:42,390
number one,
I'm healthy.

3282
02:45:42,391 --> 02:45:43,224
I have a great family,
but I wake up every day excited about 

3283
02:45:45,301 --> 02:45:46,200
the prospects,
whether they.

3284
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:48,660
If you could find that half,
the battle's won.

3285
02:45:48,830 --> 02:45:49,390
Well,
you,

3286
02:45:49,390 --> 02:45:50,150
you're

3287
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:52,100
position your life,
your,

3288
02:45:52,130 --> 02:45:54,770
your,
your study is so.

3289
02:45:55,460 --> 02:45:56,293
It's so rich with information and it's 
so illuminating in terms of like why 

3290
02:46:01,701 --> 02:46:05,570
certain things occur in our culture,
why people do certain things,

3291
02:46:05,571 --> 02:46:07,280
like what's the motivation and,
and,

3292
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:10,070
and your perspective on like knowing

3293
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:11,173
all these motivations and knowing what's
causing all these different actions and 

3294
02:46:15,771 --> 02:46:16,604
reactions.
I mean it's got to be just constantly 

3295
02:46:20,181 --> 02:46:23,890
interesting because it is so much and I 
get to meet guys like whew.

3296
02:46:23,891 --> 02:46:24,724
And hung out with guys like you are.
A great thing about my job is I get to 

3297
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:30,320
meet guys like you and learn all this 
cool shit.

3298
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:31,280
Thank you buddy.

3299

fucking lethal weapon.
