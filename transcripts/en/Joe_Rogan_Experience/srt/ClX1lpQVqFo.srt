1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,400
but I know that it's,

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,701
you know,

4
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:02,880
the,

5
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,900
especially the border towns,

6
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:05,370
they're incredibly dangerous.

7
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,480
I mean it's just people
going down left and right.

8
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,590
Getting headless and fucking body pack.

9
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,310
It was safe before safe.

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,190
It's interesting when a culture like
drastically changes over a fairly short

11
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:20,850
period of time.

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,770
I used to go to Mexico and we just go
to the spring break thing on TV in like

13
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,320
the late nineties you know,

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,163
maybe like two,

15
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,470
maybe even the early two
thousands it was like no big deal.

16
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,304
Yeah,

17
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,480
it was for fear factor.

18
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,500
The gride.

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,333
Yeah.

20
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,220
We used to get our pump on that was sweet
and taught me how to shave my chest.

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,660
I believe all of this totally.

22
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,610
Yeah.

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,480
Were dance partners.

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,990
We're going to be the first gay
couple on dancing with the stars.

25
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,490
We're going to come on.

26
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:49,801
There we go.

27
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,634
He's going to help me

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,153
for how long?

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,821
For how long?

30
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,640
Like an hour or I could watch
that longer than the head cutting.

31
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,711
What'd you get your watch?

32
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:59,544
Two guys fuck.

33
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,710
Easier than it head coming.

34
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,170
I find that hard to believe why you
mean in real life or on the Internet?

35
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,820
I've never even watched
it on the Internet.

36
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,960
Pull it up for Brian.

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,281
So Brian,

38
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:20,280
the only way this is gonna work
is take the monitor and um,

39
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,253
don't,

40
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,860
don't stream the show.

41
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,720
And then on that screen over there,

42
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,940
you need to show two guys
fucking just for Amy.

43
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,420
So well it won't ever show you.

44
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:28,801
You can do that,

45
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,460
right?

46
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,293
I want it to be

47
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,110
mixed master flesh to flesh.

48
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,370
I actually invented that name.

49
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,430
The guy's name was flashed.

50
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:43,350
Mixed master slash master flesh

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,513
by accident.

52
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,730
Yeah.

53
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,150
Right.

54
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,701
It just fucks.

55
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,770
Everybody shows up and flings.

56
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:50,150
Dick.

57
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,840
My name is cheese cream.

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,210
Can I get a rap name?

59
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,811
Well,

60
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:58,644
my rap name be.

61
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,180
I always felt like if we're
going to have a nickname,

62
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,700
you can't really nicknamed
herself knowing his

63
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,333
nickname

64
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,720
is fuck

65
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,180
this here folks

66
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,180
made your own nickname up.

67
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,320
It means you have no friends.

68
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,340
That's the only thing it means.

69
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,230
It doesn't make any sense.

70
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,064
Other than that,

71
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,360
you're a crazy person.

72
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,603
Crazy person.

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,890
Fighters.

74
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,620
It's hilarious.

75
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,620
Fighters come up with some of the silliest
nicknames to stick with it and it's

76
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,600
there forever.

77
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,650
Guys Change.

78
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,750
Like Rory Macdonald,

79
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,430
he used to call himself the water boy,

80
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,740
and then he changed his to Aries.

81
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,420
God of war.

82
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,260
Yeah.

83
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,660
It's kind of interesting where
you're allowed to change your name,

84
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,693
change

85
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,360
waterboy but now I feel
more like the god of war.

86
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh,

87
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,333
okay.

88
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,360
Just do whatever you want.

89
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,800
I guess just the world is yours.

90
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,750
So what the God of war in
relation to like Mexico crumbling.

91
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,770
I'm reading this,

92
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,930
I'm listening rather to this podcast
that explains what the fuck is wrong with

93
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,770
the Middle East.

94
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,030
And W one of the reasons why the Middle
East is so backwards and fucked up.

95
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,910
His Gingiss con king,

96
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,460
his car rolled two
there in 1200 something.

97
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,000
It wasn't gangs.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
It was actually a sons.

99
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,500
So he was already dead
and crushed Baghdad.

100
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,820
Killing everybody

101
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,000
and I million people is that people
fucking that gay guys fucking it's too.

102
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,540
You know what?

103
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,070
Are they fucking right there?

104
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,931
Because he just,

105
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:48,040
he pulled up to elderly fat guys fucking,

106
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,874
and I'm not.

107
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,613
No.

108
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,101
You know what,

109
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,821
I maybe you're right.

110
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,470
Maybe I assumed it was going to be like,

111
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,101
take it away.

112
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,830
But like I said,

113
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,810
there's going to be right.

114
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,471
That's not cool.

115
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,910
We're not going to get an honest reaction.

116
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,870
As long as she's seen it.

117
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,380
Now we can say that we were
the first person to show it to.

118
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,321
Oh,

119
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,520
she's looking right at it right now.

120
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,151
You know what?

121
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,871
It doesn't bother me.

122
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,704
She was looking right at it.

123
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,623
Just Scott.

124
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,370
Okay.

125
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,640
I honestly don't feel
bummed out about it a way.

126
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,150
We're good.

127
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,451
We're good.

128
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,380
We'll get to the sex.

129
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,971
No,

130
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:12,041
no,

131
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,430
no.

132
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,030
That's enough.

133
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,200
It's not about me.

134
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,090
It's honestly not bothered.

135
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,170
They're blowing each other like two
gentlemen who measure their mouth.

136
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,060
Fucking I call him.

137
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:21,820
I'll fucking,

138
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,001
yeah.

139
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:22,450
I don't know.

140
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:22,751
You know what?

141
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,190
I didn't see them penetrating each other.

142
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,330
That might've been a different vibe.

143
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,970
I didn't mind the 69.

144
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,640
Yeah.

145
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,121
We need to get,

146
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,481
you know,

147
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,720
you've got to prove that you see the
actual fucking I seen him right there,

148
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,530
clearly,

149
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,240
huh?

150
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,570
Yeah.

151
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,140
I uh,

152
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,430
I thought it was going to bum me out,

153
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,264
but yeah.

154
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,463
Fuck him.

155
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,160
Okay.

156
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,740
There you go.

157
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,110
Great.

158
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,301
Well,

159
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,110
thank you guys.

160
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,370
We got to do this together.

161
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,293
You're welcome.

162
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,410
So anyway,

163
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,910
the cons rolled.

164
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,970
The Mongols rolled through
Baghdad and the 1200

165
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:58,980
yeah.
