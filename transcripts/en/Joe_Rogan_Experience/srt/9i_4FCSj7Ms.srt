1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,650
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,000
And then you've been there back and
forth ever since.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,210
Yeah.
The the first time I would say it wasn't

4
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:13,350
until my flight back that I felt that
initial like I gotta do something

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,430
because whenever I was there,
the problem just seems so huge.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,120
And so I mean,
so insurmountable that what am I going

7
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,080
to do?
How am I going to help?

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,340
Um,
and,

9
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:26,040
and,
and am I going to get endanger myself or

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,020
get sick or die or whatever in the
process.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,170
Um,
and but on the way back I just felt

12
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:31,950
like,
you know,

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,783
if,
if,

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,190
if not me then,
then who,

15
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,690
you know,
like they asked me if I would give them

16
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,250
a voice if I can help them,
if I could.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
Um,
and I just felt,

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,850
I dunno,
a yearning,

19
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,490
a longing that I had to do something.
And,

20
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:45,324
uh,
so the,

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,220
the second trip back,
um,

22
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,450
was,
was great.

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,660
I got to actually meet some people that
really had some real plans.

24
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,450
Cause the first time I went with people
that we didn't have plans to actually

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,040
help or anything.
Um,

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,030
like sustainability was just kind of a
learning trip going and seeing what the

27
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:03,320
problems were.
Second time it was the university,

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,580
their uh,
their school of community development

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,580
and they had dreams of,
of giving them water,

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,140
given them land,
giving them food,

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,030
but they didn't have any way to do it
really.

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,650
They had the plan and everything in
place,

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,320
but they didn't have funding behind it.
They didn't have the technology behind

34
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,300
it.
Um,

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,520
and so the third time was whenever I
came back and I had studied how to build

36
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,620
those eco domes and I partnered with an
organization,

37
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,260
it's a great organization called water
for and they,

38
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,000
um,
they're big thing is what,

39
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,930
what I was searching for was how to put
the,

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,580
the tools are basically the power in the
hands of the people there instead of

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,850
having to have outside help,
how can we actually help them to

42
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,740
continue to do it,
continue the process.

43
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,240
And so water four puts the tools in the
people's hands and then they teach them

44
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,430
how to do it and then now they can do it
for themselves.

45
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,920
It can be a sustainable business forum.
They can,

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,980
they can use whatever model they want.
If it's a nonprofit model,

47
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,930
if it's a business model,
um,

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,300
to,
to make it sustainable there so that way

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,930
yet where I'm at,
Congolese can help Congolese in that

50
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,090
way.
I can hopefully,

51
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,080
you know,
fan the flame,

52
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,000
go over there to teach a more,
bring over the right people water if

53
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,620
we're really supported and sent over.
Um,

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,900
you know,
their director of implementation to come

55
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,120
really sit down with us for two weeks,
teach us,

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,770
he came back out,
did it again.

57
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,050
Now he's gone over since I've been back
already,

58
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,910
he's been back over teaching her team
and more,

59
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,070
you know,
strategies of how to dig these water

60
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:26,440
wells

61
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,660
and I wished it,
there was one parent that I could just

62
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,250
be like,
they're the good one and the other one's

63
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,120
bad,
right.

64
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,320
My mom would like throw hot water and my
pops and I'd be like,

65
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,350
what the fuck is going on?
And then,

66
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,870
you know,
he would do his team,

67
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,120
I smack or whatever.
And then she tried to punch him and then

68
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,540
he'd hit her and I was just like,
this is wwf in the crib.

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,780
I got a friend who still fights with his
wife and his wife threw a fucking

70
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,120
screwdriver at him and stuck him in the
arm,

71
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:55,120
like it's stuck out of his arm and he
fucked her that night.

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,690
He goes,
that shit turns me on.

73
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,543
I go,
what?

74
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,970
And he goes,
one time,

75
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,770
man,
one time,

76
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,970
it will,
this is hilarious.

77
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,380
They were watching a movie together and
uh,

78
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,720
she fell asleep at the movie.
So he took his pants down and it was

79
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,860
there watching 300.
He took his pants down and put his ass

80
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:13,360
hole like an inch away from her head and
goes,

81
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,240
and he yelled something.
She woke up and he farted right in her

82
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,074
face.

83
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,950
That's a new move.
That's the cornholio.

84
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,940
Oh man,
that's fucking went crazy.

85
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,100
She punched him in the mouth.
She fucking freaky.

86
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,761
She goes,
he goes,

87
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,100
she fucking made me see stars.
Like,

88
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,880
she cracked me in the job and he goes,
I fucking love it.

89
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,160
That shit turns me off.
It that turns you on.

90
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,080
I know,
man.

91
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,060
When I saw this stuff with my parents,
I was just say,

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,460
I never want to be in a family like
this.

93
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,710
Exactly.
I've always just dated.

94
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,390
Just Nice,
good people.

95
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,370
That's what I like.
I like,

96
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,040
I like people that are nice gear.
Sweet.

97
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,540
You don't want no yelling.
No,

98
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,690
not in the island.
No.

99
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,020
I don't want to yell at my friends.
I don't want anybody yelling at me.

100
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,970
That's the one thing I look for.
People ask,

101
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,080
what do you look for when you hire
people?

102
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,820
Good.
Trustworthy people.

103
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,140
Good values.
That's it.

104
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,790
You can't,
you can't teach that.

105
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,380
People have it or they don't.
Yeah.

106
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,581
I never,
he,

107
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,920
he actually,
the reason he got into it and to give

108
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,710
him go more in depth thought it was,
he embezzled,

109
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,100
uh,
I think $2 million from Ricoh cameras.

110
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,090
She's crying.
He was the cfo of Ricoh cameras

111
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,240
and he's a millionaire.
He was making,

112
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,680
you know,
in like the mid eighties,

113
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,930
he was making like six,
$700,000 a year,

114
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,480
which is like now it's way more.
Um,

115
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,810
and she was a million and a half now,
right?

116
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,850
Yeah.
He was making a lot of money back then.

117
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,040
We would take limos to Atlantic city
every weekend.

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
Whoa.
And then as the story goes,

119
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,680
he was just for two years,
I think,

120
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,990
just embezzling money.
He was just like doing shady

121
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,000
transactions and taking money off the
top.

122
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,650
And then he got caught when there was a
new CEO and he blackmailed the CEO

123
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,050
because he had information on the
company that they didn't want coming

124
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:53,650
out.

125
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,780
And he got out,
but he could never work in the industry

126
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,040
again.
So he became a gambler.

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,310
I mean a bookie and a gambler.
That's crazy.

128
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:04,090
So He's,
he embezzled $2 million.

129
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,480
Scottfree scottfree yeah.
Wow.

130
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,940
What a,
they were bringing up.

131
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,850
Yeah.
They were starting to get charges

132
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:17,050
together and he was facing like 40 life,
almost life in prison.

133
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,080
He loves the craziest fucking stressful.
Yeah.

134
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,660
And then he,
you know,

135
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:26,230
he became a gambler and this was around
the time my mom left him was like 86,

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,640
um,
he bet $300,000 on the red sox to win

137
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,150
the world series in [inaudible] 86.
Oh my goodness.

138
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,290
In the world series.
You remember that?

139
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,460
It was a good buck.
Yeah.

140
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,050
Oh No.
And he lost 300,000,

141
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,780
which was like most of their savings and
my mom left him the next day.

142
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,500
Jesus Christ.
Man Does that crazy.

143
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,670
No wonder why you're a comic.

144
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm like,
no wonder.

145
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,660
I thought it was so cool man.
When I,

146
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:52,570
when I got involved in it,
it was like the Sopranos was on TV.

147
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,550
It was like my dad's a gangster,
but he was,

148
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,650
he was this like fat Jewish guy.
Like he wasn't,

149
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,590
he wasn't involved in any of that.
Like he knew guys that were like strong

150
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,940
men for the,
for the guy,

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,631
for,
you know,

152
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,580
really connected.
What did he die from?

153
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,120
Colon cancer.
It's probably a lot of it due to stress

154
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,080
right now.
He was,

155
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,320
he treated his body like crap.
He basically didn't exist for the last

156
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,270
10 years of his life.
He didn't pay taxes.

157
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,820
He wasn't on the map.
He didn't have id,

158
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,290
and he was just like,
totally.

159
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,060
He kept going.
He didn't have a bank account,

160
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,690
50,000 in cash above his bed on a
headboard,

161
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,330
witness protection program styles that
what was going on?

162
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,010
No,
he just didn't want to pay taxes.

163
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,570
He didn't want to pay taxes on any of
his money.

164
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,770
So like exist.
Really.

165
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,030
So did he know that he was at health
insurance?

166
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,520
So he didn't have any of that stuff and
he didn't take care of his body.

167
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,520
And then he got sick and it was already
like stage four,

168
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,650
stage five.
So he didn't know he was sick and just

169
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:43,251
decided,
fuck it.

170
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,710
I'm not going to pay taxes.
I'm just going to ride this out.

171
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,521
This was,
I mean,

172
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,490
he didn't pay taxes,
I think for around 15 years.

173
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,420
He didn't pay taxes.
Yeah,

174
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,960
he didn't exist.
He didn't have a driver's license.

175
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:56,570
He faked a driver's license.
You gotta fake id?

176
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,010
I do.
You should use a great dad.

177
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,500
He was like,
oh,

178
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,333
really?

179
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,980
[inaudible]
yeah.
