00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,530
but you can't be a gay woman.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,550
You're also a lesbian.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,260
Like a gay man is not a thing.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,760
Like he doesn't have an extra thing.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,130
It's not like you're also a lesbian,

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,760
you know,

8
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,110
you're.

9
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,811
You know what I mean?

10
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,830
Now you're talking to Tom Cruise.

11
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,263
You know what I'm saying?

12
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:15,991
I mean,

13
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,340
lesbians are not just gay.

14
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,990
They have their own little designation.

15
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,040
That's how they want it.

16
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,120
They get what they want.

17
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,620
This I was reading,

18
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,060
I was reading those.

19
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,391
Joey,

20
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,850
I was reading those like the terms now.

21
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:27,990
CISGENDER.

22
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,381
Oh yeah,

23
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,220
those are wonderful.

24
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,823
I ran out.

25
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,490
I ran out of printing paper.

26
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,361
I'm not.

27
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,410
Shit I was spitting out was.

28
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,760
I was on like page 78.

29
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,190
I ran out of paper and I
just started reading them.

30
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,900
I actually do this in my special,

31
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,830
my CSO special that's coming out Thursday.

32
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,710
I talking about the.

33
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,370
I got so confusing now.

34
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:44,791
The libs,

35
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,330
you confuse every and nobody knows
what bathroom to use and I got that a

36
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,160
nightclub the other night and
here's the ladies room right here.

37
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:50,941
And the men's room was right.

38
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,380
Next one's a pile of shit in the middle

39
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,171
with a Tampon.

40
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,400
Stuck it in a fake mustache.

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,973
It's true,

42
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,780
and I'm not being derogatory.

43
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,180
I actually have a relative
who was transgender.

44
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,220
I wouldn't want to fucking help,

45
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,741
you know,

46
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,040
but,

47
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,600
but we're talking about these people,

48
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,790
like they make up 60
percent of the population.

49
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,740
That's where I get a little fucking angry.

50
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,310
Who's that guy from roadhouse being the
guy with the mustache that talks like

51
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:17,701
this,

52
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:17,941
you know,

53
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,100
that guy was always in like Sam Elliot,

54
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,790
Sam Elliot,

55
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,121
yes.

56
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,780
There's a great meme with Sam Elliott
and it was like they used to be a time

57
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:28,770
when we worried more about the safety of
women and children than men who like to

58
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:29,730
wear dresses.

59
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,310
It was one of those memes online,

60
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,360
like holy shit.

61
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,600
And someone put it up and everybody
went crazy because here's the thing,

62
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:40,350
like there are people
who are fucking crazy,

63
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,360
who are men who like to wear dresses,

64
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,380
want to pretend they're a woman.

65
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,400
There's transgender people and then
they're sick fucks that also likes to wear

66
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,230
dresses and go into the women's room.

67
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,790
Opened the door.

68
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,170
You opened the door to everybody.

69
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,411
Well,

70
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,810
that's what I said to these young kids
and I'm onstage like these kids in their

71
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,270
twenties like,

72
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,060
well you should be taken
advantage of this confusion.

73
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,050
You had a nightclub.

74
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,340
You see a hot chick.

75
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,770
You just slap it on.

76
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,560
Follow her into the ladies room and go.

77
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,920
I identify as a dyke tonight.

78
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,641
Open that stall.

79
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,870
I'm laying any linux.

80
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,340
Went back when she used to wear suits.

81
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,810
But I'm definitely a woman.

82
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,820
When Eddie Linux used to wear suits.

83
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,190
Yes.

84
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,480
Sweet dreams.

85
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,413
Um,

86
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't remember when,

87
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:19,671
when,

88
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:19,801
when.

89
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,634
That was big.

90
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,140
When we looking at it going,

91
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,650
whoa,

92
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,910
what will be good in a suit?

93
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,450
He's hot shit.

94
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,760
Everything beautiful.

95
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,420
She was so.

96
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,160
Did she come up with.

97
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,650
She is.

98
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,010
No,

99
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,843
she's a woman.

100
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,490
She's a woman.

101
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,660
She,

102
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,990
she actually looks good there
for Christ with orange hair.

103
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,720
That looks like if trump
was transgender teens

104
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,293
as teens.

105
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:43,981
Like what?

106
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,814
He's like 11.

107
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,130
It looks like the president.

108
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,570
What a weird haircut.

109
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,980
The ability to get that.

110
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,140
Oh Jesus had he can do that shit.

111
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,260
I can't put my leg.

112
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,630
This guy look at this shit.

113
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:01,731
Well,

114
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,580
I just took a triangle
themselves like that.

115
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,810
That freaky.

116
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,760
That's pretty.

117
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
Pretty cold.

118
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,271
Come on Bro.

119
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:07,900
That's freaky.

120
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,501
That guy's oldest.

121
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,160
Fuck.

122
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,230
He know why he's doing this because
he's thinking about how much dick.

123
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,960
He's to swing at this video's done.

124
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,520
He was doing the shit when
he was second warmed up.

125
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,710
I'm going to fuck like this.

126
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,544
Let me show you.

127
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,703
I get

128
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,130
up like my dick is my leg.

129
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,961
I think he's still alive,

130
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,860
but he was doing it at 75 he was
doing because he was on his album.

131
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,490
My ass pose

132
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,620
doubled.

133
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,560
Triangle suck my cock
and he is not alive to.

134
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,010
He's never going to die at 70 6:40.

135
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,010
He's holding his weight.

136
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,180
He's 100 years old here.

137
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,930
Did his assets deteriorate and going?

138
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,701
Wow.

139
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,481
That's amazing.

140
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,680
He's 30 years old in this video.

141
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,050
Look at this fucking
spinal flexibility though.

142
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,920
That is incredible.

143
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,810
I don't fuck with me younger when
I just say that is incredible.

144
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,470
He honey dicked you into
thinking it was no big deal.

145
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,480

147
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,570
I can put them in a tote.

148
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,141
Gobble,

149
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:05,531
gobble,

150
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,350

152
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,950
I brought my fucking

153
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,900
gobbled from my tools as well for an
extra stimulation stimulation to center

154
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,910
global Chinese

155
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,663
just fine.

156
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,070
This is how I got from my back side.

157
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,670
Not just,

158
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,170
not a lot of spinal movement,

159
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,033
just gobble.

160
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,260
He's talking the whole time teaching.

161
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,600
It's just what I'm thinking
of coming in my own mouth.

162
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,434
Maybe

163
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,310
not today.

164
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,013
Today's

165
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,810
not that impressed with this guy.

166
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,171
All right,

167
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:50,800
let's wrap up.

168
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,100
Alright,

169
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,930
so as crowder on too.

170
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,050
I'm glad we got through this dude.

171
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,310
No,

172
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,561
it was.

173
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,520
You're saying I really appreciate your
generous dude and I really do like you

174
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,110
fucked with you a little bit.

175
00:04:59,111 --> 00:04:59,220
I,

176
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,910
I treated you like a standup comedian.

177
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,930
I figured you'd fuck with me
back and you got a little four.

178
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,280
Fine.

179
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,210
We got that.

180
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,213
We got back.

181
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,120
We got through it.

182
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,450
Yeah.

183
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,980
We got listen seriously.

184
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,940
And for those listening,

185
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,810
honestly I won't say I don't because I
don't want you to get in trouble if I say

186
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
behind the scenes joe
has done some things.

187
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,320
He's been very nice.

188
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,390
So he's a nice he,

189
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,230
you know.

190
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,441
Anyway.

191
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,490
I don't know if that
hurts your street credit,

192
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:21,710
but like,

193
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:21,851
no,

194
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,900
I don't have any bad credit.

195
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,440
Have Zeros.

196
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,700
Tree.

197
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,290
Correct.

198
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,540
I like have cats.

199
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,291
You have cats?

200
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,190
I have no street cred.

201
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,371
Dude.

202
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:28,204
I take yoga.

203
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,190
He's a good dude to folks.

204
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,300
We're all fine.

205
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:31,920
We're going to be.

206
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
We're going to find a way.

207
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,860
All of these ideas to come together.

208
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,810
This is part of it is part of it.

209
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,351
The movie,

210
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,680
the Wrestler is one of my dad's favorite
movies and we're watching that with me

211
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,100
and my dad loved to go watch movies again.

212
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,963
It's Kinda like our thing.

213
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,063
So we bond.

214
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,430
No,

215
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,121
I never saw that.

216
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:47,030
That was the Mickey Rourke one.

217
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,570
I saw like a scene from
it and that was it.

218
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,141
I just never.

219
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,040
I always wanted to.

220
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,160
I never sat down and watched
it and it's so funny.

221
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,050
It was like I just
watched a grown man cry.

222
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,160
Like I watched my dad just.

223
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:57,830
Yeah.

224
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,090
Me and my dad can't.

225
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,550
I mean I love my dad to best to death,

226
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,170
but when we watch like father,

227
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:03,831
son movies,

228
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,431
anything like that,

229
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,990
it's always a tear jerker for them.

230
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,590
Oh,

231
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,011
me too.

232
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:07,610
I'm the same way.

233
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,340
Oh yeah.

234
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,173
That's awesome.

235
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,093
That's hilarious.

236
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,750
I couldn't watch pursuit of happiness.

237
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,201
Which ones?

238
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,700
That it was will smith and the kid.

239
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,360
Oh,

240
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,860
wouldn't it becomes homeless.

241
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,270
Fuck that.

242
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,740
Oh yeah.

243
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,211
I was like,

244
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:17,550
no,

245
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:17,831
no,

246
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:18,170
no.

247
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,340
I was going to do that to me.

248
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
I'll tell you what you were telling.

249
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,760
Don't want to.

250
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,020
I'll give away a giant
spoiler alert if I say this,

251
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:26,120
but I tried to watch that movie
that we were talking about.

252
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,363
Uh,

253
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,810
the arrival or arrival,

254
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,360
whatever it is.

255
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
I try to get through the first year.

256
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:30,861
I'm like,

257
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:31,694
fuck you.

258
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,531
Shut it off.

259
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,520
Not Interested in anymore.

260
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,800
You're not going to play my heartstrings.

261
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,120
Spoiler alert.

262
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,620
You fuck the figure out the movies.

263
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,960
You cry during Armageddon.

264
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,890
Just the asteroid and.

265
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:49,724
Nope.

266
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,011
Nope.

267
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,520
I knew it was fake at all.

268
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,770
I knew the other one was
faked to deep impact.

269
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,810
That was fake as fuck too.

270
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,270
Oh yeah,

271
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,460
that was terrible.

272
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,520
Do you think that people from deep,

273
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:02,000
deep impact meet people
that are fans of Armageddon?

274
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,331
They go,

275
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:02,751
Oh my God,

276
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,280
I love you from that Bruce Willis movie.

277
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:04,430
Like,

278
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,260
fuck you bitch.

279
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,570
Hey,

280
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,403
I was in the other one.

281
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,850
It came out a few months ago,

282
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,420
but we came out first.

283
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,570
We were at first armageddons bullshit.

284
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,540
Well he thought that Armageddon
and they had the idea first.

285
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,230
No,

286
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,130
that's the propaganda.

287
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,720
It's fake news.

288
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,703
Fake News.

289
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,781
Bruce Willis,

290
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:21,614
man.

291
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,280
Yeah,

292
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,240
he just said I'm good.

293
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,080
Yeah,

294
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,913
stop.

295
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,003
Just chill.

296
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,860
Probably just go surfing and shit.

297
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,113
What does he do now?

298
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,073
She's still acting.

299
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,423
No,

300
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,390
what are you gonna say you were gonna.

301
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,224
Say something.

302
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,640
Spoiler alert.

303
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,070
Oh yes.

304
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,863
Yeah,

305
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,020
yeah.

306
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,501
I can't wait.

307
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,190
All right.

308
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,023
Keep your trap shut.

309
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,520
You don't want to ruin it for everybody.

310
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah,

311
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,730
he's always been like that guy.

312
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,590
There's like some dudes that get attached.

313
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,200
It's just really kind of fascinating when
you think about how many people there

314
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:01,250
are and think how many dudes get
attached to like that action movie genre.

315
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,990
Oh,

316
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,780
like Bruce Willis,

317
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,650
like boom,

318
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,520
diehard,

319
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,060
you know,

320
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,160
like he was the guy for the extraction.

321
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,230
Be snarky action star who figured
out how to save everybody and yeah,

322
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,460
that first diehard man.

323
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,690
What was the one that won the football
one with Damon Wayans right above there.

324
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:18,524
That right there,

325
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,650
the last boy scouts,

326
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,700
there was another one he did and
he's always just like troubled cap,

327
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,390
blended pizza up with milk for breakfast.

328
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,030
You know what I mean?

329
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,450
So he's that guy smoking a cigarette.

330
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:33,110
Well,

331
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,940
I guess we're just gonna have to find out.

332
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:35,990
Yeah,

333
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,520
he was the same dude in 16 bucks.

334
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,740
Duties in a gang.

335
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,371
Movies like that.

336
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:42,200
At the same dude in a pulp fiction.

337
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,680
And he played that boxer dude.

338
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,680
He was great.

339
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:46,431
Hudson Hawke,

340
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,264
man.

341
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,090
Bruce Willis has been in
some good fucking movies.

342
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,190
What was the one with the kid?

343
