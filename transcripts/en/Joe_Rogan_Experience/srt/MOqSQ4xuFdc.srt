1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,770
And I'm not trying to,

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,380
I'm just trying to like,

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,830
like in high school I was like,

5
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,161
you know,

6
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:08,321
the,

7
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,620
the wise ass kid who had awful grades,

8
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:11,341
I was on Ritalin,

9
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,174
I was a mess.

10
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,150
And so Ritalin in high school
who I was on Ritalin since like,

11
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,540
uh,

12
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,480
like right at a preschool shit,

13
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,990
you look at the early uh,

14
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,930
government documentation on,

15
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,561
on Rhydlin.

16
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,394
This is not a joke.

17
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:23,860
Oh,

18
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,900
there's these big books.

19
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,531
My mom had them,

20
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:26,430
there's photos of me.

21
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,720
They tried Ritalin out.

22
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,710
I was part of the test group home.

23
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,140
We would get little orange tablets and
then we get little yellow tablets and we

24
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,120
have triangular orange tablets for awhile.

25
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:36,991
And My,

26
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:41,240
I went to a place called the national
research center and I was a hyperactive

27
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,480
kid and they said,

28
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:42,780
ah,

29
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,250
here we're trying this stuff out.

30
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:49,251
My mom had me on Ritalin from like a
preschool all the way to 12th grade.

31
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,610
Holy Shit.

32
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,530
In the summertime,

33
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,610
summer vacation,

34
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:54,600
I wouldn't take it.

35
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,780
And within a day that's of kicking
herself out of your system,

36
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,081
man,

37
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,090
your appetite comes back.

38
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,890
And in ninth or 10th grade I started
weightlifting and I started like throwing

39
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,280
the pills out because it's a,

40
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,150
it's an APP,

41
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,970
it's speed.

42
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,890
And so it suppresses your appetite.

43
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,840
And so I'm going through puberty,

44
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:17,310
my hormones are raging and I stopped
using the tablet and all of a sudden I'm

45
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,091
that guy at lunch,

46
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:18,441
we're like the,

47
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:18,691
the,

48
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:18,931
the,

49
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,050
the line of milk on the outer edge
of the tray because I'm eating like,

50
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:22,770
you know,

51
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,220
tons of food and the locust until I'm
going to the gym and I'm just getting

52
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:26,940
really,

53
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,940
my frustration is now being informed
by a physicality that I'm getting by

54
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,570
lifting weights.

55
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,750
So all of a sudden I'm putting muscle
on and I'm angry at the world and I'm a

56
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:40,800
spazz.

57
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,070
And so by 12th grade I was kind of a
maniac and then I got into punk rock and

58
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,431
you know,

59
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:47,940
just got,

60
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,620
got into that slug fest and just kind of
went into the world just kind of wildly

61
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,550
swinging away.

62
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,060
Who the eff,

63
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,280
why did they put you on
Ritalin at such a young age?

64
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,670
Because it's what they were
doing in America with a lot
of young people who talk

65
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,930
too much or you know,

66
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,730
had that social skills well on energy
and attention deficit and it couldn't

67
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:06,421
concentrate.

68
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,390
And I got thrown out of the
DC public school system,

69
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,111
uh,

70
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:10,681
for being,

71
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,220
you know,

72
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,090
he's yelling,

73
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,230
he's doing this and I actually read a
couple of teachers reports about me years

74
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,831
later and I said,

75
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,760
I had no memory.

76
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:18,390
I said,

77
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,230
I did all that.

78
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,741
My mom went,

79
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,071
yeah,

80
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,100
that's why they kicked you out.

81
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,740
They kicked you out of school.

82
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,520
Wow.

83
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,060
Yeah.

84
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,481
And uh,

85
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,990
I got kicked out of a few
schools until they put me in a,

86
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,500
in a prep school where
the advertising is like,

87
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:31,681
oh,

88
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,640
your kid has problems
with studying will cool.

89
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,474
I'm out.

90
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,211
And I,

91
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,620
the first few days of school,

92
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:41,010
some kids spoke at a class and I watched
this one teacher picked this one kid up

93
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,310
and just kind of toss him into a
blackboard and went right in his class.

94
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,144
You shut up.

95
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,360
And so I,

96
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,220
I didn't want to get,

97
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,830
you know,

98
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,410
a thrashing by a teacher.

99
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,760
So I was always really careful.

100
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,420
But having that difficulty sitting down
and I was fine with topics I liked.

101
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:57,960
I didn't,

102
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,141
you know,

103
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,310
I didn't groove on math or any of that,

104
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,030
but at lunchtime I'd go to the
library and start memorizing the Latin

105
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,220
nomenclature of every
North American snake.

106
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,330
I had to learn them all and
by like 10th grade I had,

107
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,610
and I have most of it's still in my head,

108
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,030
but I'm always very confused
at these medical distinctions,

109
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,710
whether it's Adhd or hyperactive or add,

110
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:22,390
whatever the fuck it is like is,

111
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,260
is that real or do people just do,

112
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,250
some people just have a
different composition,

113
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,480
a different passion inside of them and
they resist doing things they don't want

114
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:36,430
to do and they don't want to be a part
of any structured school curriculum.

115
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,120
I think all of it,

116
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,481
but it,

117
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:37,661
yeah.

118
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,520
And is that a disease or is that,

119
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,100
or do you just have more fucking and
looking right now that don't have any

120
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,610
pills,

121
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,280
you're not on anything and yet
you have all his passion for life.

122
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,000
You have all this.

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,670
Isn't that the same shit that
you had when you were six?

124
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,380
Yeah,

125
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,260
it was undisciplined and unfocused type.

126
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,771
But that does that.

127
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:52,750
It's not a disease.

128
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,110
Right?

129
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,710
I Dunno.

130
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:53,880
I mean,

131
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,000
I wouldn't call it a disease,

132
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,080
I think as this wiring.

133
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,501
Right.

134
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,910
But why the fuck is it named?

135
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,320
Why is it Adh so they can,

136
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,850
why is it so they can sell you a pill?

137
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,241
I know,

138
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,350
but isn't that crazy?

139
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,601
Well,

140
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,060
you look back at your own life,

141
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,740
the fact that you were on that shit for,

142
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,431
I mean,

143
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:06,761
what,

144
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,410
how many years?

145
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,371
Eight years.

146
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,260
Nine years really screws with you.

147
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,780
Cause you can feel it when you take the,

148
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,923
the pill,

149
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,823
you can,

150
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,120
you're basically,

151
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,440
you're a propeller that spins so fast
when it looks like they're like go spokes

152
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:20,891
of a wheel.

153
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,180
Like the wheels still,

154
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,530
it's actually going really fast.

155
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,450
That's how it felt like on the
outside I'm like this pale skinny,

156
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,830
like eh,

157
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,820
but inside,

158
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,340
I'm like the last few minutes of,

159
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,940
uh,

160
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,480
Dave in 2001 where he's coming
in spacetime in genuine,

161
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,770
everything is flying by.

162
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,880
That was like 10th grade for me.

163
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,950
I just kind of held onto my desk
and fairly flew through classes,

164
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:50,071
like not being able to retain much because
I was just speeding my brains out and

165
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:54,430
then the pill would wear off around
dinner and all of a sudden you're like

166
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,450
eating two meals and the next morning
you take the pill and you don't eat again

167
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,980
for hours.

168
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,020
That is fucking crazy.

169
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,460
It was nuts and scares the shit out of
me too because my parents didn't put me

170
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,360
on anything like that,

171
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,860
but I know I would've,

172
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,080
I know I would've been diagnosed.

173
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,450
I know I would have been put on
something if I had the wrong parents.

174
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:13,661
Yeah,

175
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,740
they put me on,

176
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,910
my mom put me on this stuff
probably because my doctor said,

177
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,210
you know,

178
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,043
hey iris,

179
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,000
this helps a lot of kids.

180
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,070
But I was in these classes and I'll
never forget one day I'm going through my

181
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:27,731
mom's books.

182
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:32,530
There's just this big Honkin hardcover
book and I opened it up and I saw these

183
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,420
like a contact sheet of me.

184
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,871
I'm like,

185
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,704
wait a minute.

186
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,240
That's that place.

187
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,510
And then I saw the camera angle and I
realized there were these mirrors on the

188
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,270
wall,

189
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,590
their observation rooms.

190
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,640
I'll never forget one day I'm looking at
that mirror and a door opened from the

191
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,400
side and my mom walked out and they would,

192
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,430
we were being observed and the camera
angle was from that observation room.

193
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,710
And there's me playing
with blocks and stuff.

194
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:00,990
I'm like,

195
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,180
I remember that sweater.

196
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,231
Oh Man,

197
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,100
I'm like four.

198
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,710
And that was part of that research group.

199
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,490
Wow.

200
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:07,881
And maybe,

201
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,560
cause my mom was a government employee,

202
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,573
I dunno,

203
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,061
but I was,

204
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:11,720
uh,

205
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
I went to a place called it like for
two years called the national research

206
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:14,901
center.

207
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,880
I got thrown out of there wow.

208
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,080
For wounding a kid,

209
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,650
which due to him through a bunch
of powdered cement in his face.

210
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:32,580
Okay.
