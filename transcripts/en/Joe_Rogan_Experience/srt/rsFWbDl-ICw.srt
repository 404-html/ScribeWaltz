1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,060
That story seems to show up.
So I'm flying them out after we called.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,983
Okay.
I'm going to do a podcast and him which 

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:09,460
subtitles in Spanish and I'm bringing 
them up here on Friday.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,080
Why?
Yeah,

5
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:14,200
my company to do it for me in Spanish 
with subtitles.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,663
And then I'm going to bring him up here 
on Friday and we're going to have a 

7
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:18,424
three way about Cuba.
Well it was like to rest on the whole 

8
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,084
thing if you don't mind.
Well you mind so I'll do mine about 

9
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:27,230
subtitles.
Justin at Barnard.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,220
Yeah.
So no,

11
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:32,054
we will not clash with you dude.
The three of us together would be the 

12
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:37,150
greatest podcast cause I could interpret
it and you would be,

13
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:38,860
would be,
uh,

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,753
it would be a real mma.
You could really talk to them about 

15
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:45,730
under hooks and to Russia.
That's a fantastic,

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,383
the Cuban where they shipped them cause 
they ship you off when you were a young 

17
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:51,230
kid.
They did.

18
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,270
A lot of people don't know.
Yeah,

19
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:54,430
they look at you on that ain't go,
uh,

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
I looked at them.
You don't have a choice.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,500
They look at you and they go do,
I said,

22
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:00,160
look,
try that on.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,730
That's it.
Now.

24
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,563
Then they'd take her to a certain age 
and that or the 80 to send you to 

25
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,580
Nicaragua or Russia.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
You train and that's why a lot of Cubans
that you docus because they'd go to rush

27
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,390
and learn judo.
Wow.

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,380
So he's going to tell you how they 
shipped him off and they don't just tell

29
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,150
your mom like would take him tomorrow.

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,713
That's it.
It's always been interesting to me 

31
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,374
because the Cubans and the Russians in 
particular were always thought of as 

32
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,570
being very technical.
Really.

33
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:33,000
The Russians,
Russians are super technical.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,073
That was what a lot of people attributed
George Saint Pierre Success in 

35
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,080
wrestling.
You know,

36
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,300
George didn't wrestle in college or in 
high school,

37
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,363
uh,
but he trained with a bunch of Russian 

38
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,324
nationals and Montreal and apparently 
phenomenal wrestlers and they have this 

39
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:47,820
incredible wrestling program.
Like when you see,

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,290
when you see Norma met off the way he 
mauls people inside the octagon,

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,720
like what in the fuck?
Like that is like a,

42
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:59,010
a perfect example of that.
Like style of super hard,

43
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,160
super technical wrestling.
They're so good at it.

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,160
There's so many.
Did you see,

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,023
you know what you see Loma Chanko used 
to be a wrestler is a video of La Loma 

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,810
Chanko.
It looks like he's doing sambo.

47
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,853
It looks like he's got a like a gian and
it's him and some other cat and he's 

48
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,770
like 11 years old or something like 
that.

49
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,220
So his father put him in everything.
His father made him.

50
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,670
Do you know Loma Chanko is?
Yes.

51
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,670
Yes.
One of the best boxers ever.

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,653
Like literally one of the most 
technically beautiful to watch boxers 

53
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,310
it's ever lived.
But this guy,

54
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,890
he used to wrestle too.
Like is this is a,

55
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,970
I don't think this is,
it is.

56
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,370
It does him.
Okay.

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,850
Is this him wrestling with somebody?
Yeah,

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,730
this is one now.
Or he can still do this shit.

59
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,743
This is like pretty recent.
Like he showed some of his wrestling 

60
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,384
moves,
but the other one was him when he was a 

61
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,140
little boy.
Like he's really tactical man.

62
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,270
He knows how to wrestle.
This is legit.

63
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,640
Like when you see the way he's moving 
his body,

64
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,900
he's not faking that.

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,630
He's done that a bunch of times and 
yeah,

66
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,560
this is,
this is one when he's a little kid,

67
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,450
man,
it's crazy.

68
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,310
It says Greco Roman wrestling,
but they're wearing a geek,

69
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:05,144
so I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but he gets his kid and a gets behind 

70
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,580
them and send them for a ride.
So he was,

71
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,210
he's always been an amazing athlete,
like an area.

72
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,190
I think there's,
there's something to that.

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,880
There's something to,
his father had an idea to crazy ideas.

74
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,714
His father took him out of boxing and 
put them in a dance for like several 

75
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,213
years.
Uh,

76
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,480
Ukrainian traditional dance style.
Apparently they were talking about it on

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,480
one of those hbo shows for like four 
years,

78
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,490
I think it was the hbo show,
but for four years,

79
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,520
I think he just danced.
You imagined that his father's like,

80
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,354
you want to learn how to box,
you got to dance and now nobody's got 

81
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,980
footwork.

82
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,240
If you've seen him,
Joey,

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,940
you've seen like his highlight reel.
It's insane.

84
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,110
It's insane.
It's insane.

85
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,711
Jamie,
pull up.

86
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,544
A woman will highlight reel because my 
daughter goes to ballet and 80% of the 

87
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,470
clashes Russia,
so I was thinking about it.

88
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,970
Yes,
that was watching the movements,

89
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,010
the last parade movement.
I'm like,

90
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:03,844
Jesus Christ.
If people did ballet and I was thinking 

91
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,860
the GSP,
like you know me,

92
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:13,850
I'm like pre probably fucking does 
ballet give them any wood bats would be,

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,360
it's great footwork.
This guy is the wizard or footwork.

94
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,440
It's crazy because he was like right in 
front of you,

95
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,500
but he's one step ahead of you at every 
turn.

96
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,540
Like he knows what you're going to do.
Right.

97
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,374
While you're doing it,
he's moving in a way that you can't 

98
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,850
move.
He's in front of you and then he's not.

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,193
It's crazy.
Like he's the one of the most technical 

100
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,404
boxers I've ever seen and it just an 
amazing stylistic achievement like what 

101
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,730
he can do with his body.

102
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,880
His style is totally unique.
I mean every,

103
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:48,490
but a lot of guys have done it.
A lot of guys that moved in and out.

104
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,324
A lot of guys have done it,
but he's doing it and it's such a high 

105
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,714
level,
such a high level that it makes people 

106
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,010
confused.
Guys quit in their corner that like what

107
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,844
in the fuck?
And I really think a lot of it probably 

108
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:00,784
had to do with his father's cross 
training and it particularly with the 

109
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:04,384
dance,
I mean think about how effortlessly he 

110
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,520
goes,
like steps around guys.

111
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,630
I mean he's got some incredible control 
of his feet,

112
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:14,464
but it makes sense that like you would 
learn how to move your feet in a 

113
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:17,674
specific way that weren't the way you 
weren't learned how to move your hands 

114
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,370
in a specific way.
Right?

115
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,290
Like think about a guy like floyd 
mayweather,

116
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,124
right?

117
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,200
His hand combinations with his upper 
body.

118
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,790
There are so precise.
It's like that,

119
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,210
that,
that,

120
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,100
that right?
But with his legs,

121
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,250
is he as precise as he asked?
Precise moving with his legs,

122
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,150
his,
his with his hands or his,

123
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,984
the 60% or 70% or 80% lama chanko is 
probably po perfectly proportioned for 

124
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:45,910
his style with his ability to move,
but also also his ability to box and hit

125
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,744
you.
Well,

126
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,340
he's got both things going on at the 
same time with next level angles.

127
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,020
So that's what I was saying.
Fuck.

128
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,680
When you're younger in Cuba,
they picked you.

129
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,980
It's not like you

130
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,600
wake up and go,
I want to be a wrestling.

131
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:00,860
No,
they look at you and go,

132
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,350
you look like he could go,
go wrestle.

133
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,633
And like what I was hearing back from 
them in the early seventies it was like 

134
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,460
they just took you away from your family
that and that was part of your training.

135
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,210
You know your,
then they put you in there.

136
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,891
Go.
We had no,

137
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,970
you know where you train and like there 
aren't me.

138
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,260
Have you talked to y'all about this turn
you well yeah,

139
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,750
like no.
We've discussed what this thing is.

140
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,943
I already have graphics on the podcast,
so I figured that I put them up and 

141
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,720
we'll do a podcast in Spanish with 
fucking subtitles.

142
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,110
Like an English film,
like a,

143
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,050
like a Giulini movie,
whatever one of those movies.

144
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:37,540
People think that unique.
Okay.

145
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,413
You have it because his,
his English is too rough for me and I 

146
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:45,290
know what he's trying to say and the 
frustration in his face.

147
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,643
I love you.
[inaudible] being so now he did a tape 

148
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,190
the other day of him in Cuba waiting for
Biz,

149
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:56,810
being in Cuba.
Went to Cuba.

150
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,350
No Romero's back.
See if he's fine,

151
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,640
but what is the,
see if you can find he's,

152
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,110
he's nuts.
He's nuts.

153
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,420
He's nuts.
He's fighting rockhold now,

154
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,730
which is a tremendous ride on the test.
Right?

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,460
That's a crazy fight.
That's a crazy fairing.

156
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:13,700
Good fight.
It's very good fight.

157
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,370
Rockhold when he's on,
it's super dangerous.

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,960
You know when the rockhold made one slip
up against Bisping,

159
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,070
but you know,
fair play to Biz,

160
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:22,840
Bang.
He,

161
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,660
he came into that fight regardless of 
where anybody ranked him,

162
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,523
you know,
like how,

163
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,220
how they felt.
His chances were he came in swinging.

164
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:32,740
He has like,
I think he had like 11 days notice,

165
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,340
something like that.
What was,

166
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,203
how many,
how many days notice that Michael 

167
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,120
bisbing get when he fought Luke 
rockhold?

168
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,010
I want to say it was something crazy 
low.

169
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,810
It wasn't much time.
You know,

170
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,920
route clock.
Luke rockhold is very,

171
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,490
very good.
He's a beach.

172
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,780
Very,
very good.

173
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,730
His top game.
Let me tell you something.

174
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,760
I think when he fought Michael Bisman,
I'm not going to lie to you.

175
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,890
I think his focus was a little off,
maybe two in a way.

176
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,890
I think he was dating rockstars and 
hanging out in Hollywood.

177
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,510
I think he's not dating or whatever 
anymore.

178
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,160
Now he's just fucking,
he thought when he beat a branch,

179
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,560
he looked great.
But his Jujitsu is great.

180
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,350
He has great cakes.
He's great with his hands,

181
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,240
his movement,
him against your,

182
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,540
well,
it's going to be interesting.

183
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,390
Let's skip vicious kicks,
man.

184
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,760
No,
he's four and he's won,

185
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,510
right?
So Luke Rock robot is number one and one

186
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,410
of the five I believe so.
I think this Joel [inaudible] is a four.

187
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,520
Yeah,
it's a great fight.

188
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,590
And then you got jocker raised back in 
the mix.

189
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,620
You know what's crazy like I always say 
to you like,

190
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,523
oh,
I don't mean to pronounce his name 

191
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,050
wrong,
and then some guy out,

192
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:36,884
right?
Like when he fought steel picking Dano 

193
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,120
whom God on when he fought my man.
Immigrant mentality.

194
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,370
Like a motherfucker.
Yeah,

195
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,230
he hits hard and all that stuff like 
that.

196
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:48,020
But now that dude still going to be more
dangerous.

197
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,640
Now he's going to fucking take that 
loss.

198
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,170
Batman man fucking machines.
You got to think how crazy it is that he

199
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,980
went from a guy who

200
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
was homeless too,
five years later fighting for the 

201
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:02,010
heavyweight title.
This is like a total amount of training,

202
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,280
five years of elementary training,
fighting for the heavyweight title,

203
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:09,740
and he's the favorite.
He's the favorite over geyser.

204
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,910
He defended it twice.
I mean,

205
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,490
it's crazy.
That's how talented he is.

206
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,640
That's how terrifying is.
That's how special he is.

207
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,200
But Oh,
a loss like that to a guide like that,

208
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,150
like to a real champ like Steve Bay,
if that,

209
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,480
what's you realize where the top of the 
game is?

210
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,150
There's another,
there's a few more things to learn.

211
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,160
There's a lot more days to get in and 
training,

212
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,090
but that guy has just begun.
He's just began five years ago.

213
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:36,924
He didn't know shit.
He's way better now than he was two 

214
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,200
fights ago.
Yeah,

215
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,034
I see the difference.
I see the difference in the way he 

216
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,130
moves.
When he fought overeem,

217
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,083
it was since significantly different 
than when I saw him in his first and 

218
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,860
second fights is first,
second fights.

219
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,200
He was very good.
It's very,

220
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,034
but just insanely strong.
He would hit guys with these 

221
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,330
combinations and clean technique to 
matt.

222
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,750
He's like,
he's not just a physically strong guy.

223
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,580
He's also very smart because he's 
learning to do everything mechanically.

224
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,414
Very good.
It's not like a guy who's only been 

225
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:12,720
striking for like three or four years,
so they look a little tight and weird,

226
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:13,890
but they can,
if they land,

227
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:15,930
they've got a lot of power.
Nah Man,

228
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,960
everything is clean.
Like you said,

229
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,500
some big of those trenches,
Jack.

230
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,393
Oh Dude.
That type of work gets you a tough 

231
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,150
stuff.
He's just a special athlete.

232
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,920
And if he keeps going,
man,

233
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,053
I mean sh boy,
that guy learning more to think about 

234
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:33,990
how little you learn in five years.
Most of these guys have way more time in

235
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,560
way more time in wrestling,
way more time in kickboxing.

236
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,140
The average guy,
by time it gets to the UFC,

237
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:40,974
I would like to know what the number is 
like how many years of training and 

238
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:47,370
competing they have,
but it's gotta be more than two.

239
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,923
Like he was.
He was like right in the UFC and 

240
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:54,330
smashing people.
It's his amazing story,

241
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,164
man.
It's an amazing story and for a lot of 

242
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:57,654
people,
the way it ended is a good lesson for 

243
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,040
martial artists.
It's a good lesson.

244
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,290
See what,
even if you weren't in Gando Fan,

245
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,680
you're bummed out that he lost.
I appreciate that.

246
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm going in gone who fan?
Fan Too,

247
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,450
but I'm more of a fan of mixed martial 
arts.

248
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,051
I,
I'm a,

249
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm a fan of an honest,
like extreme,

250
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,710
like I wanna I want to know what it is.
Like what,

251
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,080
what is this like?
What's this?

252
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,550
What's this contest right here?
What's,

253
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,413
what's actually going on here.
What's going on here is phenomenal 

254
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,330
athletic talent,
massive potential,

255
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,810
like Super Alpha athlete versus one of 
the toughest guys ever who's been in the

256
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,150
game longer.
Who knows more.

257
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:42,060
He's wrestled.
He's been fighting way more.

258
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,010
He's been in the trenches way more 
times.

259
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:44,844
He said dig deep.
He knows what it's like to be really 

260
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,170
hurt and tired in a fight.
She,

261
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,013
I appreciate the strategy of like,
how do you go in to fight a guy like 

262
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,100
perfect.
It was like rocky

263
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,660
against Mr T.
Yeah,

264
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,553
that's what exactly it was like.
So it was like heart and fucking a 

265
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,200
little smart.
Stay away from that punch.

266
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,530
It had to be,
and I,

267
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,290
I haven't watched the full fight,
you know,

268
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,124
I was working then I'm on fucking stage.
My brother getting hit by Francis and 

269
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:13,930
gone and we put mma gloves night.
Worst thing that can do a person,

270
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,500
he's terrifying and steep.
Bang,

271
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,780
got cracked multiple times and not 
fight.

272
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,360
It sound like he didn't get hit.
He got cracked,

273
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,690
but he had made up his mind.
He was going nowhere.

274
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,630
He knew what to do.
He'd been there before.

275
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,790
That's like,
that's an incredible lesson,

276
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,720
which is for the overall s the sport for
the,

277
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,470
for mixed martial arts in general.
And the lesson is like,

278
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,304
he figured out like he had like the 
craziest end of video game character 

279
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,180
ever.

280
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,751
Right?
And God,

281
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:44,584
I was like the big,
like the big boss in a video game that 

282
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:47,314
like fuck,
I got to fly.

283
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,153
I got to play against this guy that's in
Gansu and steep a figured out how to 

284
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,640
beat him being 20 plus pounds lighter 
than them.

285
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,760
No Way.
You know,

286
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,630
way less intimidating in terms of his 
physical presence.

287
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,460
All those tpa,
it's pretty fucking intimidating.

288
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,030
But in Ghana was so intimidating.
He's so next level two 65 natural giant,

289
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,324
crazy frame.
You look at people when you're next to 

290
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,014
steep it.
That's when you realize how big is too 

291
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,520
big.
Fell on TV,

292
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,354
you know,
look that big when you're next to him 

293
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:19,780
and be like,
this guy's a big fuck.

294
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,673
He's a big function.
You're walking around his asset is his 

295
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:23,550
mind though.
Yes.

296
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,350
Yes.
Come on.

297
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,560
Been fucking talked about the wikipedia 
page dog.

298
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,770
I told you the immigrant mentality with 
media page,

299
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,860
listen,
American ingenuity is fucking brilliant.

300
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,570
And with the immigrant mentality mix,
like let's say you're still an American,

301
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,030
but it that could have called you steve.
No,

302
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,883
you could still call them steep and Mayo
chick to remember where the fuck you 

303
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,140
came from.
You understand me?

304
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,320
His father came.
That's really a win like that.

305
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,380
You know it was on,
I almost called you joe.

306
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,110
I hate calling you.
I almost called you to go.

307
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,150
When was the last time you watched bronx
tale?

308
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,530
Oh,
you know what?

309
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:03,130
It's going on all week.
I watched it a year ago with,

310
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:03,964
he fucking finds him with the guns and 
he starts smacking the kids in the 

311
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,804
neighborhood.
I still remember people's parents 

312
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,910
smacking kids in the,
but wow.

313
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,810
Like people's parents come in and go,
what the fuck are you guys doing it?

314
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,320
Get the fuck home man.
I'm like,

315
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,090
won't kick.
Got a kick to the stomach.

316
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,690
And the father punched the other kid and
nobody was said Dick,

317
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,090
nobody set deck Dick.
No,

318
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,460
like I'm watching this Brian with a 
biker scene.

319
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,460
What was the lab like?
I,

320
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,373
I haven't watched Bronx town 20 years.
It's on AMC at six 30 and they locked 

321
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,354
the door and that you can't leave.
He's eaten his shit and lost to the 

322
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,880
here's the bikes and shit and he walks 
over.

323
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,541
Oh,
okay,

324
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,740
nice.
Like a gentleman.

325
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah,
no problem Ben.

326
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,550
You know what I'm saying?
They do a thing and he walks up to the,

327
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,520
I got to leave now you can't leave.
And the collage euro,

328
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,040
like that guy named son collage or

329
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,860
row who would do something like that.
That means you,

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,610
you want your son to have the immigrant 
mentality,

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,190
but when they throw that beat of the 
bike,

332
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,150
it's,
it's a true story.

333
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,290
That's a true,
true story.

334
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,630
I would listen in the 60s you couldn't 
have long and walk around the Bronx.

335
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,230
It just wasn't accent really.
Yeah.

336
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,310
That,
that hippy shit that,

337
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:14,671
that,
that,

338
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:19,010
that did happen in the Bronx.
And so what if like a hippie was walking

339
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,920
through the Bronx,
they called you dirty hair day,

340
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,740
insulted you.
They called you a bunch of shit and then

341
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,574
they drew a beating on you.
And it's hysterical because that scene 

342
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:32,090
is so accurate because after the adults 
drew have beaten on you,

343
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,403
then the May book kids chased you like 
the young kids with sticks and that's 

344
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,210
what we do.
Wow.

345
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,140
You know,
like the little guys would chase you and

346
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,410
once you were beat up and they took all 
your money,

347
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,710
it's a classic scene.
I was thinking about that and I'm like,

348
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,540
actually I got to call Joe and ask him 
one last time.

349
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,374
Look at this.
Look how bad to the bone that rather he 

350
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:54,734
stole with Joe.
Whether he stole the scene or look at 

351
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:58,580
this,
you go away.

352
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm your man is Thomas.
You got to leave.

353
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,350
But I just tell him him so I think

354
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,420
green.
That's it.

355
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,850
We'll be on way looking for trouble.
I appreciate it.

356
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,560
How can all this come together?
So got them around,

357
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,650
right?
Yeah.

358
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,520
Oh,
this is a great scene,

359
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,510
but the scene,
it's a perfect song,

360
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:35,380
right?
Perfect song.

361
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:36,214
When he walks in,
it's stretching the beginning to the 

362
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,340
goon.
Go Watch it.

363
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,820
Is this going to get us kicked off of 
you?

364
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,321
No,
no,

365
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:48,591
no,
no,

366
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,200
no.
As long as we talk over it.

367
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,730
Okay.
This is it right here.

368
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,780
You again.
Oh,

369
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:02,170
nice.
I'll tell you what the fuck we leave.

370
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,830
Watch the bites.
Man.

371
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,493
Shuts the door.
I will never forget the look on their 

372
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:30,524
face to face just dropped all their 
courage and strength was trained right 

373
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:41,780
from their bodies.
Got a reputation for breaking a boys.

374
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,110
What?
They knew that they made a fatal mistake

375
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,190
this time they walked into the roll bar.
This is real Joe Rogan.

376
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,580
This was 1968 fucking Jeroma have urge 
shit.

377
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,190
So this is a true story.

378
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,960
Jesus Christ.
This scene was fucking brutal.

379
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,370
This is it.
This was one.

380
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,300
This was allowed.

381
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,073
Two.

382
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,180
This is craziness,
Bro.

383
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,014
This was,
this was the bronx in 68 69 and the 

384
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,214
neighborhood,
you know like the enabled would tie 

385
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,930
hurry up to cops or people on the third 
floor with Tay.

386
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,610
We could see the cops from the third 
floor.

387
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,530
We could see the bolts coming down the 
street.

388
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,720
You're like the whole neighborhood was 
in on it.

389
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,800
You know what's interesting to me,
like this is all from immigrants,

390
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,730
right?
Yes.

391
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,140
It's all this was what they had to do 
because of not,

392
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:59,230
but there's also a movie is about him 
dating a black girl.

393
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,313
Right.
And what that meant that the say I 

394
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,940
forgot how good this movie was.
This movie's brilliant.

395
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,160
Yeah.
Shout out to Frankie Renzulli.

396
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,030
Yeah.
Um,

397
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,720
this movie's a genius movie.
Look at this.

398
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:11,730
Watch my car.
You know.

399
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,610
Chazz Palminteri is great and it's 
fucking good.

400
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,100
This is it.
This was it.

401
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,990
This was it.
I forgot how good this is.

402
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,570
Now.
See the young guys now that's us.

403
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,021
Right?
Well,

404
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:20,854
let's see what's going on now.
You take this guy and we would fuck him 

405
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,054
up though.

406
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,540
There's like animals.
Stop to think about it.

407
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,310
This is it.
This is how you were Italian immigrants.

408
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,260
Spanish immigrants.
Oh my God.

409
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,790
This is crazy.
Crazy.

410
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,683
When you think about there,
one generation removed from people came 

411
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:40,474
off a boat.
Let me tell you what the other side of 

412
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,680
this here,
here's the other side.

413
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:46,030
Like,
all right.

414
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,750
The big thing was as we were,
we came to move here.

415
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,280
I remember that when he would come to 
the store,

416
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:52,114
Frank Stahl,
Mike Star was your friend and he would 

417
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,930
come to the store and there was a big 
room with that.

418
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,273
Chaz stole these stories from him and 
put this together and there was like 

419
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,710
this little war going on,
but not from Frankie.

420
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,870
Rental ranking ritual is the other 
gentleman.

421
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,763
There was somebody else that was just,
that turned out to be some believe very 

422
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:10,210
big.
And uh,

423
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,810
but there's a story one time that a bike
dude,

424
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,703
old gravano money and Gravana was 
hitting him and when he fell off the 

425
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:17,884
sidewalk and broke his leg,
so gravano one night went out and 

426
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,130
fucking did something like this.

427
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,590
I'm like with 20 guys,
they beat up a bike.

428
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,070
I don't know how true it was,
but I still remember being five.

429
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,180
Like if I could think,
if you could put,

430
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,630
hit me with truth serum,
I,

431
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:39,631
I could go back to being 1968,
1969 in the bronx.

432
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,803
My daughter's five and my mother would 
send me from the dry cleaner that she 

433
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:45,904
owned to the corner where there was an 
place that had slices and Italian ice 

434
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:50,880
and shit like that.
Right.

435
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Like I was allowed to walk to the corner
at mercy on Treemont Avenue.

436
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,393
Like I think about,
I was looking at my daughter when I was 

437
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,010
watching Bronx.
I'm going,

438
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,800
I I,
how different as time change.

439
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,233
Like I was allowed to go to a liquor 
store with a note and get my mother 

440
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:10,840
Marlboro reds and bring them back in 
that neighborhood.

441
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:11,674
We didn't live there.

442
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,720
My mother just had the dry,
clean it up.

443
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:17,160
There was a bookie numbers joint.
That's why we had the dry cleaning.

444
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,930
We were partners on the dry cleaner.
You didn't know that?

445
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,120
No.
That's why I got scars on my face.

446
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:26,680
I got bit by a German shepherd as a kid.
Those three by one of the eyes.

447
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,050
That's what we did when we came from 
Cuba.

448
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:32,680
I lived in two oh five west 88th street 
and after my father died,

449
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:36,070
my mother had a dry cleaner and that's 
what we were up.

450
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:36,904
We were up in Jerome Avenue and Treemont
and grand concourse and we had a dry 

451
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,124
cleaner and every,
every weekend I would go up there and I 

452
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:45,784
would sit there with the fucking,
I learned how to dry clean and they had 

453
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:49,354
black Mike Black.
Mike was the guy that I ended 

454
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,273
everything,
but he made the best spaghetti in the 

455
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:54,184
bronx.

456
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,670
So even the Italians came to he black.
Mike Spaghetti.

457
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:58,840
Really?
Yeah.

458
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,674
This was a,
I knew all that shit when I was a kid 

459
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,050
because when you have a numbers 
operation,

460
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,320
uh,
you have to keep moving it around.

461
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,530
The cops can't,
so you have to every three or four,

462
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,364
we should have to move it around 
explaining numbers to people don't know 

463
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,500
what the numbers is.
A,

464
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,050
the Parimutuel,
it's a,

465
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,350
the last three numbers of the 
Parimutuel,

466
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,184
the track,
which is the amount of track made for 

467
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,790
the day,
soak them track,

468
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:29,791
made six hundred and eighty six thousand
four hundred eighty two thousand dollars

469
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:35,260
a number for the day is for 82 and it 
comes out as the Brooklyn number.

470
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,050
So there's three numbers a day.
There's Brooklyn,

471
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,153
the Bronx and New Jersey,
but what happened was that was a big 

472
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:47,551
business until the 80s till the lotto 
came out and the lotto cut that in half,

473
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,850
but before that,
that was all put it a little different.

474
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,233
Little different immigrant neighborhoods
all over New York City because as 

475
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,480
immigrants will one hope.
Yeah,

476
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,230
we know we want that money to get that 
refrigerator and the stove and shit like

477
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,064
that.
It's such a weird thing that they would 

478
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:07,950
gamble.
Just $2 a day.

479
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,650
Remember $2 a day when George thousand 
dollars yeah,

480
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,740
I can do a lot in 1975 with $1,000
with two kids.

481
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,230
My grandmother was obsessed with the 
numbers.

482
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,303
Yeah,
she was obsessed and she would always 

483
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:20,584
have like a number in her head that she 
thought it was going to be and it was 

484
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:26,770
like one off or something like that.
It was like these stories she would tell

485
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,040
you.
What would you say to,

486
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,120
what can I say?
I was like five.

487
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,943
I just remember it very distinctly.
My grandmother went to jail for running 

488
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:39,430
numbers in New Jersey.
She wouldn't,

489
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,160
she wouldn't rat him out.
So they put her in jail.

490
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,280
So she made sweaters,
gave sweaters to the guards.

491
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,783
Mrs D,

492
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,803
She's the nicest lady.
Did you feel that your grandmother had 

493
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,870
done time?
What did you think?

494
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,790
We didn't find out until I was probably 
like,

495
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,523
I wonder when I found out,
I think maybe I found out my teenage 

496
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,630
years and I was like,
why?

497
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,660
What the fuck people are good.
It's the year where is a,

498
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,200
I don't want to say my grandma's name 
out a respect,

499
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,210
but people would say,
you know,

500
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,710
where is she?
Oh,

501
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,480
she went to visit her,
her cousin,

502
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,790
her.
She wants to see her aunt and she was,

503
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,980
you know,
choosing the pokey for like six months.

504
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,850
I forget how much time it was,
but every time we'd go over there it was

505
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:22,910
like some new excuse.
See It in New Jersey then put you in New

506
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,743
Jersey.
They put you in jail for Gatling is 

507
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:27,500
bigger accident.
They don't give you a ticket.

508
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,423
You know,
they would give you like a ticket and 

509
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,050
shit in those days.

510
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,153
I don't know what it's like now.
This fucking the employee in jail for 

511
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,660
weed down in New York City.
I don't fucking know.

512
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,733
My grandmother was one of the few people
I've ever known where I legitimately 

513
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,390
thought they had intuition.
She has weird intuition.

514
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,300
She would do things.
It's real weird.

515
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,890
Like when my mother was a kid,
it was a rainstorm.

516
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,783
It was like real bad rain storm and for 
whatever reason my grandmother decided 

517
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:56,684
to wake my mother up,
take her out of her bed and bring her 

518
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:00,270
downstairs,
some crazy hunched.

519
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,113
She had the ceilings,
claps like right above the bed where my 

520
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:07,580
mom was sleeping.
So like pieces of,

521
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,450
you know,
it wasn't a lot,

522
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,400
it was just chunks of plaster.
But like,

523
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,323
you know,
three or four pretty significant pieces 

524
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,024
of plaster fell off of the ceiling.
It was rain came through with the whole 

525
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,860
deal,
like the ceiling game out.

526
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,263
Somehow or another,
she had this idea in her head and it 

527
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,334
could be because she knew that the 
ceiling was fucked up and she knew it 

528
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,910
was raining hard.
It was probably going to give in any way

529
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,080
or she might've had an intuition and my 
fault.

530
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,000
Everyone was always convinced it was 
intuition.

531
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,850
Everyone's always convinced like she's 
looks a little bit psychic.

532
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,290
It was always weird.
It was always weird around there.

533
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,320
She brought her monkey.
She had a month in New Jersey.

534
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,880
Yes,
in north New Jersey.

535
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,800
She had a monkey named Chichi and cheat 
you everybody,

536
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:47,634
but my grandma,
my grandfather made it keep the monkey 

537
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:53,070
in the attic.
Yo.

538
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,540
My grandma was crazy.

539
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,850
She had a monkey would open up packages 
a gum and chew gum.

540
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,030
How or where the fuck she got it from 
him?

541
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,770
I'm telling you,
my grandma was crazy.

542
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,230
Italian people had butches and they'd 
get you anything.

543
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,070
She can't look game pigeon.
She kept a monkey in the house,

544
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:14,904
man.
Do you understand what crazy then you 

545
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,820
remember monkey?
Yes.

546
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,903
Chichi.
The monkey's name is cheesy bites you 

547
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,061
now.
He never bit me,

548
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,450
but he bit my sister.
You Bet my sister.

549
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,621
Yeah.
Cheat.

550
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:26,050
You would fuck you up.
I think he bit my sister.

551
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,663
I think he tried to bite my sister.
I think it was one of those things they 

552
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,120
might have bit my cousin some when our 
family got pit ever touched him.

553
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:40,600
I couldn't even see.
I know Italian side.

554
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,463
Yeah.
That night she was crazy and once you 

555
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,460
give,
no disrespect,

556
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,930
but once you get those lunar texts,
that option that they do have intuition,

557
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,900
you're fucking done.

558
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,770
They start giving you the fish eyes,
zoot don't do shit.

559
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,190
You got to listen to all her cooking was
from another planet.

560
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,170
It's from another planet.
It was like pure immigrant cooking.

561
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,980
Like the pasta that was design.
Yeah.

562
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,130
You just sit there and go,
holy shit just perfect.

563
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,470
Just knew exactly what supposed to be in
there.

564
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,520
She baked her own,
like she would make her own macaroni,

565
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,880
should make our own Ravioli.
She would stuff her own Ravioli.

566
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:27,090
She'd be out there rolling and flatten 
out flour and shit,

567
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,430
throwing the flower on top of,
flatten it out.

568
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:32,130
She was a wizard though.
Usually get a monkey,

569
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:32,964
call it cheating.
It's gotta respect a little monkey and 

570
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,170
keep her head though.
Either respectful for grandma.

571
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,840
My grandma was a special lady.
She was powerful.

572
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,950
Once you give those,

573
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,540
listen,
when I was a kid,

574
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,180
man,
I went to my buddy's judo school.

575
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,403
I didn't join.
I just went down there to see what it 

576
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:50,520
was like and it was hidden in union 
city.

577
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,970
It was on seventh street,
but I knew that my step dad played cards

578
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,470
on ninth street on Wednesdays.
Wow.

579
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,543
Okay.
I knew my stepdad played cards down 

580
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:01,990
there.
They played baccarat.

581
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,533
Okay.
And they'd gamble in this little club 

582
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,550
and I had to be maybe 10 but because I 
grew up,

583
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:12,240
how I grew up with the numbers,
I always had my eyes out as a kid.

584
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,790
When I went to judo,
that man at the end,

585
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,653
I got in the bus to go back and I 
noticed unmarked police cars and I went 

586
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,650
home that night and look bro,
you know,

587
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:27,651
made dog get Christie love used to be a 
show on ABC about a black chick that new

588
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,930
martial arts and tried to capitalize on 
it with a system.

589
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,423
And she was good looking with an Afro 
when she was a cop that she'd come in 

590
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,784
and do karate moves on Wednesday nights 
at nine or 10 o'clock and you caught me 

591
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:43,290
at home watching get Kristy Le and I'll 
never forget that my stepdad was leaving

592
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,450
that night.
And for some reason,

593
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:46,900
I know you're going to play it back home
after that.

594
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,110
And they looked at me,
he was getting dressed a suit on.

595
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,510
You have like the billy bad suit on and 
shit,

596
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,813
you're going to play cards or five men,
why are you getting dressed to the 

597
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:57,360
nines?
And I said to him,

598
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,200
I said,
hey man,

599
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,233
today I went down there to go to Martins
judo school and I saw a bunch of them 

600
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,040
marked cards down there.
If I was you,

601
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:08,580
I wouldn't go out to that.
And He fucking just looked at me.

602
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,710
He said,
I love you.

603
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,630
And he walked down the stairs,
he got in the car,

604
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,430
started it,
opened the garage bro.

605
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,983
And 10 minutes later I heard the car 
turned off in the garage close and they 

606
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:20,040
came up and he goes,
I think you're right.

607
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,630
And he made Sundays for me and him and 
next morning and that card place,

608
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:25,464
I got rid of that.
So now they would listen to me on the 

609
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,013
housing.

610
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,410
I had these fucking moron,
my spouse.

611
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,500
But you want me to tell you what else I 
did?

612
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,493
Joe Rogan,
like this is me and like me and my 

613
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:42,430
stepdad had this weird relationship.
I got to an age where I wanted my mother

614
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,430
from myself.
You know what the feeling is dry on when

615
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:46,264
we've all gone through it.
When you lose a dad and your mom 

616
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,444
remarries that comes up a day that he's 
not going to tell you what's going on 

617
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:54,790
anymore.
And you know what?

618
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,013
I just want you to know that I,
I'm the mother fucker that runs this 

619
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:00,580
joint.
You might be sleeping with my mum,

620
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:04,120
but I run this motherfucker.
So once I gave him that advice,

621
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,600
like it really for a while,
then him and I would go in a float.

622
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,020
I kept stealing his coins from the 
center.

623
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,840
He had this sand Laszlo thing and that 
was everything to him.

624
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,003
So he had this big bottle of like scotch
that was empty and he would put silver 

625
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:20,680
dollars in there and I would steal them.

626
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,740
And from time to time he would come home
and go,

627
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,980
that bottle's looking like somebody's 
stealing my car.

628
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,290
I destroyed his mind for you because he 
was a very particular man.

629
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,500
So he had different bundles of,
but I gotta tell you something,

630
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,334
I respect them today because I saw him 
get out of the joint and I show what he 

631
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,740
did with bookmaking and how he became 
part of,

632
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:45,700
it's on a butcher shop.
I started businesses,

633
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,500
he started different businesses.
So,

634
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,783
uh,
after I saved this that night with the 

635
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,910
backer,
rocky would listen to me.

636
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,420
And then one day I went and I signed up 
for biddy basketball and union city.

637
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,790
And they used to give,
you know,

638
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:01,420
like now if you sign your kid up,
you got to pay any dollars.

639
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,620
In those days you just show up on an 
address and they gave you a tee shirt.

640
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,360
They put you on the team and they gave 
me a number.

641
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,171
They said,
like,

642
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:11,020
you didn't say department of recreation.
And it was a purple shirt.

643
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,460
My number was 57 I walked into the house
and he goes,

644
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:16,360
what do you got there?
And I go,

645
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:17,194
Oh,
I joined the basketball thing and he 

646
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:20,080
goes,
what number is he goes,

647
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:24,820
57 Cubans again,
a very superstitious 57 he goes,

648
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,060
put a number on that.
And he picked up the phone.

649
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:30,490
I go five.
He called some guy and he goes,

650
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:33,600
give me five 57 for $10 guess what 
happened?

651
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,600
Joe Rug.
What happened?

652
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,450
The number came up.
No,

653
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,410
I really had them under my spell.
Right.

654
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:39,244
The Fuck Anissa had this motherfucker at
the age of 12 so he wouldn't listen to 

655
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:46,270
me.
How old was the guy?

656
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,140
My step father Juan at the time was 47 
did not drink gig,

657
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,460
did not drink,
did not do drugs.

658
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,323
Carry the straight razor.
Joe Rogan straight razor to cut people 

659
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:58,180
in.
Yeah,

660
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,013
and he used to cut.
He used to web carpenter pants with the 

661
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:03,910
straight raise.
At this point,

662
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,640
the guy had money.
He would have a gold chain.

663
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,683
He'd wear a Chinese tee shirt,
which a lot of people do not know what 

664
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,220
it is.
That's what real pimps were.

665
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,440
That silk and made shirts from China 
that you went and they have three little

666
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:18,274
buttons.
When when you were real motherfucking 

667
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:20,344
Spec,
you cut those buttons and you get your 

668
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,310
initials and you put them in gold with 
diamonds in it.

669
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,190
That's how spics ran in those days.
Well,

670
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,420
and uh,
once I had them there,

671
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,590
Joe Rogan,
I had him,

672
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,440
he trusted me,
he trusted my eyes.

673
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,140
So one night we're in union city and I 
fucking went somewhere.

674
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,093
The walk back,

675
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,343
there's a place called pastoral music 
and there was next to the new moon 

676
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,534
Chinese restaurant.
And I show a bunch of unmarked cars and 

677
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:49,124
I never forget that.
I went back to the bar and then he'd go 

678
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,500
out and I told him,
I said,

679
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,580
dog,
I saw three on my,

680
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,670
like I had him and I seen,
I seen three on my cars up to corner.

681
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:02,060
He was very always scared of the phone,
even though he was a bookmaker,

682
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:05,360
he never used the phone.
Joe Rogan never used the phone.

683
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:07,880
And he would never have a conversation 
close to a phone.

684
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,260
This is because he always felt he didn't
not like phones.

685
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,720
He did everything like a pigeon.
His,

686
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,033
he would write the numbers and the 
little piece of paper real small and 

687
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:22,460
fold them up and put him in his hat.
And if he ever saw cops,

688
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,140
he would just eat the piece of paper.

689
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,443
He didn't give a fuck.
He always had the piece of paper 

690
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,090
somewhere close.
Sometimes you would put it in this ring.

691
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,820
This motherfucker was a savage dog.
Oh my God.

692
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,150
So that night the cops were going to 
jump on us on the bar,

693
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,430
but it was for a drug thing.
It wasn't for him.

694
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,410
But when I went back,
I told him,

695
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:45,680
listen to cops are up the corner and me 
and him,

696
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,360
he grabbed me by the hand and him and I 
walked from 29th in Bergen Line,

697
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,253
the 58th and Bergen line down the Hudson
telling different borrowers that there 

698
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:58,010
was going to be a raid.
Like that's how are untrustworthy.

699
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,580
He was a phones.
And by the time we got back to the bar,

700
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,960
we got raided and there was a dude in,
his name was Monina.

701
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,810
Right.
Monina is those,

702
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:09,644
uh,
those crazy Cubans that Albert Albacore 

703
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,130
Monina means good man.

704
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,780
Like y'all my bra.
Yeah,

705
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:18,810
the albacore there.
They don't need pussy and dental.

706
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,813
He puts it here and they fucking,
you can't fuck around with animals 

707
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,140
because of Saint Lazarus.
Know that show.

708
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:26,620
They have a very specific religion.
They have their ma,

709
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,320
it's a manhood.
They were longshoremen and Cuba and they

710
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:33,050
maintain order.
So we have a fuck up.

711
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,460
They'd come over and fuck you up there.
But he had a wig.

712
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,323
I'll never forget this.
The Guy Monina had a wig and the cops 

713
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:43,070
were there and they threw him.
And I'm like,

714
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,900
12 dog.
I'm up against the wall.

715
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,310
This search and made through that search
and my step dad,

716
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,410
they got my mom and they went to Monina 
and they searched him and the cop looked

717
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:55,310
at his work and he goes to check the wig
and they pulled the wig off and he had a

718
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,550
little aluminum foil weed,
cocaine.

719
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,370
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.

720
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:08,590
That whole bookmaking numbers world is 
fucking nuts that I grew up in.

721
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,620
I love it.
Still.

722
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,993
I love,
I wonder what it's like that there's no 

723
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:16,130
business in it.
It's unfortunate because you think about

724
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:17,600
how many bets are placed.
Oh,

725
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:18,920
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

726
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,410
there's so much money,
so much money out there.

727
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,310
People love to gamble fucking games when
games are on.

728
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,580
People love to gamble.
What do you think is spent this weekend,

729
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:29,710
Jamie?
Come on.

730
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,960
[inaudible] question Joey.
Like why is that a problem?

731
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,333
Like what?
What?

732
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,070
What is what's helping us by letting 
them regulate that shit.

733
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,070
Like why?
Why does that happen?

734
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,670
Why do you have to have a license to 
gamble?

735
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,380
Why?
No,

736
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,740
if you think someone's not paying their 
taxes and you can prove it,

737
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,353
is it because it's money?
It's cash that's been thrown around 

738
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:52,890
mostly like what?
Why is it an issue?

739
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,780
The government's got not getting their 
piece.

740
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,860
It seems ridiculous that grown adults 
could tell other grown adults that can't

741
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:03,470
gamble,
but you can hear but you can't there.

742
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,363
Oh,
gambling is one of those things like 

743
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:10,211
legalization of marijuana,
legalization of fucking cocaine lately.

744
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,830
Lization of anything,
Bro.

745
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,843
You know what?
There's going to be fucking winners and 

746
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,830
there's going to be fucking losers.
My friends,

747
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,280
two years ago,
Connecticut did,

748
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:20,114
uh,
did an expo say on 60 minutes about 

749
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:27,401
women who have just lost death.
Fucking mine's gambling.

750
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,680
I don't know.
He can sudden because they installed,

751
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:31,514
no,
no disrespect the Mohican Sun at Casino 

752
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,633
Industries,
they installed these type of slot 

753
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:40,760
machines that could just fuck what your 
mind what?

754
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:45,050
So these women were going down there and
losing fucking mortgages.

755
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,060
Houses.
You know,

756
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,420
I was like a John Waters movie,
the dog and that dog.

757
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,010
It was just something that,
listen,

758
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,603
listen,
listen.

759
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,650
Let me go.
Let's go.

760
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,483
Let's get something out of the way here.
The biggest percentage of degenerate 

761
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:00,104
gamblers are usually women.
Let's look this fucking percentage up 

762
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:05,660
here.
Women go fucking deep.

763
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,740
That's a fucking hole.
They don't give a fuck about nothing.

764
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,720
They,
they fucking play cards.

765
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,850
Women fucking bang it out.
Wow.

766
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,420
And they bang it out while you're at 
work.

767
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,350
Joe Rogan while I'm at work.
They start with a horse.

768
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,360
Then they go to this.
You know those little promos they do,

769
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,194
and in Jersey,
what did they say when you know when 

770
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,540
Atlantic City was Atlantic City,
you went to union city,

771
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,690
right?
You pay 15 bucks to get on a bus.

772
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,690
They gave you a coupon book and when you
get to Atlantic city,

773
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,100
they give it $15 in quarters back.
So that basically driving you to fucking

774
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:43,490
gamble and drive back.
I believe in gambling.

775
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,730
I believe in making your living.
I believe that it's an itch.

776
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,920
It's an illness,
whatever,

777
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:52,790
but when you're losing your house,
there's got,

778
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,540
that's where I want to know where.
That's where it bothers me.

779
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,540
It's just like cocaine.
It's just like a drug abuse.

780
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,463
It's just like the opiate problem.
It's just not any even fucking thing 

781
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,160
else.
It could fucking,

782
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,480
you and I both know people who have lost
their fucking lives.

783
00:38:08,481 --> 00:38:09,920
Gambling.
Okay.

784
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:13,610
You've seen people in pool halls.
You see how they get Joe Rogan.

785
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,850
There's no difference in the drug addict
and the gambling addict.

786
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,620
Not at all,
no difference

787
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,380
there.
It's just a scary too,

788
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,470
because they're conscious.
It's like if you've seen the drug act,

789
00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:25,270
you see him,
he's shooting up or whatever it is,

790
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:28,390
and you see him fainting,
you go out of their poor bastard.

791
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,660
But when you see a guy who,
who's fully in the grips of gambling,

792
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:33,610
trying to figure out how to make,
get his money back,

793
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,280
and he's all jazzed up with adrenaline,
doesn't understand why,

794
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,710
see there's gamblers like Michael 
Jordan.

795
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:39,544
Then there's gamblers like Joey Diaz,
this gamblers who have the means to 

796
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:46,390
gamble.
And that is a fucking killer.

797
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,490
Also like on Michael Jordan,
Michael Jordan.

798
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:52,630
And I'm not saying nothing bad about 
Michael Jordan accusations that you hear

799
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:56,010
that he even bets on his own while I'm 
one basketball games.

800
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,200
I think it very,
uh,

801
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,960
he was very,
uh,

802
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,860
competitive,
but now how Joey Diaz was doing it,

803
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,963
not how people,
Charles Barkley lost nearly $30 million 

804
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,440
gambling it to us.
He's this Charles,

805
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,630
uh,
uh,

806
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,120
Joey,
how much money is,

807
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,450
tom asked how many people did you grow 
up?

808
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:16,284
But that will,
like Joey Diaz did not have the means 

809
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:22,480
that when 19 years old.
Okay.

810
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,333
And One night they put a 10 time better 
than a fucking knick game and they won 

811
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:29,680
$50 when you're 19 $50 is a lot of 
fucking money.

812
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,543
That's a lot of fun.
So now you think you got the world by 

813
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,160
the balls.

814
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,240
So you do it again on Friday,
Saturday,

815
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,200
and now you enter this world Joe Rogan 
that gets dark.

816
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:41,830
It's,
it's a instead of the drug addiction,

817
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,843
alcohol addiction,
every morning you wake up like his 

818
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:45,970
today,
my lucky day.

819
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,093
It's like the people who go to the seven
11 every day and you're trying to just 

820
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:54,760
get a pack of rolling papers.
You're just in a rush.

821
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,700
You just left your Jitsu.
You just want to ruin papers and water.

822
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,190
If there's a guy in front of you and 
he's telling you,

823
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:01,024
give me three 68 four 60 fours and this 
poor fucking whatever gives them 20 

824
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:11,010
lottery tickets and it's $118 this is 
what this guy's doing everyday,

825
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,790
seven fucking days a week.
My friend and he bite,

826
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,763
he might be winning $200 a fucking week,
but every week he's getting deeper and 

827
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:19,414
deeper into a fucking hole because in 
your mind you think today's your lucky 

828
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:24,670
day and it's never,
you're lucky.

829
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,533
I was in that hole when I was 19 dog and
I saw a friend lose any Dallas and when 

830
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:32,404
you're 18 years old and he had to get 
three jobs and I never really fucked 

831
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:36,760
with that again.
I learned that addiction,

832
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,520
that shit left my world early.
You know,

833
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,460
it was a degenerate loser Gambler,
John Gotti.

834
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,520
He wanted,
because they brag,

835
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,043
that's that conversation in mind.
They may know who I'm still fuck got 

836
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:52,630
away from me,
you know I have no fucking idea.

837
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,160
If I had fucking Michigan and the hook,
I would have made 30,000

838
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,400
they lose 80 90 200,000
in a weekend that the system is designed

839
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,493
to bury the degenerate gambler like from
from August 15th look at this John Gadi 

840
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,490
secret obsession and that wage 600 bets 
and scrabble and a $3,000

841
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:23,320
monopoly.
Buyin you have no idea.

842
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:27,730
Guys did the generous for like eight for
like seven months.

843
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,780
I played this fucking ugly game Joe,
but I would start I the action.

844
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,640
I knew that you had a bet on Monday 
nights and try to win and you know what?

845
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:41,750
I lost every week and all these people 
show you information.

846
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,290
Listen,
Arch Lisa played the fucking game,

847
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:49,580
lost Pete Rose and lost even Michael 
Jordan and loss.

848
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,300
There's room is that,
that's why he was asked to play baseball

849
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,610
for a few years because there was a 
cover up again.

850
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,990
I did not write this.
This is just things I hear on the road.

851
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,213
Everybody has a fucking boat.
Gambling grabs you fucking weird bro 

852
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:06,704
year and it grabbed me for a long time.
I kept thinking that was the day and I 

853
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,530
kept betting 40 times what's touching 
me.

854
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,693
If they had a problem playing scrabble,
they would call up the parker brothers 

855
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:17,654
hotline.
Dick Mobsters would to dispute the 

856
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:19,820
rules.

857
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Then explain and what those fucking Lami
is a word.

858
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:34,050
It's a word Joe.
Stop means is not a one stop.

859
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,490
Mean kids don't word Wiki.
Wiki,

860
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:39,160
Wiki Dude,
he told me they stopped me.

861
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,950
That's why they would get into arguments
about garbage.

862
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:45,280
Man was a real word.
Garbage man cafe.

863
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,353
You know?

864
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,260
Oh my God,
gambling is a fucking nightmare and once

865
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:56,250
you get caught in the web and you enjoy 
rogue and shuts me down,

866
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,550
then I start putting batch with Jamie 
and then pretty soon I start plucking,

867
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:05,790
dipping into accounts and pretty soon 
now you're done.

868
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:06,743
Now you get forced into a bad hand.
I told you that I was a backer on the 

869
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:12,150
road for a while.
My friend Johnny B,

870
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,350
when I started making money doing 
standup,

871
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,253
I put together a little bankroll and me 
and him would go places and gamble and 

872
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,390
he would win or lose.
You know?

873
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,220
Sometimes he'd win.
Sometimes you lose,

874
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,320
but it was just uh,
being an action.

875
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,030
It was fun.
You know,

876
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:27,864
that kind of gambling.
Like I was never good enough to like 

877
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,443
play those guys.
But I could play like people that were 

878
00:43:32,491 --> 00:43:33,324
like my level and you'd bet like 20 
bucks or maybe if you want to get crazy 

879
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:39,570
about like 50 bucks.
I never bet like a lot of money gambling

880
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,610
on pool,
but it makes you think more,

881
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,910
it makes you play like way more serious.
It's good for your game.

882
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:47,130
And if you can have a friendly sparring 
partner,

883
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,520
they play friendly games like maybe a 
race to seven for 20 bucks.

884
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,240
So it's costs you probably in any city 
pool halls,

885
00:43:57,241 --> 00:44:00,540
I don't know what the rate is per hour,
but they gotta be like at least 20 bucks

886
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,930
for once and for all,
I want you to break it down from it.

887
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,750
I walked into a pool hall with Jamie.
Yeah,

888
00:44:09,751 --> 00:44:13,980
I got 10 g's cash in my pocket.
Jamie's my main man.

889
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:14,903
How do I exactly make money and why is 
it that the people the room passing 

890
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:21,930
money around and how does that money get
dispersed?

891
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,260
It was real simple.
Everybody puts like you put in,

892
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:26,094
I'm in for 120 matches one,
it depends on who's putting it together 

893
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,250
cause they might decide to just in all 
their money

894
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,850
like everybody put in on one side pool 
in money and you know,

895
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:39,150
and and back this guy or they might be 
betting on the side.

896
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:41,700
They might not even be playing the game.
There's always a side bets.

897
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,060
Side bets are probably more like if you 
had a bet,

898
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:49,440
if you had like a big pool game right?
There used to be a place called uh,

899
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,320
w what is it?
Western billiards.

900
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,950
I think in New Jersey,
west end,

901
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:56,843
I think it was called,
we'll see if you find west end 

902
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,050
billiards.
It was a world famous pool hall.

903
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:01,884
We would take the drive from,
I'm from New York to go down in New 

904
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,650
Jersey to this famous pool hall that 
would have these like serious high level

905
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:15,390
professionals play there and real high 
level hustlers from all over the country

906
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,224
would go there for big money games.
You go there and watch people play for 

907
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,000
$5,000
$10,000

908
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,490
I mean the best in the world would be 
there all the time.

909
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,290
I got to play against some of the best 
in the world.

910
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,290
They killed me,
but I got to play again against him.

911
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,470
Like real good guys.
Let's say into the tournament,

912
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,793
you and I,
you and I are in the tournament and you 

913
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:34,824
are a Efrin Rayez the greatest of all 
time or earl stricklin or Johnny Archer 

914
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,180
and I'm just Joe Rogan.
I barely could play.

915
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,950
It doesn't matter.
I put my money up,

916
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:44,963
I entered the tournament.
I can play against you unless it's a 

917
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,544
huge,
huge like where you have to get invited 

918
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,270
so that those joey dee has come onto the
side and go,

919
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:53,660
listen,
I'm putting three to one hud's on this.

920
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,070
Sure.
Some people definitely,

921
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,790
definitely.
That's a side.

922
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,610
Yes,
I,

923
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,160
that's all.
I don't know how the pool,

924
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:01,170
we got 100 bucks on archer.
You know,

925
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,460
you'd never seen this diaz kid play.
I've got a hundred ideas and dudes,

926
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,630
I'll take that,
I'll take that and then you just work it

927
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,160
out and everybody works it out.

928
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,233
But when sometimes guys will get 
together and back somebody to like say 

929
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:12,624
if you got it like a friend,
it's a really good player and this guy 

930
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:17,970
is coming in from out of town and he 
wants to take a crack at him and go,

931
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,590
well he wants to play $100 sets.
Okay.

932
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:22,280
And then you have to think how many 
barrels do we have?

933
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,670
You Pool your money together.
Okay,

934
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:24,504
we got four barrels.
That means if he wants to play sets we 

935
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:27,894
can lose four times.
So you have to be able to lose a couple 

936
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,084
of gain.
A couple,

937
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,700
like if you're going to really play a 
guy out,

938
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:33,534
these guys would play 10 12 hours.
Then we keep going back and forth and 

939
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:37,720
back and forth.
It's,

940
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,910
it's,
it's crazy.

941
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,970
Like I've seen guys and you would see 
him the next day.

942
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:44,100
They'd still be playing.
You'd go there in the morning,

943
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,600
they'd be playing all through the night.

944
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,410
I don't know what the fuck they were on.
Most likely some sort of emphatic means.

945
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,690
That was a big thing and the pool world 
for a while,

946
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,240
guys would just break each other with 
gambling.

947
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,400
It would just,
it would be about who quits.

948
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,640
It wouldn't be about who won.
It's very rarely about like,

949
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,500
you know like you would,
you'd be,

950
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,030
you would be frowned upon highly if you 
left on top.

951
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:11,050
Say if you're ahead by 500 bucks and you
want to quit me and,

952
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,620
and I'm still ready,
ready to keep playing,

953
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,610
I still got more money,
man.

954
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,160
Let me win my money back.
If you just walked away,

955
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,570
Nope,
I've got what I wanted.

956
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:20,850
I'm going to leave now.
Like that would be,

957
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,250
you'd be what's called bad action,
but guys,

958
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:26,130
I've got two kids are having to get up 
at seven and go to the pool hall.

959
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:28,440
Motherfucker with two kids.
You're not playing that kind of pool.

960
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:30,070
There ain't nobody would two kids 
playing that

961
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,170
level pool in pool halls like gambling,
it hustled pool maybe now there are,

962
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,400
this is actually a few guys,
I take that back.

963
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,263
There's a few guys with kids that are 
top of the food chain because the pool 

964
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:41,950
hall mile from my house,
whenever I get,

965
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,490
whenever I go into Hollywood now I can't
do her.

966
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:48,070
Okay and no more,
so I got to go a long way and I get off.

967
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:51,910
I'm victory just to see it fucking 
always felt with the generous.

968
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,930
I'm petrified to pull in there.
Sometimes places we're home to me,

969
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,600
he's always told them talking about 
right next to the Strip club.

970
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,400
Is that on victory?
Right when you exit then there's a strip

971
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:05,860
club right next to a ball.
Well,

972
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:08,950
I know the only good one in this area.
I shouldn't say the only good one.

973
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,240
The only good one that I know of.

974
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,860
His house.
A billiards in Sherman oaks.

975
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,760
I like this area.
Have you been?

976
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,383
You been on the one on one?
Have you seen what that place is that 

977
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,440
where you took me there a couple of 
times to eat.

978
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,160
We did comedy there.
Remember Hollywood billy and you took me

979
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:25,350
there.
Yeah,

980
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,200
it's fucking a building.
What is it now?

981
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,480
The goal then next time.
What does it look like?

982
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't Joe,
next time I drove by and I was like,

983
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,403
oh my God that we did comedy that to eat
dead with the a couple times we played 

984
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:42,930
pool there are a bunch of tiny chip 
time.

985
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,790
Bunch of times that place was fucking 
done.

986
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,640
That whole area is completely,
that's where I met.

987
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:49,660
Crazy.
Max are bully.

988
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,531
Really?
Yeah,

989
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:53,530
like that dude can play some fucking 
pool.

990
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,570
Ooh,
so when you play Max separately,

991
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:56,710
how much drive to pull it up guy?

992
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,750
He's still put them on the one I would 
get tortured.

993
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,490
You would have to bet like that.
I would go to,

994
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:04,240
you're never going to bet on me.
Like a guy like Max eberly.

995
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,750
He's top of the food chain as far as his
technique and delivery.

996
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,090
He could win a world championship 
tournament.

997
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,970
Like legitimately he's that good.
I have no chance.

998
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,300
Like if if we played 12 games,
I might win a couple.

999
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,760
I might get lucky and win a few.
Maybe I went for,

1000
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,993
he's getting way more.
He's going to get to 12 for sure 

1001
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,350
quicker.
It'd be a terrible bat.

1002
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,780
The bat would be,
how many games did I get too?

1003
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,093
That'd be the bat.
If you say you'll never get past three 

1004
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,250
because a guy like max tablet can run 10
racks in a row and I'm not exaggerating.

1005
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:34,084
I've seen him do it.

1006
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,100
Blam breaks,
runs 10 racks in a row,

1007
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,680
but to the point where you're sitting 
there,

1008
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,870
he did it in Vegas.
We were all hanging out.

1009
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,680
I think it was man was an Ari.
I forget who came with me.

1010
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,000
How could you forget?
You guys are going to the Italian place.

1011
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,923
Yes.
That place was amazing and that's 

1012
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,070
exactly what Max Max's plan.
He,

1013
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,400
he would break and run out on guys and 
they would just get frustrated.

1014
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,170
They'd be like,
what the fuck man?

1015
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,640
They just get,
didn't get to shoot.

1016
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,743
We watched him.
He was gambling some guy and when the 

1017
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,283
set was over,
the guy was just pissed off because Max 

1018
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,790
wouldn't miss.
It was crazy.

1019
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,624
Just watch him.
He's playing a guy that really just 

1020
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,200
wanted to take a chance and play like a 
top of the food chain guy and he gambled

1021
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:19,660
with them.
But just watching the difference between

1022
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:20,494
a kid who can play a little pool,
it's pretty good versus a world 

1023
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,420
championship caliber pool play.

1024
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,320
They're so precise.
I,

1025
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:31,870
because technique is so clean and his 
angles are perfect and he's just efforts

1026
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,970
effortlessly move in the cue ball on the
table to where he wants it.

1027
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,480
He sees clusters and problems.
Wayne advance and breaks them up.

1028
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,790
It's so high level.
That's my boy.

1029
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,020
That's Max Albert Lea.
He taught me how to play pool.

1030
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,300
Uh,
not that I didn't already play it before

1031
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,223
I met him,
but he taught me how to play it way 

1032
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,570
better,
way better.

1033
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,240
He made my game,
I'm way more uh,

1034
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,150
technical.
He was explaining things that I was just

1035
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:59,810
guessing before and he was explaining 
what was wrong with my approach and like

1036
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:00,381
what was the,
what's,

1037
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:01,214
what's a better way to do it?
He's a wizard when it comes to 

1038
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:06,230
technique.
Got He can make a living going from pool

1039
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:07,610
hall to Pool Hall.
No Way.

1040
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,570
Cause he's that good.

1041
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,670
He's an artist too.
Fortunately for Max,

1042
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,030
he uh,
he makes pretty cool artwork like um,

1043
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,973
a lot.
See some of it's probably on his 

1044
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:17,780
instagram.
[inaudible] pool cubes or something?

1045
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,111
No,
no,

1046
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:18,771
no,
no.

1047
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:21,060
Max does pool cues.
Ooh,

1048
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:22,143
somebody along the way.
He said he makes like fucking eight 

1049
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:26,180
jeep.
Oh,

1050
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,890
Judy's ivory.
Eric.

1051
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:28,820
Chris.
That's my boy.

1052
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:31,490
Eric from shake the tree.
Somebody.

1053
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,620
That's what I play with.
I played with his cue.

1054
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,290
His cue is a,
he's a wizard man.

1055
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:39,920
He's a guy who's like really into like 
the grains of woods.

1056
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,930
He's really into like patterns and he 
thinks of like,

1057
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,783
to him what is like mesmerizing.
He finds like the most beautiful pieces 

1058
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:52,070
of wood and comp combines and together 
and they have to have a certain harmonic

1059
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:55,040
frequency.
Like he drops him on a safari cement for

1060
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,300
just like Dank,
Dank.

1061
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,550
Like he wants to hear a certain sound 
from the wood,

1062
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:59,870
otherwise he won't use it.

1063
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,533
He's like finding logs on the side of 
the highway and shit and recognizing 

1064
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,550
some weird hardwood that no one's ever 
used before.

1065
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,220
He cuts it up and execute out of it.
He's a wizard,

1066
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,670
like his cues or for Dan,
he doesn't give a fuck.

1067
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,980
He makes as many as he wants.
You know,

1068
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,440
sometimes they don't make them for 
awhile,

1069
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,150
makes them first.
Friends won't let me pay for one after I

1070
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:26,720
have to pay for everything,
just to not feel terrible.

1071
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,590
He's like the nicest guy ever.
Play some fucking pool too.

1072
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,020
So I don't even know when this podcast 
started.

1073
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,700
Amazon,
it's happening.

1074
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,220
It's funny.
Before we started,

1075
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,650
we were talking about uh,
yeah,

1076
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,080
4.8
billion.

1077
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,860
I'm like,
well 3% will happen in Nevada.

1078
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,113
Only 3% so most of it online online was 
that Chris Christie thing you pulled up 

1079
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:48,861
earlier.
James,

1080
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:51,470
listen,G
and banks,

1081
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:55,190
banks,
there's still people who are like a,

1082
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:57,500
you know they have,
they got a ton of loot.

1083
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,560
Chris Christie goes to the Supreme Court
on sports betting.

1084
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,030
Is he trying to get sports betting?

1085
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,940
Yeah,
he lives,

1086
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,773
they passed something in a Jersey I 
think in 2011 to allow betting and 

1087
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:08,214
sports,
but it's still only a lot of vegas 

1088
00:53:09,241 --> 00:53:11,610
because of the whatever law there is 
back on your team,

1089
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:12,410
Chris.
Yeah.

1090
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,700
All right,
so he has a few problems,

1091
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,760
but we all do 17 states also with them 
on this.

1092
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,400
I think I want to do it so he would 
want,

1093
00:53:20,401 --> 00:53:22,770
he opposed it.
They wanted again,

1094
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:23,604
they want betting again because they 
have an NHL team in Vegas and that's 

1095
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,124
always been like the,
the logic is that there'll be some 

1096
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:29,130
issue,
whatever.

1097
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,560
You can't not be betting where their 
sports being played because someone will

1098
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:32,394
throw the game.
Everybody should be able to bet every 

1099
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:34,554
city she'll do whatever you want to.
We're going to talk to you going to do 

1100
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,250
these games though.
These,

1101
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:45,540
I'm fascinated by these games you see or
hypnotizing ladies and going crazy,

1102
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,830
losing all their,
their money.

1103
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,733
That was 60 minutes did a whole,
he bought a whole piece on these games 

1104
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,910
are like laser ish and people actually 
put the percentage was higher.

1105
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,110
Most women because of its,
uh,

1106
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,900
so let me explain something to you.
It's your view.

1107
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,710
You know,
it's just uh,

1108
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,410
it's like video games,
more like gambling.

1109
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,490
It's very fucking so addictive.
Like a video game,

1110
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:15,324
but also the gambling very game.
So that's what the beef was to remove 

1111
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:23,040
these type of games because I'm telling 
you since I was a kid,

1112
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,500
I always first off,

1113
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,260
yeah,

1114
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,380
I lived with my mother.
She had a lot of proms,

1115
00:54:29,381 --> 00:54:30,214
shovel out your rate issues,
but she was a degenerate gambler on 

1116
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:33,674
baseball

1117
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,880
between the Boston Red Sox and the New 
York mets.

1118
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,910
They killed it.
They killed her.

1119
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,400
And I saw the decline.
I saw what did that,

1120
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,770
I saw a person watched two baseball 
games at the same time.

1121
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:53,790
I remember in those days you didn't have
a split screen and direct TV.

1122
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,510
So if you were Puerto Rican,
you took one pv and you put it on top of

1123
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:02,410
the other TV and you got fucking MBC and
you had cable with it,

1124
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:03,244
came with the cord member with Hbo,
still had the cord to the fucking thing 

1125
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:13,050
and it was a thing with a box that you 
pressed and you switched three levels in

1126
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:18,051
those days may be there was no edit and 
there was no aba package or NBA package.

1127
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,153
You got like one other game.
So we would pray that it would be the 

1128
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:23,664
Boston red sox and she would watch both 
fucking games and gamble at the same 

1129
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:27,834
time.
Not,

1130
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,640
not even that.
The numbers,

1131
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,163
if she had a dream about a goat bad.
If she had a dream about going back to 

1132
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:36,290
Cuba,
Bam.

1133
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,390
Your family,
if she had a dream about,

1134
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,850
um,
seeing her daughter,

1135
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,460
Bam,
it was a number they would call her.

1136
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,520
They would call her at a quarter to 
three because she had all that,

1137
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,150
all those contacts.
So that was that gambling.

1138
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:54,830
Then there was the,
then there was the track addiction.

1139
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:55,910
Okay.

1140
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,910
Which started at aqueduct in the 
afternoon.

1141
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,953
If the sun was shining,
that was my excuse to go to aqua duck 

1142
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,250
from my mother.
Let me go to act with duck pasta.

1143
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:05,084
You had three after school and she'd be 
there at three but the whole time she'd 

1144
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:10,790
be scratching because the meadowlands 
started at eight

1145
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:12,923
okay.

1146
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,030
She knew she could catch the metal lands
at eight so guess what happens is,

1147
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,380
is that if you lose the eight o'clock 
meadowlands what?

1148
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:23,200
You haul your ass to yonkers with the 
death of death.

1149
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,100
This is

1150
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,400
where you go to before you go to a pool 
or this or your blood.

1151
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,580
You go to yonkers raceway.
Do you understand me?

1152
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,460
Have you ever been to yonkers raceway?
Yeah.

1153
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:36,310
You leave there with a corner,
the one where do you think you're going?

1154
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,880
You either going to sell your soul or 
give you a blood.

1155
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:42,730
She'd go shoot pool because you're 
saving the day.

1156
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,540
You cannot go home a loser.
Right,

1157
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,470
right.
There's all day gambling.

1158
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,870
Oh my God.
So that was her thing.

1159
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:54,871
So I also grew up in an Italian family 
that the mother was a chow away.

1160
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,820
It was like a fucking act.
It was like an act.

1161
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,880
She had three kids.
They were tremendous kids.

1162
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,480
I knew the husband,
he worked for a big corporation,

1163
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,000
they drove a nice car,
they went to church.

1164
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,183
But on Saturdays when I go over there,
I would always go with your mom and 

1165
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,010
they'd go,
my mom plays cards with uh,

1166
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,320
with the Rogan's and uh,
and this name.

1167
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,260
But why as I got older one day somebody 
said to me,

1168
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:24,094
don't be careful when you go over there.
Why they might shoot that lady in the 

1169
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:29,830
head.
She knows like 600 down.

1170
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,110
I mean,
and when I was a kid,

1171
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:34,360
I was like 13 and somebody came to me,
they said,

1172
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,470
be careful when you go with it because 
the mom's a little bit on the those card

1173
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:41,290
games.
And then as I got ahold of,

1174
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,870
they're scared for your life from a card
game.

1175
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,880
Magic being scared for your life.
Well,

1176
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,550
it was a different game.
That's how they suck you in.

1177
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:51,430
So a lot of the people now,
I also grew up with men,

1178
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:53,890
degenerate gamblers,
but I know all of the symptoms.

1179
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,110
I know the itch.
This,

1180
00:57:56,111 --> 00:58:00,210
this thing on 60 minutes just spoke 
about this addiction with uh,

1181
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,070
a computer thing with women.
That was it.

1182
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:03,903
That was really interesting,
but I know how it fucking creeps up on 

1183
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:09,514
you.
It's not a couple of years ago it's 

1184
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,250
called the slot machines.
The big gamble.

1185
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,770
Oh,
so it's just slot machines in general.

1186
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:17,650
These type of slot machines.
Computer ones,

1187
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:18,484
yes.
They have an effect on women in 

1188
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:21,310
particular.
Maybe.

1189
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,990
Man,
the fuck up ladies.

1190
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,930
How about that?
No dog.

1191
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,970
Here's my take on this whole gambling 
thing.

1192
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,920
Like you remember horse bedding in New 
York?

1193
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:32,280
Like you'd go to the horse,
you could go to the track better.

1194
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,010
Yeah,
it was right there.

1195
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,260
Right there.
They made that for a reason.

1196
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,680
I mean it just trying to make it legal.
This is legal.

1197
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,730
Come on.
It says legal.

1198
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,800
It's not legal.
It's to take a piece.

1199
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,960
Jerome,
they want that piece.

1200
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,630
Have you been to a medical marijuana 
store recently?

1201
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:47,231
No,
I haven't.

1202
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:48,180
Okay.
What are they like,

1203
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:53,250
if it's $60 your tab is now $76 cause 
the tax,

1204
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:54,244
it's $16 in taxes.
If you buy something for $60 the thing 

1205
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:58,774
about weed though is it goes so far I 
think about how much like $100 worth of 

1206
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,144
weed goes.
You could be on the moon for three days 

1207
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,280
for three days.
You could be on the moon with the proper

1208
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:15,430
edibles.
Get a $100 worth of the proper edibles.

1209
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:16,803
How much do you think you can handle?
How many jumbos do you think you can 

1210
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,820
handle?
Do you ever have a Jon Boat?

1211
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,160
Okay.
What do they have

1212
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,640
like just depends on I think a hundred 
to $200 yeah dude,

1213
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,560
I fucked up.
Need a half a jumbo.

1214
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:30,710
Once my,
I felt my cells,

1215
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:31,723
I felt all the cells in my bones.
I felt like were the tendons connected 

1216
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:36,644
on my spine?
Like it's like you could get fucking 

1217
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:44,240
blasted on and then the last 12 hours 
and then take the other half.

1218
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:47,450
That's another 12 hours for other taxes 
higher than Las Vegas.

1219
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:50,500
Jamie.
Then they aren't here for week 35% here.

1220
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,330
How much?
35 and what's in Vegas?

1221
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,313
It's high,
but it depends on if they chase the 

1222
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,570
motherfucking game dog like yes,
no more stars or death.

1223
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,160
That's so silly.
No more.

1224
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,110
Hello,
she's the Tkos.

1225
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,650
I bought the final fucking,
I got a the towel.

1226
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:07,783
I'm like Pablo Escobar.
I got a fucking cache of the ones I ate 

1227
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:12,440
this morning.
Those hello?

1228
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,150
The Tk hose.
Yeah.

1229
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,140
Yeah.
You can't find them.

1230
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:17,280
But I got to college.
I got the league.

1231
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:20,400
They become like Cuban cigars.
Oh my God.

1232
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:21,234
Like Cuban cigars now.
So some people are just going to keep 

1233
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,940
going.
There's no more.

1234
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,370
Like I told people,
there's no more stores,

1235
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:33,371
but they stars like people going fucking
bananas now.

1236
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:34,903
Cause now you guys,
you got to see the like I only go to w 

1237
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:42,131
two weeks doors,
but I go to one that's by the book and I

1238
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:44,360
go to war that they just said,
you know what?

1239
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,780
We're like steeping Mayo check.
We don't give a fuck.

1240
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,480
This is immigrant mentality.
We opened at six,

1241
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:51,314
we close at 10 we give away free bagels.
If you come at six o'clock and you got 

1242
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:57,330
to see it,
that rock rocking the road,

1243
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,350
they're going to sell those 200 
milligram stars.

1244
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,690
Tow people go down to fucking end.

1245
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,510
Wow.
Or the dea comes in and shuts him down.

1246
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,280
They don't give a fuck.
That's too,

1247
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,323
like if you're on Ventura Boulevard,
you gotta be really cool cause you're 

1248
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:11,774
done.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1249
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:15,410
with having a limit on the number of 
milligrams.

1250
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:17,420
If that's going to keep it legal,
it's in.

1251
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:18,254
That's also,
they just grow a lot of people that are 

1252
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,790
jumping at black pocket.
That's it.

1253
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,863
You know how much it cost.
You know how much it's gonna cost of 

1254
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:27,620
stars that that dude just stay open.
How much?

1255
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,360
A half a mil.
Oh my God.

1256
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,550
Because it's 70 grand just for the 
license.

1257
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:33,050
Cheap money.
They take that,

1258
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,070
they take that paper up in front,
that like led Zepplin.

1259
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:36,953
They're like Peter Grip and 1975 the 
economy's going to improve and they're 

1260
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:41,300
still gonna kill.
Oh No,

1261
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:44,060
no.
He's going to improve of when I tell you

1262
01:01:44,061 --> 01:01:44,894
what,
how much are they going to take right 

1263
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:46,740
off the target of the tape.

1264
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,573
Bang it.
They looked at Colorado's thing and 

1265
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:50,324
said,
listen,

1266
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,020
we'll cover that with steroids.
Were coming in with H,

1267
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:54,990
forget what they're doing.
Listen to,

1268
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:59,410
we're doing just to set shop now.
We don't care if you've been in business

1269
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:03,530
with nothing just to set up shop.
We got to get a piece of the actual okay

1270
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,540
fine.
If they just,

1271
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,613
they work deals out with banks and made 
it easy and acceptable for these guys 

1272
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,410
could put them,
but it's right.

1273
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,110
And a lot of places it wasn't,
they were dealing in cash.

1274
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,973
They hired,
especially in Colorado in the early 

1275
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,350
days,
they had a higher,

1276
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:21,990
a lot of like Spec ops guy.
I love saying in Spec ops like,

1277
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:24,450
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Just sounds cool.

1278
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:25,823
Um,
they would hire like former seals and 

1279
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:29,520
shit and then they would have to carry 
the,

1280
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,240
the,
uh,

1281
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,470
the money to the bank cause everybody 
knew there was like giant sums of cash.

1282
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,603
So it made it very dangerous.
They weren't allowing them to use banks 

1283
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,020
or credit cards,
rather,

1284
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,150
they weren't allowing them to,
you know,

1285
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,260
sell.
We would credit cards,

1286
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:47,650
but they selling weed and credit cards 
in a la medical in the 90.

1287
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,210
[inaudible] the hot store when you 
turned me on to my license,

1288
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,170
the hot store at the time,
which they're not there.

1289
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,073
Know that dude at the height of it was 
walking out of there everyday with 25 

1290
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:02,880
gram by himself and cool life.
Wow,

1291
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,410
that's dangerous.
He was a,

1292
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:05,244
but you know what,
he was just dumb as fuck when the dea 

1293
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:07,764
came in to have that cash in the safe 
right there that they just swooped on 

1294
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,050
it.
I knew a guy who got shot.

1295
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:14,243
He was a really nice guy and he used to 
work at the Inglewood wellness center 

1296
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,590
and a,
this was the early days of,

1297
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:22,440
um,
the medical legalization.

1298
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,260
It was like,
I want to say it's like somewhere around

1299
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,020
[inaudible] 99,
somewhere,

1300
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:29,790
somewhere in that range.
2099.

1301
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,043
And,
um,

1302
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,033
he apparently was coming out with a big 
bag of cash and someone shot him right 

1303
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:36,710
in the stomach,
took his money.

1304
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,060
They didn't take care of them.
So I took all the cash.

1305
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,380
There was nothing to hire people.
You had a higher piece.

1306
01:03:41,381 --> 01:03:42,870
You've got to hire people,
you know.

1307
01:03:42,871 --> 01:03:46,320
I see,
I see amateur mistakes.

1308
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:47,960
Yeah,
I saw this Jamie.

1309
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,660
I see amateur mistakes constantly.
For example,

1310
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,000
the store I'm talking about,
he lost.

1311
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:56,700
He lost everything.
Joe Rogan when you over,

1312
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,930
they will,
he lost everything.

1313
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:03,330
He would any weed he got.
This guy was an exotic guy himself.

1314
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,590
Like he was head when you're ahead,
you love when somebody brings you.

1315
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,040
So he bought as much as he could.
I love that expression I had.

1316
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,740
He was a head,
nobody uses that anymore.

1317
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,500
So what he would do is when you walked 
into this place,

1318
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:21,950
he would have 60 weeds on the wall and 
he kept all his weed on the property.

1319
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,080
When the feds came,
it was like stealing.

1320
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,030
He had everything there,
everything was there.

1321
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:30,864
One in the open.
You have to have an apartment and you 

1322
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:36,270
have to have an amount on the mouth.
Six ounces.

1323
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,583
It's all you should have one week.
If Jamie comes in and he wants eight 

1324
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:42,270
ounces,
give me 10 minutes.

1325
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:43,104
I got a pigeon that will bring it over 
here and 5 million right across the 

1326
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:46,980
street.
Then I got a little apartment,

1327
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:49,710
which a stash that you have a couple of 
saves.

1328
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,053
You have to,
if the cops ain't going to let you 

1329
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:54,300
deposit,
you've gotta be fucking creative.

1330
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,870
If you read all these guys' stories,
the hardest,

1331
01:04:57,871 --> 01:04:59,540
the Joe Rogan,
you ready for this expression?

1332
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,480
The hardest thing is what to do.
We'll call him dick about that problem.

1333
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:07,850
Joe Rowe in Syria.
Now.

1334
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,080
It's a real problem.
No,

1335
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,870
no.
Think about this room filled with her.

1336
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:12,930
Hello?
What was the movie?

1337
01:05:12,931 --> 01:05:13,711
I just went,
oh,

1338
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:14,521
it's tomorrow.
Oh,

1339
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:14,881
no,
no,

1340
01:05:14,881 --> 01:05:15,121
no,
no,

1341
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,710
no.
I just on a plane.

1342
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,010
You can,
when you're on a plane

1343
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,023
and Tom Cruise's on,
you've got to give them the benefit of 

1344
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:21,214
the doubt.
Oh,

1345
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,220
I've got another bullet in me.
I watched the barry seal thing.

1346
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,160
How was it?
It's not an academy award winner,

1347
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:31,180
but it's very interesting when we're 
just burying money.

1348
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:34,750
Joe Rogan,
4 million a shot like me and you are the

1349
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,593
yard like burying money,
like a suitcase with hundred dollar 

1350
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:43,150
bills falling out of it and you don't 
give a Frenchmans fucked.

1351
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,150
I always wanted to know this snopes,
this.

1352
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,450
Did Barry Seal die with George Bushes?
Phone number in his pocket.

1353
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,310
That's what they always said and he 
died.

1354
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,740
They shot him on the way to the trial.
What?

1355
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,690
George Bush,
his phone number in his pocket.

1356
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,010
Oh,
he was top notch.

1357
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:58,690
That guy.
He had it all.

1358
01:05:59,140 --> 01:05:59,973
He's seen it bro.
He took pictures of them loading a 

1359
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:08,291
fucking plane in Nicaragua with Escobar 
and the top eight and Nicaragua.

1360
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,870
They had him by the fucking balls.
No matter what.

1361
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:16,220
How you that took balls.
Fuck.

1362
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,180
They fucked him in the ass.
They told him that they wouldn't release

1363
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:21,430
the pictures.
Then they release the pictures,

1364
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:23,380
which was Douche and that's why they got
got shot.

1365
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,693
That's fucked up.
They should have taken him and hitting 

1366
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,550
him.
He Fuck is interesting though.

1367
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:28,384
They assassinated that guy.
That's a 100% assassination in 

1368
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:35,320
connection to some sort of illegal 
government.

1369
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,540
It was the fucking come up whether 
legal,

1370
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,000
what are you talking about?
That was escobar,

1371
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:42,340
that set the bird a message.
They had a deal.

1372
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:43,870
We're bearing can seals could land 
though,

1373
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:44,830
right?
Like it wasn't,

1374
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:46,750
part of the thing was with the people on
the ground,

1375
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,080
the ground that was in mean.
Here's the problem.

1376
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:55,190
This is where Eddie Bravo comes in.
They were landing in those everglades,

1377
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,350
no quote me on this.

1378
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,270
Right.
And he broke it down for me and somebody

1379
01:06:58,271 --> 01:06:58,981
else broke,
broken down,

1380
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:03,981
made it be honest with you.
And they were allowing that on your boys

1381
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,820
clock.
Clinton clock.

1382
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:06,830
That's,
that's,

1383
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,060
that's like theory,
the whole thing.

1384
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,690
That's what you always be.
His drops out,

1385
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,300
right about truth.
Because the truth is fascinating.

1386
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:16,660
The truth,
his two boys were murdered and uh,

1387
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,650
the,
uh,

1388
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:21,890
car near the official report they gave 
to the parents was a,

1389
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,250
that they had fallen asleep on the train
tracks.

1390
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,563
So a,
the parents pay for some sort of an 

1391
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:31,960
autopsy and it's revealed that the kid 
had been stabbed.

1392
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:36,961
And the one of them had been stabbed and
then they find out that around that same

1393
01:07:37,481 --> 01:07:42,220
area was where those guys would drop 
their drugs before they landed.

1394
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,010
They would parachute down their drugs,
they would,

1395
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,840
they would like and they would land.

1396
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,480
And these guys,
they had dropped points where they would

1397
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:50,314
put their shit and then someone else 
would come by and pick it up on the 

1398
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:52,684
ground.
You've got coordinators and these kids 

1399
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:57,340
apparently saw something they weren't 
supposed to see.

1400
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:59,680
So they fucking murdered these kids with
knives.

1401
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:00,514
And then the coroner was all in on it.
So they had to conduct some sort of 

1402
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,084
independent.
So that is what got this whole barry 

1403
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:07,174
seal's thing going.
It was this lady trying to figure out 

1404
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:11,740
this parents trying to figure out what 
happened to their kids.

1405
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,670
You know,
Joe wrote a fucking crazy story.

1406
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:16,160
You have to imagine,
okay that these

1407
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,950
guys were getting,
you know,

1408
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,800
let's just draw a number.
I,

1409
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,820
I mean I'm just an idiot,
but let's just draw a number.

1410
01:08:23,821 --> 01:08:27,740
And they were probably getting $4,000
per kilo.

1411
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,173
What would they put on those planes?
And there was sending five of those 

1412
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:36,680
planes over a day and dropping them in 
the Louisiana,

1413
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:38,340
and this is,
listen man,

1414
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,183
I told you a thousand times in the 
podcast and 83 they found the bear dead 

1415
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:47,570
next to a Duffel bag filled with cocaine
and aspen,

1416
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:48,404
Colorado in the mountains because they 
would drop into fucking coke in the 

1417
01:08:52,071 --> 01:08:54,280
mountain.
This is a very bad way.

1418
01:08:54,281 --> 01:08:56,170
The coke and he fucking old deed is 
hard.

1419
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,280
Oh,
what does it say?

1420
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:58,901
Oh,
okay.

1421
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,670
Barry Seal,
seal it.

1422
01:09:00,671 --> 01:09:01,504
Organize a sting operation where he 
managed to get photographs of Pablo 

1423
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:08,350
Escobar helping Nicaraguan soldiers to 
load 1200 kilos of cocaine onto a seat,

1424
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,480
but 23 male,
it's a plane.

1425
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,613
Soon afterwards,
Reagan went on television with the 

1426
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:15,970
photograph to denounce Sandinistas as 
drug smuggling,

1427
01:09:15,971 --> 01:09:16,760
corrupting

1428
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,593
duck duck bats,
how much he was getting for that 4 

1429
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:22,250
million,
800,000

1430
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,210
for one fucking low.
Now here's the tricky thing.

1431
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,433
Here's what,
here's what really pisses me the fuck 

1432
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:33,320
off that I see narcos and I see 
everything,

1433
01:09:33,321 --> 01:09:35,840
but now this is your uncle joey talking 
to you.

1434
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:36,674
Joe Rogan,
please show me the good side of Pablo 

1435
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:38,421
Escobar.
No,

1436
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:38,920
no,
no,

1437
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,401
I'm not gonna.
No,

1438
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:40,234
no.
There's no good side to Pablo Escobar 

1439
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:42,044
and the Saint Lee Harvey Weinstein.
This is a story that we have never 

1440
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:48,650
brought up,
but you have to assume.

1441
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,250
Okay,
you,

1442
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,283
you see all these shows and the whole 
fucking thing and they were in bed for 

1443
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:57,350
sure with Nicaragua.
Yeah.

1444
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,630
Who else is in bed with Nicaragua?

1445
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,793
Let me ask you this.
Do you think that it is the actual CIA 

1446
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:07,860
or is it people or if it,
when it was,

1447
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:10,260
let's not even say cia.
Dea.

1448
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,630
FBI named a bunch of fucking letters,
put them together.

1449
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,873
Is it the actual organization?
Whichever one it is that's bringing it 

1450
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:18,714
in,
are they complicit or are they're just 

1451
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:21,984
cowboys?
See the theory's always been that 

1452
01:10:23,671 --> 01:10:26,640
there's been these few cowboys corrupt 
guys.

1453
01:10:26,641 --> 01:10:30,930
Maybe they get too close to drug deals 
to crow close to the drug deal,

1454
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:32,830
and then sometimes they get seduced 
like,

1455
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:33,683
cause there's a many,
many stories of under oh under cover 

1456
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:35,844
cops getting seduced by the actual 
lifestyle of being a criminal young 

1457
01:10:38,371 --> 01:10:39,204
kids.
They probably did a little crime 

1458
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:40,284
themselves here or there.
They see some cops doing some dirty 

1459
01:10:42,211 --> 01:10:43,140
shit.
They see him.

1460
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:43,974
Some guy,
you know,

1461
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,580
there was a thing that came out about,
was it Baltimore?

1462
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:47,001
What?
What?

1463
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,440
What does the city where cops had came 
out and trial,

1464
01:10:49,441 --> 01:10:53,330
they'd kept toy guns on them to plant at
the scene of a,

1465
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:54,840
of a crime.
Like if they just

1466
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,083
shoots,
there's a fucking toy gun in the big 

1467
01:10:58,261 --> 01:10:59,094
picture,
the big world picture as an intelligent 

1468
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:04,380
individual as you are the plant.
It was planned in the sample.

1469
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:09,740
The CIA wanted a piece of their action 
and the dea was tricked into going down.

1470
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:14,790
That I really control a,
you can't be this,

1471
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,270
and I'm not saying you as an American,
you can't be this dump.

1472
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:19,143
So all the research that we've done,
all the research that we've done with 

1473
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:23,514
general north,
he was in on the package with barry 

1474
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:27,480
seal,
the whole fucking thing.

1475
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:30,860
And here's what it gets even deeper.
Let's talk about the deep disturb that,

1476
01:11:30,861 --> 01:11:34,380
that nobody ever even looked at.
And you have to think of,

1477
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:36,630
because I heard this story a thousand 
times,

1478
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,060
there was a guy by the name is Carlos 
laid that,

1479
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:39,900
that,
that,

1480
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,970
that he got crazy.
You know,

1481
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:45,410
they show him getting his dick sucked on
the radio and uh,

1482
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,600
Columbia and everything and all these TV
shows.

1483
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,433
No,
he was on an island snorting coke with 

1484
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:52,974
long hair,
talking like Jim Morrison and having 

1485
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,740
fucking threesomes and the fucking,
uh,

1486
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:03,790
their own cartel gave lay dare up to the
law.

1487
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:07,890
They are to keep them off their back.
It was five partners.

1488
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,870
It's me,
you,

1489
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:10,704
Jamie and red band,
but fucking red bands out there doing 

1490
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:17,630
videos of him snorting coke with a 
fucking pigeon on this head.

1491
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:18,863
We can't have this.
They gave the dea fucking Carlos that 

1492
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:25,170
comp like calm things down for a while 
when the,

1493
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:29,550
in 83 and 84,
when Reagan sent his troops down there,

1494
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,953
don't quote me on the dates here,
but I will tell you as a professional 

1495
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:36,300
cocaine sniffer,
what was going on,

1496
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,393
and 85,
the price of cocaine went skyrocketing 

1497
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,820
and it wasn't,
I'm sick and tie.

1498
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:46,560
It wasn't because of cocaine 
skyrocketing,

1499
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,990
it was because the cocaine was coming 
in.

1500
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:54,260
But the toughest part was getting the 
ether alcohol and to Colombia to process

1501
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:55,314
it.
The Colombians had got a tip that the 

1502
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:58,450
uh,
the,

1503
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,630
the troops were coming down to raid 
their jungles.

1504
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:04,920
Now what they had not told you in all 
these shows and research,

1505
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:09,330
but this is uncle joe is going to drop 
on you is what do you think they took?

1506
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,343
What other,
they took some labs to Nicaragua and 

1507
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:13,914
they shipped cocaine out of Nicaragua.
But guess who else partnered up with 

1508
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:21,270
them to your buddy fidel.
Fidel was shipping it in.

1509
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,133
Yeah,
he's going to be on the podcast and 

1510
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:27,420
three weeks I can you imagine having for
Dell I give you and Fidel,

1511
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:32,421
you told my God this whole block would 
have the snipers and fucking everybody.

1512
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,273
Fidel just walked in with a suit and you
had to teach them like a UFC move and 

1513
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:42,530
shit cause for Dell and come in and 
asked,

1514
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:47,601
you said you'll know getting the mixable
westgate tech cause they were anyway,

1515
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,800
but they weren't serious man.

1516
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,663
They went to very nervous in the 
presence of a guy like that lay dead 

1517
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:57,630
said in front of Congress that he was 
getting 800,000

1518
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:58,503
he was given Fidel 800,000
a shipload to come in under his flag at 

1519
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:04,464
the time.
She imagined being in the presence of a 

1520
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:06,594
Fidel Castro,
just being in his presence like if he 

1521
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:09,684
was,
you know,

1522
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,370
in his prime here in the room with him 
in his prime,

1523
01:14:12,371 --> 01:14:15,220
no one he how he ran cube.
We took it over.

1524
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,550
You have no idea.
Maybe he would be destroyed.

1525
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:20,230
This terrifying to be arrested Cuban 
American.

1526
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:22,990
You have to hate the guy.
I have to hate him,

1527
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:28,470
but as a man that thinks you have to see
what his path was crazy again,

1528
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,580
that's where my man,
Tj was,

1529
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:33,280
comes in with a van and knock toward the
Ha,

1530
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:38,310
the revolution for how he started at 
three different places at once.

1531
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,850
The revolution,
it just wasn't eight monkeys that put on

1532
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:44,800
gorilla suit and went to the mountains 
of Cuba.

1533
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,040
He came to Jersey first,
got arrested,

1534
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,740
went to Tampa,
I got arrested.

1535
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,180
He was already passing out flyers.
They always confuse Lee Harvey.

1536
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:55,870
I was,
well,

1537
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:56,703
no,
it wasn't Lee Harvey given out 

1538
01:14:57,841 --> 01:14:59,900
pamphlets.
It was Fidel Castro get with a helper.

1539
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,880
That's a joke.
Please don't quote it.

1540
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,760
The CIA.
It's a joke.

1541
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:04,690
I'm not ratting.
Yeah,

1542
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,600
Fidel Castro was in union city,
New Jersey.

1543
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,823
I can't tell you the dates,
but like I have my friend Colin to the 

1544
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:11,734
podcast and tell you the story about 
Fidel talking to his mother on a daily 

1545
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:17,620
when she would have waited to get on the
bus.

1546
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,370
She was an Irish girl in union city and 
she goes,

1547
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:25,200
I know Fidel in 19 fucking 52 and you 
need city.

1548
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,580
Just think of what he did to the 
Italians.

1549
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,540
He kicked everybody out.
It's like,

1550
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,920
fuck your casinos.
Mine now.

1551
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:35,500
It wasn't very brilliant movie started 
in the mountains.

1552
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,970
He fucking,
he,

1553
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:39,990
he,
you know,

1554
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:40,893
he just took over the little villages 
and then he changed their minds because 

1555
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:46,300
blood,
first of all,

1556
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,590
it wasn't an easy thing for to them to 
do.

1557
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:55,060
Battista was really fucking the country.
He had really divided the country.

1558
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,790
You have no idea what racism was.
Tow.

1559
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:58,624
You were in Cuban,
1955 black people weren't allowed in 

1560
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:03,700
casinos.
You have no idea.

1561
01:16:03,701 --> 01:16:06,270
These poor people today,
everybody's crying about,

1562
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,850
you have no idea what black rights were 
in Cuba for those black fucking people.

1563
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,490
They got no rights.
So those people were poor.

1564
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:17,410
That was such a high level of dot.
You see all these people dancing,

1565
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:20,740
but on the other side there was fucking 
famine,

1566
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:24,370
like people were fucking dying,
so they wanted a change.

1567
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,400
Fidel came in there as a hero.
First of all,

1568
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:28,863
he came in as Cuba was going to change,
but then he switched it on him and he 

1569
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,230
aligned but Russia and he became a 
communist.

1570
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,400
That's what made it worse.
That's what made it worse.

1571
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:43,090
Racism and hunger has always existed in 
Cuba.

1572
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:44,763
It did that.
That was the problem that they always 

1573
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:47,854
showed that party side of Cuba,
but that other side of the island is 

1574
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,450
probably,
there is people starving.

1575
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:55,000
Wow.
And Battista come on,

1576
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,990
but how do they keep up the tobacco 
production?

1577
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,610
That I don't know.
I don't know.

1578
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:03,430
I was still thinking of that Joey,
but now all of that,

1579
01:17:03,431 --> 01:17:04,264
they had the best cigars in the world,
but that people complaining now that 

1580
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,010
they're not the same cigars.
This is,

1581
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,010
some people are complaining,
but a lot of people

1582
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,843
getting frauds apparently.
Apparently when you buy Cuban cigars 

1583
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:13,754
from untrust and trustee people,
you could definitely get some fakes 

1584
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:19,640
because now they're talking about how 
the soil isn't rich.

1585
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:21,650
White people will go there as an expert.
Oh,

1586
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,530
Bobby Kelly.
Bobby Kelly's a real expert.

1587
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:28,100
Like he was on a Arusha fears podcast.
They were talking about cigars.

1588
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:31,370
Bobby Kelly really knows his shit like 
he was,

1589
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,233
he was going in depth about how many 
fake cigars there are and how he can 

1590
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:36,344
even kind of taste a fake cube.
And he smoked so many cigars and he 

1591
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,430
thought maybe one of ours was fake.
He's like,

1592
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:41,750
maybe it might be fake ninth deals.
No,

1593
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:43,440
I think this Israel,
I think this is like,

1594
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:46,100
it's like he's like that discerning 
about that shit.

1595
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,770
Huh?
There's a lot of weird freak.

1596
01:17:48,771 --> 01:17:52,010
So when it comes to cigars,
like people who are super into them,

1597
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:52,730
they get sued.

1598
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:53,563
They get you high as fuck too.
This is something that people aren't 

1599
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:57,560
talking about.
You smoke a cigar,

1600
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:59,300
you're like,
whew,

1601
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,310
that's,
there's so much nicotine in that.

1602
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,530
You had the Cuban coffee to it.
Oh my God.

1603
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:07,160
It's how the process is supposed to go 
down with the Cuban coffee.

1604
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:09,680
That's a win we do.
And you go deep,

1605
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:13,320
deep,
deep in the only needs a little taste of

1606
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,880
it that a bull and a half of Alpha brain
and you'll be there.

1607
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:21,520
You'll get the Jack Chappelle smokes it 
with uh,

1608
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,160
sometimes with cigarettes in it.
We did it the other night in the back of

1609
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:30,000
the comedy store with cigarette and 
tobacco and done a couple of times to,

1610
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,430
Yay.
Ooh,

1611
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,683
you get elevated.

1612
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,060
It was,
it was interesting.

1613
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,520
I got one time from San Francisco to 
Reno,

1614
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,833
one time from San Francisco to reno dog.
The cops were looking for me and San 

1615
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,100
Francisco and you go down to the,
any of those tourists districts and they

1616
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,050
have like a bus that'll take you to 
reno.

1617
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:48,884
So I just jumped on the bus to reno at 
this check and this is 1985 when we're 

1618
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,000
sitting in the bus and there's this 
Egyptian k,

1619
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:58,580
I'll never forget this and the back of 
it,

1620
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:00,110
you could smoke on the bus in those 
days.

1621
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:00,944
Cigarettes.
So he had rolled a blunt with hash and 

1622
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:12,350
tobacco when it got,
and I had never done that before guys.

1623
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:14,000
I'm not going to lie.
I had never even,

1624
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,730
I took two hits of that fucking thing.
Dog.

1625
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,850
I had a puke in that bathroom.
I got high as fuck.

1626
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,610
But that combination together,
that tobacco,

1627
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,020
this we'd hash.
He had the real,

1628
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,760
yeah,
that's too much.

1629
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:31,880
Rockwell Joey.
That's a bit much for Uncle Joey.

1630
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,200
The first time I ever smoked a spliff 
was with Charlie Murphy.

1631
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,260
Charlie Murphy rolled them is his cousin
Richard.

1632
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:41,270
We're on two.
Charlie could role,

1633
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,520
he would,
um,

1634
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,740
he would take a swisher sweets old 
school,

1635
01:19:45,741 --> 01:19:46,574
you know,
any kind of cigar paper and he would 

1636
01:19:48,411 --> 01:19:51,290
turn it into a joint with the cigar 
paper,

1637
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,630
which is like,
you inhale weed,

1638
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,450
you never really inhaled those cigars.
You,

1639
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:59,110
you could just kind of get them in your 
mouth and you taste it.

1640
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,880
Then you blow it out.
But when you take a drag a weed,

1641
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,550
you open your lungs up and fill your 
lungs with the smoke.

1642
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:06,410
Cigar.
Smokes too harsh for that.

1643
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,120
You don't,
you don't smoke

1644
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,720
like that for the most part.
Most people don't.

1645
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:12,570
But when you do it with pot,
you do.

1646
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:13,703
So you get this career easy blast of 
nicotine and the carets e blast a weed 

1647
01:20:17,971 --> 01:20:19,530
and you're like,
wow,

1648
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,950
it's very different than just weed.
I think I smoked.

1649
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,340
Yeah.
Last night on the podcast,

1650
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:26,870
I took two hits off in front of mine,
gave me one of those.

1651
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,130
I like those.
And it was pretty fucking scared.

1652
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,650
I'm scared of us.
I'm scared of my life.

1653
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:34,110
The ones with the cigarettes in them,
I'm scared.

1654
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:35,750
No,
no,

1655
01:20:35,751 --> 01:20:36,130
no,
no.

1656
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:37,080
I don't want no smoke.
No,

1657
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,430
no.
I'm not talking to cigarettes.

1658
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:41,490
But the ones with cigarettes and um,
it's an interesting little high.

1659
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:42,631
It's like,
Ooh,

1660
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:44,700
this is a new door to the room.
It's a,

1661
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:47,040
it's interesting.
That's what like smoking.

1662
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,083
One of the hardest things I ever gave up
with smoking cigarettes after you smoke 

1663
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:52,670
a joint,
right?

1664
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,053
That is just pure brilliance.
When you hit a fucking joy and you'd 

1665
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:05,460
take a little sip of coffee and after 
you smoke that through to you light up a

1666
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:09,800
Marlboro some life.
It's life fucking changing bro.

1667
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,170
I know a lot of people love him after a 
real good meal.

1668
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:13,621
Well,
the whole,

1669
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:16,260
it's the whole package.
So I was like,

1670
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:17,970
God,
let me ask you a meal.

1671
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:18,923
I meal a joint and then the cigarette 
and then another cigarette and a cup of 

1672
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:26,820
coffee on top of that.
Some dessert said another second.

1673
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:28,440
Right.
You have no fucking idea.

1674
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,440
Cigarette scare the shit out of him.
I'm pleased.

1675
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,850
[inaudible] body,
I can't smoke them.

1676
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:33,684
My Tony's hooked.
My blood pressure would be 2000 over 80 

1677
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,440
Tony says he can quit it anytime.
A little fella.

1678
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,270
And you know what?
What was the best one on one?

1679
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:48,370
What I realized was two years ago I shot
something and I smoked that night.

1680
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,310
I asked one of the camera guys,
let me fucking get me a cigarette.

1681
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,633
And that next morning was when I 
realized how really fucking bad day are 

1682
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,120
you felt terrible.
Oh,

1683
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:02,040
how many of you have one to two 
cigarettes to Marlboro Lights?

1684
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:05,790
And I was fine that night.
I did a comedy club and I was like,

1685
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:07,250
what the fuck is going on?
And we all,

1686
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:09,900
and I don't want to smoke the fuck.
No,

1687
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:10,734
no,
I'd never do it again after that night 

1688
01:22:12,031 --> 01:22:13,560
in Chicago.
I'll never do it again.

1689
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,720
I took one of Tony's ones before it 
show.

1690
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,810
Interesting cigarettes or interesting.
It doesn't,

1691
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:20,090
it does a weird little thing to your 
breasts.

1692
01:22:20,091 --> 01:22:20,924
It does.
And that's one of the reasons why I did 

1693
01:22:21,991 --> 01:22:25,310
this because I read something about a 
nootropics are talking about um,

1694
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,870
different vitamin,
like what's good for brain function.

1695
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,850
And one of the things they said that 
nicotine,

1696
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:30,684
nicotine is actually a nootropic and 
that they found that some people under 

1697
01:22:34,801 --> 01:22:37,440
the use of tobacco with the use of 
tobacco,

1698
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:38,653
they achieve like a,
an elevated state of like certain 

1699
01:22:42,931 --> 01:22:44,130
functions of the brain.

1700
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,460
Like it actually has some sort of a 
small measurable effect.

1701
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,920
So it really does stimulate the way your
brain works.

1702
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,330
I don't see,
for me it's different.

1703
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,980
I have to,
it's a combination.

1704
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,510
Yeah.
That's for me.

1705
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,370
Like I,
I don't,

1706
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:59,100
I wouldn't just enjoy right now you can 
say goodbye itself,

1707
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,280
but the cigarette with the weed,
but if that coffee was brewing hot right

1708
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:03,114
now and it was maybe 60 degrees outside 
with a little bit of wind and sunlight 

1709
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,353
will,
you know when you stand out in the sun 

1710
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:11,134
you'll warm,
but when you're in the breeze your 

1711
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,680
little cool.
You go outside and a good join us,

1712
01:23:15,681 --> 01:23:16,514
some fucking tremendous reef with the 
sun hitting your face and you're taking 

1713
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:24,160
a nice hit of a cigarette all combined 
or even,

1714
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,350
or even like,
I like what I do,

1715
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,503
I took a cup of coffee,
I'll pop a fucking number and then a 

1716
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:32,470
little nicotine gum to give you a little
gods,

1717
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:33,613
some blood prior to him.
One blood pressure medication on top of 

1718
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:39,110
that all together,
it all works out.

1719
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:40,003
You know what I'm saying?
If you take them apart and nothing 

1720
01:23:41,531 --> 01:23:42,820
really happens,
I get it.

1721
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,160
But together,
that's where you put them a fungo in.

1722
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,403
For me,
it's a small shot of Jack Daniels and 

1723
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:53,470
one to two hits of a joint before 
comics.

1724
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:59,050
Just a little tap to taste.
Just a little yikes.

1725
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:04,030
One Hand has really preferred.
It's a smart move.

1726
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,430
Two inches.
If you're feeling I did it.

1727
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:11,170
I did the Tequila the night w three 
points.

1728
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:12,280
Not Bad.
Oh,

1729
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:13,450
well the weight watchers.
Yeah,

1730
01:24:13,451 --> 01:24:14,720
but how long are you doing the weight 
watchers?

1731
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:18,280
How long it,
I started December 9th I went from three

1732
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:20,680
Oh nine to two 96 old.
Excellent.

1733
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,700
But you know what,
Bro?

1734
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,670
Here's the stupid thing.
Joe Rogan.

1735
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:27,270
Here's the dumbest thing in the world.
I got sick and tired of people saying,

1736
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,104
I cleaned that diet was,
you don't know Dick until you go to 

1737
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:32,410
weightwatchers.
Listen,

1738
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:33,310
you want me to tell you what the new 
way,

1739
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:34,810
once this is your rent,
it's different.

1740
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,800
It's Mike though.
Check.

1741
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,053
Ah,
okay.

1742
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:39,550
So the chicken nutrition's chicken 
breasts,

1743
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,550
chicken breasts.
I come to your house tonight and you go,

1744
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:43,384

1745
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:45,190
breasts?

1746
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,023
Just the marination.
I got to watch how your marinated who 

1747
01:24:48,311 --> 01:24:50,770

all types.
Zero.

01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,650
Corn,

1751
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:59,740
Uh,
what costs money or what costs points?

1752
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,450
Beef.
Beef,

1753
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,320
beef does 19 for Preston puts his over.
No,

1754
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:05,651

01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:05,981

But if you look at it,

1758
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,600
bro,
check this out.

1759
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:15,430
You know you do a Jujitsu during 30 
minutes and 16 fucking buoyant.

1760
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,070
They fit it in.
You get your exercise,

1761
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,060
you add points.
See,

1762
01:25:19,061 --> 01:25:21,230
I tried thinking about it.
I'm going to wait a second guy.

1763
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,500
Smart.
Wait a second guys.

1764
01:25:22,501 --> 01:25:25,810
I kind of bounce them swinging bats.
I'm hitting the bag.

1765
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,180
I'm walking around the park.
I'm still gaining weight.

1766
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,720
Something's not right.
So it's the like the butter.

1767
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:35,800
I don't use bothering them.
I could eat my piece of wheat toast with

1768
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:36,910
my eggs.
Oh,

1769
01:25:36,911 --> 01:25:38,470
you ready for this?
Are off the other way.

1770
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,333
Ready for this rock.
Throwing away the toast and just eating 

1771
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:42,400
the butter.
I don't like,

1772
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:43,920
I gotta have my thoughts wrong.
Yeah,

1773
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,550
but eat the butter butter's good for 
you.

1774
01:25:45,551 --> 01:25:47,900
Especially if it's grants thing.
I get that.

1775
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,700
Yo.
Hey Yo,

1776
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,750
no egg whites.
I cut around them.

1777
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,520
You had a bit about that.
None of those.

1778
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:55,443
There's a a thing in the news yesterday 
where they were saying that people only 

1779
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:00,520
eating egg whites is a tremendous 
health,

1780
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:01,950
uh,
deserve site.

1781
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,980
Listen,
five years ago

1782
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,070
it don't take a fucking moron.
The time,

1783
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:09,710
20 years ago,
nobody was getting concussions.

1784
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:13,300
Nobody was getting soft.
Nobody was getting their feelings hurt.

1785
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,153
This specialty men,
all of a sudden I saw people started 

1786
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:17,954
eating egg whites and I saw big rise and
people having a hard time getting their 

1787
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:22,424
wives pregnant.
All of a sudden I saw commercials about 

1788
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:29,960
erectile dysfunction.
Men never talked about having men talked

1789
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:30,794
about bug.
I did some bloaty at night and I didn't 

1790
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:35,720
get my dick hard.
Now all of a sudden there's a commercial

1791
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,673
on national TV primetime,
some fucking guy saying that and 

1792
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:41,834
awesome.
They started dropping that low 

1793
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,350
testosterone shit and I'm telling you 
dog,

1794
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:50,270
one thing about Uncle Joey,
I've always loved egg yolks.

1795
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,730
I don't like,
I don't even like mixing them.

1796
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:56,540
I think it's bad for real.
I don't even like scrambled eggs.

1797
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:57,374
I'll eat them if you make them,
if you make them nice to me with a 

1798
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:02,490
little sour cream and a little milk and 
do it and run it.

1799
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,450
I like it,
but I don't like just prison.

1800
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:07,850
I got to see the Yolk.
I got a rule.

1801
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:10,040
When you take me for breakfast,
I always got to see the yolk,

1802
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,850
so I cut around it.
The other day,

1803
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:13,730
the awaits.
You set them.

1804
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:17,810
You've been coming here for a long time.
You do not touch the white and she goes,

1805
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:18,644
I mean you do not touch it.
I have become like a surgeon with that 

1806
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:25,280
knife.
I get the yolk perfectly.

1807
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:30,080
I take that wheat toast now I don't even
eat the whole two slices of wheat.

1808
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:30,914
Those I only eat a half a wheat toast.
I take one egg yolk and put it on one 

1809
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:35,534
side and I eat the whole thing.
Like Robert Deniro eight the fucking ag 

1810
01:27:39,881 --> 01:27:42,980
and and Angel Heart.
When he wanted to scam Mickey Rourke,

1811
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:43,870
he just,
hey,

1812
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:44,703
that's how I do it.
I put a piece of bacon in my mouth and 

1813
01:27:47,531 --> 01:27:49,160
then I'd take the other piece of wheat 
toast,

1814
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,660
put the egg yolk on that.

1815
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,450
I take the other piece of banking and 
they ate my fruit and that's fucking it.

1816
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,750
That's beautiful.
I got ap Egg Yolk,

1817
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:59,120
the egg yolk,
and as you can eat three egg yolks,

1818
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:02,960
but you could also scramble for eggs,
getting a Tortilla,

1819
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:03,794
put black beans in it and the salsa.
All that costs you is the fucking 

1820
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:07,574
Tortilla dog.
Why four points where you can have a 

1821
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:12,434
full fucking point breakfast.
I need a bowl of fruit and get brand 

1822
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:16,880
fucking new dog.
It's amazing.

1823
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:20,360
That's a great scene.
A great download is creepy fingernails.

1824
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,313
Remember you bro.
You much a mother for these two guys 

1825
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:26,330
were such motherfuckers.
It's so funny.

1826
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:26,961
Oh,
from Brooke.

1827
01:28:26,961 --> 01:28:29,540
How crazy.
I don't believe in that Mumbo jumbo.

1828
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,560
I mean the top these guys where the 
basketball,

1829
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:33,463
he just told you believe that the ag is 
the symbol of the soul and some 

1830
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,630
religions looking.
You see how skin,

1831
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:42,530
I don't know,
but this face when he's eating that ag,

1832
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,120
show me.
Show me that again.

1833
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:48,680
That's a brief looking at Mickey.
Rourke's raised handsome fella.

1834
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,350
Yeah,
but poor fucking Mecca.

1835
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:53,150
Look at his face.
Not exaggerated.

1836
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,440
That's the devil.
That's about as good as a human being is

1837
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:02,100
ever going to an impression of what

1838
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,960
the devil would look like if he's a 
human being.

1839
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:04,890
Seriously,
yeah.

1840
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:09,890
He wouldn't be free.
Who else played the devil by J.

1841
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:12,820
Dot.
O when he would do those crazy devo red,

1842
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,160
remember it was all that.
Every movie had to have a rant.

1843
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:21,090
I'm fucking tired.

1844
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:22,853
Right?

1845
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:26,690
He went through a whole period of time.
Whereas brands are so powerful.

1846
01:29:26,691 --> 01:29:27,740
They're like,
how al l,

1847
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,930
here's what we're going to put the ramp 
right here like right.

1848
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:36,130
His rants were fucking phenomenal.
I mean how Pachino is scar face,

1849
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,800
right?
I mean,

1850
01:29:39,801 --> 01:29:40,634
who has,
who has more epic screaming rants in 

1851
01:29:43,401 --> 01:29:46,070
film history then Al,
but Chino?

1852
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,963
I'd say zero,
but I'll tell you something else about 

1853
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:49,100
Al Pachino.
Look at them.

1854
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,390
Nobody's had a bitch is hard.
Everyone one on tv on Pachino.

1855
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:57,410
He smacked her sister in scar face.
At least smack that chicken.

1856
01:29:57,411 --> 01:29:59,510
The Godfather when she told him she had 
an abortion.

1857
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,390
Yeah.
Like relax.

1858
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,900
Yeah.
He really had a blast.

1859
01:30:02,901 --> 01:30:04,580
Him Dude.
It looks scary.

1860
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,530
Like he looks like he hit her.
I give,

1861
01:30:06,531 --> 01:30:08,930
it looks like if you an actress and you 
never got hit like that before,

1862
01:30:08,931 --> 01:30:10,400
you'd be like,
oh my God.

1863
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:14,510
Steve McQueen and Allie McGraw real.
That was real.

1864
01:30:14,511 --> 01:30:15,344
It was real.
It wasn't even supposed to be in the 

1865
01:30:15,741 --> 01:30:17,810
seat right smack the just out of 
principle.

1866
01:30:17,811 --> 01:30:18,980
Have you ever seen that?
Seen Jamie?

1867
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,900
Oh,
we showed it before show before.

1868
01:30:20,901 --> 01:30:22,290
It was just so repetitive.
No,

1869
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:22,521
no,
no,

1870
01:30:22,521 --> 01:30:23,510
no.
That's sweet folks.

1871
01:30:23,511 --> 01:30:25,010
That's what you get.
You get the fun stuff,

1872
01:30:25,011 --> 01:30:25,844
but you also get,
who else memory about a thousand deals 

1873
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:30,380
now said Dale is,
I also heard that fucking,

1874
01:30:30,381 --> 01:30:32,750
did they role play the Dracula?
Oh yeah,

1875
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,020
that,
oh no,

1876
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:34,850
no.
Gary,

1877
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:36,210
Gary Oldman.
Sorry.

1878
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:36,861
No,
but didn't,

1879
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:39,020
didn't near a play the Dracula in 
something?

1880
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:39,883
No.
It Prank Frankenstein Deniro played 

1881
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:42,770
Frankenstein ones.
What does he to be good?

1882
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:43,883
I was terrible movie.
It was one of those ones where you're 

1883
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:47,661
like,
wait,

1884
01:30:47,661 --> 01:30:49,520
what?
It was weird actually.

1885
01:30:49,521 --> 01:30:51,350
He was pretty good as a,
as a monster though.

1886
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:53,380
He's there.
All the actors that played the devil for

1887
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:56,360
movies.
What was Kaiser?

1888
01:30:56,361 --> 01:30:57,740
So say he wasn't the devil,
right?

1889
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,550
Yeah.
Waze.

1890
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:02,110
Sure.
Wow.

1891
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,280
A lot of people.
Jennifer Love Hewitt played the devil.

1892
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,490
Jesus Christ.
John Ritter plead the devil.

1893
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,760
John Ritter did a a couple episodes and 
news radio.

1894
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,050
Look at that.
At least one.

1895
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:12,661
Hold on.
Hold on.

1896
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:14,210
We'll look at Vincent Price,
Bro.

1897
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:18,920
Vincent Price.
Who was fucking just amazing.

1898
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:22,280
He really was.
But some of those movies,

1899
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:25,070
he did like two movies that really 
scared the shit out of me.

1900
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,020
Yeah.
What?

1901
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:31,670
What did he do?
Which movies did he do that was to,

1902
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,193
I'm trying to remember.
There was a lot of like really fun 

1903
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:38,150
movies back then that if you watch 
today,

1904
01:31:38,151 --> 01:31:39,260
you're like,
what the fuck?

1905
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,130
He was definitely a Batman.
Right?

1906
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:42,860
What was he on?
Batman?

1907
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,200
Um,
house on haunted hill.

1908
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:46,340
There's,
there's his thing,

1909
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:50,600
house of wax that was a big one.
House of wax was a big one.

1910
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:55,910
The last man on earth.
He was always,

1911
01:31:56,590 --> 01:32:00,220
it was like thought of,
is that like real good creepy actor

1912
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,030
guy?

1913
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,480
Okay.

1914
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,160
Who's good in scary movies?

1915
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:04,670
Okay.

1916
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:07,380
What's his imd be?
I wonder if he was a bad,

1917
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:08,340
bad.
Yeah.

1918
01:32:08,341 --> 01:32:09,120
Yeah,
it was.

1919
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:09,953
If he was in Vincent Price,
he was in and [inaudible] funny how a 

1920
01:32:12,951 --> 01:32:16,700
guy gets like synonymous with a genre.
Movies like Vincent Price.

1921
01:32:16,701 --> 01:32:18,800
You think of it all scary movies.
You know,

1922
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:21,020
there's a few guys like that.
You think of their name.

1923
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:22,010
Oh,
scary movie.

1924
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,710
You Know John Romero,
scary movie.

1925
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:26,240
You know dawn of the dead.

1926
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,583
Okay.

1927
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,663
That's filled.

1928
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:30,900
Okay.

1929
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,220
Low TV on.
That's his name,

1930
01:32:32,221 --> 01:32:33,180
right?
John Romero.

1931
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,170
John Romero did what?
George Romero.

1932
01:32:37,171 --> 01:32:42,171
John Romero is a guy who was a game 
developer and the early days of a doom,

1933
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:48,000
he was with id software like doom and 
quake and those kinds of games.

1934
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:48,893
No,
George Romero was to guide that on 

1935
01:32:51,661 --> 01:32:52,494
paper.
Officially started this whole Zombie 

1936
01:32:53,971 --> 01:32:56,460
fucking shit much,
right when we were kids,

1937
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:57,993
the dead and the other one dog,
he has what's seen in one of those that 

1938
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:03,724
had to be 1975 I was maybe 12 years old,
maybe 13 one of those came out and we 

1939
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,800
took a hit of acid and we all went to 
the movie theater on a Saturday.

1940
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:16,380
Take the number one bus,
Jersey City,

1941
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:20,820
and they would play two of these movies.
Dollar Dan and something else,

1942
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,713
right of the living dead or something.
Fucking that night of the living dead 

1943
01:33:25,081 --> 01:33:25,914
was the first one.
There's one scene where the black guy's 

1944
01:33:27,781 --> 01:33:30,120
goal for the helicopter,
they just chops his head off.

1945
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,183
Jesus fucking Christ.
I run out of the movies was scare the 

1946
01:33:35,911 --> 01:33:38,520
living shit.
I Dunno how many times I took the number

1947
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:42,360
one bus to go to Jersey City,
the Journal Square.

1948
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:43,643
There was a movie theater dog.
That's why I saw Richard Pryor live at 

1949
01:33:46,591 --> 01:33:50,520
the sunset strip the first time on a 
Friday night I got stabbed.

1950
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:53,670
That's so nice.
You got stabbed.

1951
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:55,230
He's got caught.
I still got the scar.

1952
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:58,020
That's where I saw the pink panther 
movies.

1953
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,153
That was my first John.
And to getting high and go into the 

1954
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:03,414
movies.
Like I knew I couldn't go to the movies 

1955
01:34:05,281 --> 01:34:06,114
and Wartburg and he didn't city cause 
I'd bumped into one of my mother's 

1956
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:09,714
friends or something.
So me and my little goombas figured out 

1957
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:15,420
if we went to Jersey City,
we could get on the bus,

1958
01:34:15,421 --> 01:34:18,090
cause little drama,
get the six pack,

1959
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:18,924
split it four ways and smoke a joint and
go into those movies and Giggle and act 

1960
01:34:22,501 --> 01:34:25,530
like I'm an asshole.
We also went down to the sea,

1961
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:26,663
the Groove Tube and Kentucky Fried and 
Movie Kentucky fried movie was a genre 

1962
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,153
that stone for Saturday night live.
And there was a movie put together by a 

1963
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:42,930
bunch of sketches,
but one of the famous sketches is the in

1964
01:34:42,931 --> 01:34:47,931
a court room and uh,
and there's a gorilla fucking people up.

1965
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:49,613
Yeah.
They would just say different stupid 

1966
01:34:50,971 --> 01:34:53,640
things and the fucking guy go,
yeah,

1967
01:34:53,641 --> 01:34:54,474
that was loony.
They Teddy's fucking do this movie 

1968
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:58,370
today.

1969
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,090
You too,
by the way.

1970
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:01,140
This was on hbo where we were killing 
me.

1971
01:35:01,141 --> 01:35:01,974
All right,
Jamie.

1972
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:03,231
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1973
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:04,064
This is on Hbo.
So you had a talk to your mother and to 

1974
01:35:06,241 --> 01:35:07,074
get an HPO because groove tube or 
Kentucky fried movie was going to be on 

1975
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,600
and they were hilarious.
Could never have this movie.

1976
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,631
Yes,
she's good.

1977
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:15,980
And gang triggers.
Yes you could.

1978
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:17,323
You could do this move.
They don't have the balls to do this 

1979
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:22,520
movie tonight.
Girls are getting pie and look at this.

1980
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:24,530
Look at this.
Look at this shit.

1981
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,720
This is crazy.
You can never do this in movie today.

1982
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:28,640
And a regular movie,
they would never allow that.

1983
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:29,493
Catholic high school girls in trouble 
and the guys banging the girl on the 

1984
01:35:31,611 --> 01:35:33,590
shower and you see her tits pressing up 
against the glass,

1985
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:36,950
like legitimately see everything.
American pie was not,

1986
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,830
I mean it's not a sketch thing,
but it wasn't too far different.

1987
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,450
No,
but even American pie.

1988
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:44,420
I think you'd struggle to do that now.
I think the climate shifts,

1989
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,620
no,
no,

1990
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:49,230
we're just still a part of America loves
this type of humor.

1991
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,383
Joe Rogan no know that trying to,
they took f1 grid girls out of Formula 

1992
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:55,544
One racing the grid girls like hot wing.
They took them out and now they're 

1993
01:35:59,241 --> 01:36:04,070
petitioning to take octagon girls out 
and ring card girls.

1994
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,140
They're saying like,
we need to stop this like,

1995
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,400
and they're like,
what are you talking about?

1996
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,560
It's how we make a living stupid.
Like what?

1997
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,770
Woo Hoo.
It's the objectification of women.

1998
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:17,330
I think if you can have chippendales and
you can have,

1999
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:21,200
I think you should ever end card boys 
see who gets hired.

2000
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,323
Joey,
what happened?

2001
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:27,320
Just cause people are crazy people,
you know.

2002
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:28,091
Do your mind,
you,

2003
01:36:28,091 --> 01:36:31,100
you made a point the other day with 
those two young men that,

2004
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,590
uh,
I don't want to quote you.

2005
01:36:34,591 --> 01:36:35,424
You said something about that as a,
somebody got mad at people with a 

2006
01:36:38,581 --> 01:36:39,570
vagina,
hats

2007
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:40,923
black,
which I was transgender charters were 

2008
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:45,903
mad because it represents the woman's 
march and not everyone who was a woman 

2009
01:36:49,091 --> 01:36:51,640
has a vagina that was there.
There were upset.

2010
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,470
It's transport.
Holy Fuck

2011
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:54,850
of it.
As much as an American,

2012
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:56,410
as you will hold.
I'm fucking done.

2013
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,840
I'm done.
I'm done.

2014
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:01,180
I don't know what else to do.
I mean,

2015
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:03,850
three months ago,
uh,

2016
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,713
the fucking,
some guy came out with a brilliant 

2017
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:06,904
movie,
Stephen King that scan everybody that 

2018
01:37:08,351 --> 01:37:11,170
did not,
it wasn't number one film about a clown.

2019
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:13,810
Yeah.
And all of a sudden there was a parade.

2020
01:37:13,811 --> 01:37:14,740
You know,
they got together.

2021
01:37:14,741 --> 01:37:19,741
Clowns marched in protection of clowns 
because ever since that movie came out,

2022
01:37:20,441 --> 01:37:23,100
a bunch of clowns lost that job.
Oh my God.

2023
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,480
In the spring,
they were booked for the fall.

2024
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,190
So they belong.
You know,

2025
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:31,300
we'll get into something now that's just
totally out of control.

2026
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:35,650
I read the Amy Schumer thing with the on
Xeon Zari,

2027
01:37:35,651 --> 01:37:36,670
I read,
uh,

2028
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:40,330
you know,
you try to not avoid everything,

2029
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:42,100
but it's right in front of you.
You know,

2030
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:44,990
every day there's something else,
you know,

2031
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:48,290
he just waiting for the fucking shoe to 
drop every day.

2032
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,350
I am going to continue to be who I am,
John Rowe and on stage.

2033
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:57,210
I don't really give a fuck sensitive.
I can't.

2034
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,680
I'm a stand up.
I can't,

2035
01:37:58,681 --> 01:38:00,810
I don't have time.
I think about it.

2036
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:01,813
I would.
I also watched the podcast of you with 

2037
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:10,401
Brendan and Brian and you talked about 
something that didn't happen to no,

2038
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:11,424
no.
It did happen to me where I was at a a 

2039
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:18,231
child children's school at a fair and a,
and I tried to turn it into a bit.

2040
01:38:19,051 --> 01:38:19,884
I just couldn't sell it to be funny.
Kid was playing in front of me and I 

2041
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,270
could tell there was something not right
with the child.

2042
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,890
And some of the child called him a 
faggot and the kid's mother came out.

2043
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,000
She goes,
he's not a fact that he's a transgender.

2044
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,120
And then the mother came up to me,
I'm high as fuck.

2045
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,580
How old were you?
Two.

2046
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,890
This is three months ago.
Okay,

2047
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:44,640
this is three months ago at a park.
You know before you go to those events,

2048
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:48,480
you get tuned up and you put [inaudible]
in your eyes and you go down and you try

2049
01:38:48,481 --> 01:38:49,314
to be as nice as you can as a parent,
but you tried to avoid talking to a lot 

2050
01:38:52,231 --> 01:38:54,480
of people.
Your wife does all the talking.

2051
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,730
You just sit there and wave the people I
and why?

2052
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,630
Who Do you think's in the wouldn't 
Machida.

2053
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,290
Yeah,
Machida and you're just,

2054
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,150
you're just watching the girls.
You know what I'm saying?

2055
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:06,060
You try to do that,
but there's always something that,

2056
01:39:06,061 --> 01:39:09,540
those events that you get back in the 
car with your wife and go,

2057
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:12,660
Mrs Rogan,
what the fuck was that about?

2058
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:14,470
And then they'll break it down for you,
Tami,

2059
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:16,710
I'm lying to you at every fucking thing.

2060
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,543
It's like you,
you were talking about the people 

2061
01:39:18,571 --> 01:39:20,910
believe in the earth that there was no 
Adam and eve.

2062
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:25,050
That's what I'm striving to.
When you were telling that bit.

2063
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,660
I didn't know what the fuck he would 
talk about.

2064
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:27,800
I go,
who does he hang out with?

2065
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,900
This is what's,
yeah,

2066
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:33,840
with this poor bastard.
But now that I have a child that's five,

2067
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:37,170
I'm getting up to see different people's
views that are my age.

2068
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:41,820
And this lady came up to me and gave me 
a whole here beat how the kid is 15 they

2069
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:46,821
have my medication and he's known he was
a woman since he was nine and that,

2070
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:52,320
uh,
but then she fucked up Joe Rogan.

2071
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:54,060
She said she always wanted a girl 
anyway,

2072
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:57,420
knowing Jesus.
But you guys are talking about something

2073
01:39:57,421 --> 01:40:00,600
about there was of somebody or they've 
got in trouble for a three year old,

2074
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:03,120
give them block and see,
I don't want nothing about that world.

2075
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,370
I know nothing.
Oh,

2076
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:05,760
and Benjamin,
you've got in trouble.

2077
01:40:05,761 --> 01:40:09,240
Get fired from his agency.
They dropped him because he was tweeting

2078
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:12,480
a bunch of shit about someone using 
hormone blockers on a three year old.

2079
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,220
He's like,
this is crazy.

2080
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,100
What I listened to that day and where I 
live.

2081
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:21,810
I thought my head was gonna blow up and 
her when she came over and explained why

2082
01:40:21,811 --> 01:40:23,190
he was going to be a trend again.
Well,

2083
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,510
here's the thing.
Here's my thing.

2084
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:28,410
Here's my thing.
If kids behaving a certain way,

2085
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:29,903
let him keep behaving that way you don't
have to fucking throw hormones in the 

2086
01:40:32,521 --> 01:40:33,354
mix.
You don't even know what's going to 

2087
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:36,390
happen when you do that.
You're going to change who he is.

2088
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,433
So you're telling me that he has this 
urge to take hormones that are not 

2089
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:42,960
native in his body and the same amounts.
He's this urge to do this,

2090
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,520
so we should just let them do it.
No,

2091
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:47,700
he has an urge to be identified as a 
woman.

2092
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:51,030
Like you don't even have to do anything 
to do that.

2093
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:53,500
If you just decide you identify as a 
woman,

2094
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,540
most people are going to be cool with 
it.

2095
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,553
Like we're saying that a child has to 
take some chemicals in the middle of 

2096
01:41:00,341 --> 01:41:02,620
their developmental cycle.
This is the only way we can do this.

2097
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,513
This is the smart way.
This is a smart way when they're six or 

2098
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:08,230
16 or whatever it is.
That's crazy.

2099
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,050
That doesn't make sense.
From a developmental standpoint,

2100
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:15,100
like I'm not a scientist,
but I understand enough about the stages

2101
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:15,934
that the human being goes through before
it reaches adulthood and you're not 

2102
01:41:18,881 --> 01:41:19,714
really completely formed until you're 
like 20 years old or 25 years old or 

2103
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:25,720
something like that.
It's like the frontal Cortex does inform

2104
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:28,390
to your 25 so your decision making is 
always a little weird.

2105
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,710
So you don't have $12 what the fuck they
want to be at Fifth Katelyn?

2106
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:36,490
16 six or a three though.
She said that he knew it done.

2107
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:39,190
Come on and I went home.
I told my wife,

2108
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:41,200
my wife said,
well you got to watch a show or be week.

2109
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,650
Are they eight is a show about kids that
want to,

2110
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:46,960
you know,
make the child listen.

2111
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,510
It doesn't matter.
It's just that I'm trying to,

2112
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,940
I'm trying to tell you that I'm finding 
out about shit now though.

2113
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,221
But you know,
it's weird.

2114
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:58,000
It's like why?
Why does if someone feels a certain way,

2115
01:41:58,001 --> 01:41:58,834
they feel they are a certain way and why
did they have to take chemicals to 

2116
01:42:01,271 --> 01:42:03,550
achieve a new state?
Like what?

2117
01:42:03,551 --> 01:42:04,384
What is like the identify with being a 
woman so they have to take chemicals to 

2118
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:11,470
reach this state.
I think man,

2119
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,640
if I was a person who was a transgender 
person listened to me talk,

2120
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:17,080
I'd be like,
shut the fuck up.

2121
01:42:17,081 --> 01:42:17,914
You don't know shit about that.
But a lot of you cheered if you're 

2122
01:42:20,141 --> 01:42:20,974
listening to this,
but that all I'm saying is that this is 

2123
01:42:23,501 --> 01:42:25,360
a very unusual situation.

2124
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:28,780
It's very unusual.
I don't think it's a bad thing,

2125
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:29,973
but I think that doing it to someone who
really can't fully make up their mind 

2126
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:36,694
yet just seems insanely risky and what,
what could happen to the kid could be 

2127
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:44,314
terrible and people have made successful
transitions when they'd transitioned in 

2128
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,094
their thirties you don't have to do it 
when you're six if you want to be a 

2129
01:42:50,411 --> 01:42:53,290
transgender person and union thirties 
sure.

2130
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:57,190
Where your 20s or whenever we decide 
that a human being is rationally capable

2131
01:42:57,191 --> 01:43:00,890
of making full life decisions that are 
as dramatic that that's what I thought.

2132
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,073
I was like,
what the fuck makes a good decision at 

2133
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:03,991
six days?
You know,

2134
01:43:03,991 --> 01:43:04,824
but it does matter what he want a 25 
that doesn't mean that someone had 16 

2135
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:11,350
who thinks they're a woman.
Couldn't absolutely become one later and

2136
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:12,730
be super,
super happy with it.

2137
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:13,563
That's not,
I'm not saying that's not possible 

2138
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:15,850
either.
Like everything's possible.

2139
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:19,840
There's a thing for everybody and if 
that is what you feel like is your,

2140
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:21,700
your thing,
you want to be that.

2141
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:25,430
That's just your,
it's who you identify with and you,

2142
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,670
you have every right,
you have every right to do that.

2143
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:30,280
So what you're saying,
probably you know how many fucking drugs

2144
01:43:30,281 --> 01:43:35,281
I did between 16 and 20 a lie.
It's not funny.

2145
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,520
You did a lot of drugs from the time I 
met you.

2146
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:43,300
You were the fact that you had a heavier
schedule before that.

2147
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,340
No,
but I'm talking about like I,

2148
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:48,400
I tried to stay away like I was a karate
guy.

2149
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:52,190
Like you and the kids from karate on 
Saturdays.

2150
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,023
They were geeks.
We either went to a martial art 

2151
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,630
festival,
we competed or we went to a karate movie

2152
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:03,700
or we went to a Honda martial arts 
supply.

2153
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:05,540
Hi Man.
Those places.

2154
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:06,643
So we saved our money.
Like would you want to go to the movies 

2155
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:11,250
and see the five deadly hands?
No,

2156
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:13,040
no.
We've got to save our money.

2157
01:44:13,041 --> 01:44:15,490
We're going to Honda next week to buy a 
kaboodle time.

2158
01:44:15,491 --> 01:44:16,324
Fuck.
Like we would always buy like the ones 

2159
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:19,730
that you'd hold,
uh,

2160
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,110
with the,
uh,

2161
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:25,610
just so you know,
I don't fuck around g money.

2162
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:31,100
What are you drawing?
What are you drawing?

2163
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:32,870
This is what,
if you look at you,

2164
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,910
you know how to write Chinese letters.
Yeah.

2165
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:39,740
If you look at those old Chinese things,
they all had this side.

2166
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:43,670
That's how you wrote karate.
That's how you wow.

2167
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:46,520
Roland karate like that.
So you would,

2168
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,860
I knew all about this.

2169
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:48,693
You would buy the,
the handle that I would hold the ones 

2170
01:44:51,481 --> 01:44:52,314
where you wouldn't take one dog,
they had the water at the top and they 

2171
01:44:55,061 --> 01:44:55,894
had for riches of canvas.
And you would stand in front of it and 

2172
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:02,090
you mock url,
Maki war and they would have like,

2173
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:03,900
you would get nuts guys.
Really?

2174
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:06,080
Oh my gosh.
And then we would save our money.

2175
01:45:06,081 --> 01:45:06,914
We would geeks.
That's what we did at 12 but to had a 

2176
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:10,514
little Goombas and my neighborhood and 
when they were 12 they did something 

2177
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:14,444
completely different.
They went behind the school and they 

2178
01:45:16,461 --> 01:45:19,820
would row one joy and put it in a piece 
of glass tube and,

2179
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:23,480
and light it up.
And we would drink a boone's farm.

2180
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:25,010
Oh,
the fruit shit.

2181
01:45:25,011 --> 01:45:27,830
And I'd get pukey so I didn't know who 
to hang out with.

2182
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:29,650
So I would have to be like a double a 
check.

2183
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:32,150
That was a tough job for me as a 12 year
old.

2184
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:35,030
I liked hanging out with my karate 
geeks.

2185
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:37,670
You know what I'm saying?
I like going to competitions.

2186
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:38,504
I like doing forms.
I like doing the semi contact 

2187
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,940
competitions where you couldn't kick 
above the head.

2188
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,230
Yeah,
those are good for kids,

2189
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:46,064
but you don't like it that way.
But you still kick the kid and get 

2190
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:49,110
disqualified.
But fuck fucking.

2191
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:50,600
I think the joy of that,
just seeing,

2192
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:51,530
you know,
people did that.

2193
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,393
This is when life was simple for me.
This was so I had to make a decision 

2194
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:57,710
because the Kung Fu kids didn't get no 
pussy.

2195
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:02,240
They just weren't into policy.
They would talk about girls and they may

2196
01:46:02,241 --> 01:46:04,880
be had a crush on the girl and the four 
30 class,

2197
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,370
but they never asked to accompany of the
events.

2198
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,593
My other buddies went to pussy,
so eventually I cut the karate fucking 

2199
01:46:12,201 --> 01:46:15,120
geeks out and I started hanging out with
a little,

2200
01:46:15,121 --> 01:46:15,954
the druggies and you make your 
transition into and from those 

2201
01:46:19,521 --> 01:46:23,690
developmental ages,
like I tried to hide my drug use.

2202
01:46:23,691 --> 01:46:27,350
I tried to hide,
especially with marijuana use for two or

2203
01:46:27,351 --> 01:46:28,970
three years.
It was just marijuana.

2204
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:33,710
While then,
once I became a freshman,

2205
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:35,203
got it and start basketball.
My freshman year I decided to let's 

2206
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:43,541
venture out into this acid thing.
Let's venture into this masculine thing.

2207
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,590
It was a different name.
It was masculine,

2208
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,560
but it really wasn't mescal and Joe 
Rogan.

2209
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:50,130
It

2210
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,420
was a little tag.
Cody,

2211
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,290
it would know,
wasn't even pay on it.

2212
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:56,130
It was a little thing.
I did the same shoes.

2213
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:56,993
Me Isn't Paoli Mba,
but masculine is what they saw you in 

2214
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:02,154
the south.
They supposedly put in Tequila as 

2215
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:05,910
something that's a sow,
right?

2216
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:06,773
Yeah.
This is something that two little 

2217
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:10,820
fucking white kids made in a pill.
It was rat poison,

2218
01:47:10,821 --> 01:47:14,430
but something else and something else 
and it was very tiny.

2219
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:17,700
It was maybe a little size of this.
That's it.

2220
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:20,910
And it came in aluminum foil.
Even smaller than that.

2221
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:22,740
Wow.
Even smaller than that,

2222
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:26,700
way smaller,
that sort of thing that that's it.

2223
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:28,013
You paid $80 for it and you got a 
hundred of those and you're struggling 

2224
01:47:31,561 --> 01:47:32,394
for $3 a piece and that would fuck you 
up for six hours with a two hour hayes 

2225
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:38,933
in between an hour buffer.
I want to come down and I did that for 

2226
01:47:43,591 --> 01:47:44,520
three or four months.

2227
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:48,990
Then they introduced me to thc crystal,
which is snorting.

2228
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:50,123
They sold it as,
what we do is we got a bunch of stems 

2229
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:54,174
and seeds from the reefer.
We put it in a pot and we boil that pot 

2230
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:04,250
and whatever separate from the stems and
the seeds that goes to the sides.

2231
01:48:04,261 --> 01:48:07,680
We scraped that off.
And that's where you snot in your nose.

2232
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:09,900
Oh my God.
So I was,

2233
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:10,973
I was,
I had like a personal karate rule cause 

2234
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:16,770
I would always just smoke it and do the 
masculine,

2235
01:48:16,771 --> 01:48:18,870
but I was never going to put nothing in 
my nose.

2236
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,101
Oh,
you had a rule?

2237
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:21,720
Like a drug addict puts something in 
their nose.

2238
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:24,780
Like that's it.
Like that's a complete different range.

2239
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:29,210
I'll never shoot heroin and I never was,
especially at my karate man as a carotid

2240
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,240
man.
Right.

2241
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:33,720
Carotid morals.
I was just straight away with the reef.

2242
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,153
And then I finally ended up snorting 
that fucking gorilla biscuits because 

2243
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:41,010
that's what it was.
It was angel dust.

2244
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:45,360
They just told you.
And I went under the Angel Dust Tab.

2245
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:46,583
Like every Sunday me and my friend 
Carlos Perez would buy a six pack of 

2246
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:53,340
Michelob.
He only like Michelob.

2247
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:54,203
He has good friends tonight in this kind
of special to appear with the beer will 

2248
01:48:59,671 --> 01:49:04,671
pour must say something more.
Call it as long brow.

2249
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,040
Low Brow.
What are we talking about?

2250
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,330
Michelob.
Michelob.

2251
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,670
No we would,
we would drink low brow,

2252
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:12,653
low brow.
That one we would get a six pack on the 

2253
01:49:15,031 --> 01:49:15,864
eyebrow and fucking snot.
A $10 package of the crystal and mother 

2254
01:49:20,791 --> 01:49:21,624
would go to the track on Sundays.
So I knew she wouldn't come back til 

2255
01:49:24,421 --> 01:49:25,254
seven so me and him would snow in it as 
soon as my mother stepped foot in that 

2256
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:30,054
car and 11 being hit with having and 
we'd snorting it and then fucking just 

2257
01:49:34,561 --> 01:49:37,290
sit around like and be fucking zombies 
all day.

2258
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,330
But that was a development and then I 
went after my mom got it.

2259
01:49:41,331 --> 01:49:46,331
Just want to and acid tab fucking a year
or God knows

2260
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,150
what was in those goddamn things.
God fucking know what's going on here.

2261
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:54,010
Well on rock commercial,
Oh this is,

2262
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:59,710
oh my God,
look at that guy.

2263
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:08,470
This is like a sketch.
It's a truly great American beer.

2264
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:09,334
Why?
Why does it have an American name 

2265
01:50:10,151 --> 01:50:12,790
motherfucker?
What are you embarrassed you embarrassed

2266
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:14,830
to be from here?
American beer.

2267
01:50:14,831 --> 01:50:19,831
Low and proud.
Fucking drink low brows.

2268
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:22,300
Shit.
Actually it isn't American beer,

2269
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:23,410
right?
That's like steep amy.

2270
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:25,000
Oh check.
Keep your fucking real name.

2271
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,730
That's as American as it gets.
And she's still around.

2272
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:31,330
Lowenbrau I don't know.
But if they said low and breath,

2273
01:50:31,331 --> 01:50:32,164
that was their name and they started the
beer company and it didn't change her 

2274
01:50:34,241 --> 01:50:35,590
name.
That's as American as it gets.

2275
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:37,150
So I'm wrong.
I should shut the fuck up.

2276
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,250
It's even looking it up.
It's the German brewery.

2277
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:42,280
Liars.
Liars.

2278
01:50:42,281 --> 01:50:45,280
Liars line about American American made.

2279
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:46,293
Apparently they make a lot of American 
American plants make a lot of cars now 

2280
01:50:49,961 --> 01:50:53,740
that you think are Japanese cars like 
Toyota Tundras.

2281
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:56,620
They make them in Texas can make a bunch
of them in Ohio too.

2282
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:58,660
Honda's Nissan's.
That's weird,

2283
01:50:58,661 --> 01:51:00,370
right?
Like if you think you'd buy in a Honda,

2284
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:03,040
you sink.
You're definitely buying a Japanese car.

2285
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:05,950
If you think you're buying some American
cars,

2286
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:08,110
it might be a Mexican car.
How crazy is that?

2287
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,350
Like what companies making their cars 
down in Mexico?

2288
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,470
I think they,
I think they closed a couple of plants.

2289
01:51:14,471 --> 01:51:17,230
I think Toyota was down there.
Somebody else for a while.

2290
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,570
But here's the thing,
if they put him down in Mexico,

2291
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:24,550
but they gave him American money,
like the levels of American money that's

2292
01:51:25,150 --> 01:51:28,800
in Mexico,
they would stop doing it a lot actually.

2293
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:30,340
Wow.
Look at all these different ones.

2294
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:32,770
Chrysler has three plants,
four to three plans.

2295
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:35,020
GM is four plans.
Moms does one,

2296
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,210
they do it down there cause it's 
cheaper,

2297
01:51:37,211 --> 01:51:38,044
which I guess they have to do what they 
gotta do and I'm sure it helps the 

2298
01:51:41,321 --> 01:51:42,154
community because then I know it does.
I know people that have had 

2299
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:47,890
manufacturing down in these countries 
and they do it for the cheap,

2300
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:51,100
but it does help the people.
Like there's some places that don't have

2301
01:51:51,101 --> 01:51:51,934
much,
but what's arguable is like why is 

2302
01:51:53,771 --> 01:51:54,604
living like a western person so 
important when these people have been 

2303
01:51:57,791 --> 01:52:00,880
living in their own way for thousands of
years.

2304
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:01,714
It's just they just didn't have like all
the crazy infrastructure and all the 

2305
01:52:04,901 --> 01:52:07,150
shit that we had.
They didn't have the crazy cities.

2306
01:52:07,151 --> 01:52:10,810
And you know other than a few cities in 
Mexico like Mexico City.

2307
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:15,160
So they would go and put these plants 
and like why is it doing,

2308
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:17,950
I mean I don't,
I'm all for people being able to work.

2309
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:18,813
But is that better?
Is it better than the way they were 

2310
01:52:20,621 --> 01:52:21,454
living before when they were living like
indigenous people are living like 

2311
01:52:23,921 --> 01:52:27,220
villagers are living like trades people 
or whatever they did to get by.

2312
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:29,170
I Dunno.
Maybe it is better.

2313
01:52:29,171 --> 01:52:30,004
Maybe it's,
let's go back to the whole situation 

2314
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:33,730
here.
I still remember,

2315
01:52:33,731 --> 01:52:34,564
cause I'm a little older than us storm,
remember where it was kind of starting 

2316
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:41,820
to get that bull if you bought a foreign
car like I,

2317
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,320
I'm bad old ways.
I'm not sure that that,

2318
01:52:44,321 --> 01:52:46,120
I still remember the La

2319
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,023
mid seventies I still remember when 
Toyota advertised or Nissan advertised 

2320
01:52:51,981 --> 01:52:56,270
the car for 1995 and I would go,
wait a second,

2321
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:58,460
I got $40 in the bank.
I could buy one of those.

2322
01:52:58,461 --> 01:53:02,630
It was $1,900
stupid like a corolla or something.

2323
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,113
And I still remember there was a time in
this country when if you bought of what 

2324
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:10,040
if you were on the first person on this 
block.

2325
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:13,850
If you showed up with a foreign car,
you got a little bit of grief,

2326
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:15,763
you got a little bit of grief,
and then it felt like they sold 

2327
01:53:19,881 --> 01:53:23,030
themselves.
It felt like we dropped the ball at some

2328
01:53:23,031 --> 01:53:25,310
point.
As Americans,

2329
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,173
as you know,
I don't know what happened to Detroit 

2330
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,263
and all that stuff.
I know that where's the highest 

2331
01:53:30,921 --> 01:53:32,750
populations of Puerto Rico in this 
country?

2332
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,880
I don't know.
You think it's the bronx,

2333
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:37,910
but it's not.
It's a suburb outside of Cleveland.

2334
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,193
Why?
Because in the 50s they took a bunch of 

2335
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:45,140
Puerto Ricans and put them into this 
suburb to work at the car plants.

2336
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,453
All the car plants shut down at that.
We ended up going other places and 

2337
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:51,860
whatever and blah,
blah,

2338
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:52,760
blah and blah,
blah,

2339
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:53,594
blah,
and then the foreign car and started 

2340
01:53:55,021 --> 01:53:57,620
checking our fucking ass.
Why again?

2341
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:58,880
I don't know.
What's it?

2342
01:53:58,881 --> 01:54:01,220
The workmanship?
Was it the quality?

2343
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:03,860
All I know is if,
if I got a fucking Toyota,

2344
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:08,120
I could drive it for 80,000
miles without stopping to get gas.

2345
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:11,900
You know what I'm saying?
You as a consumer and as an American,

2346
01:54:11,901 --> 01:54:16,220
you want to buy American products and 
you want to buy American made products,

2347
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:17,743
you know?
So there's a couple of places now like 

2348
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:21,720
beside Mexico,
there's,

2349
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:24,650
where are we?
We have places now,

2350
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:25,484
like in Indiana we had like,
Toyota has a couple of places and they 

2351
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:31,190
should bring it back.
I mean,

2352
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,560
Eh,
fuck it.

2353
01:54:33,561 --> 01:54:34,400
Let some,
you know,

2354
01:54:34,401 --> 01:54:35,234
so we trade,
we get someone to tell you all of this 

2355
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:38,660
stuff,
which is a,

2356
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:42,200
what kind of car are they?
Japanese or Chinese or Japanese?

2357
01:54:42,201 --> 01:54:46,460
Japanese and let some of our strict get 
made over there as part of,

2358
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:47,563
is it Nafta?

2359
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:49,590
Um,
that's North American,

2360
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,970
North American free trade agreement.
So that's just,

2361
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:53,323
I think,
I think I'm just talking about my 

2362
01:54:54,361 --> 01:54:55,530
answer,
but I think that's just us.

2363
01:54:55,531 --> 01:54:58,920
Mexico and Canada.
So when we build a car in Mexico,

2364
01:54:58,921 --> 01:55:01,590
it's a lot cheaper.
Develop that car because of the rate.

2365
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,500
Yeah,
they pay,

2366
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,830
people pay feel blessed.
It's cheaper to get land.

2367
01:55:05,070 --> 01:55:08,280
These people don't have anything else 
going on down there or not as much going

2368
01:55:08,281 --> 01:55:10,500
on down there.
Obviously as they do in America and some

2369
01:55:10,501 --> 01:55:11,334
like heavily populated cities and so 
they can offer people much less money 

2370
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,040
and they do it.
There's a lot of plants that do that,

2371
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:18,683
but here's the thing,
it's the real question is do you think 

2372
01:55:20,671 --> 01:55:21,504
that this is just going to elevate these
people and they're eventually going to 

2373
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:25,313
catch up with the Western world and live
the way that we're living right now in 

2374
01:55:28,441 --> 01:55:29,010
the United States?

2375
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:32,340
Like there's ultimately a possibility of
that or are we saying,

2376
01:55:32,341 --> 01:55:33,174
well,
we're always going to have these people 

2377
01:55:33,721 --> 01:55:34,554
that would treat less good and we're 
just always going to keep them in that 

2378
01:55:36,601 --> 01:55:38,130
position.
They're never going to get any better.

2379
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:39,330
I mean,
what?

2380
01:55:39,330 --> 01:55:42,750
Which one is it?
It's either one of those two things or I

2381
01:55:42,751 --> 01:55:46,650
made it possibly be that people just 
want shit cheaper,

2382
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:48,270
so bad.
They don't care.

2383
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,313
They don't care.
They don't care if a guy's making a 

2384
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:52,650
dollar a week or whatever the fuck they 
make.

2385
01:55:52,651 --> 01:55:54,510
How much do they make?
If you had to guess,

2386
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,580
if you guess,
how much does someone in a um,

2387
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:58,463
uh,
an automobile plant in Mexico make as 

2388
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:01,344
opposed to an American worker?
I'm sure someone must have done some 

2389
01:56:02,971 --> 01:56:03,804
sort of a study.

2390
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:06,751
It's weird,
man,

2391
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:09,210
because if they were doing the exact 
same thing on this patch of dirt,

2392
01:56:09,211 --> 01:56:09,931
we would go,
what?

2393
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:12,360
You can't pay that little?
Then you say,

2394
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:13,081
oh,
but down there,

2395
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:13,914
everything's cheaper.
And the given these people an 

2396
01:56:16,141 --> 01:56:18,900
opportunity like why is it better?
Here's the question.

2397
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:23,280
Why is it better than the way they've 
always been living in Mexico?

2398
01:56:23,281 --> 01:56:28,281
$2 per hour workers make $40,000
suv is $2 an hour.

2399
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:29,873
Jesus Christ to imagine a person working
all day and you hand them $16 you sir 

2400
01:56:36,361 --> 01:56:37,194
are a piece of shit.
Could you imagine guy busts his ass on 

2401
01:56:41,581 --> 01:56:46,581
an assembly line all day?
You give him $16 fuck you.

2402
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:50,520
That's crazy.
Started a dollar 10 an hour.

2403
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:53,220
Oh my God.
A dollar an hour.

2404
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:57,030
You make more than prison.
That is ridiculous.

2405
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,220
And that's Mexican money.
That's American money.

2406
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:00,890
A dollar a day,
$2 and hour.

2407
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:04,330
Maybe it's like the translated joe would
go,

2408
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:05,730
fuck,
that's insane.

2409
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:06,923
But it's,
it's just the idea is that if you're 

2410
01:57:10,261 --> 01:57:11,094
always going to be able to,
you got to always be able to make more 

2411
01:57:13,051 --> 01:57:15,540
money.
Like these people have this idea in,

2412
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:17,730
a lot of these corporations have 
unlimited growth.

2413
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:20,340
They just want to constantly be growing 
and growing and growing.

2414
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:21,443
It's some people think it's a very 
dangerous idea because if you're your 

2415
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:29,540
bottom line for your companies to always
outdo every quarter at a certain time,

2416
01:57:29,611 --> 01:57:30,444
people start getting desperate and they 
start cutting environmental corners or 

2417
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:34,974
cut and research corners.
They're doing whatever the fuck they 

2418
01:57:36,391 --> 01:57:40,200
have to do to keep their bottom line 
down and keep their profits coming in.

2419
01:57:40,201 --> 01:57:43,590
And that's what you could say about like
these prescription drug companies,

2420
01:57:43,591 --> 01:57:45,390
people want to think that these 
companies are evil.

2421
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,420
They're companies.
Their job is to make money,

2422
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:49,283
okay?
And they're caught up in a storm where 

2423
01:57:50,831 --> 01:57:55,831
they're allowed to make legal money and 
this legal money is fucking substantial.

2424
01:57:56,370 --> 01:57:57,203
It's a giant amount of money these 
pharmaceutical companies are making on 

2425
01:58:00,701 --> 01:58:02,820
an opiate,
so people are dying left and right.

2426
01:58:02,821 --> 01:58:05,820
Joey left and right.
This is one of the craziest,

2427
01:58:05,821 --> 01:58:10,560
unspoken Emmett epidemics.
The human race to a little bit forever.

2428
01:58:10,561 --> 01:58:14,340
You the truth of everything.
I still talked to my truck.

2429
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,233
It was good to me when I needed them.
And from month to month I still taught 

2430
01:58:20,151 --> 01:58:20,984
for the Armenian.
I still talk to Don sleazy and in fact 

2431
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:24,570
the hustle.
He's,

2432
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:27,210
he just did a big movie.
You got a couple of lines of big movie.

2433
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:29,280
That's awesome.
They do what they do.

2434
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:30,990
I do what I do.
I have a family.

2435
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:35,780
I got a call from the guy made him,
I saw him at rouse.

2436
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:39,080
You have bet you did.
Do you see do about the Armenian?

2437
01:58:39,081 --> 01:58:41,590
This is one of my favorite bits.
All of the army that routes.

2438
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,430
He gave me a hug and all with his kids 
and kids.

2439
01:58:44,431 --> 01:58:45,264
Are you right now?
You'll know how many times I met him 

2440
01:58:47,321 --> 01:58:50,260
with his kids and he would put an eight 
ball in my head.

2441
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:53,080
You know,
I've been in that position now.

2442
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:57,190
I had groceries and I hugged him and he 
goes,

2443
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,470
you mind if I call you later?
You know,

2444
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:01,330
and I go,
she'll call me whatever you want.

2445
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:03,300
And he goes,
uh,

2446
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:05,410
do you,
where do you live?

2447
01:59:05,411 --> 01:59:06,161
And I told him,
and he goes,

2448
01:59:06,161 --> 01:59:07,870
I live here.
Can I meet you?

2449
01:59:07,871 --> 01:59:09,550
I went to ask you a question.
I didn't know.

2450
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:11,830
I thought he was going to ask me if I 
still did blow.

2451
01:59:11,831 --> 01:59:12,890
I didn't know.
I,

2452
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:13,371
you know,
I'm,

2453
01:59:13,371 --> 01:59:14,440
I'm good,
I'm good.

2454
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:18,160
And when I met the men meet him,
what he wanted to know was,

2455
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:19,960
he goes,
you're a comedian.

2456
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:23,260
And uh,
I just wanted to ask if you knew anybody

2457
01:59:23,261 --> 01:59:24,620
who,
Eh,

2458
01:59:24,810 --> 01:59:27,130
get pills.
And I go,

2459
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,670
I got a Xanax at the house and you're 
free to take them.

2460
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:31,511
He goes,
no,

2461
01:59:31,511 --> 01:59:31,781
no,
no,

2462
01:59:31,781 --> 01:59:33,400
no.
I talking pain.

2463
01:59:33,401 --> 01:59:35,650
I see.
Or whatever.

2464
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:37,060
Again,
like shook his hand.

2465
01:59:37,061 --> 01:59:38,120
I gave him a hug.
Joe Rogan,

2466
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,880
I don't know nobody,
I don't know.

2467
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:42,153
A week later I told him I'd to ask,
cause I do know a guy kind of saw the 

2468
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:49,560
white dude in Hollywood and I called him
like I was a week later they are meeting

2469
01:59:49,561 --> 01:59:51,460
and called me and he goes and I go,
you know what?

2470
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:52,420
I'm sorry,
hold on.

2471
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,633
And I went,
I looked when I called this white dude 

2472
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:57,900
and he called me back and he said,
ah,

2473
01:59:57,970 --> 01:59:59,530
give me a couple of days,
you know?

2474
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:04,531
And he called me back and what he told 
me was mind boggling what he's done,

2475
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:09,370
the prices.

2476
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:14,260
I went just getting what you pay for 
pharmaceutical.

2477
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,513
He hit me back and he told me three 
numbers on the phone with three 

2478
02:00:19,961 --> 02:00:24,961
different names of what this guy had.
And I'm not a drug dealer.

2479
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:28,120
I called the Armenian and I just said,
listen,

2480
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:30,040
this is what they told me and this is 
what he wants.

2481
02:00:30,041 --> 02:00:30,874
And the guy goes,
okay,

2482
02:00:30,910 --> 02:00:32,700
don't tell him in a week I get a 
thousand.

2483
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:33,543
Um,
I could not believe the amount of money 

2484
02:00:35,981 --> 02:00:38,550
for these pills.
Rarely,

2485
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,370
you know,
I never was a big pill head,

2486
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:41,223
but oh my God,
the black market for pills is fucking 

2487
02:00:48,791 --> 02:00:49,624
ginormous.
And I knew this kid and Hollywood will 

2488
02:00:51,921 --> 02:00:53,350
come through,
I know him

2489
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:54,343
15 years,
he's a big Jujitsu guy door and they 

2490
02:00:58,341 --> 02:00:59,174
can't close it.
It is mind boggling what you pay for 

2491
02:01:02,811 --> 02:01:04,070
pills.
Well,

2492
02:01:04,071 --> 02:01:05,150
you know what happened,
right?

2493
02:01:05,151 --> 02:01:06,500
You know what?
We've got it all started.

2494
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:07,640
Well,
this is what happened.

2495
02:01:07,641 --> 02:01:09,410
First of all,
they're obviously very addictive.

2496
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,240
Um,
second of all,

2497
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:12,133
something happened in Florida where they
allowed people to get the all clinic 

2498
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:16,953
prescription pain clinics everywhere.
It was basically what offtrack betting 

2499
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:22,610
is for gambling.
That was heroin,

2500
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:26,150
heroin,
60 minutes show me,

2501
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:28,250
everybody's got an ache.
You know,

2502
02:01:28,251 --> 02:01:31,040
sometimes my fucking neck bothers me 
after a couple of podcasts,

2503
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:33,050
I need to get a little oxy,
my back,

2504
02:01:33,051 --> 02:01:34,700
just I can't sleep.
Here you go.

2505
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:38,090
Have some oxy.
They would have a pharmacy attached to a

2506
02:01:38,091 --> 02:01:38,924
doctor's office town of 3,200
was flooded with neuro 21 million pain 

2507
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:45,710
pills as addiction crisis worsen.
Lawmakers say,

2508
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:48,740
whoa.
A town of 3,200

2509
02:01:48,741 --> 02:01:52,880
people was flooded with 21 million pain 
pills town in West Virginia.

2510
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,360
Jesus Christ.
People in,

2511
02:01:55,420 --> 02:02:00,420
in those towns like from the wild and 
wonderful west of West Virginia.

2512
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:01,783
What does that,
the whites of West Virginia remember 

2513
02:02:02,991 --> 02:02:03,840
that well,
wonderful.

2514
02:02:03,841 --> 02:02:07,160
Well what kind of wild and wonderful 
whites of West Virginia oxies,

2515
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:08,660
Xanax,
nick,

2516
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:10,380
whatever the fuck you got.
The little ones.

2517
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:12,770
I got the little ones for anxiety.
You know,

2518
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:15,830
you take an anxiety.
I get them lately before I get,

2519
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:18,230
like if I haven't gone in the road for a
while.

2520
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:20,060
Oh really?
That Thursday morning.

2521
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,290
Oh my God.
Joe Rogan.

2522
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,153
As I'm getting ready,
I keep thinking like I'm fucking not 

2523
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:25,453
packing.
Right.

2524
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:26,683
I forgot something.
I forgot the holes of sleep apnea and 

2525
02:02:29,181 --> 02:02:31,070
I've been buying half of it.
And you know what?

2526
02:02:31,071 --> 02:02:31,904
I even fall asleep.
I got out of the plane and I fall 

2527
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:37,220
asleep.
But on the road people give me weird,

2528
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:38,113
creepy things and it's so blackberry is 
so that I just go to Web Deb d and You 

2529
02:02:45,330 --> 02:02:48,410
looked for a pill indicator and if 
there's something good,

2530
02:02:48,411 --> 02:02:49,244
I'll save it.

2531
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:52,670
Cause at least I got to live.
If I ever have an emergency,

2532
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,620
if I'm lonely with or something,
you're capo,

2533
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:57,040
these little pills,
you know?

2534
02:02:57,690 --> 02:02:59,300
Wow.
But when the dog,

2535
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:02,480
when they told me that,
like I knew when I was a kid,

2536
02:03:02,481 --> 02:03:03,700
I would go to central,
uh,

2537
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:07,160
to Washington square park and I could 
get eight,

2538
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:11,210
10 milligram Vallian with the V in the 
middle.

2539
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:13,910
That's the real deal.
When you're going to fuck,

2540
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:18,500
and they got a v in the middle of cut 
out all the shit.

2541
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:20,473
That's the shit of Mac daddies.
I could get eight of those for $10 and 

2542
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:28,430
that would,
here's the question.

2543
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:29,293
Do you think if it was legal,
more or less people to use it or the 

2544
02:03:32,061 --> 02:03:34,370
same?
Why are you,

2545
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,770
what is this trick points?
Thursday?

2546
02:03:36,771 --> 02:03:37,604
I'm curious what you gambling and drugs.
Pills you give people the green 

2547
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,160
greenlight dog.

2548
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:46,250
We're fucking,
we're crap creatures of habit.

2549
02:03:46,850 --> 02:03:50,630
We're all going to fucking go.
Some of us are going to control it.

2550
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:51,703
Listen to some people that get knee 
surgery and neck surgery like yourself 

2551
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:55,903
and you thrown away the Vicodin and 
there's other people that take that 

2552
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:02,480
prescription and two years later they're
shooting heroin.

2553
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:05,330
Yeah,
I don't understand that.

2554
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:09,740
Okay.
I have different holes in our jeans,

2555
02:04:09,741 --> 02:04:10,491
Bro.
Well,

2556
02:04:10,491 --> 02:04:12,920
there's some people that like pain.
I'm not one of them,

2557
02:04:12,921 --> 02:04:14,510
but there's some people that genuinely 
like it.

2558
02:04:14,511 --> 02:04:16,670
They get pleasure out of it.
What kind of pain do you like?

2559
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,511
I mean,
what kind of pain?

2560
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:21,050
I don't think this is what I'm saying.
This is the question.

2561
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:23,720
I think they think there are syndromes 
where,

2562
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:25,940
and it's probably fairly common,
it turns,

2563
02:04:25,941 --> 02:04:26,774
it's not just one person.
It's like several people that could 

2564
02:04:27,891 --> 02:04:31,100
point out that uh,
experienced actual like pleasure,

2565
02:04:31,101 --> 02:04:34,220
like a serotonin burst from certain 
amounts of pain.

2566
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:36,530
They don't feel,
I don't think they feel it is the way we

2567
02:04:36,531 --> 02:04:38,130
feel it.
And so they're always trying to do

2568
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:38,963
things to themselves and they say that 
some of the people that get like a lot 

2569
02:04:40,561 --> 02:04:42,170
of piercings have that,
uh,

2570
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:44,100
some people that get a lot of tattoos 
have that.

2571
02:04:44,101 --> 02:04:45,980
They start to feel the want to feel it 
more.

2572
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:49,080
They want to burn it into themselves.
It's an I.

2573
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:49,351
Dot.
I'm not,

2574
02:04:49,351 --> 02:04:50,184
obviously not a psychologist,
but it's apparently a pretty common 

2575
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,840
theory.
Another day I want to talk to you about,

2576
02:04:55,850 --> 02:04:59,050
I was the pub cash can believe.
I have to say I'm not a psychiatry.

2577
02:04:59,051 --> 02:05:02,880
I love to podcast where you were talking
about cause I want to do,

2578
02:05:02,881 --> 02:05:05,370
to really tell you the truth.
The podcast are,

2579
02:05:05,371 --> 02:05:07,050
you were talking about,
that may be some,

2580
02:05:07,051 --> 02:05:11,510
the Jones John Jones actions were caused
by head injuries.

2581
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:13,980
Could easily been.
I tell you not caused by,

2582
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:16,250
not caused by cause he usually could be 
a fact.

2583
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:17,010
I got to tell you something.

2584
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:18,760
Joe Rogan,
uh,

2585
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:19,921
again.
Well,

2586
02:05:19,921 --> 02:05:22,920
let's go back to abuse from gambling or 
pills.

2587
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:26,850
The mind with cocaine is a very tricky 
mine.

2588
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:28,980
Oh yeah.
And it takes a year off.

2589
02:05:29,970 --> 02:05:33,410
I'm just telling you this from 
experience because I learned a lot about

2590
02:05:33,411 --> 02:05:35,880
new tropics from you.
I don't really know much about it,

2591
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:39,060
but Roman [inaudible] sent me two of his
jugs.

2592
02:05:39,061 --> 02:05:42,100
It's the ship that neuro one,
the orange juice.

2593
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:43,213
But that's not shit that got me into 
nootropics when I got off cocaine that 

2594
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:51,330
came in the mail and I really drank and 
I didn't tell nobody my secret because I

2595
02:05:51,331 --> 02:05:53,250
knew,
especially for a guy like me,

2596
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:55,860
you know,
John Jones is 26 years old.

2597
02:05:55,861 --> 02:05:56,694
He's a phenomenal fighter.
I didn't think that it really had 

2598
02:05:58,771 --> 02:05:59,604
anything to do with any other thing.
I think it was that when you were on 

2599
02:06:03,151 --> 02:06:06,060
cocaine and that year afterward,
cocaine,

2600
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:08,360
thanks to pleasure patterns out of your 
mind.

2601
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:09,543
I'll be your brain.
It's not the same or tone and the 

2602
02:06:11,191 --> 02:06:12,360
Melatonin.
I don't know.

2603
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:13,613
Don't correct me on this,
but I feel that it took me a year to 18 

2604
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:20,724
months for me to just become a human 
again and I haven't gotten hit in the 

2605
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:26,664
head.
Not since I was about 13 I got beat up 

2606
02:06:28,441 --> 02:06:29,274
by the guy.
I tried the Mug and I got hit in the 

2607
02:06:30,841 --> 02:06:31,674
head with a flashlight.
It really took me 18 months to embrace 

2608
02:06:34,981 --> 02:06:35,720
your man.
Yeah.

2609
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,740
Again.
Yeah.

2610
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:40,050
I want you to remember that.
I want you to think of that morning,

2611
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:44,860
what happened in Santa Fe with when he 
ran the light and he ran away from that.

2612
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,410
What?
What?

2613
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:47,700
What was he,
Jamie,

2614
02:06:48,090 --> 02:06:50,220
do you think he just woke up and was 
going to church?

2615
02:06:50,221 --> 02:06:51,900
No,
he was out the night before.

2616
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:53,183
Yeah.
He could have very well been out from 

2617
02:06:54,151 --> 02:06:54,350
the night.

2618
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:55,420
There's no pleasure.
You know,

2619
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:59,130
you take,
it takes your mind a long time.

2620
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:02,010
You know what's the thing?
When I get off the juice,

2621
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:04,740
I got to do something for my boss to 
grow again.

2622
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,770
You'd have to take something called 
clomiphene.

2623
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:08,633
Okay,
and what?

2624
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:10,140
Well,
there's a couple of different ones.

2625
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:12,840
Apparently a,
it's an estrogen blocker.

2626
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:13,733
It blocks your estrogen.
That's actually one of the things that 

2627
02:07:14,911 --> 02:07:15,744
John tested positive.
So how long would it take for me to get 

2628
02:07:17,731 --> 02:07:19,980
my balls back again?
It'd take you a little while.

2629
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:20,963
Hey Ben,
he stayed here the amount of time that 

2630
02:07:22,711 --> 02:07:23,910
you were doing it.
Oh,

2631
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:24,863
see if that's why you're only supposed 
to go on like a short cycle unless 

2632
02:07:27,601 --> 02:07:30,380
you're a crazy bodybuilder guy.
Those guys just stay on it all the time.

2633
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,800
Thing with the cocaine,
Bro.

2634
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:32,663
I thought about your statement and I 
went home and started writing and 

2635
02:07:35,111 --> 02:07:35,944
thinking

2636
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:37,953
I got off November,
2007 it took me a year and a half just 

2637
02:07:43,001 --> 02:07:45,430
to become a human being to realize I was
fat.

2638
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:48,070
I was 400 pounds.
I need it to go to weight watchers.

2639
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:51,250
Took me 18 months to realize I hadn't 
married.

2640
02:07:51,251 --> 02:07:56,251
My wife took me a long time for my brain
to think normal.

2641
02:07:56,891 --> 02:07:58,320
Like anybody else does.
Right.

2642
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:01,360
So I want you to take that into 
consideration.

2643
02:08:01,361 --> 02:08:02,500
Or deb.
I definitely do.

2644
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:04,990
I know you're saying,
I agree to me a long time.

2645
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:08,630
You know when you do blow,
when you go on stage to say,

2646
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:11,500
if I do blow three nights in a week and 
I go on stage,

2647
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:13,210
I have no control.
Joe Rogan,

2648
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:16,540
I'm looking at you in the face.
You see me on stage.

2649
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:17,913
I have no control.
I have no connection from my brain to 

2650
02:08:21,881 --> 02:08:25,000
what's coming out of my mouth.
I can't.

2651
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:26,200
Now you're going,
do you,

2652
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:28,000
are you speaking to rats now?

2653
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:31,090
Uh,
it was empty words.

2654
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,060
There was no passion behind that.
That's why it wasn't funny.

2655
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:34,990
You know,
you said to me,

2656
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:37,630
you said it blocks love.
It blocks the love.

2657
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:41,200
That's it.
The love in between my,

2658
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:46,030
the cocaine in my words is gone.
But that's what stimulus do.

2659
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:46,893
Stimulants or ramp up the aggression and
the impulsiveness and they ramp up your 

2660
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:53,643
fearlessness.
They ramp up your courage and get 

2661
02:08:55,061 --> 02:08:55,894
disproportionate.
They ramp up your ego like some 

2662
02:08:58,331 --> 02:08:59,164
stimulants on some people.
Some people obviously look to people 

2663
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:04,420
that can handle booze and these people 
that can't amble even a little booze.

2664
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,010
And I think that's the same with 
stimulants.

2665
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:07,600
I think that's the same with pretty much
everything,

2666
02:09:07,601 --> 02:09:09,880
every almost every life experience.
In fact,

2667
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,610
I think there's some people that can 
handle things and some people that can't

2668
02:09:12,611 --> 02:09:14,950
and some people that can't at first,
then they eventually learn to.

2669
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,353
Um,
someone sent me something about Rodney 

2670
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:21,070
Dangerfield was fucking great man.
All from New York Times,

2671
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:22,410
the relentless thing.
Yeah,

2672
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,270
it was great.
John.

2673
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:26,560
John Dudley sent it to me.
Fucking a,

2674
02:09:26,561 --> 02:09:27,710
it was amazing.
Yeah,

2675
02:09:27,711 --> 02:09:29,800
I read that.
It's amazing.

2676
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,360
It's amazing.
Oh No.

2677
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:32,890
Tait Fletcher.
Tait Fletcher.

2678
02:09:32,891 --> 02:09:34,840
San Antonio's great.
It was tate.

2679
02:09:34,841 --> 02:09:39,841
Shout out to take flincher where tate a 
jam letter of recommendation.

2680
02:09:40,301 --> 02:09:43,000
Rodney dangerfield.
It is an amazing piece.

2681
02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:45,700
Who wrote this?
What does the name of the gentleman,

2682
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:49,090
Alex,
how stat Alex,

2683
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:49,983
you made a masterpiece.
That's a fucking hell of an article 

2684
02:09:51,941 --> 02:09:55,210
about one of the greatest of all time 
when it comes to standup comedy.

2685
02:09:55,211 --> 02:09:56,044
And he just talks about the evolution of
Rodney dangerfield and how like it 

2686
02:09:59,681 --> 02:10:00,514
wasn't until he was like in his fifties 
and he really fucking got it together 

2687
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:04,143
like and became the great standup that 
we know him as and his process for 

2688
02:10:07,181 --> 02:10:08,950
boiling down as material.
Joey,

2689
02:10:08,951 --> 02:10:12,250
it's a fucking amazing article.
I read it two times,

2690
02:10:12,251 --> 02:10:13,560
so I look,
I get tism.

2691
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:15,880
What do you want to do?
We to do this special?

2692
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:17,350
Yes.
We're going to do a special,

2693
02:10:17,351 --> 02:10:18,184
I'm going to direct your comedy special.
We're just going to figure out when to 

2694
02:10:20,321 --> 02:10:22,460
do it and where to do it.
In June at the Ice House.

2695
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:25,810
The Ice House is the place I think.
Yeah.

2696
02:10:26,390 --> 02:10:28,810
Let's do six shows.
Let's do six.

2697
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:29,673
Let's do,
let's do I want to do to Thursday to 

2698
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:33,340
Friday to Saturday.
Boom.

2699
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,273
I want to get those

2700
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,113
crazy week.
Savages is a different kind of animal 

2701
02:10:37,281 --> 02:10:39,210
that goes out on Thursday night.
One hour there.

2702
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:41,240
They're a little more ramped up for one 
hour,

2703
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:42,240
15 minutes.
You Go,

2704
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:43,880
you're going to go crazies.
We're going to do,

2705
02:10:43,881 --> 02:10:44,714
I would just want it.
We're going to capture the real Joey 

2706
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:48,530
Diaz experience and we're going to put 
together a special,

2707
02:10:48,610 --> 02:10:51,410
that's it.
We're done June in a ice house.

2708
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:52,303
We'll give everybody a the details,
but this is the first special that I've 

2709
02:10:55,101 --> 02:10:58,040
ever even attempted to do something with
other than my own.

2710
02:10:58,041 --> 02:10:58,874
So listen,
you would be the guy that they would do 

2711
02:11:02,091 --> 02:11:03,680
with fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2712
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:07,790
I think I picked the name of it is a 
immigrant because the towel,

2713
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:12,780
the immigrant mentality is proof with 
respect to pay me.

2714
02:11:13,730 --> 02:11:14,563
That's perfect.
That's a perfect name and the perfect 

2715
02:11:17,001 --> 02:11:18,660
fucking name of the album.
Okay,

2716
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:19,573
beautiful.
I'm already in process to write and I'm 

2717
02:11:22,071 --> 02:11:22,904
ready to go.
I think the ice house is the place we'd 

2718
02:11:24,501 --> 02:11:26,480
been there a million times.
It's home.

2719
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:27,860
It's family.
Oh my God.

2720
02:11:27,870 --> 02:11:28,703
It's all,
yeah,

2721
02:11:28,730 --> 02:11:33,050
it's a great place to film and when that
place gets Rockin Holy Shit.

2722
02:11:33,051 --> 02:11:34,110
It's going to Colorado.

2723
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:36,870
I'm going to Colorado.
I'm flying in a day early.

2724
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:37,733
I'm interviewing Antonio La Dzio.
I'm going to go show people were 

2725
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:42,894
kidnapped.
Bella doesn't show pupil the halfway 

2726
02:11:44,461 --> 02:11:45,294
house.
I'm going to walk around Bova I book 

2727
02:11:47,791 --> 02:11:50,760
tape all that and I'm going to have that
up this fucking spring.

2728
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:52,310
I got some shit.
I'm planning.

2729
02:11:52,311 --> 02:11:55,830
I want to do like a little mixed tape 
type of stand up drop.

2730
02:11:55,990 --> 02:11:57,860
We got to let these mother fuckers.
Yeah,

2731
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:58,733
I'm ready to shoot the special.
They don't had a great time in 

2732
02:12:00,511 --> 02:12:01,380
Charlotte,
man.

2733
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,593
I knew you weren't Durham and you and I 
would discuss in the comedy scene in 

2734
02:12:05,461 --> 02:12:07,600
North Carolina.
Amazing how it was judged.

2735
02:12:07,650 --> 02:12:08,483
I just want to thank new people and the 
week before that I was in Austin and 

2736
02:12:12,451 --> 02:12:13,284
that place is like this last time I got 
emotional and Austin like I don't know 

2737
02:12:17,791 --> 02:12:22,560
how many times I drove from Houston to 
Austin to do the open Mike on Wednesday,

2738
02:12:22,561 --> 02:12:27,090
Joe Rogan and that little stage,
I can tell you looking at your face five

2739
02:12:27,091 --> 02:12:30,450
times and now I was headlining and 
selling the place.

2740
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,653
I just didn't walk in that dog.
I did the open mic for Margie and she 

2741
02:12:34,831 --> 02:12:36,200
would tell me,
you're too dirty for me.

2742
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:38,420
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

2743
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,593
I'll be at the Austin is fucking,
it's really weird to see the growth of 

2744
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:48,930
cities,
but not only that,

2745
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:52,350
to see the growth of comedy in these 
cities,

2746
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,030
Portland,
Oregon,

2747
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:57,120
like that's what happened.
That's how fidelity took over Cuba.

2748
02:12:58,050 --> 02:12:58,883
Just little growth in different areas 
and internet that has made people more 

2749
02:13:03,211 --> 02:13:04,044
aware of comedy.
15 years ago we would go to Houston and 

2750
02:13:06,061 --> 02:13:06,894
be excited.
We would go to New York and maybe like 

2751
02:13:08,761 --> 02:13:09,594
three other places.
Everything else was just a regular town 

2752
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:16,290
down.
And Freetown is excited about your rogue

2753
02:13:16,291 --> 02:13:20,660
and Bert Kreischer fucking,
uh,

2754
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:22,620
the garage.
It's a Chinese girl.

2755
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:24,540
Uh,
Amy Wong,

2756
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:27,900
Allie Allie won.
There's a lot of grace.

2757
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,860
I'm fucking excited about people coming 
town.

2758
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,240
You know,
it's uh,

2759
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:37,050
we've seen this growth.
Like it's been an amazing,

2760
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:37,681
like,
see,

2761
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:40,200
I got into comedy,
I'm the tail.

2762
02:13:40,201 --> 02:13:41,034
And like when I got into comedy,
people were telling you to Tobar kid 

2763
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:44,573
because five years before that ever seen
is we're getting 1500 plus add and 

2764
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:53,010
features again,
2500% and have the line is we're getting

2765
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:56,100
five grandpas and all of a sudden what I
got it,

2766
02:13:56,370 --> 02:14:00,990
I still remember the first notes he gave
us was before you guys get into comedy,

2767
02:14:00,991 --> 02:14:05,460
I went in to tell you what happened to 
the bubble busted and he broke down what

2768
02:14:05,461 --> 02:14:08,310
comics are getting paid.
I didn't give a fuck.

2769
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:10,830
He was just trying to discourage us.
Yeah,

2770
02:14:10,831 --> 02:14:12,090
he's wrong.
He's wrong.

2771
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:14,790
You know what the Bible is not writing 
jokes.

2772
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:15,833
Yeah.
That was the Bible does the Bible in 

2773
02:14:18,001 --> 02:14:18,790
Boston.
I'm,

2774
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:22,170
I'm almost positive.
I don't know what people blame it on the

2775
02:14:22,171 --> 02:14:24,830
access of comedy on television at the 
time.

2776
02:14:24,830 --> 02:14:26,880
I believe that cause the great ones are 
still there.

2777
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:29,820
I think what happened was there was a 
lot of guys that were really,

2778
02:14:29,821 --> 02:14:30,571
really,
really,

2779
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:31,404
really fucking funny cause they had 
taken their act and Polish that 

2780
02:14:33,781 --> 02:14:34,614
motherfucker like a diamond and they,
they brought it to you and it was just 

2781
02:14:37,741 --> 02:14:39,210
perfect.
It was a perfect act,

2782
02:14:39,211 --> 02:14:42,240
but it didn't change.
It was a perfect piece of work.

2783
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:44,580
But they didn't write more.
Some guys did,

2784
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:45,773
but not enough guys dead.
And so people would keep coming back to 

2785
02:14:48,061 --> 02:14:50,550
the shows.
They'd be able to say the jokes word for

2786
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:53,310
word year after year.
Like they'd go to see some guys,

2787
02:14:53,311 --> 02:14:56,850
they would do the same act year after 
year and they never left Boston.

2788
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,043
And it's a very unfortunate thing 
because like when it comes to like 

2789
02:14:59,821 --> 02:15:00,654
proficiency level,
there's guys like Steve Sweeney that 

2790
02:15:02,911 --> 02:15:05,400
used to kill in a way that you're like,
oh my God,

2791
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:07,980
what's the guy that used to drink the 
white Russians and a container?

2792
02:15:08,010 --> 02:15:08,843
Don motherfucking Gavin.
Gavin is one of the stuff for guys out 

2793
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:14,790
in Boston.
When I started that you heard about your

2794
02:15:14,791 --> 02:15:17,670
boy too at the Tony Clark packing some 
heat.

2795
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:21,000
Let him when he was killing it.
And what's the guy that had the shows?

2796
02:15:21,001 --> 02:15:22,560
He was funny.
In 91,

2797
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:23,394
Bro,
Anthony Clark married to Anthony Clark 

2798
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:29,520
was fucking throwing,
he's a merge that murder.

2799
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:30,443
He used to fill the uh,
faneuil hall club with all screaming 

2800
02:15:33,391 --> 02:15:34,224
checks.
I never saw anything like it cause he 

2801
02:15:35,281 --> 02:15:36,600
was cute,
you know,

2802
02:15:36,601 --> 02:15:38,370
and he would,
he would be silly on stage.

2803
02:15:38,371 --> 02:15:40,830
Carl's loved him.
I mean to the point where that place,

2804
02:15:40,831 --> 02:15:43,470
would it be overrun with girls?
It would be like 80,

2805
02:15:43,471 --> 02:15:46,200
20 girls in this faneuil hall common 
connection.

2806
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:47,370
We'd be like,
what the fuck?

2807
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:49,950
Like what are their comic brings in 
girls like this,

2808
02:15:49,951 --> 02:15:51,900
that love him.
And then he's another one,

2809
02:15:51,930 --> 02:15:53,910
they'd see the same bits over and over 
and over again.

2810
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:55,710
They didn't care.
They would find with it.

2811
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:57,420
It's weird.
It was a weird time.

2812
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:02,100
What fucked everybody up was people 
would go to see someone special,

2813
02:16:02,101 --> 02:16:02,934
like Kennison did a special and then he 
tried to do the material from the 

2814
02:16:06,061 --> 02:16:06,894
special on a show and the people already
knew the material and they were like 

2815
02:16:09,631 --> 02:16:10,464
yelling out bits and fucking up beds.
And so I think comics then started 

2816
02:16:13,831 --> 02:16:14,664
realizing once you do like a real 
special and put it on hbo or something 

2817
02:16:18,391 --> 02:16:19,224
like that and it makes you famous,
you got to throw that shit away and 

2818
02:16:21,571 --> 02:16:24,910
write a completely new set.
That's why it's so tough now Tara,

2819
02:16:24,911 --> 02:16:25,744
because you're trying to develop your 
hour on the road and you put your wire 

2820
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,003
the road and you go off and follow a 
week to promote that hour and you got 

2821
02:16:35,261 --> 02:16:36,094
the same half you got half hour or that 
hour unless you're fucking Harry 

2822
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:40,820
Houdini.

2823
02:16:40,820 --> 02:16:41,653
Well now prepare for that already.
When I went through after the last time 

2824
02:16:45,011 --> 02:16:45,844
was a big fucking lesson.
Everybody has that lesson that's going 

2825
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:50,380
through that right now.
I'm just putting this out.

2826
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:51,110
That's it.
Yeah.

2827
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:53,140
Yeah,
and those weeks when you're putting that

2828
02:16:53,141 --> 02:16:54,340
out,
just stay home.

2829
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:55,480
Yeah,
just stay at home.

2830
02:16:55,481 --> 02:16:56,314
Don't embarrass you.
Don't try to do some stay home and get 

2831
02:16:58,181 --> 02:17:02,470
15 minute bits of the show and once you 
get six of those 15 minute bits,

2832
02:17:02,830 --> 02:17:07,830
then you go out and put 45 together.
You start from scratch and then what?

2833
02:17:08,651 --> 02:17:11,410
You still got 30 35 minutes.
Once you shut your bed,

2834
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:13,173
once you shut that 50 minutes,
you still have 35 minutes to work on it 

2835
02:17:15,911 --> 02:17:17,260
again.
There's no shame.

2836
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:22,360
Fucking your boy is an Adam.
We stays home for a fucking year to work

2837
02:17:22,361 --> 02:17:24,520
on an hour and then goes out.
Russell,

2838
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:25,360
Russell Peters.

2839
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:27,250
Yeah,
he stays home for a long time.

2840
02:17:28,260 --> 02:17:29,093
He still does some gigs in the road.
Be MCS and just talks to the crowd Fox 

2841
02:17:31,661 --> 02:17:32,231
with them,
Bro.

2842
02:17:32,231 --> 02:17:34,900
Shout out to our little pep part and a 
Friday night.

2843
02:17:34,901 --> 02:17:37,900
Sound out the stamp of only the second 
comic to do it.

2844
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:40,690
Who sold out the staples?
Gabriel,

2845
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:43,030
did he really?
Jesus Christ,

2846
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:46,750
Friday,
Friday till they get game.

2847
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,700
That's a Laker game.
Gabriel Iglesias,

2848
02:17:48,701 --> 02:17:51,760
hold out a Laker game Friday night at 
the staples center.

2849
02:17:52,090 --> 02:17:54,780
Him and Kevin Hart are the only ones to 
do it.

2850
02:17:54,781 --> 02:17:58,060
An animal and a sock to yourselves.
Murder in it.

2851
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,850
Here's why he's funny.
Anybody can go see him.

2852
02:18:00,851 --> 02:18:02,650
You can take your kids to see him,
your mom to see him.

2853
02:18:02,651 --> 02:18:04,510
He's a nice guy.
Everybody loves him.

2854
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:06,123
You're getting what you want to see.
You getting a funny comedian having a 

2855
02:18:07,991 --> 02:18:12,991
good time.
That sounds fucking thousands.

2856
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,850
I want to say that's at least like 
18,000

2857
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:16,684
people.
I think that might be 25 it might be 

2858
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:19,960
20,000
I think that places dog.

2859
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:21,123
Here's the beautiful thing.
I still remember him paying me $35 or 

2860
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:27,340
the ones and I think I'll do the bicycle
club and he would host.

2861
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:29,200
Wow.
How many people?

2862
02:18:29,201 --> 02:18:31,510
21,000
Jesus Christ.

2863
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:37,240
Oh my God.
That's so many people might have 21,000

2864
02:18:38,681 --> 02:18:39,550
people.
Powerful.

2865
02:18:39,551 --> 02:18:41,500
Gabriel Iglesias.
Holy Shit.

2866
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:43,180
That's nuts guy.
This fucking,

2867
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:44,650
there's,
there's so many.

2868
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:47,470
I'd of comedy.
He's right at the top right now.

2869
02:18:47,471 --> 02:18:50,080
Him and Kevin Hart and t in terms of 
like being able to do that,

2870
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:53,710
especially being able to do that in la.
He's a hero in La.

2871
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:54,573
He's done more shows consecutively at 
the Ice House and sold out like fucking 

2872
02:18:57,131 --> 02:18:58,540
10 years ago.
He was doing that.

2873
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:01,630
He would do like Monday shows,
Tuesday shows two shows,

2874
02:19:01,631 --> 02:19:04,090
Wednesday two shows three if it's just 
fucking crank them out,

2875
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:04,924
man.
He was taking people out to breakfast 

2876
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:08,450
after it shows.
Yeah,

2877
02:19:08,610 --> 02:19:11,700
I'm Christmas Eve after that,
he still got,

2878
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:13,810
he still does two shows on Christmas 
Eve.

2879
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:14,733
That's amazing.
He could do shows at three in the 

2880
02:19:15,551 --> 02:19:16,384
afternoon.
He would do shows to the ice house like 

2881
02:19:17,681 --> 02:19:22,681
whenever he wanted and every path hit 
three in the afternoon fucking pack.

2882
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:26,710
Let's God woo people wanted to see it.
Have a couple of drinks,

2883
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:28,130
watch funny comedy.
Why

2884
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:28,963
not tie cut?
Just just the amount of people that are 

2885
02:19:31,161 --> 02:19:35,020
going out the comedy.
I'm just honored to be a positive thing.

2886
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:36,083
You Know Joey,
you and I have known each other for a 

2887
02:19:36,921 --> 02:19:39,220
long time now and so we've seen like a 
couple of waves.

2888
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:40,330
Oh my God,
no,

2889
02:19:40,331 --> 02:19:42,080
no,
nothing like nothing like this.

2890
02:19:42,081 --> 02:19:42,914
The fuck where you at?
The wiltern sold out and who he is and 

2891
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:51,500
Chappelle and John.
John Mayer at the fucking forum.

2892
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,720
They were sold out too.
He was sold out,

2893
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:57,580
but he did a warm up the night before 
somewhere else like yeah,

2894
02:19:57,620 --> 02:19:59,870
let's just try it out just to see if it 
works.

2895
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:03,980
And that sold out too,
like people are out and about Jack.

2896
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:06,020
Yeah.
People are out and about.

2897
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:07,160
Well,
we're,

2898
02:20:07,161 --> 02:20:07,994
we're very,
very lucky to have dave out there right 

2899
02:20:10,191 --> 02:20:11,060
now,
like,

2900
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:12,053
like doing a lot of comedy.
Like he's the top of the food chain and 

2901
02:20:15,051 --> 02:20:16,160
he's doing a lot of comedy.

2902
02:20:16,170 --> 02:20:17,003
Did two specialists last year in two 
specials this year and they're fucking 

2903
02:20:20,121 --> 02:20:22,050
good man.
One,

2904
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:25,350
he did it from DC.
That is a really good special,

2905
02:20:25,351 --> 02:20:26,210
gosh,
that's a whole,

2906
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:29,000
I enjoyed the shit.
I enjoyed the belly room too,

2907
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:30,860
but yeah,
I love how I have,

2908
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:34,080
I haven't seen that one.
How bout for every age?

2909
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:39,020
Told you the belly room wouldn't work.
You'd go,

2910
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:39,883
fuck.
They're selling belly room when you get 

2911
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:44,810
into a groove and the belly room.
Okay,

2912
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,750
let me break something down here at the 
comedy store and again,

2913
02:20:47,751 --> 02:20:49,480
you're going to go,
we heard this guy's,

2914
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:50,323
no,
you haven't heard this whim because I 

2915
02:20:51,471 --> 02:20:52,304
just found this one out fucking three 
weeks ago when you got sick that night 

2916
02:20:56,180 --> 02:20:58,670
and you couldn't,
I covered for you and the belly room.

2917
02:20:58,700 --> 02:20:59,533
You had the flu and they called me.
That went through the belly flew and he 

2918
02:21:02,871 --> 02:21:03,704
flew though I heard through the belly 
room and I have this shirt analogy gone 

2919
02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:10,460
at the belly room and it just wasn't 
doing it.

2920
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:11,773
The belly room does it where it is.
Why at the belly room does it require 

2921
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:22,280
the efficiency that the original room 
required?

2922
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:25,640
How so?
So you'd be,

2923
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,660
you want to slow it down a little bit 
and the belly rooms out.

2924
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,640
You're saying,
okay,

2925
02:21:28,641 --> 02:21:33,641
so I'm sparring with you and we're not 
doing 50% we're doing 30 now,

2926
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:35,173
right in the belly room.
If we do 50 it's a little too 

2927
02:21:39,291 --> 02:21:41,360
aggressive.
That two right there,

2928
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:42,673
the energy's right there,
and I learned this after 20 fucking 

2929
02:21:45,051 --> 02:21:45,884
years of doing spots that right.
Remember the belly room was where I 

2930
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:49,514
learned the story though.
Before that I was rushing to the 

2931
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:53,933
punchline and not getting into a joke 
out the belly room was where I learned 

2932
02:21:59,060 --> 02:22:03,590
to sit back a little bit and explain 
what the fuck you,

2933
02:22:03,591 --> 02:22:07,430
what it is you're trying to tell us why 
you just kept telling me,

2934
02:22:07,431 --> 02:22:08,520
what did you just say?

2935
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:11,120
There's no segue here.
There's nothing to joey.

2936
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:15,500
You're just eating some girl's asshole 
is great and we don't want to hear that.

2937
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:16,363
We want to hear how you got that.
I learned that in 99 and the belly room 

2938
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:25,100
fucking around and I went back up there 
a couple of weeks ago for me,

2939
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,483
the main room,
I got to come out like a fuck in the 

2940
02:22:28,771 --> 02:22:29,604
main room.
I got to come out like Mike Tyson when 

2941
02:22:31,741 --> 02:22:32,940
he beat up.
Uh,

2942
02:22:32,950 --> 02:22:34,870
what?
What did he beat up in Atlantic city and

2943
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:37,920
knocked him out in the 57 seconds.
Who?

2944
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:40,620
He was part of one of the brothers with 
the mouthpiece.

2945
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:42,540
Leon spinks.
Michael spinks.

2946
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:46,530
I eat dick in the main room.
I last,

2947
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:50,280
I come out jasmine crossing one to a 
different room.

2948
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:51,233
I got to come out one,
two in the main room and the original 

2949
02:22:53,701 --> 02:22:55,340
room,
the gauges.

2950
02:22:55,350 --> 02:22:56,310
Who you're following.

2951
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:01,320
I gotta follow crystal lip with a,
I got who came out this year,

2952
02:23:01,321 --> 02:23:02,154
who came out of that and travis with a 
flying sidekick riddled fabricio 

2953
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:07,530
version.
You got to come out with the flying side

2954
02:23:07,531 --> 02:23:10,150
kick at the original room.
Okay.

2955
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:11,750
There's some people break it down for 
you.

2956
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:14,400
The original room,
you got to follow Joe Rogan,

2957
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:17,910
Chris,
Leah or bill burl like I had a couple of

2958
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:19,920
weeks ago.
I got to come out from the curtain.

2959
02:23:20,430 --> 02:23:22,950
Okay.
Until a flying side kick upward.

2960
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,910
It's just hasn't been done since Bruce 
Lee and the Chinese connection.

2961
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,980
There's no,
it's me.

2962
02:23:28,981 --> 02:23:31,920
And you would usually do a flying 
sidekick from an evil ground.

2963
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:33,720
No,
I got to go upward.

2964
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:37,770
That's their comedy and the fucking 
original rule.

2965
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:41,370
That's where you see me go bananas where
you've seen me at my best,

2966
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:45,960
like crazy red in the face about to have
a heart attack.

2967
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:48,270
Pitching your heart out on stage.

2968
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:51,720
You have to come out with a flying site.
That's a crazy move you,

2969
02:23:51,721 --> 02:23:54,510
but you go on a vertical or a tremendous
up.

2970
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:55,583
You're on your back kick and y'all got 
to get out my shoulders and kick up and 

2971
02:23:58,321 --> 02:24:01,050
tried to get you in the drawer.
That's the original room.

2972
02:24:01,051 --> 02:24:04,230
The belly room,
like the rest on my right hook.

2973
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:07,800
I could rest on my one toe.
The belly room.

2974
02:24:07,801 --> 02:24:08,634
You can,
I could breathe and just throw one twos 

2975
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,153
and keep you off me deep breathe deep.
Kept my composure and even though you 

2976
02:24:17,461 --> 02:24:19,620
hit me with some of those zoom guy,
oh slugs,

2977
02:24:20,090 --> 02:24:21,690
I got him whom?
God,

2978
02:24:21,691 --> 02:24:24,150
no.
If I keep my hands up and stay away from

2979
02:24:24,151 --> 02:24:25,380
you're right,
I'll be okay.

2980
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:26,633
That's the belly room.
That's why the belly room I always 

2981
02:24:29,581 --> 02:24:31,500
thought would be a great place to shoot 
us.

2982
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,820
You know what's great about the belly 
rooms?

2983
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:34,170
The same thing that's great about the 
White House.

2984
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:35,880
The Ice House Annex.
The second room.

2985
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:39,390
Yes.
That's like there's no room for an act.

2986
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:41,250
There's no room for an ax.
It's too intimate.

2987
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:42,413
Like you have to figure out where's the 
no fat aspect of the bet and you got to 

2988
02:24:45,481 --> 02:24:48,690
be tuned into the bet they feel.
With my 55th birthday up there,

2989
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:51,720
I put the Ice House.
What days at,

2990
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:52,613
it's a Saturday.
The 19th so 19th I can't get the comedy 

2991
02:24:55,111 --> 02:24:57,720
store,
so I got the original room.

2992
02:24:57,780 --> 02:24:58,613
I got the a small room at the ice house 
on the 17th and 19th and then the 18th 

2993
02:25:03,901 --> 02:25:08,370
I've got the original room.
I got the belly room at the comedy store

2994
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:11,160
and it's the night before George 
Washington's birthday.

2995
02:25:11,790 --> 02:25:16,140
So I got people doing that one too.
So I turned 55 that weekend.

2996
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:18,690
Oh Shit.
And working out with Uncle Joey,

2997
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:20,910
I only tried to 10 or 15 bucks.

2998
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:24,460
I do that once a month and I go on that 
stage too.

2999
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:26,590
And you just fuck around you just 
reading.

3000
02:25:26,591 --> 02:25:27,424
I write down in a notebook that I don't 
really know about and we develop it 

3001
02:25:30,851 --> 02:25:33,280
together up there and sometimes it's 
phenomenal.

3002
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:35,470
Nine at that time,
it really is phenomenal.

3003
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,850
It's a good idea.
What would they tell you?

3004
02:25:36,851 --> 02:25:37,684
Why?
Because I met 30% I purposely the 

3005
02:25:41,151 --> 02:25:43,840
mandible,
this is purposely,

3006
02:25:44,050 --> 02:25:46,480
I wouldn't do that.
The comedy store on a Saturday night?

3007
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:47,470
No,
no.

3008
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:50,530
I purposely did that ability to take the
edge off.

3009
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:53,200
Okay.
I might even have a shot of alcohol.

3010
02:25:53,230 --> 02:25:54,130
Whoa,
whoa.

3011
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:56,040
Just one.
It's three point.

3012
02:25:56,070 --> 02:25:56,970
Yeah.
Cause,

3013
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,630
oh,
I don't eat much alcohol.

3014
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:00,753
So I'll do it edible and have a little 
shot of alcohol at the Ice House and 

3015
02:26:03,611 --> 02:26:07,420
tape it and always get one or two great 
things.

3016
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:08,254
Joe Rogan,
I'm not going to tell you I got an hour 

3017
02:26:09,971 --> 02:26:10,804
of greatness,
but because you're so relaxed and they 

3018
02:26:14,621 --> 02:26:17,050
know what they're getting,
it's a big difference job.

3019
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:18,880
The comedy store.
Listen,

3020
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:23,770
how do you sharpen metal with metal 
comedy store stones?

3021
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:24,760
You do?
Uh,

3022
02:26:24,761 --> 02:26:25,950
we do.
Uh,

3023
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:26,793
we do a special on June.
May I got to go to the comedy store 

3024
02:26:29,381 --> 02:26:30,700
three nights,
four nights a week.

3025
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:32,270
That me,
that's it.

3026
02:26:32,310 --> 02:26:34,150
That's the gym.
And throw it low that,

3027
02:26:34,270 --> 02:26:36,010
that the WHO's next?
None of no it.

3028
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:37,360
Delete it.
Get up there.

3029
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:39,470
Take,
I do take downs for an hour.

3030
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,880
Take them down.
I don't care how bow,

3031
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:44,570
that's what you do before you shoot a 
thinking.

3032
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:45,850
You need all of it.
Right.

3033
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:47,770
You need to sense,
you need the writing.

3034
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:49,780
You need to set all of it.
You need to riding.

3035
02:26:49,781 --> 02:26:52,900
You need to working out.
Your head's gotta be at the right place.

3036
02:26:52,930 --> 02:26:54,160
Absolutely.
You know what else?

3037
02:26:54,161 --> 02:26:55,660
I think you need,
do you need friendship?

3038
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:57,600
I think that helps.
I think that would,

3039
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,443
I think that when you set up to me on 
the phone the other day and you also 

3040
02:27:01,751 --> 02:27:04,360
know that you got,
when I get there,

3041
02:27:04,361 --> 02:27:06,160
you got to leave some stuff to aggravate
me.

3042
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:10,570
But I've thought about this many times 
like who would I be without you guys?

3043
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:13,270
Like who would I be without you?
Who would I be without Eddie?

3044
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:16,000
Who would that be without red band?
Who would that be without Ari?

3045
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:18,160
Who would that be with that Dunkin?
I think about the same.

3046
02:27:18,161 --> 02:27:19,990
The Thompson girls think about the same 
thing.

3047
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:22,450
Who would I be?
These are these people like Bert.

3048
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:24,060
They mean a lot to me.
Like they're,

3049
02:27:24,061 --> 02:27:26,020
they're very important people.
And then there's your family,

3050
02:27:26,021 --> 02:27:28,390
which is through the moon.
That's that.

3051
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:31,570
That kind of love is very weird.
That that kind of love is over.

3052
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:34,630
Whelming how,
how much it changes who you are.

3053
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:35,613
You have,
you were talking about the tower g come 

3054
02:27:37,691 --> 02:27:40,450
doe the Bruce Lee Book and you were 
saying that,

3055
02:27:40,451 --> 02:27:43,360
you know,
a lot of excerpts were stolen and the,

3056
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,250
I don't even know,
we're not even,

3057
02:27:45,251 --> 02:27:47,320
and that's not the proper word that I 
used.

3058
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:48,533
Play drives.
I have a tie with Joey Diaz and half of 

3059
02:27:52,151 --> 02:27:55,180
that tile is what I learned from Joe 
Rogan.

3060
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:56,583
The other half of that ty was what I 
learned from my Ra and working with 

3061
02:27:58,961 --> 02:28:01,900
Dunkin.
None of us are very original.

3062
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:04,450
I just kicked it up a bit.
Uh,

3063
02:28:04,451 --> 02:28:05,284
one thing I love about you is you didn't
sell teachers that happened to show you 

3064
02:28:08,321 --> 02:28:10,790
don't need to do nothing.
When I go into a town,

3065
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:13,570
I focused on five shows.
I don't want to do your podcast.

3066
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:16,120
I don't want to go see the statue of 
Liberty.

3067
02:28:16,121 --> 02:28:17,260
I really don't.
You're right.

3068
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:20,510
He did a kick ass.
I'm there to go to get them a good meal.

3069
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:22,880
Uh,
after the first show.

3070
02:28:22,881 --> 02:28:24,230
Look,
it's a small club.

3071
02:28:24,231 --> 02:28:28,010
It's sold that let me not go out and 
take pictures.

3072
02:28:28,011 --> 02:28:28,844
Let me focus on the important thing,
which I'm 55 I got to give you 150 

3073
02:28:32,481 --> 02:28:35,600
fucking percent and those are the towel.

3074
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:36,710
You know,
I'm up early.

3075
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:39,680
I do my radio,
I'm up early to get out of there.

3076
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:42,230
Every once in a while on Saturday you 
got to have,

3077
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:44,360
you've got to have a drink with the 
audience,

3078
02:28:45,060 --> 02:28:48,460
a little charlotte on stage or whatever.
You know what I've,

3079
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:51,430
I've come to think of myself as one 
piece of,

3080
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:53,450
I'm a piece of three or four.
You guys,

3081
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:56,060
if you want the truth,
are we,

3082
02:28:56,061 --> 02:29:01,061
I like Ari's relaxation on stage already
takes chances.

3083
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:05,960
Like we all want,
all three of us love to take chances.

3084
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:10,160
That's why we do what we do.
You're not gonna get the same hour,

3085
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:13,100
year out the fucking,
he had not even close.

3086
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:16,470
We also have a similar style of mixing 
everything up.

3087
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:18,380
Yeah,
I have.

3088
02:29:18,470 --> 02:29:20,660
Everybody has their own towel,
man.

3089
02:29:21,170 --> 02:29:22,003
You know Bruce Lee just,
he just wanted to teach you how to 

3090
02:29:25,251 --> 02:29:27,500
combine it and that's what we're doing 
right now.

3091
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:29,600
For sure.
You'd think I'm johnny original.

3092
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:32,330
I'd take a little bit.
I learned from Bert.

3093
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:35,660
I learned from Tom,
I learned from Bill Burr,

3094
02:29:36,110 --> 02:29:40,640
I learned from Dave Chapelle and now 
this is your art again,

3095
02:29:41,330 --> 02:29:42,163
there's every,
the arm bar is the same whether I go to 

3096
02:29:44,001 --> 02:29:45,750
you or John Jockey and showing me the 
same thing,

3097
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:48,020
but it's how I do it.
Yup.

3098
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:49,430
Yup.
It's the same point.

3099
02:29:49,431 --> 02:29:50,264
It's a really good point.
I think there's no way you could ever 

3100
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:53,923
say any one person is not influenced 
because every single style of standup 

3101
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:58,153
comedy is in some way or another or 
originated was like the Lenny Bruce's 

3102
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:05,660
and you know the,
the Dick Gregory's and the,

3103
02:30:05,661 --> 02:30:07,160
you know the guys who were doing it.
Wait,

3104
02:30:07,210 --> 02:30:11,240
the danger fields guys doing it way back
in the day and even Bob Hope,

3105
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:13,970
all those guys,
they started this thing.

3106
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:14,923
You got to think the world has had no 
standup comedy up until like what a 

3107
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:21,800
hundred and fucking 50 years ago or 
something.

3108
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:24,380
That's nothing.
This shit just started and the owner was

3109
02:30:24,381 --> 02:30:27,230
one of the first guys to do it.
Mark motherfucking twain.

3110
02:30:27,470 --> 02:30:28,303
Mark motherfucking twain would do 
readings of his book and it was funny 

3111
02:30:30,651 --> 02:30:34,040
and people would laugh.
He was in front of people rocking.

3112
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:35,053
He was killing.
He's telling stories and reading and 

3113
02:30:37,491 --> 02:30:39,350
people thought he was hilarious.
He would give speeches.

3114
02:30:40,110 --> 02:30:42,680
They found somebody before Mark Twain,
I'm sure,

3115
02:30:42,770 --> 02:30:45,350
but he was really popular writer years 
ago.

3116
02:30:45,351 --> 02:30:49,900
Yet they is living proof that that 
standards existed before him.

3117
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:51,790
Uh,
uh,

3118
02:30:53,140 --> 02:30:57,980
uh,
a form of this art form existed before.

3119
02:30:58,310 --> 02:31:00,140
Yeah.
It's sub civilization.

3120
02:31:00,141 --> 02:31:02,300
I did read that a couple of years,
I'm sure.

3121
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:04,370
Subdued.
Yes.

3122
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:09,790
There was some store and because,
and now I see myself on stage.

3123
02:31:10,061 --> 02:31:13,730
It's like when I take my sets now pro,
I hear,

3124
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:16,860
I hear a little Joe Rogan.
I hear a little arriving.

3125
02:31:18,110 --> 02:31:20,100
I hear a little lenny bruce.
I love when

3126
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,980
he bruises.
Yeah,

3127
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:22,853
man,
man.

3128
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:24,690
Dig.
That's,

3129
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:27,810
I love that Levy.
Bruce said Shit that you didn't know.

3130
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:29,130
People said,
fuck.

3131
02:31:29,131 --> 02:31:30,210
Yeah.
And it wasn't dirty.

3132
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:32,940
Not just a certain word.
Like when I go on stage that,

3133
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:34,640
you know,
uh,

3134
02:31:34,820 --> 02:31:35,653
you want,
you don't want to know my leukemia and 

3135
02:31:36,741 --> 02:31:39,180
the place,
my Luchia is those mergers.

3136
02:31:39,181 --> 02:31:39,661
Like,
what's he,

3137
02:31:39,661 --> 02:31:40,301
what's he saying?
Right,

3138
02:31:40,301 --> 02:31:40,840
right,
right.

3139
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:42,270
My Luke,
it's just bad luck,

3140
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:45,740
but that's something Lenny Clarke with 
say the fuck were you?

3141
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:48,240
He put them a luke on me.
You know what I'm saying?

3142
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:53,460
We were all,
we're not plagiarizing or doing anything

3143
02:31:53,461 --> 02:31:54,241
like that.
No,

3144
02:31:54,241 --> 02:31:55,074
we're influenced.
We're influenced and muscle wrong with 

3145
02:31:57,001 --> 02:31:58,620
that.
One thing that's important is,

3146
02:31:58,621 --> 02:32:00,310
uh,
we're all real fans of comedy.

3147
02:32:00,311 --> 02:32:01,260
I know.
You're still a fan.

3148
02:32:01,290 --> 02:32:03,780
You still enjoy watching common hell of 
it.

3149
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:06,650
I go to the fourth wall a lot.
Chair,

3150
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:07,523
rugged.

3151
02:32:08,070 --> 02:32:13,070
The fourth wall was with Mickey told 
rocky to do dog.

3152
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:15,390
I gotta you don't mean I got to take him
out of the rock.

3153
02:32:15,391 --> 02:32:16,650
Nikki told rocky do.
Why?

3154
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:21,060
Because,
because he wanted he,

3155
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:22,680
somebody took all,
no,

3156
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:25,080
I'm sorry.
Apollo took rocky.

3157
02:32:25,110 --> 02:32:26,060
Oh,
dirty gym.

3158
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:27,373
Some look at that.
Look at these motherfucker taking it 

3159
02:32:28,791 --> 02:32:30,120
back.
No,

3160
02:32:30,121 --> 02:32:30,571
no,
no,

3161
02:32:30,571 --> 02:32:31,260
no,
no.

3162
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:33,810
He took him to his own black gym and he 
goes,

3163
02:32:33,811 --> 02:32:37,260
I wanted you to look at these guys so 
you can look at their eyes.

3164
02:32:37,261 --> 02:32:38,094
And he goes,
remember when your eyes used to be like 

3165
02:32:39,391 --> 02:32:40,224
that?
Ooh,

3166
02:32:40,230 --> 02:32:41,160
that's right.
He goes,

3167
02:32:41,161 --> 02:32:43,230
remember when your eyes used to be like 
that rock?

3168
02:32:43,231 --> 02:32:44,064
So lately I've been going before I go 
out and then they go to the fourth wall 

3169
02:32:46,801 --> 02:32:50,760
and North Hollywood and I pay $5 to do 
five minutes.

3170
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:54,510
And the rule is you have to sit there,
you know,

3171
02:32:54,511 --> 02:32:57,030
most open Mike should do your state's 
time and you leave.

3172
02:32:57,950 --> 02:33:01,380
You have to sit down and watch others.
Why did I tell you something?

3173
02:33:01,381 --> 02:33:06,130
The last six weeks I've learned more 
from watching these open Mike,

3174
02:33:06,131 --> 02:33:11,131
hers than anything because I also 
realized that where I was when I was one

3175
02:33:12,451 --> 02:33:15,810
of these guys,
I wanted what I had.

3176
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:20,811
Right now I want it to be a headline.
I wanted to not be a rich guy,

3177
02:33:23,731 --> 02:33:24,564
but I wanted to just be funny.
I want it to be accepted as a comedian 

3178
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:30,570
and ever since I've been going to the 
fourth wall,

3179
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:32,460
I go there three or four nights a week.
Joe Rogan,

3180
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:36,030
I pay $5 to do five minutes.
I'm no better than anybody else,

3181
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:37,523
but the main thing is he asked me what I
want to go up and I always tell him 

3182
02:33:40,771 --> 02:33:45,060
towards the end because I want to watch 
these kids and joy.

3183
02:33:45,061 --> 02:33:49,380
Every time I leave that Bri leave 
laughing and I fucking learned something

3184
02:33:50,130 --> 02:33:52,620
and I'm back.
No alcohol and that Joe Rogan.

3185
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:53,613
Hmm.
Just fucking eight people watching you 

3186
02:33:55,591 --> 02:33:56,424
do five minutes.
I want you to think about when you were 

3187
02:33:59,881 --> 02:34:02,860
doing five minutes and what was going 
through your head.

3188
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:05,950
I'm just telling you my heart's beating 
because I stood.

3189
02:34:05,951 --> 02:34:08,190
I remember bombing and leaving there 
thinking,

3190
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:09,473
Nah,
I'm going to have to get a little way 

3191
02:34:09,811 --> 02:34:13,350
the job or now you're going to have to 
get a cook job.

3192
02:34:13,351 --> 02:34:17,980
These guys all have day jobs.
They all talked about this jobs,

3193
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:20,740
but every time I go to the fourth ward,
Bro,

3194
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:24,850
I fucking learned something.
I go there some nights I go to flappers,

3195
02:34:25,210 --> 02:34:27,130
I go there some nights I go to the 
store,

3196
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:32,940
I go there some nights I go to the how I
do it that way,

3197
02:34:32,981 --> 02:34:33,814
but I always go there and every time I 
go there I always go there with like 

3198
02:34:36,911 --> 02:34:37,744
five minutes planned pro.
It doesn't even hit the stage because 

3199
02:34:41,741 --> 02:34:45,610
from watching those guys I learned 
something and I remember something and I

3200
02:34:45,611 --> 02:34:46,444
just come up with this crazy story so I 
look at it as like a like doing 

3201
02:34:50,681 --> 02:34:52,390
kettlebells.
Yeah,

3202
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:55,060
that's a good way to look at it.
I really do.

3203
02:34:55,061 --> 02:34:55,894
I look at these young guys and I 
remember that pain and that confusion 

3204
02:34:58,301 --> 02:34:59,134
that I had that fucking feeling you had 
when you were an open mike or in your 

3205
02:35:02,741 --> 02:35:06,310
friends are telling me you were funny,
but you still had to drive the limo,

3206
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:07,173
keep the paper job route or still drop 
off papers or whatever the fuck job you 

3207
02:35:11,081 --> 02:35:11,914
said you had.

3208
02:35:12,190 --> 02:35:14,950
You told me the story about meeting at 
he Atlantic's and all that.

3209
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:20,340
You're still in that crossroads of 
comedy where you don't know what to do,

3210
02:35:20,381 --> 02:35:25,381
but you know in your fucking hard that 
you just can't wait to be a headliner if

3211
02:35:26,431 --> 02:35:29,500
somebody would just give you a chance.
Back then,

3212
02:35:29,501 --> 02:35:31,600
I wasn't even thinking I can never be a 
headliner.

3213
02:35:31,690 --> 02:35:34,000
I was really just hoping I could make a 
living.

3214
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:38,560
I never thought I'd wind up being,
when you mean living,

3215
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:42,130
you mean food?
A one bedroom cable TV.

3216
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:44,740
There was a guy that had a fucking loft.
He was the king.

3217
02:35:45,080 --> 02:35:45,913
I had a loft it,
they'd taken a school house and turned 

3218
02:35:47,921 --> 02:35:49,870
it into condominiums.
This guy,

3219
02:35:49,871 --> 02:35:50,920
I never,
I'll never forget.

3220
02:35:50,921 --> 02:35:51,754
I looked up to him like I couldn't 
believe where he was living in Dj 

3221
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:54,851
Hazard.
That's his name.

3222
02:35:54,851 --> 02:35:56,850
Hilarious comedian.
Oh my God.

3223
02:35:56,850 --> 02:35:57,820
He Damn.
Sure.

3224
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:00,740
Well Dj has always been a real nice guy 
and an excellent guy.

3225
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:02,350
Very funny,
very funny guy.

3226
02:36:02,351 --> 02:36:03,184
Always has been,
but I remember he had like a loft 

3227
02:36:05,231 --> 02:36:07,180
apartment.
I remember everybody talked about it.

3228
02:36:07,181 --> 02:36:08,990
It's like what?
This got brick walls inside.

3229
02:36:09,770 --> 02:36:11,020
He was like,
he was the king.

3230
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:13,160
He was living like an adult.
But he was,

3231
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:16,480
he was a standup comedian.
Like everybody else.

3232
02:36:16,481 --> 02:36:17,920
We had thought about like,
you know,

3233
02:36:17,921 --> 02:36:18,754
you're living like you're barely getting
by stuffing a bunch of guys and do a 

3234
02:36:20,351 --> 02:36:21,440
house.
You know,

3235
02:36:21,470 --> 02:36:24,580
there was a lot of like comedy flop 
houses or comedians would wind up moving

3236
02:36:24,581 --> 02:36:25,414
in together or you're living in some 
shitty apartment and he could barely 

3237
02:36:27,671 --> 02:36:28,504
afford.
Are you living with your girlfriend or 

3238
02:36:29,411 --> 02:36:30,244
something?
It's weird when you go back and think 

3239
02:36:34,031 --> 02:36:34,990
about it,
you know?

3240
02:36:35,770 --> 02:36:36,390
Okay.

3241
02:36:36,390 --> 02:36:38,660
Like you coulda quit at any time.
Think about it.

3242
02:36:38,661 --> 02:36:42,860
Think about it your early days when it's
terrible and it just bombed all the time

3243
02:36:42,861 --> 02:36:45,970
and you're like,
it really?

3244
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:47,353
Yeah.
I watched some do with set one night at 

3245
02:36:48,570 --> 02:36:53,570
the old triple and in front of 8 million
people and he and his mind,

3246
02:36:54,090 --> 02:36:55,830
he was at the garden though.
Wow.

3247
02:36:55,831 --> 02:36:59,580
It's like I get it now,
but where's your meat to Pitt?

3248
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:03,570
I left it at home.
You know who,

3249
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:06,930
uh,
one of the most proud moments as a young

3250
02:37:06,931 --> 02:37:08,700
comedian when,
uh,

3251
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:12,840
I was at the comedy store and um,
uh,

3252
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,590
I did a set in front,
you know,

3253
02:37:15,591 --> 02:37:18,170
like literally like maybe five or six 
people,

3254
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:22,640
but I did,
it is hard as I would do it in a regular

3255
02:37:22,641 --> 02:37:25,760
room and I heard in the back,
Paul Mooney going right,

3256
02:37:25,900 --> 02:37:29,340
ah,
ah,

3257
02:37:29,490 --> 02:37:30,930
laugh,
laughing and support.

3258
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:33,810
You know how Paul Mooney would laugh and
support and you would go,

3259
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,673
oh shit,
I just got the green light from Paul 

3260
02:37:36,631 --> 02:37:37,464
fucking Mooney.
Like Paul Mooney was laughing at my 

3261
02:37:39,181 --> 02:37:40,014
shit.
Then he came up to me after a show and 

3262
02:37:41,371 --> 02:37:42,750
he goes,
he goes,

3263
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:44,190
you're a real comic.
He's like,

3264
02:37:44,191 --> 02:37:46,590
you did that show in front of all those 
people.

3265
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:47,723
And he goes,
you knew that there was five fucking 

3266
02:37:49,021 --> 02:37:50,250
people in that room.
You did that show.

3267
02:37:50,251 --> 02:37:52,290
Like it was packed and does,
that's a real comic.

3268
02:37:52,650 --> 02:37:53,483
He goes,
you made me laugh.

3269
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:56,280
That's what you learn to become.
It kind of like a,

3270
02:37:56,281 --> 02:37:58,590
Paul Mooney says that to you when you're
just coming up,

3271
02:37:58,591 --> 02:37:59,760
you're like,
Holy Shit.

3272
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:01,350
Like,
I might be able to figure this out.

3273
02:38:01,380 --> 02:38:02,400
I might be able to do this.

3274
02:38:04,530 --> 02:38:05,363
It's big,
right?

3275
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:07,410
Someone coming up to you,
you know,

3276
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:10,350
it's crazy when you do a spot at the 
store,

3277
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:12,660
you low,
you're in the big leagues Bro.

3278
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:15,810
Like no matter where I do a spot,
when I travel,

3279
02:38:15,811 --> 02:38:19,020
that's one day when I'm at the store on 
Thursday night,

3280
02:38:19,021 --> 02:38:20,160
Tuesday night,
you know,

3281
02:38:20,161 --> 02:38:20,994
you're in some fucking good company.
You're doing something right or you did 

3282
02:38:23,941 --> 02:38:25,040
something right.
Yes.

3283
02:38:26,910 --> 02:38:30,270
I love when comics are in the room.
I love laughing at comics.

3284
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:35,040
I love going to the stolen early and 
catch and two or three great calming.

3285
02:38:35,041 --> 02:38:37,380
So laughing and that makes my fucking 
night.

3286
02:38:37,890 --> 02:38:42,890
Whether it's you or even Bobby Lee is so
fucking out of his mind on stage.

3287
02:38:43,770 --> 02:38:44,603
You know,
lately we've been getting around whites 

3288
02:38:45,931 --> 02:38:50,610
and the fucking uh,
Bill Gilbert.

3289
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:51,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

3290
02:38:51,950 --> 02:38:52,783
I mean Ron White,
Bill Burr last week there was a lineup 

3291
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:57,210
last how's there?
All the time.

3292
02:38:57,240 --> 02:39:01,050
There was a lineup last week that was 
just ridiculous and two weeks ago,

3293
02:39:01,530 --> 02:39:02,820
but then I saw you down there.

3294
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:04,840
That was just ridiculous.
Places on fire.

3295
02:39:05,630 --> 02:39:07,290
I the weighed down.
I have anxiety,

3296
02:39:07,291 --> 02:39:08,124
you know,
I puked on the car one time on the way 

3297
02:39:09,271 --> 02:39:12,800
down there from the anxiety of going 
down and following while I'm having this

3298
02:39:12,801 --> 02:39:15,930
surgery at March 5th for your ear?
Yeah.

3299
02:39:16,050 --> 02:39:18,720
And what do they have to do exactly?
Put a tube in there.

3300
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:21,060
Whoa.
To drain the fluid.

3301
02:39:21,090 --> 02:39:22,350
What's,
what fluids in your ear?

3302
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:23,513
Whenever I have,
it's getting to the point where with 

3303
02:39:25,351 --> 02:39:28,140
some brown for the last six months I've 
been living with plugs.

3304
02:39:28,141 --> 02:39:33,070
When I go to the shower now I got weigh 
a blog when they go to git.

3305
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:35,430
So why?
What's going on with your ears?

3306
02:39:35,460 --> 02:39:38,070
Because the fluid goes in.
I don't know dog.

3307
02:39:38,430 --> 02:39:40,980
I stuck a bean in my head when I was 
six.

3308
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:43,660
I was playing that game,
please.

3309
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:44,503
I spill the beans and then you stuck 
when you're here and fucked it up and 

3310
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:48,150
they couldn't get it out and I just left
it,

3311
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:50,570
then brought it over.
It went in there.

3312
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:54,190
My mother put hot oil in there.
They took all out.

3313
02:39:54,191 --> 02:39:56,630
Where the fuck Oh,
they took her to a chair.

3314
02:39:56,790 --> 02:40:01,230
So they wrecked my esl.
Today I get a doctor didn't take it out.

3315
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:02,350
Yeah,
I went up to La,

3316
02:40:02,740 --> 02:40:03,630
uh,
the,

3317
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:08,670
the Jewish hospital 68th and Broadway.
That how that's hurting my ear.

3318
02:40:08,671 --> 02:40:10,270
Just thinking about it.
So now,

3319
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:14,040
50 years later,
because my driving

3320
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:16,680
or whatever,
now I get carsick oh look,

3321
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:17,533
equilibrium.
So I have to even wear ear plugs when I 

3322
02:40:20,041 --> 02:40:21,750
walked,
go on walks and the tide,

3323
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:26,250
I got to wear ear plugs because if not,
the sweat goes in my ear.

3324
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:30,390
You know what I used to get a terrible 
fucking car sickness from trying to read

3325
02:40:30,391 --> 02:40:31,410
a book in a car.
Oh yeah.

3326
02:40:31,411 --> 02:40:34,000
You cannot do anything like that.
The car after a while,

3327
02:40:34,001 --> 02:40:34,834
you're just like all,
especially with reading glasses at this 

3328
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:40,980
really poor design and try to read your 
twitter Jack,

3329
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:42,623
come around that turn where the four or 
five hits the one o one and see what 

3330
02:40:46,831 --> 02:40:50,460
happens to your fucking stomach.
It's a weird thing,

3331
02:40:50,461 --> 02:40:51,600
huh?
Motion sickness.

3332
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:55,380
Some people get it all the time.
I get it all the time.

3333
02:40:55,410 --> 02:40:56,211
Not,
I'm playing,

3334
02:40:56,211 --> 02:40:57,870
it's not,
I get it.

3335
02:40:57,871 --> 02:41:01,260
If I get high and get on a boat,
go down the Jersey shore,

3336
02:41:01,261 --> 02:41:02,340
getting on a boat,
I'm done.

3337
02:41:02,730 --> 02:41:05,220
I got to take the pills I was at treat 
those pills.

3338
02:41:05,221 --> 02:41:08,650
Drama mean that stuff is brutal.
That stuff is rather BCC.

3339
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:10,470
You gotta be tired.
I'd rather be sick.

3340
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:11,910
I'll throw up.
I don't give a fuck.

3341
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:13,303
That sucks.
But at least I don't feel like I'm 

3342
02:41:15,691 --> 02:41:18,030
drugged out.
Like I fell asleep in a diner.

3343
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:22,170
Me and my friend Jimmy Utilia,
we went out blue fish fishing.

3344
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:23,063
I'm on those tea party boats and the way
home we stopped at a darn and gets on 

3345
02:41:25,151 --> 02:41:28,920
me.
I literally fell asleep head down on the

3346
02:41:28,921 --> 02:41:29,754
table.
I literally was like drugged out where 

3347
02:41:31,381 --> 02:41:32,370
you are.
The drama being.

3348
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:33,181
Yeah.
It was on drama,

3349
02:41:33,181 --> 02:41:38,181
Maine and I was only like 150 pounds 
back then.

3350
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:41,530
154 pounds.
That was like what,

3351
02:41:41,570 --> 02:41:44,160
what I was weighing when I was competing
and uh,

3352
02:41:44,161 --> 02:41:46,230
I'd never did anything.
I didn't do anything.

3353
02:41:46,231 --> 02:41:46,950
I didn't drink.

3354
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:49,200
I didn't smoke pot and then I didn't do 
shit.

3355
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:51,270
So in that drama,
meaning in my system,

3356
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:53,220
my sister was like,
check please.

3357
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:55,280
It just shut down.
I couldn't hear.

3358
02:41:55,290 --> 02:41:58,800
I had no tolerance at all.
I fell completely asleep at a diner,

3359
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:02,910
but I tried to take with my friend Jimmy
took,

3360
02:42:02,911 --> 02:42:04,800
he's way bigger than me.
I think I just overdosed.

3361
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:05,873
It will be,
it's just something where the Harvey 

3362
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:10,710
Weinstein gets out of Rehab and he wants
to come on the podcast.

3363
02:42:10,711 --> 02:42:12,090
We do let them month.
Um,

3364
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:14,280
I let them out of,
you're coming on to why?

3365
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:15,480
Because we're going to have some fun 
with them.

3366
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:16,920
Oh yeah,
it's hot box him.

3367
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:19,790
We want that.
We want the fucking real for that.

3368
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,240
She's got some crazy,
you can't,

3369
02:42:21,241 --> 02:42:23,400
you can't,
you can't have them anywhere.

3370
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:25,260
You know that guy,
especially in the middle.

3371
02:42:25,261 --> 02:42:27,390
We were joking around folks,
especially in the middle of a trial,

3372
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:29,180
because he's in the middle of like a ton
of trial.

3373
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:30,031
Oh,
well he comes back,

3374
02:42:30,031 --> 02:42:32,880
he's going to get charged.
I for sure something's going to happen.

3375
02:42:32,910 --> 02:42:33,743
There's so many different trials in 
terms of like civil lawsuits and stuff 

3376
02:42:36,650 --> 02:42:39,450
and it's a lot of women saying he did 
horrible things.

3377
02:42:40,350 --> 02:42:43,170
It's undoubtedly,
there's no way he's going to skate.

3378
02:42:43,450 --> 02:42:46,440
Something's to happen.
Something civic trial,

3379
02:42:46,441 --> 02:42:49,140
criminal trial.
Some days I have several trials.

3380
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:52,350
Absolutely.
We're changing as a species.

3381
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:53,213
That's what's happening and in the way 
it's like we're making it up as we go 

3382
02:42:56,461 --> 02:42:58,620
along and there's a lot of rocky things 
that are happening,

3383
02:42:58,621 --> 02:42:59,454
a lot of chaos and,
but this is awareness of like what you 

3384
02:43:02,881 --> 02:43:03,714
should and shouldn't do to human beings 
in terms of like forcing yourself on 

3385
02:43:07,081 --> 02:43:10,650
people and you know fucking them when 
they say no,

3386
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:12,430
it's like rape and

3387
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:17,670
the idea that we're still doing that in 
2018 and people are doing it at a really

3388
02:43:17,981 --> 02:43:19,990
high level.
It's like boy,

3389
02:43:20,090 --> 02:43:21,550
bye of creepy.
Thanks.

3390
02:43:21,551 --> 02:43:23,560
I'm over to this fucking town.
Of course,

3391
02:43:23,561 --> 02:43:26,350
right off the bat,
soon as I got here,

3392
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:31,380
I heard the creepiest pocket things.
Boy You got into like the movies,

3393
02:43:31,571 --> 02:43:36,571
like I heard he was creepy things and I 
saw creepy bayview and listen,

3394
02:43:36,911 --> 02:43:39,700
Ben,
you've ever want to call a fucking spade

3395
02:43:39,701 --> 02:43:41,230
a spade because you're getting in 
trouble.

3396
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:43,300
But you look at Kevin,
what's his name?

3397
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:44,920
Spark was event.
Which guy?

3398
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,560
Kevin Spacey and Kevin Spacey.
You can't tell he sucks.

3399
02:43:47,561 --> 02:43:52,561
Dick puncher knew he would suck a dick 
part time and we looked at Kevin Spacey.

3400
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:56,440
If you look at that fucking dude,
Lee Harvey Weinstein,

3401
02:43:56,441 --> 02:43:57,274
you can't tell that.
That dude would make you suck his dick 

3402
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:03,190
before.
Think about that and all of these people

3403
02:44:03,191 --> 02:44:04,060
took pictures with him.

3404
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:05,113
Would that be to the fuck?
Are they agents that actually sent you 

3405
02:44:06,521 --> 02:44:09,820
on that mission to Lee harveys fucking 
hotel room?

3406
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:10,923
I want to know where the fuck they are.
They didn't know that Lee Harvey was 

3407
02:44:13,841 --> 02:44:14,674
going to come out with a massage and 
asked you to suck his fucking deck or 

3408
02:44:17,830 --> 02:44:21,010
watch them naked pro.
We knew for a long fucking time.

3409
02:44:21,250 --> 02:44:23,770
Everybody knew when there's a fucking 
gap,

3410
02:44:24,340 --> 02:44:27,430
when you have a dream and you have 
power,

3411
02:44:27,700 --> 02:44:29,680
a lot of things could happen.
I mean,

3412
02:44:29,681 --> 02:44:30,514
I'm no fucking liberace,
but I got my Dick's up at the comedy 

3413
02:44:33,490 --> 02:44:37,840
store just because of being a comedian 
and some real thought that you were like

3414
02:44:37,841 --> 02:44:41,020
had supernatural powers.
It's fucking crazy.

3415
02:44:41,470 --> 02:44:44,470
And if you don't know about fucking 
Hollywood,

3416
02:44:44,471 --> 02:44:45,304
listen man,
they'd been fucking people till they're 

3417
02:44:47,111 --> 02:44:50,470
dead for you.
Look at this fucking Marilyn Monroe.

3418
02:44:50,830 --> 02:44:54,440
They kicked that bitch and you don't,
who else was a dirty motherfucker?

3419
02:44:54,460 --> 02:44:55,293
That fucking liberace.
That guy was making you sign contracts 

3420
02:44:58,061 --> 02:45:01,620
making you fucking have plastic surgery 
making you have places like clam him.

3421
02:45:01,960 --> 02:45:06,200
Are you fucking kidding me?
There's been some creepy fucking shit in

3422
02:45:06,201 --> 02:45:09,750
this town you got away with for fucking 
zillions.

3423
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:12,220
He is.
And now I tell you what,

3424
02:45:12,221 --> 02:45:14,560
man,
I'm more for the movement.

3425
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:16,690
I'm all for it.
I have a daughter.

3426
02:45:16,691 --> 02:45:18,730
You have daughters.
I have sisters.

3427
02:45:18,731 --> 02:45:19,564
I got friends.
I tell you would fucking bothers me the 

3428
02:45:22,331 --> 02:45:23,200
most.
I tell.

3429
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:24,790
The only thing that bothers me out of 
this,

3430
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:25,833
you know what bro?

3431
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:33,420
Who was in pappy on with Steve Mcqueen?
I don't remember Dustin Hoffman was him.

3432
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,870
If he fingered bank,
get a 73 shut the fuck up.

3433
02:45:38,980 --> 02:45:41,410
Shut the fuck up.
People changed.

3434
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:46,630
I'm not the same guy who kidnap can't 
bell in 1987 I'm not sorry Joe.

3435
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:47,793
I'm not.
So how are you going to come back at me 

3436
02:45:49,181 --> 02:45:53,170
about something I didn't like deep 
bought an 87 I was a different guy.

3437
02:45:53,171 --> 02:45:54,004
I was doing blow.
I had asked you to finger bang yet you 

3438
02:45:56,561 --> 02:45:58,390
can't do that.
That I don't want to do.

3439
02:45:58,630 --> 02:46:03,370
Don't let somebody fucking career cause 
he stuck a finger in your ass and 92 and

3440
02:46:03,371 --> 02:46:06,010
now it came back to you to the scale of 
Amnesia.

3441
02:46:06,310 --> 02:46:09,320
You can't do that to me.
You want to call me out personally,

3442
02:46:09,530 --> 02:46:11,810
call me the fuck out.
Call me at home and go,

3443
02:46:11,811 --> 02:46:12,644
hey man,
in [inaudible] 94 one that you asked me 

3444
02:46:14,241 --> 02:46:16,520
if you could eat my ass hole,
who said you were wrong?

3445
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:18,650
Listen,
I was doing an eight ball a day.

3446
02:46:18,651 --> 02:46:19,770
What do you want from me?
All right.

3447
02:46:20,210 --> 02:46:21,043
I resolved that issue that I understand,
but don't call me out on something like 

3448
02:46:24,651 --> 02:46:28,250
that.
1972 people fucking change pro.

3449
02:46:28,730 --> 02:46:30,400
That's what pissed me off.
Giant.

3450
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:35,630
There's a tiny gaps we're talking about 
like the chair pivot and it was 1985 and

3451
02:46:35,631 --> 02:46:40,370
don't fucking call me out.
If you call me out,

3452
02:46:40,820 --> 02:46:43,370
call me out with a friend.
Whether you're talking about,

3453
02:46:43,550 --> 02:46:46,810
look at what level though,
if it gets to rape a dog.

3454
02:46:47,060 --> 02:46:48,380
Hold on.
Listen,

3455
02:46:48,410 --> 02:46:50,300
the way I come from,
that's not even allowed.

3456
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:51,673
That word never entered my mind.
I'm talking about if I was coked out of 

3457
02:46:55,761 --> 02:46:57,140
the bar one night.
Now what I'm telling,

3458
02:46:57,141 --> 02:46:57,974
I told you I'd tell these were banging 
and I want to put a coke rock in your 

3459
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:01,613
asshole.
You can't come at me for some in 1988 

3460
02:47:03,981 --> 02:47:05,270
cause I used to do what every other 
night.

3461
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:07,160
That was my opening line.
Listen,

3462
02:47:07,161 --> 02:47:07,994
your ass hoes on fire.
What's it gonna take for me to stick my 

3463
02:47:10,401 --> 02:47:11,234
tongue in that fucking thing and make 
that thing you know you're not going to 

3464
02:47:14,301 --> 02:47:15,134
listen.
You're not going to get a piece of ass 

3465
02:47:16,221 --> 02:47:19,070
by selling somebody real estate.
You've got to sell them Dick.

3466
02:47:19,190 --> 02:47:21,020
Well,
the ones that it works on,

3467
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:22,203
that's the ones you want.
Like if you can go up to a gal and say 

3468
02:47:24,291 --> 02:47:25,580
that to her,
Oh,

3469
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:26,953
you gotta write me already.
Where if I knew who you were a girl and 

3470
02:47:30,081 --> 02:47:33,860
I knew you did coke and you had that 
certain look in your eyes,

3471
02:47:33,890 --> 02:47:38,890
what's the cluck to the look?
That is when you do cocaine,

3472
02:47:40,851 --> 02:47:41,684
you do dirty fucking things.
So when you look at a girl that's doing 

3473
02:47:45,531 --> 02:47:50,120
cocaine and she's like,
she suggest to you that she's going back

3474
02:47:50,121 --> 02:47:51,290
to your hotel with you.

3475
02:47:51,770 --> 02:47:52,603
It's time.
Nobody goes back to the hotel with you 

3476
02:47:55,641 --> 02:48:00,530
when they have a boyfriend.
If you're doing coke at time,

3477
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:03,890
because percentages keep getting go 
higher and higher.

3478
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:06,110
What Cook apparently makes people 
promiscuous,

3479
02:48:06,111 --> 02:48:06,550
right?
Right.

3480
02:48:06,550 --> 02:48:09,320
It makes people go fucking bananas to go
suck a Dick.

3481
02:48:09,321 --> 02:48:13,880
So you take somebody who's wife up to 
your hotel room and then 6:00

3482
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:14,713
AM she's doing coke with you.
You'll notice that one of the times she 

3483
02:48:16,911 --> 02:48:19,070
comes out of the bathroom,
the button,

3484
02:48:19,071 --> 02:48:20,780
it'll be opened.
You know what I'm saying?

3485
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:22,123
Then the next time she comes out,
she'll come out to tell you a story and 

3486
02:48:25,161 --> 02:48:28,610
her pants will come out and show button 
them in front of the little things start

3487
02:48:28,611 --> 02:48:32,000
to happen if you signs and pretty soon 
you're like,

3488
02:48:32,001 --> 02:48:32,691
listen,
nothing.

3489
02:48:32,691 --> 02:48:34,430
Nothing.
Take off your pants.

3490
02:48:34,431 --> 02:48:36,360
I'm gonna see you play with your pussy.
Do,

3491
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:37,383
do,
do,

3492
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:38,270
do,
do,

3493
02:48:38,270 --> 02:48:38,390
do.

3494
02:48:38,390 --> 02:48:40,920
That's what the,
what gets me right now is the,

3495
02:48:41,220 --> 02:48:43,870
the 20 year call out,
the 30 call.

3496
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:46,220
I ain't going to ruin Dustin Hoffman's 
Korea.

3497
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:48,170
Yeah.
He was giving out foot rubs.

3498
02:48:48,171 --> 02:48:52,700
He was asking him ask him acting creepy 
black.

3499
02:48:52,701 --> 02:48:55,550
You know what bro?
Part of that shit,

3500
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:59,390
we allow that creepiness and society.
We turned our fucking heads.

3501
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:01,033
You follow them saying,
I'm sure you're not the type of return 

3502
02:49:03,571 --> 02:49:04,051
you had.
No,

3503
02:49:04,051 --> 02:49:08,420
I'm not the type of turning my head,
but I noticed that you didn't notice it.

3504
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,263
The cocaine thing is a,
is a real interesting one because you 

3505
02:49:11,281 --> 02:49:15,510
see people making crazy decisions.
Just real nutty fucking decisions.

3506
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:16,373
Oh,
you sell a tonin men of pounding 

3507
02:49:17,550 --> 02:49:20,280
everything.
So what y'all [inaudible] system.

3508
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:21,173
So your whole system's delusional.
I remember going out like after a long 

3509
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:28,140
night and not sleeping.
Okay.

3510
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:28,974
Now that comes to a point where you have
this paranoia where you don't leave the 

3511
02:49:31,861 --> 02:49:34,830
house,
but now that comes through with paranoid

3512
02:49:34,831 --> 02:49:38,640
that you're going to leave the house and
bump into somebody and guess what?

3513
02:49:39,180 --> 02:49:40,013
Sometimes you actually do,
you go to a seven 11 together soda and 

3514
02:49:44,461 --> 02:49:48,030
you bump into somebody who was in the 
same predicament as you.

3515
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:49,373
That happened to me once I was,
I went by Gavin's I think I was staying 

3516
02:49:53,641 --> 02:49:57,090
with Ralphie and I went by Gavin's and 
I'm the first floor.

3517
02:49:57,091 --> 02:49:57,924
They was just checked that we used to be
a stripper and she had a daughter that 

3518
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:03,540
was about 13 kind of ugly.
She always like Pavarotti.

3519
02:50:03,990 --> 02:50:07,590
We used to call it bob or cause she had 
thick fucking eyebrows and shit,

3520
02:50:08,130 --> 02:50:10,560
but the mother was kind of a freak and I
got up like that.

3521
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:11,993
Like I was up all night and it was like 
nine in the morning and I was about to 

3522
02:50:14,371 --> 02:50:15,204
call my drug dealer.
They get a package of 11 that keep the 

3523
02:50:17,641 --> 02:50:22,641
body alive and I bumped into that animal
to stay away and she asked me like,

3524
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:25,170
you know,
I got some coke,

3525
02:50:25,710 --> 02:50:30,710
I was on my way and that chick,
that chick was in gay,

3526
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:33,780
Ooh,
I'll never forget this.

3527
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:37,140
She was engaged and like,
well I'm on my way right now.

3528
02:50:37,141 --> 02:50:38,560
And she goes,
do you want to split the gram?

3529
02:50:38,570 --> 02:50:38,960
I go,
yeah,

3530
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:39,840
yeah,
let's put the grab.

3531
02:50:40,410 --> 02:50:42,230
It was like 30 bucks.
We went over there,

3532
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:44,130
we split the fucking grand and we went 
back.

3533
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:45,623
Her daughter was sleeping so we had to 
do the coke in the hallway on the first 

3534
02:50:49,351 --> 02:50:51,180
floor.
All right.

3535
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:53,080
Under the stairway,
you know what I'm saying?

3536
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:54,873
And after we did two blanks,
we were just thinking they are looking 

3537
02:50:56,761 --> 02:51:00,210
at each other and she was like,
don't even ask.

3538
02:51:00,690 --> 02:51:01,523
I just told the guy that was bothering 
me all night that I wouldn't give him a 

3539
02:51:03,871 --> 02:51:04,291
site.
Like,

3540
02:51:04,291 --> 02:51:06,230
oh listen,
it's 10 in the morning,

3541
02:51:06,231 --> 02:51:06,901
you know,
do something,

3542
02:51:06,901 --> 02:51:09,180
man.
We got to do something.

3543
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:12,300
And I started swapping spit.
What the next thing you know,

3544
02:51:12,330 --> 02:51:15,480
she's stuck in the helmet and when I 
went to come,

3545
02:51:15,481 --> 02:51:16,530
she goes,
don't do that.

3546
02:51:16,530 --> 02:51:18,580
And I came on a jeans,
uh,

3547
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:22,710
like it was all over her jeans.
It's 1130 in the morning and you come on

3548
02:51:22,711 --> 02:51:24,540
some of these genes,
you're coked up.

3549
02:51:25,110 --> 02:51:27,510
I felt like a piece of shit.
That's what the worst of it.

3550
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:29,093
I see her three nights later and I'll 
come by audrey and she's with her 

3551
02:51:33,451 --> 02:51:38,451
boyfriend and her boyfriend comes over 
to him and he goes,

3552
02:51:38,611 --> 02:51:40,470
hey man,
we might have a problem here.

3553
02:51:40,471 --> 02:51:41,280
And I'm like,
what?

3554
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:42,240
What's going on?
He goes,

3555
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:45,390
my,
my girl was a little bit angry.

3556
02:51:45,391 --> 02:51:47,730
I don't know what happened,
but I think you should apologize.

3557
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:51,120
I felt like when I came on the pants,
I was just suck my dick.

3558
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:53,370
That's what happened.
Did she tell you that?

3559
02:51:54,270 --> 02:51:56,820
That's how crazy to coke world is?
Oh my God.

3560
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:59,730
Like she told her boyfriend,
she was angry at me.

3561
02:51:59,731 --> 02:52:00,900
It's none of your business.

3562
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:03,000
Why?
But so he came over to me,

3563
02:52:03,001 --> 02:52:05,590
cause I don't know what's going on.
You're a nice guy.

3564
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:07,960
I don't know what's going on.
I felt like going,

3565
02:52:07,961 --> 02:52:10,150
you know why she blew me a letter in the
morning.

3566
02:52:10,550 --> 02:52:11,950
I was like,
came on the jeans.

3567
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:14,980
I shot a load of the jeans.
She couldn't fucking,

3568
02:52:14,981 --> 02:52:15,814
you know what?
What are you spraying your genes to get 

3569
02:52:17,171 --> 02:52:19,060
shit off?
I'm going to shout it out.

3570
02:52:19,550 --> 02:52:20,383
She put the shout out that spur,
if she fucking wanted to that old coach 

3571
02:52:24,410 --> 02:52:27,070
Carter,
no vitamins in my system.

3572
02:52:27,430 --> 02:52:32,200
I weighed 380 pounds.
Those genes were stayed for lifetime.

3573
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:37,910
Oh.
Uh,

3574
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:39,333
uh,
I did the dumbest shit on all those 

3575
02:52:44,811 --> 02:52:46,250
drugs.
The dumbest shit.

3576
02:52:46,251 --> 02:52:49,190
And especially the year it took me to 
get off it.

3577
02:52:49,191 --> 02:52:51,380
What's going on?
Someone at our door.

3578
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:52,393
Oh,
okay.

3579
02:52:52,400 --> 02:52:56,420
Who the fuck is this page?
You may have five 46 in the morning.

3580
02:52:56,421 --> 02:52:59,210
Crack of dawn and what's going on his 
own fedex,

3581
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:02,180
probably someone dropping something off.
Um,

3582
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:04,280
anyway,
my brother told nothing.

3583
02:53:04,281 --> 02:53:06,750
We got to get out of here eventually.
All right,

3584
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:08,270
I'm going to leave eventually.
I'm good.

3585
02:53:08,360 --> 02:53:10,190
I'm having a good time.
It was good to see you.

3586
02:53:10,191 --> 02:53:11,180
I'm just getting to see you too,
man.

3587
02:53:11,290 --> 02:53:12,140
Jamie,
my man.

3588
02:53:12,141 --> 02:53:12,974
I thought about you when I saw fucking 
the cramps and ty come back against 

3589
02:53:17,751 --> 02:53:18,880
them.
I thought about you.

3590
02:53:18,881 --> 02:53:22,880
Who'd you bet I lost on that one?
I had told me to check.

3591
02:53:22,881 --> 02:53:24,350
Check part lands some stuff.
Ah,

3592
02:53:24,670 --> 02:53:26,330
fuck.
Like I don't go straight up.

3593
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:28,940
You love those sucker bets are going to 
go straight up.

3594
02:53:28,941 --> 02:53:29,774
It's winning the lottery.
Why when 20 bucks when you can win 200 

3595
02:53:31,821 --> 02:53:32,654
no,
because I'd rather them raise my 

3596
02:53:33,651 --> 02:53:37,010
percentage of bet one and double up on 
it and you just worry about one.

3597
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:40,670
Why am I sweating to moves through the 
fucking minor sweat to most?

3598
02:53:40,700 --> 02:53:43,100
I don't want to get in that long game.
Oh my God.

3599
02:53:43,730 --> 02:53:46,260
Fall too deep like you're talking about.
But who the fuck this is?

3600
02:53:46,270 --> 02:53:47,103
What's the next fight on the car?
We got some great cards to go over the 

3601
02:53:50,361 --> 02:53:52,910
rock over Merrill fight.
That's Great Romero.

3602
02:53:52,911 --> 02:53:57,270
And then when you got March 7th Khabib 
against Tony Ferguson.

3603
02:53:57,271 --> 02:53:59,900
Shit in Brooke coming at you from all 
directions.

3604
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:01,460
That's going to be Brooklyn,
New York.

3605
02:54:01,461 --> 02:54:04,280
Are you doing this show that weekend?
Isn't it April?

3606
02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:05,420
It's April,
right?

3607
02:54:05,420 --> 02:54:07,460
April.
What's the exact date?

3608
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:08,930
April 7th I believe.

3609
02:54:11,210 --> 02:54:12,830
Fuck cats.
That's a crazy fight.

3610
02:54:12,910 --> 02:54:16,100
That has a hard time.
I'm at a rock 'em sock.

3611
02:54:16,101 --> 02:54:20,420
'Em robots fight.
That's who the fuck knows fight.

3612
02:54:21,650 --> 02:54:23,600
You know that's one of those fights 
where you're like,

3613
02:54:23,601 --> 02:54:25,970
whoa,
that's going to be a crazy one.

3614
02:54:26,300 --> 02:54:31,300
Tony Ferguson's a bad mother fucker and 
Khabib Nijmegen Madoff is already one of

3615
02:54:33,921 --> 02:54:36,710
the scariest guys have ever seen compete
ever.

3616
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:39,620
Malls people already.
This is his first shot at the title.

3617
02:54:39,860 --> 02:54:42,230
Just stop and think of what,
what happens if that fucking savage gets

3618
02:54:42,231 --> 02:54:44,230
the title?
That guy some mash.

3619
02:54:44,270 --> 02:54:45,103
It's people.
What he did to Edson Barboza was super 

3620
02:54:46,811 --> 02:54:49,220
natural.
It's like he's not even the same thing.

3621
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:52,610
You said something during that fight 
that said it all.

3622
02:54:52,970 --> 02:54:55,790
There was one point of the fight that 
you said,

3623
02:54:55,910 --> 02:54:59,250
look at the look in essence face.
Yeah,

3624
02:54:59,780 --> 02:55:03,110
and I've had that look and that's when 
you're getting chased by 18 people.

3625
02:55:03,710 --> 02:55:04,100
He had

3626
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:05,770
a look that heated.
No,

3627
02:55:06,220 --> 02:55:07,790
no hitting.
No hope.

3628
02:55:08,020 --> 02:55:10,730
He went into like a survival situation.
Like,

3629
02:55:10,731 --> 02:55:14,780
like when you see a deer that's getting 
attacked by a crocodile or something,

3630
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:18,110
they have this like survival thing where
you're like,

3631
02:55:18,111 --> 02:55:20,900
you're just trying to survive.
Obviously deer is not the same.

3632
02:55:21,370 --> 02:55:22,880
I that's terrible analogy.
Hold on,

3633
02:55:22,881 --> 02:55:23,714
let me correct this.
What I think is that Barboza had 

3634
02:55:25,761 --> 02:55:29,780
realized that like there's no way he's 
going to beat this guy on the ground.

3635
02:55:29,781 --> 02:55:33,340
It's not even close.
Like I think if he went to that fight,

3636
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:34,213
probably thought he'd be able stuff more
take downs and probably be able to get 

3637
02:55:36,261 --> 02:55:38,810
back off his feet because he was doing 
that with a lot of guys in camp.

3638
02:55:39,260 --> 02:55:40,093
But once that guy gets a hold of you,
there's an acceptance that certain 

3639
02:55:43,581 --> 02:55:47,930
fighters go through where they,
they're locked down like holy shit.

3640
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:48,793
Like they're just drained from this 
animal mall and them trying to retain 

3641
02:55:50,961 --> 02:55:53,210
their energy,
trying to recharge their battery,

3642
02:55:53,211 --> 02:55:54,044
trying to get back in it.
And you've got to realize that guy 

3643
02:55:55,881 --> 02:55:59,180
that's in proposals,
one of the best fucking kickers ever,

3644
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:02,270
ever.
He's one of the best kickers ever.

3645
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:03,553
That fucking guys,
the fastest switch kick I've ever seen 

3646
02:56:05,451 --> 02:56:06,284
in my life outside of like professional 
Moitai like San Chai or blue cow or 

3647
02:56:11,841 --> 02:56:14,900
something like that.
He's got a world class left leg kick.

3648
02:56:14,901 --> 02:56:17,300
I mean woo,
he's fast as fuck.

3649
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:20,120
He couldn't keep that guy off him and it
was so scary.

3650
02:56:20,121 --> 02:56:24,980
That guy's face to me where he drilled 
for hours.

3651
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:27,230
He drilled,
take down the fence,

3652
02:56:27,231 --> 02:56:31,610
he drove everything that was,
but he never drove this,

3653
02:56:31,730 --> 02:56:34,430
couldn't do it.
Like there was one point where he looked

3654
02:56:34,850 --> 02:56:36,290
and it was like,
wait a second,

3655
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:38,270
I've done everything I can.

3656
02:56:38,270 --> 02:56:40,490
I,
I even trained with the giants taking me

3657
02:56:40,491 --> 02:56:42,840
down for a week.
Different animal.

3658
02:56:42,940 --> 02:56:46,700
It felt this depending on how he keeps 
you down on either,

3659
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:52,040
his control on that side is fucking 
something that is,

3660
02:56:52,730 --> 02:56:53,563
there's certain guys that have a 
grappling skill that it's very hard to 

3661
02:56:56,211 --> 02:56:57,044
see when you look at it.
Even if you're a skillful glow grappler 

3662
02:56:59,871 --> 02:57:00,704
yourself,
you're looking at someone like you like 

3663
02:57:02,181 --> 02:57:04,640
why is he able to do that to everybody?
Like what?

3664
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:06,350
What is he doing differently?
Like,

3665
02:57:06,351 --> 02:57:07,184
why is this one guy being able to do 
certain things and other people can't 

3666
02:57:09,351 --> 02:57:10,184
do?
And there's a few of those guys out 

3667
02:57:11,331 --> 02:57:13,700
there while you're watching me just go 
Jesus,

3668
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:16,030
like what the fuck?
And but Comedians,

3669
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:19,190
the number one guy in that category,
because he's never been defeated.

3670
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:21,960
He said one moment of adversity in the 
octagon.

3671
02:57:21,961 --> 02:57:24,230
I get clipped by a punch from Michael 
Johnson.

3672
02:57:24,890 --> 02:57:26,570
I can't think of a single round.
He's lost.

3673
02:57:27,170 --> 02:57:28,003
Not off the top of my head at least.
I mean he may have lost rounds on some 

3674
02:57:30,411 --> 02:57:31,244
judges' scorecards,
but he's essentially mauled every 

3675
02:57:33,231 --> 02:57:35,630
motherfucker they put in front of him.
He's an animal.

3676
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:39,380
So this guy versus Tony,
it's phenomenal fight.

3677
02:57:39,770 --> 02:57:43,550
Cause Tony is a savage and Tony fights 
very well off of his back.

3678
02:57:43,551 --> 02:57:47,030
He is a seriously dangerous guard.
You can't sleep on him.

3679
02:57:47,180 --> 02:57:49,430
He's durable as fuck.
He can knock you out.

3680
02:57:49,431 --> 02:57:51,350
He never gets tired.
And he's,

3681
02:57:51,351 --> 02:57:53,930
his game is,
they come and he's a fucking champ right

3682
02:57:53,931 --> 02:57:55,190
now.
He's the interim champ.

3683
02:57:55,550 --> 02:57:57,490
You know when he beat Kevin Leave with a
triangle,

3684
02:57:57,491 --> 02:58:00,350
you'd beat a top guy like Kevin leave 
with a fucking triangle.

3685
02:58:00,740 --> 02:58:01,620
That's a big move.

3686
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,750
Tony's dangerous,
nasty,

3687
02:58:03,751 --> 02:58:05,730
dark chokes is darce choke is one of the
best,

3688
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:07,980
was great,
but he wasn't ready for Talia.

3689
02:58:08,480 --> 02:58:11,010
Kevin Leach was sick to his staff.
That's,

3690
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:13,780
that's that action.
But note unquestionably hurt.

3691
02:58:14,310 --> 02:58:17,880
He wasn't totally as it's too high 
level.

3692
02:58:17,881 --> 02:58:18,714
That was to,
you could see in the second round 

3693
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:21,623
perhaps.
I would like to see that fight to get 

3694
02:58:22,801 --> 02:58:23,634
what you,
you have to say that because that's how 

3695
02:58:24,241 --> 02:58:25,130
it went down.
Sorry.

3696
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:26,453
But I think that if you wanted to have 
them fight again and Kevin Lee can go 

3697
02:58:29,941 --> 02:58:30,774
into that fight healthy,
I think you'd see a very different 

3698
02:58:33,181 --> 02:58:35,010
fight.
I don't think you would see tony.

3699
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:37,560
I'm not saying that you would see tony 
lose or Kevin when,

3700
02:58:37,710 --> 02:58:38,543
but I would think you would see a Kevin 
Lee that could sustain its performance 

3701
02:58:41,041 --> 02:58:41,874
longer.
I think being drained from staff is 

3702
02:58:43,351 --> 02:58:44,190
just,
there's no judge,

3703
02:58:44,310 --> 02:58:45,230
there's no effect.

3704
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:46,590
I've had it before.
It's the worst.

3705
02:58:46,890 --> 02:58:47,970
Your body.
It's not the worst,

3706
02:58:47,971 --> 02:58:48,804
but it's not good.
Your body goes into a very weakened 

3707
02:58:50,671 --> 02:58:51,630
state.
It's your,

3708
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:53,640
you are not the same thing.
You're just not.

3709
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:54,833
You can,
if you're a real professional and you 

3710
02:58:55,870 --> 02:58:57,810
can go out there and do your job.
And a lot of guys have,

3711
02:58:57,930 --> 02:58:58,763
a lot of guys have fought in one.
Luke rockhold beat Chris Weidman on 

3712
02:59:00,781 --> 02:59:02,460
antibiotics.
How about that?

3713
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:05,190
He was fighting off staff when he beat 
Chris fucking Weidman.

3714
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:07,890
That's how good Luke rockhold is.
Guys have done it,

3715
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:09,053
but that's not him at 100% he wanted,
he wanted 70 or 80 or whatever the fuck 

3716
02:59:13,141 --> 02:59:14,280
it was.
You know,

3717
02:59:14,730 --> 02:59:15,563
there's no doubt about it.
Staph infections and antibiotics both 

3718
02:59:18,031 --> 02:59:19,200
fuck you up.
And Kevin Lee,

3719
02:59:19,201 --> 02:59:21,930
I believe,
opted to not take the antibiotics.

3720
02:59:21,931 --> 02:59:24,810
So after the fight,
so he didn't want to weaken the system,

3721
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:26,310
but he's still weakened by the staff.

3722
02:59:27,030 --> 02:59:31,470
Fuck fuck.
Oh shoot.

3723
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:32,753
Demetrius Johnson versus Tj dillashaw.
Superfight targeted for UFC two 26 and 

3724
02:59:36,121 --> 02:59:38,700
co main event.
Oh Shit.

3725
02:59:38,900 --> 02:59:41,670
Two 26 that I dunno.
July Vegas.

3726
02:59:41,710 --> 02:59:44,460
Hello?
Steve Bay DC fight.

3727
02:59:44,660 --> 02:59:46,620
Oh good.
Oh,

3728
02:59:47,850 --> 02:59:49,590
that's a big court case.
I'm Bro.

3729
02:59:50,370 --> 02:59:52,860
They got some good cards coming up.
That's what Greg is.

3730
02:59:52,861 --> 02:59:57,861
Kevin Co sleep don't sleep motherfucker.
This game might run by by his ship,

3731
02:59:58,410 --> 03:00:01,200
whose mother fucking fights are getting 
better and better now.

3732
03:00:01,201 --> 03:00:02,034
Again,
I'd love to see Steve Bay become a 

3733
03:00:03,061 --> 03:00:04,560
superstar.
Me Too.

3734
03:00:04,590 --> 03:00:06,000
I think.
I think he deserves it.

3735
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:08,520
And I think you look at where that guy 
is right now.

3736
03:00:08,550 --> 03:00:10,740
Like what is more American than this 
guy?

3737
03:00:10,741 --> 03:00:11,574
Like you said with his immigrant named 
what is more American than a guy who 

3738
03:00:13,861 --> 03:00:14,694
works right now as a fireman while he's 
the UFC heavyweight champion of the 

3739
03:00:17,271 --> 03:00:18,840
world.
And he's a great dude.

3740
03:00:18,890 --> 03:00:19,350
Good,
good.

3741
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:20,760
And broke the record.

3742
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:21,653
Broke the record for the most defensive.
He's beat the scariest contender we've 

3743
03:00:24,961 --> 03:00:26,410
seen in a decade.
You know.

3744
03:00:26,490 --> 03:00:28,620
Uh,
I watched the podcasts a lot.

3745
03:00:28,630 --> 03:00:29,720
Yeah.
Had those guys aren't here.

3746
03:00:29,721 --> 03:00:31,400
We're talking about the Tao of Jeet 
Guido.

3747
03:00:32,590 --> 03:00:36,960
And I think that a lot of people really 
miss out on the main thing.

3748
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:41,130
And this is what you miss out with me 
every time.

3749
03:00:41,240 --> 03:00:42,150
It's not with you.
No,

3750
03:00:42,180 --> 03:00:42,860
no,
no.

3751
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:44,520
I don't.
Other people.

3752
03:00:44,521 --> 03:00:49,170
You mean like whenever I want to see is 
Bruce Lee fucking things and I see these

3753
03:00:49,171 --> 03:00:50,004
kids are the 30 talking about Bruce Lee.
I get sick to my stomach because Bruce 

3754
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:57,880
Lee that bring martial arts for this 
country.

3755
03:00:57,881 --> 03:01:00,230
Then he caved immigrants.
Hope Bro.

3756
03:01:01,120 --> 03:01:01,953
I was a kid.
I just come from Cuba to Green Horn in 

3757
03:01:04,471 --> 03:01:05,304
on Sunday nights.
I would throw you out the window to 

3758
03:01:07,331 --> 03:01:12,331
watch that show when I was five and then
they canceled them and then he came back

3759
03:01:12,431 --> 03:01:15,850
with the first one that supposed to be 
fist of fury,

3760
03:01:15,851 --> 03:01:20,851
but some argue that was a flat that 
didn't do that good that introduced him.

3761
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:26,170
It was the one in [inaudible] 71 the 
Chinese connection when I was eight.

3762
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:31,210
That was a great model that really put 
this country over.

3763
03:01:32,380 --> 03:01:35,620
If you were,
it didn't mean you were a tough guy.

3764
03:01:35,621 --> 03:01:37,900
How many,
how many I youtube,

3765
03:01:37,930 --> 03:01:42,930
how many black guys are there that think
that Chinese is and they got wisdom.

3766
03:01:43,031 --> 03:01:45,370
What was the guy used to send you videos
of,

3767
03:01:47,210 --> 03:01:50,130
forget the guy's name,
but he's a bunch of those things.

3768
03:01:50,150 --> 03:01:54,760
Make people tougher.
He gave immigrants blacks.

3769
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:56,230
He gave them hope.

3770
03:01:56,260 --> 03:01:59,890
How many black dudes started dressing 
like Bruce Lee and you know,

3771
03:01:59,891 --> 03:02:04,210
doing crazy shit and wearing gunning 
fool our kung fu outfits.

3772
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:09,040
You know everybody's wrong about Bruce 
Lee because I saw it and I saw his death

3773
03:02:10,030 --> 03:02:10,863
and I saw how people would go to 
Chinatown because there was no internet 

3774
03:02:13,650 --> 03:02:15,640
can confined kind.
They go to Seattle.

3775
03:02:15,641 --> 03:02:17,320
They go to is greg.
I went to his grave,

3776
03:02:17,350 --> 03:02:18,183
I went to his grave,
took a picture and gave it to Eddie 

3777
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:20,493
Griffin.
That's why Eddie Griffin will always be 

3778
03:02:21,761 --> 03:02:22,594
indebted to me cause I gave him a 
picture of Bruce Lee's brave and just 

3779
03:02:26,251 --> 03:02:28,420
shit.
That's how I Bruce Lee,

3780
03:02:28,421 --> 03:02:29,254
when he died there was no internet.
They didn't report per sleeve that on 

3781
03:02:32,291 --> 03:02:34,750
the news.
How did people find out about it?

3782
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:39,780
You found out a week later when the 
trainees newspaper Hit New York and then

3783
03:02:40,691 --> 03:02:43,120
in China town,
it came out through China town.

3784
03:02:43,660 --> 03:02:48,310
When I heard about it,
I was forced to go to China town and get

3785
03:02:48,430 --> 03:02:52,570
the paperwork with the pictures.
But everybody had to,

3786
03:02:52,690 --> 03:02:53,523
it was an open casket and China and the 
open casket was glass around him and to 

3787
03:02:58,231 --> 03:02:59,064
him,
nobody believed Bruce Lee was that then 

3788
03:03:01,271 --> 03:03:03,760
enter the dragon came out.
But I bing Bada boom,

3789
03:03:04,090 --> 03:03:04,923
everybody made $1 million and nobody 
said nothing but his debt browth fucked 

3790
03:03:10,450 --> 03:03:13,360
people up.
Like,

3791
03:03:13,361 --> 03:03:14,194
you know Bruce Lee gave hope because the
Vietnam War was going on and there was 

3792
03:03:18,671 --> 03:03:19,504
something else going on in this country 
that people don't remember that 

3793
03:03:22,451 --> 03:03:23,710
destroyed this country.
You know,

3794
03:03:23,711 --> 03:03:25,290
which shot this country down.
What?

3795
03:03:25,450 --> 03:03:28,720
When the Beatles broke up this fucking 
Christ.

3796
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:29,793
Did people lose that mind?
So you always get into arguments with 

3797
03:03:32,771 --> 03:03:34,840
people led.
Zap One's a good bat.

3798
03:03:34,870 --> 03:03:35,703
Yeah,
but wait til the beetles get back 

3799
03:03:36,431 --> 03:03:37,264
together,
bitch,

3800
03:03:37,660 --> 03:03:40,570
because they were always threatening you
with the Beatles talk.

3801
03:03:40,570 --> 03:03:41,900
I like jethro Tull.
Yeah,

3802
03:03:41,901 --> 03:03:43,690
but they're not nothing compared to the 
Beatles.

3803
03:03:44,020 --> 03:03:47,290
So until John Lennon got shot,
then those people had a voice.

3804
03:03:47,291 --> 03:03:48,880
Fuck you at the Beatles,
bitch.

3805
03:03:48,990 --> 03:03:50,860
You know what you were?
Springsteen is the man.

3806
03:03:51,070 --> 03:03:55,360
You know what you would love.
Go to the Mirage show to the Beatles,

3807
03:03:55,490 --> 03:03:59,120
a Cirque de Solei show.
It's called love fucking crap.

3808
03:03:59,180 --> 03:04:01,070
When did you go credible?
A couple of weeks ago.

3809
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:04,790
You were there doing it with my family.
Okay.

3810
03:04:05,060 --> 03:04:07,490
And W I wanted to see the Cirque de 
Solei show.

3811
03:04:07,491 --> 03:04:10,650
It's supposed to be amazing and I seen 
the original circus de Soleil.

3812
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:11,510
Well,
this guy,

3813
03:04:11,510 --> 03:04:15,770
nobody would have met the Beatles,
broke up this country,

3814
03:04:15,771 --> 03:04:19,640
went to a tough time.
You have no fucking id now.

3815
03:04:19,641 --> 03:04:21,560
You don't have any idea if you're,
you're young,

3816
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:23,930
you have no fucking idea.
Put it in perspective.

3817
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:25,520
The Beatles,
let let it be out.

3818
03:04:25,521 --> 03:04:27,140
In the end of that,
we'll let it be dog.

3819
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:28,213
That was it.
People will crack White People Crack 

3820
03:04:30,770 --> 03:04:31,603
Jack fucking incredible song.
When you think about what John died 

3821
03:04:35,120 --> 03:04:35,721
with,
John,

3822
03:04:35,721 --> 03:04:38,420
let him die.
What happened in New York that Sunday?

3823
03:04:38,750 --> 03:04:41,720
You think about that?
That was amazing to look at.

3824
03:04:42,230 --> 03:04:45,140
Now he was on another level.
The whole band was on another level.

3825
03:04:45,141 --> 03:04:48,830
They were very psychedelic,
mostly came in at the perfect time,

3826
03:04:49,310 --> 03:04:51,920
right?
The Beatles were breaking up.

3827
03:04:51,950 --> 03:04:53,930
Muhammad Ali,
Muhammad Ali,

3828
03:04:53,931 --> 03:04:57,890
but also in 1973 this is a very 
interesting fact.

3829
03:04:58,310 --> 03:05:03,310
At $50,
at $15 ticket sales at $15,

3830
03:05:04,990 --> 03:05:08,030
$12,
$10 ticket sales.

3831
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:09,313
This country gross,
$3 billion and concerts really go watch 

3832
03:05:14,181 --> 03:05:18,410

The one of my music,

3833
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:19,273
I can't say I'm the seventh.
So much good music came out of that 

3834
03:05:21,381 --> 03:05:22,340
time,
that era.

3835
03:05:22,370 --> 03:05:23,203
Every school was on tour.
They had a list of who was on tour 

3836
03:05:25,910 --> 03:05:27,200
Zeppelin,

3837
03:05:27,610 --> 03:05:29,450

3845
03:05:48,531 --> 03:05:50,110
That was the big thing to do.

3846
03:05:50,720 --> 03:05:54,500
George Federal Goodman destroyed.
People forgot about j geils band,

3847
03:05:54,740 --> 03:05:57,800
Jake giggles band.
That was about freeze frame.

3848
03:05:57,820 --> 03:06:00,440
Angel as a centerfold.
He was married to Faye dunaway.

3849
03:06:00,441 --> 03:06:02,080
