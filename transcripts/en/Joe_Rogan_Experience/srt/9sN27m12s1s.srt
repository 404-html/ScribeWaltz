00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
Hello Freak bitches that again.
I mean fuck starches pain now is fucking

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,690
a is killer.
I mean music is so hard to pin down.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,650
It's funny too because you know,
we had a bit of it.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,493
We had a fallen out recently and you 
couldn't find a bigger storage will 

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,920
faint to me.
I just listened to his record on the way

6
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:21,660
over here and it's a fucking 
masterpiece,

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,510
but he also wants to talk to me right 
now.

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,400
What happened?
Well,

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,130
here's the thing I don't even mind 
talking about,

10
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,860
right?
I in an interview,

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,190
I said that he was,
but I just honestly,

12
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:37,020
what I believe,
I think he is.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,173
You're going to laugh when I say it,
but I swear this is what I fucking 

14
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:44,760
believe.
I think he's a Patriot ass.

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,570
I'll just let that sink in for a second.
I think he's taken motherfuckers out and

16
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,750
I confronted him about it.
Where did you get this information?

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,850
Well,
let me tell you video.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,773
See,
I'm like I said I knew him back in 

19
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,590
Kentucky and he goes,
this fucker goes to the navy.

20
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,424
Right,
right.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,350
That's magic.
Magic magic.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,150
He's,
he's worked for the governor.

23
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,984
Imagine being in the navy and you look 
next to you and some guy just picked up 

24
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:15,480
a guitar and start singing and it starts
with Simpson.

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,560
Imagine that there's no fucking way,
like the greatest singer guitarist,

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,390
one of the best ones in the world right 
now.

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,470
Would you agree with that?
Oh,

28
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,304
for sure.
He's just sitting next to you on a 

29
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,620
fucking boat and they decides,
you know what?

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,630
I want to leave the navy when he was 
young.

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,000
But I'm saying you can't just quit the 
navy.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,450
Uh,
what you do term,

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,930
you know,
he didn't do his term.

34
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,370
He fucking left.
Brilliant.

35
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,470
So He owes the gum.
How long did he go?

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,270
I don't know the fuck.
Listen.

37
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,660
All my facts aren't together,
but he leaves.

38
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:43,494
Can you do that?
I thought that's like you go awol and 

39
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,680
they didn't go a while.
He's fucked.

40
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,600
So why I'm thinking,
why is he fucking out?

41
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,550
Oh,
well you should talk to Alex Jones about

42
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,031
this.
Well,

43
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,190
no,
but I'm telling you I don't need to talk

44
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,024
to him.
I got the answers.

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,290
He leaves.
Right?

46
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,670
Right now I he,
all of a sudden out of nowhere,

47
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,450
he just puts out the fucking wreck.
So what if you're in the government,

48
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,420
you want to take some fuckers out,
put their dick in the dirt,

49
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:06,630
luck.

50
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,370
I'm saying take those motherfuckers 
down.

51
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,710
What's the best way to do it and this 
done.

52
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,950
But men have been done before by some,
some other Hollywood stars.

53
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,280
Tension music artist alive.
And you as you.

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,720
Well Nigga as a front,
but who travels the most efficient music

55
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,201
artists?
Yeah,

56
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,600
and you gotTa have them legit cause he's
got to go fucking play right?

57
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,130
Checkout circles to it.
Now,

58
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,540
here's what I'm going to say right now.
I know you're laughing at me.

59
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,550
I said you both laughed at him,
but this motherfucker has toured Europe.

60
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,400
Fucking tent.
He's,

61
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,433
he's toured England.
10 Times you ever heard of who's your 

62
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:39,960
favorite country music artists from 
England?

63
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,580
They don't listen to fucking country 
music.

64
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,700
They listened to it.
You don't play and listen to it.

65
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,880
He's going over there fucking killing 
people and.

66
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,353
But this fucker,
it's gone to how many times you eat a 

67
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,410
lot.

68
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,830
Yeah.
You ever met a Japanese guy and you go,

69
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,700
who's your favorite country artist?
They don't go,

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,860
you know,
they don't go,

71
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,290
ah,
fuck,

72
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,820
ah,
do I can tell you you'll come.

73
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,883
They don't listen to that shit.
He's over there taking motherfuckers 

74
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,324
out.
You go down his tour list and you check 

75
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:03,584
the,
check it with the papers of enemies of 

76
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,230
the state who been taken out.
That shit fucking lines up,

77
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,740
does it?
I think if I wasn't the specifics,

78
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't.
Anyway,

79
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,983
I got a little stone and I thought this 
was what happened and I should have 

80
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,160
asked him about it,
which is true.

81
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,660
But so he just started accusing them of 
being a CIA has done to his face.

82
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,090
I did it on a couple of radio shows and 
then.

83
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,670
And this is probably going to break it 
open a little bit,

84
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,080
but anyway,
now he's,

85
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,543
he won't.

86
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,430
Why will he confront me about it?
Because it's true.

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,950
Right?
And why is this new album all about him?

88
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,993
You heard the record.
It just him talking to his son because 

89
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,950
he's seeing shit at night.
He,

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,670
he seen the shit,
you know,

91
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,683
why do you write an album about this 
serious about jill as like a serious 

92
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,120
talk to your child because you've seen 
should go down.

93
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:57,121
You've seen motherfuckers tell you he 
loves his kid and no one does that.

94
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,440
No,
that's not a reason to make a record.

95
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,060
He says he's telling his kids,
warning him,

96
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,460
don't do what I did,
you know,

97
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,530
and he's a hired government assassin and
I'm almost positive about this it.

98
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,510
But I'm also getting the truth out 
there.

99
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,930
What don't you worry he's going to take 
you out for exposing them.

100
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,760
That's what I'm talking about it because
now they know if he takes me out,

101
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,000
we'll know,
we'll then my story will be true.

102
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,343
That's what that guy thought in Russia.
Remember that dude in Russia that was 

103
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,190
talking shit about,
uh,

104
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,570
about Putin.
He was a,

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,420
like a political rival.
The Putin that he thought because he was

106
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,070
so public,
they'd never take them out.

107
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,640
They shot him with his girlfriend while 
he was with his girlfriend.

108
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,620
They shot him in front of a government 
building.

109
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,650
That doesn't help my fucking anxiety for
the story.

110
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,140
They'll just get you,
dude.

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,570
Especially if you go to Russia,
don't tour Russia.

112
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,590
I don't know.
Well,

113
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,270
I mean,
again,

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,930
I,
I'm,

115
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,510
my facts aren't like 100 percent 
together,

116
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:51,790
but from what I've seen that,
why wouldn't he talk to me about it?

117
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,710
Then you say,
well,

118
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,663
you know,
people get tested when you call them 

119
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,610
killers.
They get,

120
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,780
um,
you know,

121
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,490
they feel bad.
I don't know,

122
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:00,911
man.
Yeah,

123
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,820
you asked me.
I mean,

124
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,790
whatever.
I think I'm onto something,

125
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,900
but whatever.
Anyway.
