1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,580
Kellen,

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,413
you could sing us

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,130
alive.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,610
That's it.

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,020
All right.

6
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,271
All right.

7
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,104
We went on the air.

8
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,710
All right.

9
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,730
Good evening everybody.

10
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,630
This is a,

11
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,280
if you're listening to
this for the first time,

12
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,680
this is what's called a
fight companion podcast.

13
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,660
And what that means is we don't really
talk about anything that's going to

14
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,610
expand your mind or if we do,

15
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,750
it's totally by accident.

16
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,740
Okay?

17
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,640
We don't talk about,

18
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,573
uh,

19
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,670
there's how many sponsors
we caveman coffee tee shirts
on caveman coffees on bar

20
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,960
buddy tape.

21
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,600
Fletcher Jardeen too.

22
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:33,970
Awesome.

23
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,803
Tudes

24
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,470
as long as it was like medium,

25
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:38,520
so I can bust out of it.

26
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,450
We might lead a little gay if we all
got him on what I'm saying to my party.

27
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,890
We're trying hard.

28
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,520
Um,

29
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,400
we can't wait.

30
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,590
We're going to go into this podcast.

31
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:48,540
What we're going to do is we're
gonna Watch some old school fights,

32
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,370
but we can't,

33
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,560
uh,

34
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,590
we can't really talk about fights until
we talk about our last podcast together

35
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:57,540
because it kind of became the biggest
podcast in the history of MMA.

36
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,210
How many you can take,

37
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,140
you can take kind of out of that sentence.

38
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:01,351
Yeah.

39
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,180
It's off the charts off the charts,

40
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:03,660
Jamie.

41
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,530
It's not ours.

42
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,490
It's theirs.

43
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:05,880
It's a,

44
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,661
it's a fighter.

45
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,111
And the kid,

46
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,944
these fucking,

47
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,783
oh

48
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,813
no,

49
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,620
we just did in his studio.

50
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,100
We had Joe on and this studio.

51
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,000
But your podcast.

52
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,331
Right,

53
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:19,010
exactly.

54
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,843
And,

55
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,440
and so Joe kind of spoke,

56
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,900
his mind would just sit there
and neither one of us actually.

57
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:26,970
Yeah.

58
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,980
And then it's just a chair.

59
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,650
She watched it.

60
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,670
I watched it but youtube and I thought
the whole time it was jre probably that

61
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,161
whole tickets.

62
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:38,010
It's the same studio.

63
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,410
That's all I was sitting in there.

64
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,620
It would look like the same show.

65
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,590
You can just do it.

66
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,960
Be a red behind me instead of a,

67
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,501
if you yeah,

68
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,910
Brian behind there you would go,

69
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:45,151
what?

70
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:45,984
The what the fuck?

71
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,430
Anyway,

72
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,810
now and he's all concerned with them.

73
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:52,811
Like just Eddie Bravo might be a little
high talk shit could go off the rails.

74
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,980
All I wanted to know is the views,

75
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,540
what kind of feature to the New Yorker
magazine and it got all this stuff.

76
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,500
We're number one on,

77
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,250
on every chart on the dunes.

78
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,170
So it was a blessing in disguise.

79
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,540
But it's huge though.

80
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,080
It's huge.

81
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,040
It was great for Brian Right now.

82
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,711
It was great.

83
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:21,360
It was great for your podcast and
in a lot of ways it's an important

84
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:25,030
conversation that needs to be had
about MMA and about fighting gree.

85
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,180
Part of the issue with it was having it
having a really honest conversation in

86
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,020
front of the whole world.

87
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,310
That's part of the issue with it.

88
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,630
If I could do it again,

89
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,300
I definitely wouldn't have done that.

90
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,583
Um,

91
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,730
the good part about doing that is that
it gets this conversation out there.

92
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,280
The bad part about doing that
is you took a lot of heat and I,

93
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,460
I feel real bad for that.

94
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,490
I feel like I really fucked up for that
and I didn't go into that and tending to

95
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,960
like approach it like that.

96
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,010
But it seemed like when we
started talking I started worried

97
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,220
more worried that your perception of like
how the fight went down and the future

98
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,290
and what's going on as far as like the
amount of damage that you've taken is

99
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,610
very different than how I see it and
how a lot of other people see it.

100
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:20,560
And I think there's a certain
number that every fighter has,

101
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:20,831
you know,

102
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,790
like a certain amount of times they can
get hit a certain amount of concussions

103
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,624
they could face.

104
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,760
And if I don't know a guy and I see that,

105
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,840
I just know,

106
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,351
okay,

107
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,400
this guy's Chiney,

108
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:33,851
you know,

109
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,770
and I've called a lot of fights like that.

110
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,680
I've called a lot of fights where
I know if this guy gets tagged,

111
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,011
he's,

112
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,030
his legs are going to go,

113
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,451
you know,

114
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,350
we've all seen it.

115
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,650
We know and I've called a lot of
fights where a guy was a young,

116
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:50,050
fresh fighter and then I've called
the same guy fighting seven,

117
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,771
eight years later,

118
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:51,490
six years later,

119
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,150
whatever.

120
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,530
And it's a different human being.

121
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Um,

122
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,400
it's everyone's choice and I'm not
trying to impose anyone's choices or my

123
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,440
choices on anyone else,

124
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,363
but

125
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,080
there's some things that we've talked
about and one of the things that we've

126
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,490
talked about before is you,

127
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,740
you were talking really open and honestly
about some of the losses that you had.

128
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,940
And you said,

129
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,500
why didn't anybody tell me?

130
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,450
You kept saying that?

131
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,390
Why didn't anybody tell me this kid down?

132
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,140
Tell him,

133
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,140
why didn't anybody tell me I shouldn't
be fighting Nogueira my third,

134
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,360
my air time out.

135
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,840
Yeah,

136
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,530
you were like,

137
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,390
I thought it was going to kick his ass.

138
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:31,871
I thought,

139
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,620
you know,

140
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,940
why didn't anybody tell me?

141
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,301
And you,

142
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,690
you kept saying that it was funny
and you were being self deprecating,

143
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,130
joking around you being self
deprecating is very funny.

144
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,740
But one of the things that uh,

145
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,051
you know,

146
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:51,051
you see time and time again about being
a fighter is that that same kind of

147
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,600
belief in yourself that makes you want
to get into that fucking cage in front of

148
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:55,931
the world,

149
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,360
in your underwear and throw
bones at some other dude.

150
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,540
That same kind of belief in yourself can
get in the way if things aren't going

151
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:04,960
right.

152
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,930
It's almost like so many fighters like
have this ability to put blinders on and

153
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,830
not see the danger and not see,

154
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,280
do not see what other
other people are saying and

155
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,680
is as a person who is
around it all the time,

156
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,693
it gets,

157
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,350
it gets super disturbing.

158
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,960
Like you see it time and time again.

159
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,471
You know,

160
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:30,310
one of the best things that Dana white
ever did in all the Times that I've known

161
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,230
him is stopped chocolate
Dell from fighting.

162
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,170
It's one of the best things
he ever did because it was,

163
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,580
he could have made a fucking fortune off
chocolate Dell just pair them up with

164
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,660
someone who's not going to knock them out,

165
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,640
pair him up with some dude's
going to grapple with them,

166
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,320
pair him up with some dude,

167
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,201
you know,

168
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:45,430
uh,

169
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,180
who's not a,

170
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,530
not a big striker guy,

171
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,940
was a real good wrestler.

172
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,510
You know,

173
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,751
there's,

174
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:50,830
there's guys like that out there.

175
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:55,780
You should find a comeback opponent for
chuck and just make ungodly amounts of

176
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:56,290
money.

177
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,040
Rich Franklin wasn't supposed

178
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,590
to be that dangerous on his feet,

179
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,080
you know,

180
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,750
it was like you'd think,

181
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,200
okay,

182
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,700
chuck can out strike.

183
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,833
Frankly,

184
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:06,890
that's a good,

185
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,723
good fight for sure.

186
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,600
And then what we saw was as
rich Franklin dropped him,

187
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:11,961
you know,

188
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:12,680
and it's,

189
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,513
it's,

190
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,240
Joe has seen what he's
talking about when he sees,

191
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,680
when he meets all these guys,

192
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,630
the new fresh crop from tough,

193
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:20,871
oh,

194
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:21,980
here's the new guys.

195
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,581
I would,

196
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,810
when I worked with Joe,

197
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I would watch tough cause
it was entertaining but also
to remember all these new

198
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,610
guys that I'm going to meet backstage,

199
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,170
I'm going to meet all these dude I worked
with the UFC eight years and you meet

200
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,430
this new crop,

201
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,120
these new fighters and you feel like
you have to be on top of everything.

202
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,420
They'll,

203
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,080
it's embarrassing when one of these new
guys from the ultimate fighter season

204
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:45,321
six,

205
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:45,800
season seven,

206
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,490
six today,

207
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,100
they come up to you backstage and
you have no idea who they are.

208
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,160
There was a couple of seasons that
I missed and it's embarrassing,

209
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:52,550
right?

210
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,690
You see them come and go and
Joe really is concerned when,

211
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,831
when he see,

212
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,920
when he meets a guy and they
come in and like he sees like,

213
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,320
man,

214
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,020
how much damage is this going to take?

215
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:03,760
Uh,

216
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,830
is this guy going to be one of the elite
than make it through or is it going to

217
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:10,460
be like most fighters that don't go
all the way through and then they go

218
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,000
through,

219
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,680
they go through some
tough times and all that.

220
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,260
I S I see the exact same thing,

221
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,890
but I look at it just a little
bit different because I,

222
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,331
I think,

223
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:20,811
hey man,

224
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,980
you know it's dangerous.

225
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,731
You're getting in the,

226
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:23,720
in the octagon.

227
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,920
If you wanna,

228
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,980
if you wanna put your brain in jeopardy,

229
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,850
go for it.

230
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,260
I look at it as why these guys
came in and why they got cut.

231
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,120
Like when you look at all these fighters,

232
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,451
they get,

233
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,260
why did he get cut?

234
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,650
Why did he lose that last
fight that got him cut?

235
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,570
I'm always looking at what,

236
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,340
who's trainers war?

237
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:44,420
What does training was?

238
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,070
What does Jujitsu was like,

239
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,550
who was he training with his wrestling
and as for investing and striking and

240
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,900
what went wrong there.

241
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,900
And cause most people
that come into the UFC,

242
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,150
Devin even get to the main card.

243
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,391
Most people that are,

244
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:57,650
don't,

245
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,160
aren't even aware of these hundreds of
fighters that come through never make it

246
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,540
to the main card and they're gone.

247
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,040
They're cut you out.

248
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,360
You lose two fights in a row.

249
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,400
In the prelims they're
going to cut you generally.

250
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,030
Right?

251
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,410
But you know how many wins you have to
line up in a road to get to the main

252
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:12,681
card,

253
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,100
especially if you're under one 70 you
have to put like eight or nine wins

254
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,140
together before it's like,

255
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,220
it's like getting,

256
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,900
getting into the UFC,

257
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,901
getting signed by the UFC is easier than
going from the prelims to the main guy.

258
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,880
[inaudible] back.

259
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,820
The easy part happened,

260
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,080
you got signed with UFC,

261
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,490
here comes the hard part.

262
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,870
Let's see you last,

263
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,570
I was going to say it to

264
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,110
piggyback on that and I think what you
are saying and what I took away from it

265
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,060
was was the fact that look,

266
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,850
to get to the belt,

267
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,500
you are going to have to take a certain
number of fights and just because of the

268
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:47,610
way this sport is,

269
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,800
you're going to take damage
no matter who you are.

270
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,880
And the question is,

271
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
is it worth it?

272
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,670
And you were speaking
specifically to Brenton,

273
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:56,160
is it worth it to go through that

274
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,993
journey,

275
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,980
go through that journey and possibly do
real damage to yourself when there's a

276
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,620
bridge to cross that and,

277
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:04,800
and I that I took.

278
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,380
So I think that's a question that
every fighter has to ask themselves.

279
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,460
Um,

280
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,220
and I think it requires being
very honest with yourself.

281
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,230
So that's kind of what I,

282
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,190
that's what I,

283
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,240
why I thought the conversation was
very relevant to anybody who is in,

284
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,710
in combat sports.

285
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,570
Look at your look at your brain this way.

286
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,200
Okay.

287
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,330
Pretend your brain is a rock,

288
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,260
that you're going to carve a sculpture of.

289
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,383
Okay.

290
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,573
And you're chipping.

291
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,330
You want to do,

292
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:34,380
if you have one sculpture that you can
make with your whole life with this

293
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,100
brain,

294
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,560
you want to make the very
best sculpture possible.

295
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,150
You can't chip too much shit away from
it and then try to put rock back on.

296
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,050
It doesn't work.

297
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,290
You only have a certain
amount of rock to work with.

298
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,310
And I look at fighting in the same way.

299
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:55,311
You have a certain amount of brain that
you could take damage with before you,

300
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
you start seeing weird shit with guys.

301
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,900
You start seeing guys get
knocked out by punches.

302
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,800
It looked like nothing.

303
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,750
You start seeing guys,

304
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,200
uh,

305
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,330
just a normal shot that
they would have taken.

306
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,910
You saw this with chuck
in his early career.

307
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,970
He would eat nothing like candy and
just blast you right in the face.

308
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:12,804
Like it was nothing.

309
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,280
It was very demoralizing when guys would
fight chuck cause they would clip him

310
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,520
right in the Chin and he would
just fucking break your face in.

311
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,350
I mean he just was so tough,

312
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,180
so tough and so mean.

313
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,050
You know when chuck,

314
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,800
I mean it's a very nice guy but when he's
competing he was just for Rosha and he

315
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:32,270
was also known for
having any credible chin.

316
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,310
Incredible Chicken Club,

317
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:33,621
which,

318
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:38,610
and he went from having one of the best
chins in the game and we saw it to man.

319
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,770
He went through what
most fighters go through.

320
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:41,910
A lot of fighters,

321
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,130
the,

322
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,500
they go through their career and they
try to piece things together as it goes

323
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:46,890
along.

324
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,490
Try to get,

325
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:47,970
well,

326
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,211
you know,

327
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,050
maybe I should,

328
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,471
uh,

329
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,801
you know,

330
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,870
work with more wrestlers
and maybe I should,

331
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:52,320
uh,

332
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,890
work with,

333
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,250
uh,

334
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,240
good kickbox and coach
or it's f I believe.

335
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,740
I really strongly believe in this,

336
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,300
that in the future we're going to have,

337
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,360
every fighter is going to have like a
Matt Hume or for Rasa Hobby or a guy like

338
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,960
that who's like a maestro,

339
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,930
a guy who looks at you actively.

340
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,820
And those are the best
guys out in my opinion,

341
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:12,361
those two guys.

342
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,280
There's a few other guys that
John Crouch is great at it,

343
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,210
but a guy who looks at you
objectively and finds what's wrong,

344
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:23,211
what's right and moves you into position
slowly gets you fights with the right

345
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,570
caliber opponent and gets you
to a place where you need to be.

346
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,100
Very few guys have the luxury that
very few guys ever get to that.

347
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,430
And I think that along the way a lot of
guys take some damage in training that's

348
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:42,180
unnecessary or that they
could have avoided they.

349
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,260
And then you know,

350
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:43,401
you,

351
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:43,651
you,

352
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,000
you factor in life,

353
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,421
you know,

354
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,900
you factor in like with you especially
you factor in how many years of football?

355
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,190
20 how many time do you
think you got your bell rang?

356
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,360
20 years of football.

357
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,413
Maybe six.

358
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,530
That's it.

359
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,070
Yeah,

360
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,750
like flat lined or just,

361
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,340
no.

362
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,930
Yeah,

363
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,763
yeah.

364
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,703
That's,

365
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,870
that's how many times
you get hit in the head.

366
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,150
The other thing that goes on in football,

367
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,590
it's really crazy that people don't
think about its chest when you're going

368
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,021
chat.

369
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,550
When you get hit in the chest,

370
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,400
it seems like an impact
that's just on your chest,

371
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,490
but a large amount of concussions,

372
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,491
even concussions at windup in depression
or from chest injuries from getting hit

373
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:31,621
in the body because your brain and you
snap back your head even though you're

374
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:33,040
not getting hit in the head,

375
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:37,600
your brain smashes around inside of your
head and it causes some serious injury

376
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,120
to the brain and they're,

377
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:41,050
they're doing all these
different tests on like,

378
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,790
like what is important?

379
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,990
Is it head contact,

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,830
his head moving.

381
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,830
A lot of soccer players have issues with
the CTE as they get older from heading

382
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:50,800
the ball,

383
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,740
just heading a fucking rubber ball.

384
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,750
It that much doesn't matter.

385
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,331
And it was not,

386
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:55,750
it doesn't,

387
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,261
it's not.

388
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:56,530
It's,

389
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:56,801
yeah,

390
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:57,611
they do a lot,

391
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,680
but it's a matter of that,

392
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,430
that thump,

393
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,323
that jolt,

394
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,410
that sharp jolt.

395
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,270
It's your brain moving around inside
of your head and it's not designed for

396
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:07,571
that.

397
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:08,350
And at a certain,

398
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,470
it has a certain amount of those you can
give it and then it just starts going.

399
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,360
It's like a fucking transmission that
you just jam into fucking first when

400
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,194
you're on the highway.

401
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,100
After a while,

402
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:18,581
it's that thing.

403
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,121
It's just like,

404
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,721
whoa.

405
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,051
Hey,

406
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:20,381
hey,

407
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,191
hey gears.

408
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:21,971
Start breaking.

409
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,110
Shit starts falling off.

410
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,310
If I didn't know you and you were just
another fighter and you asked me for

411
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,144
advice,

412
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,420
I'd probably be a lot nicer
about how I gave you that advice.

413
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,140
I did that cause I'm fucking terrified
I did that because I'm seeing you're a

414
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:38,980
smart dude.

415
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,960
You're a funny dude and you're,

416
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,850
you're like fun to be around.

417
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,480
We're not going to go.

418
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,281
That goes with no,

419
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:44,350
no,

420
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,471
no,

421
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,304
no.

422
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,050
We're going to good place if that,

423
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,460
if that goes away,

424
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,840
if that goes away,

425
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,390
I would be horrified.

426
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,800
I'd be fucking horrified.

427
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,060
I would have a real problem.

428
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,270
I've had problems call and
fights with people I barely know.

429
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,640
And then I see them get to
that point where they're,

430
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,340
they're,

431
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,600
they,

432
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
they start slurring and they
started having a hard time.

433
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,890
I see it in interviews.

434
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,810
I see them like struggle in interviews.

435
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:08,110
I go,

436
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,530
Ooh,

437
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,250
look at him.

438
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,900
And sometimes it's just a guy's tired.

439
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,793
That's possible.

440
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,101
Shit.

441
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:12,934
If you catch me,

442
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,350
if I'm really tired,

443
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,140
you know,

444
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,150
in some of the interviewed me,

445
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,730
I bet I'd probably look
like I was fucked up.

446
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,170
You can usually,

447
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,420
but there's,

448
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,430
there's just a thing
that happens where I go,

449
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,264
fuck,

450
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,613
he's gone.

451
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,101
You know,

452
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:27,410
and I,

453
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,930
I've seen too many guys,

454
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:29,111
man.

455
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,100
I've seen too many guys.

456
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:33,250
I seen a bunch fighting his
fucking dangerous as shit.

457
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,260
But it's more dangerous when
you're not considering the danger.

458
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,400
It's like,

459
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,641
you know,

460
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:42,490
Tj grant guy was fighting
for the lightweight title,

461
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,720
has a title shot lined up,

462
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,420
smashing everybody and it looks fantastic,

463
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,390
has one concussion and
all of a sudden he can't,

464
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,250
he can't recover from
this fucking concussion.

465
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,850
He's got to look this year long.

466
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,320
Headache is all fucked up,

467
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,570
tries to get back every time he
tries to get back to the gym,

468
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,740
tries to start training again,

469
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,970
fucks him up again.

470
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,140
And he's like,

471
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,681
this might,

472
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:00,921
you know,

473
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:01,151
he's,

474
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,270
he's trying to figure out what to do.

475
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,170
Like this might be over,

476
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,270
he was in line for a title
shot a year and a half ago,

477
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:05,760
something like that.

478
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,740
A year and a half million.

479
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,870
And then the guy who was
fighter who fought before he
got that shot of the title

480
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:11,704
is Gray Maynard,

481
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,901
uh,

482
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:16,010
gray Maynard with grain or is
a fucking animal guy comes off.

483
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:16,460
Tough,

484
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,300
tough wrestler,

485
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,253
a hard punch,

486
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,323
you know,

487
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,960
but it goes through these wars.

488
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,730
She got wars with Frankie Edgar.

489
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:24,140
He started off with a great chin too.

490
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:24,860
Yeah.

491
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,490
And then,

492
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:25,780
you know,

493
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,030
the side,

494
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,050
the last fight when Nate Diaz,

495
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,490
he gets tagged and he just,

496
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:29,720
his body freezes.

497
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,554
You could tell,

498
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,790
you could see it in his face.

499
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,940
His body freezes and he like this guy
just is not taking shots the way he used

500
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:38,660
to tag them,

501
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,021
you know,

502
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,640
and maybe he's okay.

503
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,481
Maybe you know,

504
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:42,410
he went into that fight.

505
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,960
That's the other thing guys go
into fight with injuries already.

506
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,220
Like you were talking about,

507
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,030
um,

508
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,740
your fight with Ben Rothwell,

509
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,400
the UN,

510
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,290
that fight we were talking
about on the podcast,

511
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:56,291
you'd got tagged by Corwin and training
up to that and you're going in already

512
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:57,560
diminished.

513
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,960
You going in like with
a weakened chin already.

514
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,440
We,

515
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,800
you know,

516
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,830
if somebody tags you,

517
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,391
you're already,

518
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:03,500
it's like you hurt your knee.

519
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,780
So when he gets you in a knee bar
and your knees tweaked already,

520
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:06,740
like you're fucked.

521
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,640
That's,

522
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,410
that's the same way with everything

523
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,080
Brandon.

524
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,160
I mean if you decided or are you like on
the fence or you for sure fighting for

525
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:15,401
sure.

526
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:16,020
Fighting,

527
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,140
not even up for discussion.

528
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:17,610
Yeah,

529
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,900
I mean you guys can keep talking about it.

530
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,600
Sure.

531
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,433
At this point,

532
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,333
at this point.

533
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,340
That's defensive Brendan Tone know
at this point it would be about,

534
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,670
I think,

535
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,190
uh,

536
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,023
it's,

537
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,580
if Brian started hanging out with any
other fighter who just got into the UFC,

538
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,330
whoever it was,

539
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,250
there's a good chance,

540
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,810
80% chance.

541
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:43,760
I would say that we'd be going
through the exact same thing at,

542
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,990
at whenever a,

543
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,050
that person's career,

544
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,740
you know,

545
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,410
whenever there was like two or
three losses and are big losses,

546
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,220
Bam.

547
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,870
That would mean if you're around Brian,

548
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:57,040
that means Joe likes you too and what
you're hanging out and he gets to know you

549
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:57,360
and,

550
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,300
and he's just,

551
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,030
it really is.

552
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,621
I know,

553
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:00,131
you know this,

554
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:02,650
it really is just him like loving you.

555
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,923
That's all it is.

556
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,920
Zero fence for me.

557
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,500
For me,

558
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,821
I'm like,

559
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:07,001
man,

560
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:08,020
if you want to still fight,

561
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,010
this is what I think.

562
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,540
I think you,

563
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,610
if you just say fuck the brain injury,

564
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:13,241
I don't give a shit.

565
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:13,781
I'm going,

566
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:14,570
I'm going for,

567
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,900
I'm a fucking savage and this
is what I was born to do.

568
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,350
I don't care if my brain
starts going bad at at 50.

569
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,393
If you're going to do that,

570
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,383
then this is,

571
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,680
this is what I would say,

572
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,823
just

573
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,163
get out of here,

574
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,541
Scott,

575
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,160
free every now and then.

576
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,930
Every now and then someone,

577
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,030
some fighters asking me for advice,

578
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,190
what they should do and,

579
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,480
and everything that he said about like,

580
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,280
you know,

581
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,090
like your footwork for example,

582
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:41,350
and kind of lunging with your punches.

583
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:41,680
Yeah.

584
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,270
Obviously you're not as smooth
as Anderson Silva on your feet.

585
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,193
That's obvious.

586
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,970
The goal I would say,

587
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,830
if you're going to keep going,

588
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:50,071
okay,

589
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:54,690
let's fucking get that
foot work and the movement

590
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,330
down,

591
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,070
let's strive to move.

592
00:17:59,071 --> 00:17:59,640
Like,

593
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,061
I mean,

594
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:00,600
uh,

595
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,051
you know,

596
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,890
John Jones,

597
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,480
whatever John Jones has stolen,

598
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,680
however he's moving.

599
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,270
Maybe you'll never be Jon Jones,

600
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,180
but you strive for excellence.

601
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,500
Maybe you get halfway there,

602
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:11,610
but you're in,

603
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,331
in your pursuit,

604
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,710
you get 70% of the way there.

605
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,410
But I think you're a,

606
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,980
you're a tremendous athlete.

607
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,970
You play football,

608
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,110
you can do anything.

609
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:19,770
Um,

610
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,603
I think,

611
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,030
you know,

612
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,610
just critiquing your last fights,

613
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:26,730
it's like spend extra time getting
your footwork professional,

614
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,810
rocky three,

615
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,040
Rocky Balboa,

616
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,880
Mr t,

617
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,631
watch that movie.

618
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,390
You know what I mean?

619
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,390
[inaudible]

620
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,600
was about about him getting
his foot work together.

621
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,020
He gets his footwork together
and then he beats Mr t get,

622
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,330
you can get smooth if you remember it.

623
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,350
Anybody can do it.

624
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,960
If you pay attention to
fiber Eastover doing.

625
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:52,471
For instance,

626
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:52,861
right now,

627
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:53,371
he's a killer.

628
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,440
Stryker with great footwork
and great movement.

629
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,310
He's fucking people up.

630
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,600
But he wasn't like that for awhile.

631
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,380
He was the classic Jujitsu guy like
Hadzic Gracie when he came out,

632
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,150
super good Jujitsu Guy,

633
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,790
they'd had zero stand up and there they,

634
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,520
you don't think I take one
punch that really shaky.

635
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,200
They're trying to get
the fight to the match.

636
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,920
They lose,

637
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,720
lose some decisions that get taken down.

638
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,291
You know,

639
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:13,670
the,

640
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,010
the,

641
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,110
they really don't have anything
to offer on their feet.

642
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,980
Right.

643
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,191
So,

644
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,024
but then you,

645
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,910
what Felicia over doom did than most
other Jujitsu fighters didn't do a lot of

646
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,744
judges to fighters.

647
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,950
They poked him into the MMA world.

648
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,041
I,

649
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:26,331
you know,

650
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,430
on this is gonna take way
too long to way too scary.

651
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,010
Like I'm going to open up an
academy and fucking make money.

652
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,920
Just [inaudible] a lot of guys that
did that and some Jujitsu guys have,

653
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,511
you know,

654
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:36,930
they,

655
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,250
they lasted a few fights,

656
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,840
but they can never get
their stand up together.

657
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:40,080
They,

658
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
it was started looking okay,

659
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:44,310
but then it was just condemn and then
they didn't have the wrestling to take

660
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:44,971
down these wrestlers.

661
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:48,070
So they're stuck standing and they
can't take these wrestlers down there,

662
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,670
not that pro pulling guard.

663
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,190
So they get caught in this mess
and then they get cut in the UFC,

664
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:53,700
UFC,

665
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,870
all these black belts in,

666
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,290
out,

667
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,650
in,

668
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,960
out and out by bt.

669
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,200
Super Doom and out.

670
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,741
But you know what?

671
00:19:58,741 --> 00:19:59,574
He stuck it out.

672
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,220
He stuck it out camp
working on his footwork,

673
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,600
kept working on a strikes,

674
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,070
the power and the combinations.

675
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,310
Look at Fabius we're,

676
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,110
we're doing now.

677
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,100
He stuck it out.

678
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,960
People don't remember those dark
ages he started working with,

679
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,810
he wasn't that good.

680
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,570
His standup wasn't that
good and it takes so long.

681
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,750
I just think you gotta get the ultimate
standup coach do you could find,

682
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,110
and it was just like rocky three,

683
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,630
the focus on lids and then work with,

684
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,111
um,

685
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:25,591
I would just,

686
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,570
just as someone who's giving you advice,

687
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,940
find the best wrestler wrestling team,

688
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:34,941
go to Colorado and get your wrestling
on trying to strive for Olympic level.

689
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,361
You might not get there,

690
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,350
but you're an athlete.

691
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:38,041
You can get real.

692
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,180
Could be an amazing wrestler.

693
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,620
You could be an amazing striker.

694
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,160
You think you can throw all those
spinning kicks and heel kicks.

695
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,551
Yes,

696
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:44,970
you can.

697
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,803
You just gotta practice.

698
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,310
You can do anything you want every time.

699
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,960
Every time we've had discussions like the,

700
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,280
it seems like you,

701
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,930
you think,

702
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,720
um,

703
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,330
that a lot of techniques
or just for certain people,

704
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,290
for their body types.

705
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,540
I believe you can do anything you want.

706
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,810
I believe you can.

707
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,400
I paid them before,

708
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,520
locked down and no,

709
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,370
seriously this,

710
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,640
the real and then,

711
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,490
and then the Jujitsu,

712
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,720
that Jujitsu you need to not to,

713
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,000
to release the stuff.

714
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:10,690
That's that.

715
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,690
That's that whole whatever is keeping
you from opening your mind to the best

716
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:19,240
possible Jujitsu every seen Ben
Saunders his last fight with drill rigs,

717
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,290
oil rigs.

718
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,740
He heard a snap from a takedown,

719
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,830
but you just see how Ben Saunders
was about to eat him up right away.

720
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:27,190
You just see that you can do that.

721
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm not just blowing smoke up your ass.

722
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,340
You could do all that.

723
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,940
Then Saunders came down for
three weeks and I ran it.

724
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,940
People are going to be shocked
when they see him when they buy,

725
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,560
if that fight wouldn't have ended.

726
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,820
Oh Man.

727
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,290
The position we worked on,

728
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,180
Joe rigs just fell right into it.

729
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,720
He,

730
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,810
he was about to light them
up with amazing guard word.

731
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,500
Uh,

732
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,490
Ben Saunders.

733
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,950
A lot of guys have come through my
gym and have a lot of great fighters,

734
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:54,010
but Ben Saunders is the only fighter
ever that I ever worked with.

735
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,740
The came to me or Ricardo
laboriel black belt.

736
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,660
He's already good at on
the ground and he's all,

737
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,890
he has a lot of MMA experience and he's
a great striker with super long legs.

738
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,491
He's six three,

739
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,400
but has the legs held,

740
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,360
his legs are insane and super flexible.

741
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,380
I,

742
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,000
someone just gave me the,

743
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,770
if I said it was perfect,

744
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,210
they gave me a guy to get his rubber
guard together who's already a dangerous

745
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:19,631
striker,

746
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,441
long and Lanky,

747
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:21,520
super flexible.

748
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,920
Already a black belt in Jujitsu,

749
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,850
man,

750
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,080
Ben Saunders is a,

751
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,930
is a,

752
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,750
is going to shock the world.

753
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,890
And I believe,

754
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,710
I believe you give me three weeks,

755
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,760
just come to my gym.

756
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm not going to charge you.

757
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,340
It's still,

758
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,611
you know,

759
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,140
I'm not saying leave Henner Gracie,

760
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:39,190
just train with Henner.

761
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,540
He's got a lot of great stuff.

762
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,340
Henna Gracie has great stuff.

763
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,320
He's the great grandson of Haley.

764
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:44,471
Oh,

765
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:45,140
come on,

766
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,820
give me a break.

767
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,200
He's very super knowledgeable,

768
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,063
right?

769
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,120
All but you can always add to your game.

770
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,710
You could always add weapons.

771
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,770
And that's the mindset I believe
every fighter should have,

772
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,750
including you always.

773
00:22:58,751 --> 00:22:59,021
It's like,

774
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,790
what weapons can I add in wrestling?

775
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,030
Oh,

776
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,110
I'm done with the wrestling.

777
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,250
You're not done with the wrestling.

778
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,720
You need more setups.

779
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,410
You need,

780
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:05,760
uh,

781
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,880
a master wrestling off the fence and
really turn that into an arc on Jujitsu.

782
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,200
There's so much you can cad,

783
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,970
dude,

784
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,410
there's so much you can add.

785
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,430
Talk to Ben Saunders.

786
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:16,480
Talked to Tony Ferguson.

787
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:16,690
Yeah.

788
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,700
When guys actually opened
their mind and come through,

789
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,863
man,

790
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,160
my,

791
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,590
my,

792
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,423
my team,

793
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,850
you know,

794
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,820
we're all working together to come up
with the best possible Jujitsu for MMA

795
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,280
possible.

796
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,360
We're getting a little off track.

797
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,650
I agree with you.

798
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,480
In on all points was about
Brendan has really good Jujitsu.

799
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,810
You definitely could benefit
you to work at guard,

800
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,550
but you're striking.

801
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,440
If I had to say one thing to you when we
talked about this before or right after

802
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:45,201
their Alaska fight,

803
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:45,620
I'm like,

804
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:45,980
you got to

805
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
go and do like some hardcore like go to
some like really elite gym and have a

806
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:58,151
guy like Henri Hooft or have a guy
like rob came in or have Duane Ludwig.

807
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,130
Have someone work with
you for a long time.

808
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,310
Have someone tighten up all 30.

809
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:04,941
Dude,

810
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,361
you're young.

811
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:10,361
You can take a year or two off and you
see somewhat funniest fuck 30 as young as

812
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:13,454
fuck.

813
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,030
You look like you're 24 did
and you're in great shape.

814
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,920
It wouldn't be a bad idea.

815
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:19,161
You know,

816
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,740
if I read tomorrow that you
just wrote a blog and you said,

817
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,221
you know what,

818
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:27,221
I decided I'm going to take two
years off to get my striking to the,

819
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,400
I'm not going to come back until
my striking look beautiful.

820
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,050
I'm,

821
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,480
I'm going to go to Thailand for
fucking six months or whatever.

822
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,740
Just the focus,

823
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,380
the focus should be the foot
work and the combos and,

824
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,280
and the,

825
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,160
the arsenal,

826
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,930
the leg kicks a flying knees.

827
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:45,764
Brendan,

828
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,480
what's your thoughts on the podcast and
the aftermath and all that shit cause

829
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:51,740
we're just talking at you here.

830
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,250
I don't know where to start.

831
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean,

832
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,780
uh,

833
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,020
people think I was like offended or they
thought we were mad at each other and

834
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:03,820
that it couldn't be
further from the truth.

835
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,230
I know you're looking out for me.

836
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:07,300
It's all the only reason I know this.

837
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,350
I wasn't man the least bit.

838
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,900
There's maybe five people in this world
who could talk to me that way and I went

839
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:12,700
and try and kill,

840
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,360
you know what I'm saying?

841
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,781
So,

842
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:14,614
uh,

843
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,240
you're one of them and uh,

844
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:16,991
I dunno man,

845
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:17,370
during the,

846
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,640
it's tough to listen to,

847
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:19,474
you know,

848
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,380
I stopped to listen to them.

849
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:20,830
People are like,

850
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:20,981
Oh,

851
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:21,814
you took it great.

852
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,361
Nah,

853
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:22,571
man,

854
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:23,410
I didn't know what to do.

855
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:26,950
I wish I could take that credit
trying not to cry to be honest.

856
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,903
That's why I was just going,

857
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,863
uh,

858
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:29,860
uh,

859
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,660
because I was,

860
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
if I would have said more than that,

861
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:34,510
I would just start crying and
then people are texting me like,

862
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,021
my brother's like,

863
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:35,351
dude,

864
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:36,610
just fucking leave.

865
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,443
This is brutal.

866
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:37,840
Like,

867
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:37,931
well,

868
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:38,860
I can't do that.

869
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,380
What you mean brother also told
you that he agreed with me?

870
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,273
Yeah.

871
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,171
He agrees to.

872
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,470
As far as he,

873
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,313
he,

874
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,250
he thinks I can be champ.

875
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:49,270
I could fight for a title,

876
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,400
but he thinks that I could make more
money being a doing podcasts in my shows.

877
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,140
But he's also worried about you?

878
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,680
Yeah.

879
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,071
Oh yeah.

880
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:57,461
He's like,

881
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:58,810
I don't want to see you
get punched in the face.

882
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,380
Yeah,

883
00:25:59,380 --> 00:25:59,740
yeah.

884
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,480
He doesn't think I'm like
washed up and I'll shitty.

885
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:05,260
Like you really could become
like you guys together,

886
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,190
especially as a team.

887
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,750
You guys can become a huge force.

888
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,441
That's the other thing.

889
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:08,740
Like,

890
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,490
like you're hilarious,

891
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:09,911
like doing,

892
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:10,481
doing this,

893
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:15,220
doing the podcast with you is by far by
far the biggest thing we've ever done.

894
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,930
And just the notoriety and the
amount of love I get now is insane.

895
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,440
Like I,

896
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,590
I was walking down the street from
Starbucks and this construction workers,

897
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,390
three of them came up to
me and gave me a big hug.

898
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:25,841
Like,

899
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:26,651
don't stop man.

900
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,401
We love you man.

901
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,234
Don't stop.

902
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:28,930
Like,

903
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,763
it's insane.

904
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,660
And then you see the
article in the New Yorker.

905
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,591
I mean,

906
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,320
it's just the coverage we got from it.

907
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,273
And honestly,

908
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,840
when I left here,

909
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:39,010
I texted Brian right away.

910
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:39,340
I said,

911
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,330
we're not posting that man.

912
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,350
I'm super embarrassed.

913
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,220
I'm crying right now.

914
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,083
Do not post.

915
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,940
And I got home again,

916
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,810
cried some more,

917
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,763
and I was like,

918
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,870
I think you and I started talking.

919
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,501
And,

920
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,070
uh,

921
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,341
I was like,

922
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:50,460
yeah,

923
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,250
we probably should post it
because there's an unselfish way.

924
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,901
I've had a lot,

925
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:55,860
I'm not going to mention names.

926
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,990
I've had a lot of fighters
reach out to me who were like,

927
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,830
thanks dude,

928
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,191
like that.

929
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:00,660
That went a long ways man.

930
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,070
I needed to hear that.

931
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,460
I can't believe you've stood in,

932
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:04,470
took it like a man,

933
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,160
blah blah blah.

934
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,000
So I have these people who are in the
business reaching out to me now and I have

935
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:09,511
big shoulders,

936
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:09,720
man,

937
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,471
have thick skin.

938
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:12,540
I'd be shorts for a reason cause
they can take all this shit.

939
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,310
You know what I'm saying?

940
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,890
It,

941
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,690
I took it as you just reaching out to me.

942
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,250
So we spoke about,

943
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,680
hold on top that I'm talking.

944
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,040
I was going to say what he said about,

945
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,030
we talked about releasing it and
you kind of said this is part of,

946
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,130
this is part of my thought process.

947
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:30,780
This is part of the experience of fighting
and that's why he kind of decided why

948
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:31,530
hide this?

949
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,830
Let's not to let this out there and
get the debate I talked about on our

950
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:35,311
podcasts.

951
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:36,510
Like it's like a journey.

952
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,560
Like the reason the show so big and the
reason why when you do a show I walk in,

953
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,090
people are cheering big brown.

954
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,530
It's insane man.

955
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:43,740
When I,

956
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,700
when I go to anything.

957
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:48,540
So the reason why is because they're
on this journey with me like they care,

958
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,800
like they literally care about me.

959
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,140
So I talk about signing a fight.

960
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,130
I talked about getting the trash,

961
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:53,641
Brown fight,

962
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:54,570
how excited I am.

963
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,750
I tell you about going through
training camp and the buildup,

964
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,350
how excited and nervous and scared
and then after the fight win or lose,

965
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:02,460
there's still a part of this journey.

966
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,320
So I'm just going to leave it.

967
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:04,890
And this was a huge part of it.

968
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,120
Good or bad.

969
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,961
It does.

970
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:11,010
I think it does wonders for not only
me but other fighters out there or

971
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:11,371
football.

972
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:12,900
I've had football guys reach out to me.

973
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,830
I had a ton of people reach out to me and
thank me for having that conversation.

974
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,641
Both fighters,

975
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:18,690
trainers,

976
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,520
former fighters,

977
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,900
just across the board.

978
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,063
You know,

979
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,520
so many people don't want
to have that conversation.

980
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,300
They just don't because we all know it's
real and it's the monster in the room

981
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,550
that nobody talks about you.

982
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:32,670
You know what it has done though.

983
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,570
It's like a,

984
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:33,751
you know,

985
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:34,920
obviously you're a powerful dude,

986
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,340
but I don't think you realize
on when you say something,

987
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,070
these fucking people jump on it man.

988
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:45,750
But it's opened up a weird door because
people don't realize that you and I are

989
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:46,590
good friends.

990
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,111
They think,

991
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:47,271
you know,

992
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:48,930
like they see me on here whatever,

993
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,790
six times a year,

994
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:51,720
whenever the fuck I'm here.

995
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,490
So they think we're just whatever.

996
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:55,050
And you call my fights in the UFC.

997
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,020
So it's opened up this door
where like the fucking guy at uh,

998
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:00,520
uh,

999
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,530
Bennigan's or whatever.

1000
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,790
I hop my waiters like,

1001
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,361
yeah,

1002
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:03,691
man,

1003
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,890
heard the podcast.

1004
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,600
I think,

1005
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,330
uh,

1006
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,900
I think,

1007
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,250
I think you might want to give it up

1008
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,763
for sure.

1009
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,913
Starts with,

1010
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,780
I think,

1011
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:12,961
yeah,

1012
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:13,381
for sure.

1013
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,400
Go get my double stack,

1014
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,120
but thanks.

1015
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,721
You know what I'm saying?

1016
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,554
It's like,

1017
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,720
so it's opened up a weird doorman where
I'm telling you I've had close family

1018
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:22,201
and friends,

1019
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:22,920
like,

1020
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,191
wow,

1021
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:24,000
what you need to do.

1022
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,450
They think because I
took the advice thing.

1023
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,960
Everyone thinks I took it well
when I was just trying not to cry.

1024
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,530
They,

1025
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,620
they offered me the advice now where
they've never been a fight in their life

1026
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,990
like a at a family member go,

1027
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,930
I just don't get why you
don't do two week camp.

1028
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,120
I mean you do these eight week camp,

1029
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:42,010
you seem overtrained let's just
go two weeks and then people are

1030
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,270
giving you that kind of advice because
they sat down at two oh five why did they

1031
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,350
come up with a two week camp?

1032
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,150
No one's ever said that.

1033
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:48,301
No,

1034
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,210
it's insane.

1035
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,320
They'd never been a fight.

1036
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,220
Can you make two or five?

1037
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,833
I don't know.

1038
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,801
One day somebody,

1039
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:57,250
somebody close to him said go down
to two or five and fight in February.

1040
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,000
He was like two and it's opened up.

1041
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,710
It's opened up this door
where people are like,

1042
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,071
oh,

1043
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:03,850
shopping cart,

1044
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,661
the likes this.

1045
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:05,650
I'm just going to give them advice.

1046
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,040
If you're changing my oil for sure.

1047
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,830
Don't give me funding advice
so it's open like that door.

1048
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:12,664
You know what I'm saying?

1049
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,640
It's whatever people
love you that were good.

1050
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,361
People love me.

1051
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:16,561
I,

1052
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,700
I've had a conversation with Dwayne and,

1053
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,573
uh,

1054
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,170
listen,

1055
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:20,681
Austin Peay,

1056
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:22,810
I've had conversations with
people that don't like you.

1057
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,940
And I say it's because you don't know.

1058
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,030
That's it.

1059
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,351
I'm like,

1060
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:31,330
if you know him and you don't like me to
take a page out of Brendan Schaub lose

1061
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,164
my number.

1062
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,240
If you know me,

1063
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,073
you don't like them.

1064
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,620
If you know Brendan Schaub,

1065
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,330
you don't like him if I don't
know if I said that right,

1066
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,463
but don't,

1067
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,861
yeah,

1068
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:39,694
you're wrong.

1069
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,990
You're a real nice guy.

1070
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,771
And you know,

1071
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:45,460
and I think that's one
of the hard things about,

1072
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,323
um,

1073
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,540
being in a position where you're,

1074
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:48,940
um,

1075
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,790
you're exposed to the public because
you're just going to get a bunch of

1076
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,760
opinions you're going to,

1077
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,250
but I get it no matter what,

1078
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,240
anything I talk about,

1079
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,410
it's a,

1080
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,550
it's one of the weirdest things.

1081
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,820
Like you'll be in line at Starbucks and
someone will try to bring up some shit

1082
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,661
that happened to you,

1083
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:04,540
like some personal shit from
like 10 years ago or something.

1084
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,920
And I'll talk to you about it.

1085
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,131
Like,

1086
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:06,371
yeah,

1087
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,140
I heard you bring him to you talking
about this and that and blah,

1088
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:08,410
blah.

1089
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:08,890
He's like,

1090
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,071
dude,

1091
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,260
I'm just trying to get a coughing.

1092
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,871
Get out of here.

1093
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,730
We're not going to go into
some weird shit about my dad.

1094
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,680
You know?

1095
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,441
I don't know you.

1096
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:15,274
This is crazy.

1097
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:15,770
He's cause that,

1098
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,870
talk about some shit

1099
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,050
and I think you mean a way.

1100
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:20,590
Yeah,

1101
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,423
in a way.

1102
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,310
But you don't know someone
unless they know you too.

1103
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,690
You do know them,

1104
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,380
but you don't know them in terms of like
how you guys interact with each other,

1105
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:33,430
especially if not accusing
these people being clueless.

1106
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:35,140
But if you run into a clueless person,

1107
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:39,490
they think they have this idea of
who you are based entirely on your

1108
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:40,690
interactions with other people.

1109
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,170
They're not taking into account
how that person would react to you.

1110
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,220
Like you know,

1111
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,700
you think you have this idea of who
the fuck Brian Callan is and how to fix

1112
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:49,510
Brian Cowen.

1113
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,500
But Brian County will be like,

1114
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:50,701
Whoa,

1115
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:50,851
Whoa,

1116
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:51,031
Whoa,

1117
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:51,211
Whoa,

1118
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:51,421
whoa,

1119
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:51,641
Whoa,

1120
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:52,180
whoa.

1121
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,350
How about you look in a mirror,

1122
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,184
motherfucker.

1123
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,870
You know you're talking
all this shit about me.

1124
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:59,800
Why don't you look at yourself like this
is a crazy conversation that you're not

1125
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,800
qualified to be doling
out advice to Brian can.

1126
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:05,690
That's why podcasts are so big
and that's why people buy it.

1127
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,940
Because those same people are going to
listen to every show you do what Rogan

1128
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:10,211
says,

1129
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:11,080
Brennan shop needs this.

1130
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:11,800
Listen,

1131
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,491
I run them and like,

1132
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:12,821
yeah man,

1133
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:13,654
you need to do this road,

1134
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,320
this man.

1135
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,160
It's a numbers thing.

1136
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,083
It's a numbers thing.

1137
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,630
I mean you're dealing with millions of
people now and when you're dealing with

1138
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:20,291
millions of people,

1139
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,440
you're gonna run into a certain amount
that are just crazy and a certain amount

1140
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,100
that overstep boundaries and asserting
them out there just getting real nervous

1141
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:27,841
around you and they,

1142
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:28,040
they,

1143
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,280
they talk out of character
when they're around you.

1144
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,610
That would never bough too.

1145
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,180
Especially if they're drinking.

1146
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,160
How many fucking drunk dudes have
got me and bear hugs and pick me up.

1147
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,243
Fuck crazy.

1148
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,090
Drag me over to their friend's mean.

1149
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,050
People lose their shit.

1150
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:42,831
They didn't know what to do.

1151
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:43,664
They are like that.

1152
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,880
They've grown up with you
in a way like in some way.

1153
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,061
Yeah,

1154
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,350
they get drunk and you know,

1155
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:48,651
just,

1156
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:49,490
it's overwhelming.

1157
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,060
And I've,

1158
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,960
I've experienced it,

1159
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,610
I've been lit up for,

1160
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,470
and I met someone that I
really admire and like,

1161
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,191
Whoa,

1162
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:55,930
this is fucking die.

1163
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,763
And you know,

1164
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,410
you,

1165
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:57,920
you know,

1166
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,920
the only time I ever experienced anything
close to real faith was when I did one

1167
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:06,230
episode of sex in the city
when it was the biggest show.

1168
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:08,750
And I walked through
New York City and I am,

1169
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,420
I am nodding,

1170
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,720
I was with Jimmy Burke
and I am not exaggerating.

1171
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,640
Literally every woman that came by,

1172
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,810
every woman was like,

1173
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,063
oh my God,

1174
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,000
you were so funny.

1175
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,300
Last night I started dragging
Jimmy into bars just to see,

1176
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,620
just to have this experience.

1177
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:21,921
I was like,

1178
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:23,450
women and girls would get drunk.

1179
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,310
They dragged me and I was a prop.

1180
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,570
I was basically a prop.

1181
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,560
They didn't know my name or anything,

1182
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:28,394
but just,

1183
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,030
but we're talking about dudes,

1184
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:30,883
we're talking about

1185
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,550
sex and the city better.

1186
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,500
It's way better.

1187
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,220
Yeah.

1188
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,190
Well I'll go places and guys
a think because I'm a fighter.

1189
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,183
They'll hit me.

1190
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,133
Oh God,

1191
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,070
Holy Shit.

1192
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,150
Shop and hit me.

1193
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:44,810
I'm like,

1194
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,290
I know you don't hit
me mail like to get it.

1195
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,960
How many times do people
ask you to take pictures?

1196
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,093
Choking them.

1197
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,413
I get those.

1198
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,110
Mine's more of a punch punch.

1199
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,070
I do a terrible choke
just so they can't sue me.

1200
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,303
Yeah.

1201
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,460
Well you know the UFC actually told
people to not take pictures with people

1202
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,010
choking him.

1203
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,660
She has chocolate.

1204
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,790
Dale and Matt Hughes both got suit.

1205
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,970
I tell this to people when they asked
me to take a picture choking them and a

1206
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:11,301
picture,

1207
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:11,490
I say,

1208
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,860
I literally can't.

1209
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,200
I've been told not to good scam.

1210
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,720
Can you take a picture of me choking me?

1211
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,240
A guy left a guide to do with Matt Hughes,

1212
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:20,990
listen to this.

1213
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,880
And the guy was a fucking bad cop.

1214
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,620
The guy was a fucking dirty cop.

1215
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,520
So he takes his picture with Matt Hughes.

1216
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,950
Mad is choking him in the picture,

1217
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,640
you know,

1218
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,240
and look,

1219
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,170
Matt's a fucking hard ass in a,

1220
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,270
in a wrestler and one of the greatest
welterweight world champions ever.

1221
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,630
So I'm sure he fucking
really choked this dude.

1222
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:38,991
I'm like,

1223
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:39,824
all right dude.

1224
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:40,851
You want it?

1225
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:41,150
Yeah.

1226
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,660
Country fucking farmer strong.

1227
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:42,891
It was like,

1228
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:43,341
all right dude,

1229
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,180
you want to get silly.

1230
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,910
Just fucking gave him the clamp down,

1231
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:48,260
but he didn't hurt the guy.

1232
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,210
At the very least,

1233
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:51,044
the guy got it.

1234
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,200
He got to experience what it feels
like to get choked by a fucking world

1235
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:54,830
champion.

1236
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,120
So this guy goes and he's
files this lawsuit because
he's got the photo of Matt.

1237
00:34:59,121 --> 00:34:59,954
He was choking him.

1238
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,510
Meanwhile everybody around
says the guy asked Matt,

1239
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:05,600
he was to choke him in the picture and
then they start looking into this dude

1240
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:06,680
because the dude soon,

1241
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:10,010
Matt Hughes and they find out he's dirties
doing all sorts of illegal shit and

1242
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:10,850
now the guy's in jail.

1243
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,370
Oh guy went to jail because of that
shows people in pictures and then chuck

1244
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:16,880
Ladelle wound up,

1245
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,680
I believe I might be
talking about a school here,

1246
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,840
but I'm almost positive he settled.

1247
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,110
I'm almost positive they had to settle
because it was some stupid number,

1248
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:25,610
like 10,000 and the lawyers like,

1249
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:25,761
look,

1250
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:27,950
you're going to spend
25 grand fight in this.

1251
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,270
But they use that commercially.

1252
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:30,710
Does that oil filter,

1253
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,161
commercial,

1254
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:31,671
whatever it is,

1255
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,150
where he's just zoning or some shit.

1256
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,410
This is a long time ago.

1257
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,450
This is a long time ago while
he was a world champion.

1258
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,290
Yeah.

1259
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,123
That's crazy man.

1260
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:41,490
Yeah,

1261
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,323
it happens all the time.

1262
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,080
So what do you,

1263
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,681
what do you want to do?

1264
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:44,514
What's your plan?

1265
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,920
How are you going to rebound from this?

1266
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,293
Uh,

1267
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
make some changes,

1268
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,550
switch some things up.

1269
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,180
I'll go over it.

1270
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,560
I'll probably off here
what I'm going to do,

1271
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,394
but uh,

1272
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,750
just make some changes camp wise,

1273
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,580
coach wise and um,

1274
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,270
just focus on my weaknesses and get
better man where card and then uh,

1275
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,150
I'll fight again.

1276
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,580
Heavyweight and I would imagine,

1277
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,480
uh,

1278
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,730
mid next year and what helps me right now,

1279
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,031
you know?

1280
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:06,181
Yeah,

1281
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm in a dark place,

1282
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,914
but um,

1283
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,731
our podcast,

1284
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:11,130
find the kid and doing stuff
like this really helps me man.

1285
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,810
So I'm focused on the podcast.

1286
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:17,280
I've wrote a couple of new segments
and if you can keep this guy in line,

1287
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,430
like you guys make them show up
and you guys work together still.

1288
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,540
You guys are great team.

1289
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,463
It's hilarious.

1290
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,310
It's hilarious.

1291
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:23,700
Team.

1292
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,440
You have like a man,

1293
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,000
very Brian is,

1294
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,230
I count on Brian,

1295
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,771
you know,

1296
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,300
I mean I goof on Brian all the time,

1297
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,141
but when,

1298
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:34,040
when I had this opportunity to
go hunting for that show meter,

1299
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,670
it's only one guy called,

1300
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,590
cause I know that Brian would go camping,

1301
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,420

1302
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:38,620
he'll,

1303
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,080
he'll sleep in the snow.

1304
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,771
Like he's,

1305
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:41,250
he's just,

1306
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,720
he just can go through shit.

1307
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,740
He ain't calling me.

1308
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,253
I called Eddie,

1309
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,950
Eddie Bravo be like,

1310
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:47,291
dude,

1311
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:52,291
you can go to the supermart
heading off [inaudible] Brian's.

1312
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,430
Brian is there for you too.

1313
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,540
And Brian is also never angry
at you and never in a bad mood.

1314
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,890
He's a very unique guy,

1315
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,000
is a very unique guy.

1316
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,481
You know,

1318
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,370
I love Eddie.

1319
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,260
He's my pride.

1320
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,200
And these guys are both,

1321
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,340
they're both my brothers,

1322
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,720
but Eddie,

1323
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:14,190
the difference between them is like
Eddie can get upset at people about shit,

1324
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,810
but I've never seen you upset
anyone in my life where you're like,

1325
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:20,130
fuck that guy man.

1326
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,240
If whatever reason,

1327
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,620
whatever you have in you,

1328
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:24,210
you have this weird
thing and you man will,

1329
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:24,990
you just,

1330
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,040
you're like a duck.

1331
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,690
Water just rolls off your back,

1332
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,230
shake that shit and you keep on going.

1333
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,083
I can't stay.

1334
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,920
It's,

1335
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,220
it's an amazing positive quality because
Eddie and I are very similar in a way.

1336
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:37,050
We're both really nice,

1337
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,400
but deep,

1338
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:41,790
deep down inside we have some weird
resentment shit because of our dads.

1339
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,330
You know,

1340
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,070
there's like this anger shit.

1341
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:47,220
We both have one of
this weird abandonment,

1342
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,730
anger shit where we're like,

1343
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,020
you know,

1344
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,070
fuck the world,

1345
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,490
you know?

1346
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,650
But it's also one of the
reasons why we're brothers.

1347
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:53,484
It's like,

1348
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,960
you know what?

1349
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,940
I'm like the same with you man.

1350
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,900
When we met each other,

1351
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:58,950
we became best friends,

1352
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,810
like instantaneous.

1353
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,290
I know,

1354
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:01,591
you know,

1355
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:03,960
with you and with Eddie
was exactly the same thing.

1356
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,971
Like you,

1357
00:38:04,971 --> 00:38:06,020
you could sleep in my house,

1358
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,200
you can do whatever the
fuck you want to do.

1359
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:07,951
You want to borrow my car,

1360
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:08,131
you know,

1361
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:11,910
it's instantaneously because we have this,

1362
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:12,610
you know,

1363
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,200
you know,

1364
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,630
I know when dudes are real,

1365
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,290
you know,

1366
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,030
I know when no one's going to fuck me.

1367
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,571
I know,

1368
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,404
I know when I,

1369
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,430
when you have love for someone and you
know it's reciprocated and you know,

1370
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,630
I would do anything for you.

1371
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:25,280
You know that.

1372
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,180
And I would do anything for you
and I would do anything for you.

1373
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,830
It's if I really would.

1374
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,360
And so being in this situation where
you're watching someone and they're,

1375
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,620
they're going down a path you'd like,

1376
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,790
God dammit,

1377
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,990
there's a fucking cliff.

1378
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,170
How do I tell him there's a fucking cliff
at the end of this shit is a fucking

1379
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,004
cliff.

1380
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,450
There's a goddamn cliff.

1381
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,660
And he's done it.

1382
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,420
Especially as someone that,

1383
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:46,631
yeah,

1384
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:47,171
but you know what,

1385
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:47,380
like,

1386
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,740
you could,

1387
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,420
you could rebound from a lot of the shit,

1388
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,990
but someone who's a,

1389
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,060
uh,

1390
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,350
mixed martial arts fighter,

1391
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,540
it's a fucking crazy cliff cause it's,

1392
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,980
it just goes,

1393
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,860
it just drops off and there's
no pillow at the bottom.

1394
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,120
There's no airbag.

1395
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,910
And there's ways around
that fucking cliff.

1396
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,301
You know,

1397
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:04,931
Matt Hughes,

1398
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:05,800
perfect example,

1399
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,461
Matt Hughes,

1400
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,271
you talked to him today.

1401
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,260
He's sharp as a tack.

1402
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,423
He's fine,

1403
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,120
he's fine.

1404
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,440
And he was never a great striker,

1405
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,371
you know,

1406
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:14,860
he never got knocked out or
he got knocked out in the,

1407
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:15,880
in the cage couple of times,

1408
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
but he never really knocked anybody
out other than Henzel Gracie,

1409
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:19,001
like standing.

1410
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,790
Everything was like him taking
guys down ground and pounding him,

1411
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,301
you know,

1412
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:22,581
but he,

1413
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:22,750
you know,

1414
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,160
he got knocked out by Bj.

1415
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,860
He got knocked out by
Palae way back in the day.

1416
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,221
You know,

1417
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,480
he stopped by a few guys.

1418
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:29,770
George Saint Pierre stopped him.

1419
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:30,970
Um,

1420
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,420
you know,

1421
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,660
he fought some really
fucking bad ass dudes,

1422
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,220
but to this day he's fine.

1423
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,630
I talked to Matt all the time.

1424
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,230
It's a fence.

1425
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,670
He was one of those guys that said,

1426
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:40,390
okay,

1427
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,780
that's it.

1428
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,680
I had a good run.

1429
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,030
These new dudes.

1430
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:43,691
Holy Shit.

1431
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:45,370
I'm actually going to have
to learn how to strike,

1432
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,390
compete with these guys.

1433
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,320
Fuck that.

1434
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,460
How about c?

1435
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,050
Well,

1436
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,740
you know,

1437
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,370
there's just,

1438
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,600
everybody has,

1439
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,320
like I said,

1440
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,280
you have a rock.

1441
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,540
We're all born with a rock.

1442
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,250
Different people's rocks
are different size.

1443
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,320
Mark Hunt's rock is as
big as this fucking room.

1444
00:39:59,650 --> 00:39:59,951
You know,

1445
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:01,350
he's got a different size of the rock.

1446
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,300
Some guys have a rock that's
like really small man.

1447
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,970
Some guys rock like you gotta
be careful what your sculpture,

1448
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,900
you're designing something and you
should design that to the best of your

1449
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,360
possible abilities and with you,

1450
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,310
you're a very high profile dude,

1451
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:16,990
not just because of the UFC,

1452
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,850
but now because of the podcast.

1453
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,320
You have the opportunity.

1454
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:24,790
I mean you could get guys who would be
more than happy to take partial credit

1455
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,610
for turning your striking around for
turning you into an elite kickboxer.

1456
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:29,170
Yeah,

1457
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,000
Duane Ludwig is the motherfucking man.

1458
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:31,301
Dude.

1459
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:35,380
I mean I'd never met a guy who was
more obsessed with taking fighters and

1460
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:40,381
turning them into like prodigies based
on all of the information that he has in

1461
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:41,350
his head.

1462
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,350
He's texted me several times right before
we came in here and we've talked about

1463
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:46,470
it.

1464
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,690
Let me,

1465
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,770
Dwayne and I have talked about you to
Dwayne and I talked about you before I

1466
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:52,120
brought him in to work with you.

1467
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:55,630
I brought him in to work with
you because I have a deep,

1468
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:59,590
tremendous respect for Dwayne's
knowledge and also his obsession.

1469
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,760
Dwayne's a nut.

1470
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,330
Really?

1471
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,290
He's a nuts.

1472
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,230
You get that Tj Dillashaw
foot work together.

1473
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,830
You could do that.

1474
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,150
It's just going to take a lot of work,

1475
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:08,260
but anybody could do it.

1476
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,071
Not only that,

1477
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,270
Duane is Dwayne,

1478
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,160
doesn't sugarcoat Jack Shit.

1479
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,370
Dwayne won't sugarcoat and he
won't even sugarcoat sugar.

1480
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,140
You know,

1481
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,470
Dwayne's like that's planted sugar.

1482
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,610
It is what it is.

1483
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:19,180
You know,

1484
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,691
I love you.

1485
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:20,530
You're my mother Fucker,

1486
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:21,490
but this is wrong.

1487
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,670
You're lifting your back foot off
off when you throw in right hands.

1488
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,360
What the fuck kind of shit is that like
Dwayne will go and then you do it right?

1489
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:28,631
He like,

1490
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:28,961
yeah,

1491
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:29,794
motherfucker,

1492
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,411
I kill.

1493
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:32,890
He'll give you all the positive
reinforcement when you do it right,

1494
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,070
but if you do it wrong,

1495
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:34,311
Dwayne,

1496
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:35,390
what's a shit in your mouth?

1497
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:35,841
You know,

1498
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:36,260
he doesn't,

1499
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,160
he doesn't give a fuck.

1500
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:37,341
You know,

1501
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:41,720
he's a guy who's fought for world titles
and kickboxing was a elite MMA fighter

1502
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:42,890
for a long time,

1503
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,280
you know,

1504
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,330
has been down.

1505
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,021
He's been up,

1506
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,780
he's been Kod Kaos guys been submitted,

1507
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,710
seen it all.

1508
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,030
Yeah,

1509
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,701
no crazy.

1510
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:52,460
Would it be if Duane Ludwig
got his shit together?

1511
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,200
He's coming out looking smooth.

1512
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,280
That would be amazing.

1513
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:55,851
You know,

1514
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:56,390
it's all,

1515
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,800
it's all just about numbers.

1516
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,330
And I was say that
fighting in a lot of ways,

1517
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,800
it's like having a conversation.

1518
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,360
Someone could shout you down.

1519
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,131
You know someone,

1520
00:42:06,131 --> 00:42:07,460
if you don't know how to deal with it,

1521
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:08,630
someone can shout you down.

1522
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,080
But if you'd know how to deal with it
and someone tries to shout you down,

1523
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:12,860
you'll like,

1524
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,050
you'll slip away and then
they'll get tired of,

1525
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,250
and you down and you go,

1526
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,330
what did you just say now?

1527
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,320
What'd you say?

1528
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,650
You basically said nothing and here's why
he said nothing cause you're a fucking

1529
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,600
idiot and this is why
you're a fucking idiot.

1530
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,280
And then you start hitting him with all
these words that they don't know and all

1531
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,690
these sentences they
couldn't possibly form.

1532
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,151
And you,

1533
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:32,900
you barrage them with a,

1534
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:35,990
a verbal assault of intelligence and of,

1535
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,630
of articulation that
they're not capable of.

1536
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,640
And a lot of ways fighting is like that.

1537
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,090
There's some guys that could storm out
of the gate and they have one technique

1538
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:45,350
and they throw it out
here and they fucking,

1539
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,300
but if you're skilled,

1540
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,480
you move and you slip and you slide and
eventually you start Anderson Silva and

1541
00:42:53,111 --> 00:42:53,750
a motherfucker.

1542
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,640
Like when Anderson Silva
fought Stephan Bonner,

1543
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,170
one of the best examples is like
force it guy or Forrest Griffin.

1544
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,790
Both of them are good
both to stem the bar.

1545
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:05,660
It was crazy because he backed his
body up against the cage that we,

1546
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,630
me and forth.

1547
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,911
Oh yeah.

1548
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:09,130
Well he just left for it.

1549
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,180
Perfect example in another way in that
forest got Kol dose times in training.

1550
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,370
He got knocked out twice in training.

1551
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:16,760
He did.

1552
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,120
Yeah.

1553
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,640
Yeah,

1554
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:17,961
it was,

1555
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:18,470
you know,

1556
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,950
I'm sure had people
telling him to not fight.

1557
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,251
You know,

1558
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:22,461
I mean,

1559
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,040
I'm sure he,

1560
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:29,350
it's just what you know also forces a
good example of a guy who won a world

1561
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,220
title came off the ultimate fighter,

1562
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:32,990
got fed immediately to the dogs.

1563
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,030
I mean it was fighting like elite guys,

1564
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:35,571
you know,

1565
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,800
like right off the bat.

1566
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,160
And then you look at forest now.

1567
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:38,994
I mean for us,

1568
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,910
he's physically in a lot of trouble.

1569
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,190
Like he can't even brush his
teeth with his right hand.

1570
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,840
He's talked about it pretty openly.

1571
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:47,180
He's bodies like really
fucked up his shoulders.

1572
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,340
He's taken a lot of
punishment to the head.

1573
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,350
He was a big dude to cut to a five though.

1574
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:51,770
Fuck yeah.

1575
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,521
That was my size,

1576
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:53,121
if not bigger.

1577
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:54,470
And he said he's a big dude.

1578
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,270
So cutting down for that many years.

1579
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:56,510
Really.

1580
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,261
Guess who else is?

1581
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:00,650
John motherfucking Jones Jones
walks around two 30 all the time.

1582
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,281
It doesn't really.

1583
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:01,461
Yeah,

1584
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:03,290
when Jon Jones is a,

1585
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:03,681
you know,

1586
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:05,330
like when he carries around,

1587
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,120
did you get your body fat measured?

1588
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:08,954
What's your body fat?

1589
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,660
That was 14% last time was a really,

1590
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,920
how long was that ago?

1591
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,143
Uh,

1592
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,070
who's to eight weeks ago.

1593
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,581
How do they do it?

1594
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:17,450
There's some merging you,

1595
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,770
uh,

1596
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:19,604
it's with some,

1597
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,640
some body composition
machine that scans your body.

1598
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,270
Ah,

1599
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,661
interests,

1600
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,530
fanciest thing.

1601
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,380
I would've thought you would've been
higher than that because I'm 17%.

1602
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,390
I was 17 or 15%.

1603
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,471
But heavyweights.

1604
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:31,710
You know mark hot.

1605
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,220
You're pretty

1606
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,950
lean.

1607
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,060
Well,

1608
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,301
yeah.

1609
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:34,110
Yeah.

1610
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,580
I think my head is fat out of fat head.

1611
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,193
Who's like,

1612
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,120
it's him.

1613
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,700
I got a couple of big,

1614
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,290
my Noggins I probably,

1615
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,150
Bravo actually broke.

1616
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,720
I put my head next to dean lister.

1617
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,260
No,

1618
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,060
he's world renowned for
the size of his head.

1619
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,630
Yeah,

1620
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,470
we took a picture.

1621
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,630
He's world renown.

1622
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,060
My head's bigger than Dean listers.

1623
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,240
Steve Bay MyUsage is getting a good size.

1624
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,320
Good Noggin.

1625
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,510
I won't cheat.

1626
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,680
What did you think watching that fight?

1627
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:12,040
What a God damn slobber knocker steep
bay and junior dos sites and how they can

1628
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:12,841
take that much punishment.

1629
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:15,960
Speaking to pump I jds look stiff.

1630
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,590
Yes.

1631
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:16,801
Well,

1632
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:17,131
you know what?

1633
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:17,910
He looked bigger.

1634
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,940
What's weird is that he weighed,

1635
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,540
weighed the same.

1636
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,030
You wait around while he
looked 40 might've been leaner.

1637
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,640
Like he look more shredded and this they
just look like he looked perhaps better

1638
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,320
to what might've been
leaner John Fish's body.

1639
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,040
Did you say John?

1640
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,873
I was crazy.

1641
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,490
Crazy.

1642
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,323
Shredded,

1643
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:35,540
shredded.

1644
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,580
I never seen him like
he used to be like Mike.

1645
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:38,111
Just see,

1646
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:38,944
I know I,

1647
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,750
he stopped.

1648
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,710
He stopped being a Vegan,

1649
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,670
started eating meat again.

1650
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,200
Oh God.

1651
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,391
She'll,

1652
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,690
she'll stop being a vegan doe.

1653
00:45:46,691 --> 00:45:47,170
He's still a,

1654
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,003
and I just talked to him.

1655
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,410
What'd you guys think of that?

1656
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:49,880
Uh,

1657
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,501
Rusa Mark Paul,

1658
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:55,501
Horace minibar nasty trash dude
monsters and he gets a hold of it.

1659
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:56,640
You know what?

1660
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,030
I think,

1661
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,301
man,

1662
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:01,890
I think he's held on to submissions
way too long in the past.

1663
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,340
But this one was saying it is,

1664
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:03,780
yeah.

1665
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,890
People were saying it was too long.

1666
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,581
Here's the deal.

1667
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:06,750
If it was any other submission,

1668
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,670
it was an arm bar or rear naked choke.

1669
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,790
No one have a problem with it.

1670
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,320
It's the fact that it's a heal hook and
then it transitioned to a knee bar and

1671
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:17,280
everybody's thinking about their knee
exploding and you know that where the heel

1672
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:17,491
hook,

1673
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:18,324
especially,

1674
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,350
you don't have any time,

1675
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,184
man,

1676
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:21,570
by the time you're hurting.

1677
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,201
Oh Jesus.

1678
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:22,671
Too late.

1679
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:23,431
How has his knee,

1680
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:23,821
it's okay,

1681
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:24,180
right?

1682
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,013
It's fucked.

1683
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,080
Fucked.

1684
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,180
I look at the position as needs in price.

1685
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,310
It doesn't mean anything.

1686
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,153
Tour,

1687
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,620
try to need someone in the face.

1688
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:35,670
They're not holding back.

1689
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,990
It's not 80% power.

1690
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,530
It's either trying to put
their knee through your faith,

1691
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:40,380
100% power,

1692
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,680
as many motherfucking times they
can and the referee stops it.

1693
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:43,980
It's fine.

1694
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,120
So when you get injured with,

1695
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,290
with little joint locks,

1696
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,760
personally for me,

1697
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,320
I do Jujitsu.

1698
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,370
That's just part of the game.

1699
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:50,791
You know what I mean?

1700
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:50,971
Yeah.

1701
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,440
He held it on a little bit long,

1702
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,580
but that's MMA.

1703
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,720
It was a Jujitsu match.

1704
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:55,260
That's a big,

1705
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,460
he's so good at that.

1706
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,323
His opponent,

1707
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,280
his face.

1708
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,610
But he didn't even in this fight,

1709
00:46:59,710 --> 00:46:59,970
he,

1710
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,880
I mean it was like literally
he's holding onto it.

1711
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,100
John fitches tapping the referee grabs.

1712
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:05,983
I mean,

1713
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,480
yeah,

1714
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,200
I mean it's not,

1715
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,580
he's in the past held on the shift and
the referees pulling on his arms and he

1716
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:12,420
won't let go.

1717
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,680
He doesn't do that.

1718
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:15,080
And then the issue they have is because,

1719
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,570
uh,

1720
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,130
fitches tapping and you didn't let go.

1721
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:19,050
He doesn't like go to the ref stops you.

1722
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,831
You're not supposed to.

1723
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:20,221
Exactly.

1724
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:21,570
What people don't know is in the back.

1725
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,680
The Ref says that,

1726
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,790
you know what I'm saying?

1727
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,590
So he's trained to do that.

1728
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,410
He's so strong.

1729
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,310
He's five

1730
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,410
foot seven and a half
or something like that.

1731
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:35,680
So he's all muscle and all gorilla bones.

1732
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,750
And did he see how we
drive the rail tendons?

1733
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,130
Did you notice that he pulled guard?

1734
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:39,700
Yeah.

1735
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,090
Oh yeah.

1736
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,700
He was not John Fitch down.

1737
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:41,891
He's like,

1738
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:42,040
no,

1739
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,360
he needs John Pitch on the ground.

1740
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,510
How the fuck is a Brazilian gonna take
a wrestler down if you're not Damien

1741
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,560
Meyer,

1742
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,700
he's the only guy that's doing it.

1743
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,151
You know,

1744
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:49,500
he did it.

1745
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,730
You're just like stupid
little single shot.

1746
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,340
And then he pulled
guard right into a heel.

1747
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:58,480
So I don't think anybody knows what a
heel hook really feels like until that guy

1748
00:47:58,481 --> 00:47:59,410
gets a hold of your legs.

1749
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,680
So people that are against
pulling guard right there.

1750
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,790
That was a perfect example of
a guy he could not take down,

1751
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,380
but he's still got them down anyways.

1752
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,880
He's so dangerous.

1753
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,650
It's one of those things
that people forget about.

1754
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:12,221
Horrifying.

1755
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:13,080
I was scared.

1756
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,400
He's horrifying cause he's
going to mangle your leg.

1757
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:16,310
You're not even gonna train.

1758
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,170
Never going to be the same.

1759
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,200
You won't even try.

1760
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,410
You know what you can be
as they're going to fight.

1761
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:21,011
Rusa Marple,

1762
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:22,480
Horace tap early.

1763
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,810
Alan Belcher not only did the best
anybody's ever done at dealing with his

1764
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:33,760
ground game and being caught
up in it and defending,

1765
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,000
he also put out a video on
what John Fitch did wrong,

1766
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,080
which John Fitch should have done.

1767
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:38,280
Right.

1768
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:38,940
Really?

1769
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,290
Yeah,

1770
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:39,560
that,

1771
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:39,860
yeah,

1772
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,000
yeah,

1773
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,240
yeah.

1774
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,690
He went into the fire and literally
stopped all of Paula Harris stuff.

1775
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:44,730
Literally caught up.

1776
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,940
Not too long to see that.

1777
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,140
No,

1778
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,950
pull it up.

1779
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,610
Pull that up.

1780
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,150
Uh,

1781
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,220
Alan Belcher versus who?

1782
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:51,970
Some Paul.

1783
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,121
Yeah.

1784
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:54,070
You put it on that because
we don't want to steal any,

1785
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,960
any hitters from your computer.

1786
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,141
Oh,

1787
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:56,510
it is.

1788
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:56,891
Okay.

1789
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:57,700
That's right.

1790
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:57,971
Okay,

1791
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:58,990
let's see what we could find it here.

1792
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,740
I saw him like two weeks after
that event and I was like,

1793
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,800
yeah,

1794
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,660
just something like that.

1795
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,150
Branding,

1796
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,411
just,

1797
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,244
just the,

1798
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,610
you can get as good with
leg blocks as recent,

1799
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,320
more porous.

1800
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,730
You can get that good.

1801
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,660
And if you are in a situation where you
needed to get this fight to the ground,

1802
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:18,490
the guy was too much
dangerous of the striker.

1803
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:19,470
But you couldn't take him down to him.

1804
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:19,720
Go.

1805
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,310
You could pull guard
with those heel hooks.

1806
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,060
You can do it.

1807
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,661
Anybody can do it.

1808
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:23,500
They just got to work on it.

1809
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,423
Yeah.

1810
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:25,743
Let's see this now.

1811
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,420
Profit Alan Belcher.

1812
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,730
Let me kill us all on this motherfucker.

1813
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,370
He's a good dude too.

1814
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,490
Yeah,

1815
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,010
the Brendan Schaub comeback.

1816
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,010
I don't hear anything in this.

1817
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,560
This is the first 45 minutes of
the movie rise of the night rising.

1818
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:44,021
Good Brown.

1819
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:44,780
All right.

1820
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,780
And then also I'm going to
show how maybe you could get,

1821
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,140
do something a little bit better amount
of say John Fish did something wrong.

1822
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:56,000
A lot of people made the same mistake
and a couple of days and look out for it.

1823
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,410
So first off,

1824
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:58,650
uh,

1825
00:49:58,650 --> 00:49:59,440
probably ours,

1826
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,690
the way that he gets to the leg locks a
lot of times is he got the attacks the

1827
00:50:02,691 --> 00:50:05,690
legs on a single leg or double
leg and then drops under this.

1828
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:07,790
Take him that he did
and was on the outside.

1829
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,350
And then he started lifting the leg
almost like he was going to switch to a

1830
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,184
double leg.

1831
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,940
And he does it with the perfect Tommy
with a lot of his tech techniques.

1832
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,890
He does a really good like set
up by faking the take down.

1833
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,190
It lifts a leg or right
when the guy just to it,

1834
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:27,260
that's when he dropped underneath.

1835
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,010
Yup.

1836
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,270
Right under the leg and
starts to attack the,

1837
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,150
the a leg lock right here.

1838
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,800
So John Fitch did a good job

1839
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,400
to put his weight on the leg and,

1840
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,960
and start to go like this.

1841
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,410
So my rs locks his legs over here.

1842
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,330
Can you come around this side for me?

1843
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,330
Alan Belcher really
breaks down who some are.

1844
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,370
Paul Horez versus John Fitch.

1845
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,383
The knee inside.

1846
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,280
I know you're not going
to spell this right.

1847
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:57,961
Alan Belcher.

1848
00:50:57,961 --> 00:50:58,794
John Fitch

1849
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,240
move and I have it trapped here.

1850
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,080
So part of ours continues to twist here
until he finally knocks Fitch down.

1851
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,840
And then he starts to attack this hill,

1852
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,510
but bringing his wrist underneath here,

1853
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,990
but his hand and then pulling on
his hand like this right here.

1854
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:22,480
And what he wants to do is tighten up
the legs and push the toes back and get a

1855
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:23,740
heel hook just like that.

1856
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,263
Right.

1857
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:29,500
So what Fitch was doing here was
unraveling his feet a little bit,

1858
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,251
openness feed up,

1859
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:32,170
trying to take this off by artist,

1860
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:34,300
wants to bring this over,

1861
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,500
just like that.

1862
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,650
And he was making space
cutting his knee across,

1863
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,250
and then Fitch was also
straightened his leg out.

1864
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,560
Okay.

1865
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,560
What pilates does though is he
squeezes the knees and he brings this,

1866
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,250
he keeps twisting it even though it's
straight and he's expecting the guy to

1867
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:54,040
roll out because the pressure
I'm putting makes them spin.

1868
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,480
But as he spins,

1869
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:56,770
I turned back the other way,

1870
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,830
which helps break his knee more,

1871
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,850
but also puts me right into
a physician for a knee bar.

1872
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,150
So now he locks his figure four right
above the knee and he keeps this grew up

1873
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:15,340
here and he can thrust his hips down
while I pull in this street and actually

1874
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,380
twist in the hill.

1875
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:17,340
Also at the same time.

1876
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,030
It helps if you don't have side a
little bit and you can see in the fight

1877
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:23,230
pirates got on his side.

1878
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:27,280
I think it might've been all the
way go this way to this side here

1879
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,410
was actually elevated that he
actually elevated me hands back,

1880
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:31,701
back.

1881
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:33,450
I can feel more room.

1882
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,520
It's almost as if I
have this behind my arm.

1883
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:41,470
It shows really strong and I twist
the hill booming and I fussed my hips.

1884
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:42,380
They're getting the tap.

1885
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,620
All right.

1886
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,060
Okay.

1887
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,893
So

1888
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,060
they probably too long for us to want
to see what he should have done though.

1889
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,580
Yeah,

1890
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,970
but this is going to be so long time
for people that are listening to this

1891
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:56,163
podcast.

1892
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,900
Go Watch it.

1893
00:52:58,930 --> 00:52:59,890
We'll watch it after the show,

1894
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:00,820
but I want to give a,

1895
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:03,820
I also want to get Alan as
many hits on this as possible.

1896
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,440
So if you go to Alan Belcher's,

1897
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:06,640
a youtube page,

1898
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,620
it's Alan Belcher breaks down who?

1899
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:09,401
Some are Paul Harris.

1900
00:53:09,401 --> 00:53:11,740
But this shit is like 1520
minutes long or something.

1901
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,370
It actually,

1902
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,380
it's only 11 minutes but

1903
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,613
pretty dope though.

1904
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,090
I'd like to sell it Belcher.

1905
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,320
I'd like to see how he defends it.

1906
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,520
Who did a better,

1907
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,100
no one's a better job at defending

1908
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,933
leg locks,

1909
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,390
uh,

1910
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:27,751
in,

1911
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:28,680
in the octagon,

1912
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,610
in front of the world.

1913
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,110
Millions of people pay per view.

1914
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,340
Then Alan Belcher,

1915
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,360
he rusa,

1916
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,460
Marco Horace was all over his legs.

1917
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,370
He had five different
intents that his legs.

1918
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,380
And what Alan Belcher did is he flew dean
lister in for that camp and he flew in

1919
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:44,670
a guy named Davi Ramos,

1920
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:46,590
who's a leg lock wizards.

1921
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:51,480
And he just had those guys jump on
his legs for two months straight.

1922
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,120
And he said the first couple of
weeks he was tapping left and right.

1923
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,090
But after a while he
learned how to stop that.

1924
00:53:57,091 --> 00:53:57,780
And I have,

1925
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,530
and then it just became instinct and
then he became impossible to tap with,

1926
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:01,841
like lost.

1927
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,210
So you just have to walk through the fire.

1928
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,880
You just have to go through all
those taps and not worry about it.

1929
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:06,960
Just know you're going to get through it.

1930
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,503
And no matter what,

1931
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:09,683
no matter what,

1932
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,870
unless you have some kind of brain defect,

1933
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,480
you put yourself in those
bad spots long enough,

1934
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,920
you will figure it out.

1935
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,531
It was a stress,

1936
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:18,090
the Ba.

1937
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,110
Then after a while you're like,

1938
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,141
I don't know.

1939
00:54:20,141 --> 00:54:21,270
I'm worried about this at all.

1940
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,800
Not only do I not worry about it,

1941
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,060
but I'm going to attack from there.

1942
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:27,790
Sorry.

1943
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:29,500
Someone's an alcoholic.

1944
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,750
Dee Dee Dee Dee.

1945
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,260
I got a drink and a couple of bottles.

1946
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:33,094
Deep Humbug.

1947
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,933
Yeah.

1948
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,750
Um,

1949
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,750
so I think we probably talked enough
about Brendan shop and branch ops career.

1950
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,893
I think so.

1951
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,123
I love you guys.

1952
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:43,510
Are you guys allowed to pull out,

1953
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:43,841
pull out?

1954
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:45,220
You have to shoot right past fights.

1955
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:45,401
Yeah.

1956
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:45,580
Well,

1957
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,810
we're not really watching them.

1958
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:47,041
We're,

1959
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:47,800
we're going to watch.

1960
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,790
They're go to the people at home.

1961
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:49,660
I got to see us.

1962
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,501
The,

1963
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:50,651
uh,

1964
00:54:50,651 --> 00:54:52,570
the video up there is,

1965
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,150
we're watched.

1966
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:56,410
See where we're watching w w
what's going on on Youtube.

1967
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,240
But once we go to fight pass,

1968
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,200
the people at homework is
still going to continue.

1969
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:03,280
We see that we can fight back.

1970
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,671
Oh yeah.

1971
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:05,380
We're going to watch the fights.

1972
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,100
We're going to watch the fight on
fight pass and I want to watch 'em.

1973
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,900
We're gonna Watch some classic fights,

1974
00:55:10,901 --> 00:55:11,350
man.

1975
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,360
And I want to watch
some early fade or man,

1976
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:16,210
because why early phase such a,

1977
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:17,090
so scary.

1978
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,120
The Tyson days.

1979
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:19,961
Good God.

1980
00:55:19,961 --> 00:55:20,794
It's time.

1981
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,110
This is fade or versus Nogueira.

1982
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,730
This is the first one.

1983
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:25,983
And uh,

1984
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,370
we can get volume on this,

1985
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:27,521
right?

1986
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:28,110
We can hear it.

1987
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,360
So,

1988
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,580
so Wilfredo was a sambo world champion.

1989
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:31,750
What is his background?

1990
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:32,590
Combat Samba,

1991
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:33,850
which is a different style.

1992
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,380
Sambo.

1993
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:34,890
It's a,

1994
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:35,410
uh,

1995
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:36,910
a samba that also has,

1996
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,773
um,

1997
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,980
they have a lot of,

1998
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:39,790
uh,

1999
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,870
strikes in it and they were the
geek jacket and a head gear.

2000
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:44,471
And I,

2001
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:44,950
you know,

2002
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,770
I don't know how long they've
been competing like that,

2003
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,950
but it's essentially like
MMA and a lot of ways

2004
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:53,691
I think.

2005
00:55:53,691 --> 00:55:55,040
So he's a good fight.

2006
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:57,390
The great fight that he's
kept that have hands in a

2007
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,350
good position on the floor.

2008
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,220
Look how good he looks.

2009
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,830
Handsome bastard back then.

2010
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,260
I love that motherfucker know is my hero.

2011
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,550
This was 10 years ago.

2012
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:12,670
I think I got a little
bit more technically even
stayed my favorite Brazilian

2013
00:56:13,071 --> 00:56:16,760
fighter of all time by
far back in the day.

2014
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:18,350
He was a motherfucker.

2015
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:22,640
He was the first heavyweight that came
along and it showed like real legit

2016
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,513
Jujitsu.

2017
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,480
His back.

2018
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,940
Yeah.

2019
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,181
Okay.

2020
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,200
We can go through all this.

2021
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,700
That'll shut God fatal or
looks yelling to babyface.

2022
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,513
Huddle shy.

2023
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,053
Not

2024
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,920
Missing a lot of the uh,

2025
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,880
the big scars that he
developed later in his career.

2026
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,630
Yeah,

2027
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,201
really bad,

2028
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:44,500
right?

2029
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:44,891
Yeah.

2030
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:45,101
Yeah.

2031
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,810
He got Scott some scar tissue,

2032
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:48,430
Russian mafia eyes also.

2033
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:49,750
His body changed.

2034
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:49,991
Yeah.

2035
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,160
Look how calm he is.

2036
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,100
That was one of the weirdest things
about fate or when he would fight.

2037
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,270
That's like Carla Esparza.

2038
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,410
Did you see her when she
came out and fought Bros?

2039
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:59,303
Nama jewelry?

2040
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,880
Does she actually,

2041
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,300
it was,

2042
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,111
it was almost,

2043
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,160
she was so calm.

2044
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,250
If you didn't know that
was like her little thing,

2045
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,410
you would think she was petrified.

2046
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,333
She was just like the,

2047
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,643
yeah,

2048
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,250
and rose is all like just dancing
around and just shaking on her side.

2049
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,710
Carla's not even moving,

2050
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:18,850
not even an inch.

2051
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:19,571
Look at this shit.

2052
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,280
They have the national anthem back then.

2053
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,750
Did you remember that?

2054
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,950
I don't say that.

2055
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:25,610
That's a booster Martha,

2056
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:25,880
right?

2057
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,870
Amarillo Bustamonte Mario
Sperry with fucking black hair.

2058
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,680
Look at that.

2059
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,230
There's little cheerio.

2060
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,423
Cheerio man.

2061
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:34,863
Dude.

2062
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,140
Got a nose on

2063
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,720
trials off.

2064
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,620
It'd be trade shit.

2065
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:42,101
They'd be like,

2066
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:43,060
why did you lose weight?

2067
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:43,894
What happened?

2068
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,830
Did you just forget?

2069
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,600
I put the pressure on you,

2070
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,703
the hips,

2071
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:51,880
or you can get that crowd.

2072
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:53,050
Look how quiet the crowd is.

2073
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:56,530
This is the thing that was weird about
watching fights in Japan when we were

2074
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:57,520
there for the UFC.

2075
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,170
Everybody was told me it was like that.

2076
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:00,160
But when you see it live,

2077
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:00,971
and by the way,

2078
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:01,411
they would just,

2079
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:01,691
it,

2080
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:03,730
they've changed since the old days.

2081
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,050
The old days it was dead silent.

2082
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,910
Now they clap and cheer a little bit
because it's becoming a little bit more

2083
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,340
auditions and stuff.

2084
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:11,310
That's trendy thing now.

2085
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,633
Damn.

2086
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,541
Hold on.

2087
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:14,440
We gotta go to the beginning.

2088
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:14,901
I just want to see,

2089
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:17,260
to take how to fight or to kind of talk.

2090
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,570
He doesn't look out and look at it.

2091
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,270
He'll get it.

2092
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,230
He's tired or back then.

2093
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:22,631
Now.

2094
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:23,820
He never used to look.

2095
00:58:23,821 --> 00:58:24,730
He always looks down.

2096
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,450
He was thick back then.

2097
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:29,560
It was later in his career
fate or like slimmed out.

2098
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,210
He got a lot smaller,

2099
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,770
super thick back then.

2100
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,120
He sees a lot of kettle bells and
a lot of power lifting back then,

2101
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,300
but he decided somewhere along the
line that's skill training was more

2102
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:41,134
important,

2103
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,850
but I think that you need both,

2104
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:43,121
man.

2105
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:43,954
I really do.

2106
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:44,940
Oh,

2107
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,240
but I mean there's all so many variables
involved in old fader that made him a

2108
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:50,074
monster.

2109
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,200
Just a strength is only one of them.

2110
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,400
The other thing was just,

2111
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:59,401
he was just so fucking ferocious tiger
mom time and fast too for heavyweight

2112
00:58:59,621 --> 00:58:59,831
man,

2113
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:01,060
deceptively fast.

2114
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,590
Stand right there.

2115
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:03,424
Look at this.

2116
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:07,330
He also had a really good
technical approach to MMA man.

2117
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,660
He just would explode so fast,

2118
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,770
so fast,

2119
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:12,604
but he's fucking,

2120
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,020
and it's everything he
throws is like a Mac out.

2121
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:15,911
What's the latest?

2122
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:16,780
He's still retired.

2123
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:17,620
He doesn't want to come back.

2124
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,480
He's done man.

2125
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:20,081
He's smart.

2126
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:22,090
He knew that those last few fights,

2127
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,560
just not the same guys
we're looking at right here.

2128
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,390
We're looking at the
dude in his prime here.

2129
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,000
This is 2000 for 10 fucking years ago.

2130
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,060
Brain was pictures thing is the
2004 there was nobody like him.

2131
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,610
Nobody had come along before like him.

2132
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,450
Nobody,

2133
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,980
nobody could whip off arm bars off their
back the way he could and still throw

2134
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,440
fucking serious hands on their feet.

2135
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:46,274
The way he cooks.

2136
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,930
I don't think we've seen anyone like him.

2137
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:50,690
As far as the light changes and UFC fight,

2138
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:52,310
his face stays completely the same.

2139
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Well he always said that they'll like
showing emotion is showing weakness.

2140
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:56,150
Yeah.

2141
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,470
Nogueira with that fucking
wrist control setup,

2142
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:58,671
man,

2143
00:59:58,671 --> 00:59:59,490
that was his shit.

2144
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,860
He doesn't even look like you warmed up.

2145
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,281
Like he just,

2146
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,001
he looks cold,

2147
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:03,380
his body like he's just looks like,

2148
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,353
eh.

2149
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:05,661
Take my shower.

2150
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,190
I was playing cards about 10 minutes ago.

2151
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,440
I'm going to fight.

2152
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,530
I had to fight hard to see,

2153
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:09,840
you know.

2154
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,980
I mean if we remember his
brother and his gnarliest tat,

2155
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:17,240
I was like the grim reaper
holding a baby right now.

2156
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:19,580
He's in jail right now I think for rape.

2157
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:20,480
I don't know if he got out.

2158
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,610
His brother did a lot of crazy shit.

2159
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:24,770
There's some video of his
brother drunk off his ass.

2160
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:25,550
Magic.

2161
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:29,040
That guy being drunk and being
mad at you crust raping you

2162
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,550
or be mad at you and raping you.

2163
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,543
No thank you.

2164
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,230
And I mean you

2165
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,850
don't even meet a girl.

2166
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,850
I've been thinking about as me was framed.

2167
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,980
I believe he was framed by the Illuminati.

2168
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:44,600
I think he was going to drop the bomb.

2169
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:45,434
Is that right?

2170
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,060
You don't what?

2171
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,700
We're going to get some
girls you're fucked.

2172
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:50,540
That's what I,

2173
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,500
I don't think he did that.

2174
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:59,090
He was going to drop a bomb about
the CIA's involvement in Oh shit.

2175
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:00,410
Cause cause you want we're listen,

2176
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:05,540
listen failure with some fucking ferocious
ground and pound from inside the big

2177
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:08,670
Nog got those scars from being run over
by a truck I think as a kid was just the

2178
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:09,441
one on his back.

2179
01:01:09,441 --> 01:01:09,650
Yeah.

2180
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,590
Yeah it is back.

2181
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,080
He was in a coma for like a long time
or in the hospital I think for like a

2182
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:15,913
year.

2183
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,080
But they do feed him vitamins
and milk won't happen.

2184
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,930
Vitamins and milk,

2185
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,210
milk,

2186
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,043
milk,

2187
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:24,740
milk to a baby.

2188
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:25,683
It's bones.

2189
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,411
It's got to think about this.

2190
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:29,450
The last thing you want
to give was a baby's milk.

2191
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,040
Oh goodness.

2192
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,670
I mean it's just what
everybody gives babies.

2193
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,620
This is what gay guys love.

2194
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,133
This is it.

2195
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,470
That's not why they,

2196
01:01:37,471 --> 01:01:39,440
why they like him and maybe
cause they think of a fucking,

2197
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:41,480
these guys know that that's aggressive.

2198
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:42,860
Super aggressive.

2199
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,910
That's why gay guys like him.

2200
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:47,990
I mean I know a gay man who is a comic
who is very in love with a brand.

2201
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:50,990
And why isn't there Gage Jujitsu?

2202
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:52,341
I mean,

2203
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,290
wouldn't you would think
like he's always like,

2204
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,533
where's your dad too?

2205
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:56,230
Right?

2206
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:58,070
They probably not enough of them.

2207
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,113
Why isn't there more?

2208
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,340
Why isn't there a gay Jujitsu Academy?

2209
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:01,950
They're probably,

2210
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,140
they would love it.

2211
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,490
They would love it.

2212
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,360
Can you imagine?

2213
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,410
Put out an advertisement,

2214
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:12,010
but even even in the class even engage
you just so you don't think about the

2215
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:14,300
sexual aspect of the positions.

2216
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,240
Even engage,

2217
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,960
know you don't want
the guy to tap you out.

2218
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,370
So even if you are attracted to the guy,

2219
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,440
he was dudes beating you up.

2220
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,390
I Francis Bacon,

2221
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:24,880
the painter.

2222
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,590
I think she gets too important not
to get tapped out that no matter what

2223
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:29,460
position you're in,

2224
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,980
you're not picking about sex ever.

2225
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,260
You're thinking about
not getting tapped out.

2226
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,280
Even if you're gay,

2227
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:37,170
you're not thinking about sex in Jujitsu.

2228
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,153
That's what I believe

2229
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,840
the move them to some of the
[inaudible] podcast called.

2230
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:46,410
That's what I believe we're
thinking about fighting in the ring,

2231
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,710
that they kept moving people to
the center in the same position.

2232
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,530
There should.

2233
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:56,760
Good thing about the ring is
that it plays less of a factor,

2234
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:58,650
like as far as the environment.

2235
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,080
Then the cage does cause the cage.

2236
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,680
You didn't push a guy against it.

2237
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,930
It's the whole sport cage wrestling that
is so different than regular wrestling,

2238
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,580
wrestling off the cage and all the
possible positions against the cage.

2239
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:12,450
When you're wrestling,

2240
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,520
there's only so many positions
against the cage and Kenny Johnson,

2241
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:20,760
he's a wrestler who's
science septic about it.

2242
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,090
He trains Alan [inaudible] who's
one of my guys and they're,

2243
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,613
oh,

2244
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,410
here's a question I have.

2245
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,730
If they don't training and mostly
Sam and training in Russia.

2246
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:35,040
He doesn't have a lot of Jujitsu
guys to train with probably.

2247
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:35,550
Right.

2248
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:40,020
So how was he so good at defending against
all these trauma has submissions but

2249
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:43,430
it's not the most of the leg
locks and well their bars.

2250
01:03:43,431 --> 01:03:45,090
Farmers especially Camorra's.

2251
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:45,983
Yeah,

2252
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,190
which is what it was just going for.

2253
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:51,210
I mean Fado is one a lot of
fight by straight arm bar
and a lot of fights by our

2254
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,380
Kimora over doom.

2255
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:53,850
Used to be a cro cups,

2256
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,650
Jiu Jitsu instructor.

2257
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,230
She what?

2258
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,320
Croatia to help him with his defense.

2259
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,790
Well even though sambos like a Mo,

2260
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,620
it's mostly a leg lock system and catch
wrestling as like this kind of system

2261
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:11,454
without a guard.

2262
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,081
Since hoists,

2263
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:13,914
Gracie,

2264
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,730
all grappling styles have adopted or
filled the holes that were glaring since

2265
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:22,200
UFC one like oh shit,

2266
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:26,190
we actually do need a guard cause
catch wrestling didn't have a guard.

2267
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:26,521
Eddie,

2268
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:27,211
when you see this,

2269
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,980
what do you think here about his guard?

2270
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,971
I mean when you see this,

2271
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:33,900
I mean this is obviously 2004 but when
you know your guard and your style,

2272
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,380
you mean he must be seeing so
many goddamn openings in this.

2273
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,161
It just didn't.

2274
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:41,820
People weren't aware of back then as
far as like when he can control his

2275
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:42,420
posture.

2276
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:42,691
Well,

2277
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:47,691
Nogueira was the first guy to come along
since hoists Gracie to be known for his

2278
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:52,320
guard there we went and hoists Gracie
who tapped everyone out in the beginning

2279
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,560
and then people got hip to Jujitsu.

2280
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,410
Then they started training it.

2281
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:58,590
They learn the defense and then we had
a long period where like Mark Coleman

2282
01:04:58,591 --> 01:05:02,940
came in and the wrestler
started dominating and we
didn't have any Jujitsu guys

2283
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:07,890
in there that knew how to submit people
off their back when there was punches

2284
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:09,900
and elbows and there's no key,

2285
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:10,943
it was just,

2286
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,113
it was too much.

2287
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:15,900
It was like a riddle that needed to be
solved and then Nogueira comes along and

2288
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:16,231
boom,

2289
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,064
just like that.

2290
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,150
He was the only guy out there,

2291
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:22,930
especially especially for a heavyweight
to finish people off their back.

2292
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:24,790
He was known for his guard.

2293
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:25,624
When you talk,

2294
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,020
when you're talking about
a MMA guards back then,

2295
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:34,120
most of the time people said
Nogueira had the best guard in MMA.

2296
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:38,710
He was the only guy going after this and
a man fitters getting out of a lot of

2297
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:39,010
stuff.

2298
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,870
It's squishy and it's really,

2299
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:41,704
really greasy.

2300
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:44,950
It's greasy and he's strong
and he's also by the way,

2301
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,480
might've been oiled up.

2302
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:47,560
Yeah.

2303
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,310
How about that?

2304
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:50,340
Mark Coleman told me
that he was backstage.

2305
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,040
He saw Vandelay oiling up.

2306
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:53,790
Vandalism,

2307
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,623
a fight.

2308
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,043
Fair.

2309
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:57,190
Listen brother,

2310
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,530
this is bad.

2311
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:00,364
It's using.

2312
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,593
He was Alex.

2313
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:03,101
You can't do that.

2314
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:03,790
I'd be shocked.

2315
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,450
You'd be surprise.

2316
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,740
Oh,

2317
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:07,750
these fucking shots he hit no.

2318
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:09,070
Carol with this was,

2319
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:12,490
this is the roughest part of this fight
and Nogueira was another guy who was

2320
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:14,440
known for his chin based on these fights.

2321
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:17,630
He had the strongest Chin in MMA.

2322
01:06:17,631 --> 01:06:18,040
If you,

2323
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,900
if you talked about
the best guards in MMA.

2324
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,111
No.

2325
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:20,950
Garrett is going to be up there.

2326
01:06:20,951 --> 01:06:22,990
Back then you'd be talking
about the best chins and MMA.

2327
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:23,460
No,

2328
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,640
isn't going to be back there and I'm like,

2329
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,290
you're talking about the best chins now.

2330
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,190
No.

2331
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,090
Has been around,

2332
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:28,520
you know,

2333
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:33,520
th the sports so long that
his chin clearly isn't as
strong as it was back then

2334
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:34,743
to a war.

2335
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:38,780
I think he's going to do what
he's doing to watch for next guru.

2336
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:44,080
Next know who is going to make millions
is the guru who could turn you from,

2337
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:44,500
uh,

2338
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,970
turn your Chin around and strengthen
your Chin and make yourself and turn you

2339
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,804
into a guy.

2340
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,240
There's gotta be some kind of technique,

2341
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:52,980
not a group,

2342
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:53,261
bro.

2343
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:54,490
That's so fucking wizard.

2344
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,060
He's going to come in on the Dragon.

2345
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,380
Oh Man.

2346
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,640
What if that happens?

2347
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,990
What if there's something
that would have missed it?

2348
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:06,040
I can make your Dick bigger and you give
up on fighting because Dick is so big.

2349
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,590
You just check it out,

2350
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:08,011
man.

2351
01:07:08,011 --> 01:07:10,740
When your Chin by or breathe
underwater underwater,

2352
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:12,310
why would you fire taking these shots?

2353
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:14,980
I'm going to bring your Chin back and
I'm gonna make your Dick Three inches

2354
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:15,460
bigger.

2355
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,293
Trust me.

2356
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,193
Trust.

2357
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:19,191
Well,

2358
01:07:19,191 --> 01:07:21,830
you know what's going to be really
interesting when they do come up with

2359
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:25,880
genetically engineered human beings where
people have just unbelievably freakish

2360
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:26,780
athletic ability.

2361
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:31,130
You're not going to care as much about
like athletics and won't mean as much.

2362
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:31,941
Like right now,

2363
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:35,570
what it means is a representative
patient of your character,

2364
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:36,680
of your will,

2365
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,010
of your ability to do something
that most people won't do.

2366
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,280
When you see a guy who was built,

2367
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,540
you think two things.

2368
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,490
One is the old folk would steroids,

2369
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,050
but the other thing you think is like,

2370
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:45,231
wow,

2371
01:07:45,231 --> 01:07:47,010
that guy has put in some
fucking work like this.

2372
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,770
Even when a guy is on steroids,

2373
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:49,604
if a guy is big,

2374
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,660
the only way you get big is by putting
in the kind of work that most people are

2375
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:54,500
not willing to do.

2376
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,600
So when you see somebody,

2377
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,443
yeah,

2378
01:07:56,850 --> 01:08:00,340
look at this man that was at
a Brazilian Electric Char.

2379
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:00,761
Yeah,

2380
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:01,594
it was beautiful.

2381
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,000
So when you see someone
that they look at this,

2382
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:07,790
he's trying to pass instantly
trying to pass that era.

2383
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,150
That was a beautiful thing about Nogueira
his Jujitsu so smoothly that half a

2384
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,300
side control immediately.

2385
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:14,880
Look at this.

2386
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,231
Look at this.

2387
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,380
[inaudible]

2388
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:18,680
her man so strong,

2389
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,000
so strong.

2390
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,040
It's such a good grasp.

2391
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,920
Pausing Brian Jenny,

2392
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,093
first time.

2393
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,420
He's never satisfied.

2394
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:29,623
He's never seen it,

2395
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:36,230
but just the way he's been reacting.

2396
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:37,250
There's no way he's ever seen.

2397
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:38,510
He said MMA fan the way.

2398
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:43,280
I'm like a fan of politics
and every now and then,

2399
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,260
why'd you have to call me out?

2400
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:46,094
Cause you know I'm like,

2401
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:47,040
wow man.

2402
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:47,420
Yeah,

2403
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,140
any minute.

2404
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,220
Well there was this guy,

2405
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,250
Mark Fitch used to fight in the UFC.

2406
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:57,310
Now he fights for the Superbowl of
fighting and just got armbars fought this

2407
01:08:59,661 --> 01:08:59,991
guy.

2408
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:03,380
That guy's like a chimpanzee and arm bars.

2409
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:04,911
Dude,

2410
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:05,481
SPF.

2411
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:09,050
That should be what a CBS comes out with.

2412
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,063
Look at this.

2413
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,140
It looks like he just woke up.

2414
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:13,850
It doesn't have a scratch on his face.

2415
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,290
Even in between rounds.

2416
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:16,700
Calm as a cucumber.

2417
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,230
The thing about these fights,

2418
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:20,570
these pride fights in this widely known,

2419
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:20,991
I mean,

2420
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:21,231
you know,

2421
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:24,920
you talk to guys like I had an incident
anyway on the podcast and ends and told

2422
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:29,921
me like specifically said on his fucking
contract that they're not testing for

2423
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:31,700
steroids specific.

2424
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,160
Oh look at that bomb

2425
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,340
Jesus crew on that one.

2426
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:37,611
Right.

2427
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:38,780
I think it would have been over to,

2428
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:39,350
let's see,

2429
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,670
just just those shots.

2430
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:43,250
Don't you think as aggressive
as he was in his ground,

2431
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:43,611
a pounds.

2432
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:46,850
The same reason down the road when
he felt a guy like we're doomed.

2433
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,660
Submitted.

2434
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,300
Virgin was just way get caught.

2435
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,070
People get caught.

2436
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:51,340
Agree.

2437
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:51,770
Whom?

2438
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,660
Condom Verdugo tricked him.

2439
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,030
He made it seem like you
went down and got hurt.

2440
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,250
He pulled guard in a
different kind of way.

2441
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:58,670
It's like,

2442
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,370
oh,

2443
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,540
why should I take them to get on top?

2444
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,383
Boom.

2445
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:07,550
Boom.

2446
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,470
If that third right hand
would it got through,

2447
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,380
I think he would have been knocked.

2448
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:11,214
You're still hitting him.

2449
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,713
Boom,

2450
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:14,420
boom.

2451
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,440
Oh my God.

2452
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,410
Those who was our right left,

2453
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:19,100
right,

2454
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,430
left,

2455
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,881
right,

2456
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:20,301
left,

2457
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:21,470
right Jesus Christ.

2458
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:22,760
That should be a gift right there.

2459
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,151
That right.

2460
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:23,331
Left,

2461
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:23,950
right.

2462
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:24,790
Holy Shit.

2463
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:26,840
So Garrett could take it like nobody.

2464
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,260
I feel like pride was back when baseball
didn't test and guys were hitting like

2465
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:31,400
50 60 Homer's.

2466
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,361
These fights,

2467
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,580
they didn't test and he got shot last.

2468
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:35,570
Each other in the face.

2469
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,100
Exactly.

2470
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,450
Plus the last time I
watched baseball on eep.

2471
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,290
Oh,

2472
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:40,380
they're all on EPA.

2473
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:41,360
She crimes had his girl.

2474
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:42,194
She loves him.

2475
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:42,851
She loves him.

2476
01:10:42,851 --> 01:10:43,684
No good.

2477
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,600
I heard don't guera
lives like a rock star.

2478
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:50,030
That's what I heard you
made in Japan or Brazil.

2479
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:51,973
He's a rockstar.

2480
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:53,303
Yes.

2481
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,203
Shit.

2482
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,063
Good,

2483
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:56,480
good.

2484
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:56,940
I like it.

2485
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,830
Enjoys life.

2486
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:58,820
One other,

2487
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,653
right.

2488
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,693
He deserves that.

2489
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,170
Fuck.

2490
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,900
Anybody who's a warrior deserves that.

2491
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:03,231
Know us.

2492
01:11:03,231 --> 01:11:03,621
No other.

2493
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:04,400
Yeah,

2494
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,080
I hear that Putin really likes

2495
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,161
watching this,

2496
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:13,560
but so let's pay attention to fade wars
physique because it will show some later

2497
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,010
fade or

2498
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,580
fights.

2499
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,660
He's never been lean.

2500
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:16,501
Well No,

2501
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:16,681
no,

2502
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:16,831
no,

2503
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:17,371
never lean.

2504
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:19,560
But his bulk dropped substantially.

2505
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:20,520
His amount of mass,

2506
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:21,660
like his muscle power,

2507
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,200
it drops shredder.

2508
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,630
That would have been,

2509
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,480
we should have been to a five
to a five the whole time.

2510
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:27,871
Yeah.

2511
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:30,120
He was two 30 and at least
20 pounds overweight,

2512
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,710
like easily.

2513
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:33,380
Could have been to 10 lean,

2514
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:33,780
you know,

2515
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,141
if like,

2516
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:35,520
if Fado was like,

2517
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:36,541
you know,

2518
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,440
find a fighter,

2519
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,730
a Russian guy,

2520
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,460
like a poly bag routine off was shredded.

2521
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,060
It fade or like got down
to that lean body mass.

2522
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:45,930
He'd be two or three,

2523
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,340
like without even cutting weight.

2524
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,210
It's crazy,

2525
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,910
but it's gut guys got a
little bit of a bad ass.

2526
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:53,400
Was Carlson fucking Gracie man.

2527
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,313
Who's your grandma's grandma?

2528
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:58,830
When you look into the history
of what happened in Brazil,

2529
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:01,860
Carlson Gracie was the man,

2530
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,280
dude,

2531
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,120
that was the round.

2532
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,200
His whole pain.

2533
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,640
They wouldn't know [inaudible].

2534
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,230
They weren't on their boxing.

2535
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,840
Look at all their guys and their
boxing Merola booster month.

2536
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:11,490
They had some serious boxing,

2537
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,770
so did the Noguera's.

2538
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:15,630
I was like a throw down with their
feet and that was all Carlson Gracie.

2539
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,810
How about fucking veto bro?

2540
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:22,160
[inaudible] was the first guy to come
along see 12 the only Gracie's that had

2541
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:26,970
really real hands or Carlson
Gracie's got that clan,

2542
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,390
that Brazilian top team clan
that Carlson Gracie brought up.

2543
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,530
That guy was the man.

2544
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,350
That guy was the unsung
hero of the Gracies.

2545
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,380
I'm shocked at how much bigger fade or
is physically like his muscles and his

2546
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,020
old fights in awhile.

2547
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:41,850
Much bigger.

2548
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,430
Swole like 20 plus pounds of muscle.

2549
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:45,000
Bigger.

2550
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,440
Like if you look at him towards the end,

2551
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:47,970
like when he fought Dan Henderson,

2552
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,130
he's a shell of himself.

2553
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:53,130
It makes me wonder like how the states,

2554
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,510
that's true.

2555
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:59,010
When you're hoists Gracie saying stuff
like you don't need to a trained boxing

2556
01:12:59,011 --> 01:12:59,491
or wrestling,

2557
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:01,590
you just need you Jitsu like
all your needs is Jujitsu.

2558
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,600
When you hear who I say stuff like that,

2559
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:04,320
what do you think?

2560
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,900
I think it's crazy you're saying
that to the other Gracie's though,

2561
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:07,141
right?

2562
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:10,420
He's not saying that for everything I
can on Roger Gracie for working on is

2563
01:13:10,421 --> 01:13:11,550
restructuring box.

2564
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,560
Meanwhile Roger Crazy saying that now
as he's saying that slowly he's turning

2565
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,510
into a decent strikers fucked up,

2566
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:20,700
changed six screening dude,

2567
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
how'd you Gracie is is turning into
[inaudible] if he just fucking turns that

2568
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:29,670
striking training up the
coaches and he's got,

2569
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,110
he's got the jazz athletic.

2570
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:34,790
Is he saying he's saying that
now he's saying that today.

2571
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,790
It's hard to listen to hoist today because
it makes me sad because I think you

2572
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:39,840
know is just,

2573
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,520
I dunno what's going on with him,

2574
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:43,170
but all the shit that he said about you,

2575
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,820
I put hoists in a new category.

2576
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,241
Now I'm like,

2577
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:45,781
okay,

2578
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:46,614
he's that guy.

2579
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:47,041
You know,

2580
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,090
I don't know what's going on.

2581
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,850
I don't know if it's
emotions or if it's anger,

2582
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,150
but all the shit that he said about you
after you beat Heuler the second time.

2583
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,730
I know you didn't win a
decision cause it was a draw.

2584
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,930
You dominated him in that fight.

2585
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:00,870
Let's just say that you dominated him in
that match a hundred percent everybody

2586
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,750
knows it and you never said a bad thing
about the Gracies leading up to it.

2587
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:05,310
You guys were very
respectful to each other,

2588
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,110
you and heuler where before the match,

2589
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:07,921
even after the match,

2590
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:09,390
you gave it up to a boiler in the Gracies.

2591
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,201
You always did.

2592
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:10,711
You always have.

2593
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:12,010
You always really cognizant about

2594
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,101
it.

2595
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:14,080
So when he got super upset about that,

2596
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:14,320
I went,

2597
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:14,950
okay,

2598
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,570
this is like a non rational person.

2599
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,130
There's a person who's
not thinking straight.

2600
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,090
So when he starts talking about
like all you need is Jujitsu Mike.

2601
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:22,720
Yeah.

2602
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,530
Okay.

2603
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:26,560
Until you fight someone
like Anthony Rumble,

2604
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:27,520
fucking Johnson.

2605
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,930
Good luck with all that.

2606
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:30,520
Good luck when you Jujitsu,

2607
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:35,140
when you get knocked into the fucking
next dimension with every Jabie throws.

2608
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:35,770
Oh yeah,

2609
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:36,011
good.

2610
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:37,090
Try that out.

2611
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,110
The reality,

2612
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:43,140
the reality cold hard reality is
hoists Gracie in his prime UFC one.

2613
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,410
Okay,

2614
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,880
fights Anthony Rumble Johnson,

2615
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:48,400
he gets put to sleep in 20 seconds.

2616
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,060
That's a reality because
the game has changed.

2617
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:56,380
It is a fucking whole new world and
when you deal with a guy like rumble

2618
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:56,801
Johnson,

2619
01:14:56,801 --> 01:14:57,700
hate to keep bringing him up,

2620
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:01,690
but he's a perfect example of a
wrestler who's a strong wrestler,

2621
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,460
wicked takedown defense,

2622
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:08,550
strong as shit and has
that God given power.

2623
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:11,410
God Given Power with good coaching.

2624
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,670
He's got Henri Hooft,

2625
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:16,060
one of the best fucking
striking coaches in MMA period,

2626
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:20,610
a real Dutch kickboxing striking coach
and he's teaching those fucking guys had

2627
01:15:20,611 --> 01:15:23,140
a throw combinations that are technical,

2628
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,460
put strikes together,

2629
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:28,540
be in the right position to land bombs
and he's dealing with this like super

2630
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,890
athlete and Rumble Johnson.

2631
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:30,940
If voice had a fight,

2632
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:31,600
that guy,

2633
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,500
he would have a different,

2634
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:33,610
a difference of opinion.

2635
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,473
He would realize like,

2636
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:34,691
well,

2637
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:37,840
you're different when you're dealing
with a completely different species of

2638
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:38,321
human.

2639
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:40,420
These are these super athletes of today.

2640
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,350
They're just on a,

2641
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,520
what would he do against Jon Jones?

2642
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:43,750
Jujitsu's all your nude.

2643
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,141
Okay,

2644
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:45,040
good luck.

2645
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:48,520
Good luck using your
Jujitsu on John Jones.

2646
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,140
How do you explain that?

2647
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:50,800
Like you don't,

2648
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,010
you don't bother with someone says
the earth is 10,000 years old.

2649
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:54,580
You get it.

2650
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,120
Okay,

2651
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:55,690
I got to go.

2652
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:59,140
Here's the crazy thing is
not a fan on the planet.

2653
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,050
Agrees with them.

2654
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:01,620
Nobody agrees with them.

2655
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:02,454
That one.

2656
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:06,790
And he's the biggest
UFC legend of all time.

2657
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:09,120
What was his Jujitsu?

2658
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:10,680
What was the context of what I'm saying?

2659
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:16,390
He says that he saying that Roger Gracie
was spending too much time working on

2660
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:16,960
his striking.

2661
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,430
That's why he's not successful.

2662
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,481
He met him.

2663
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:21,280
King Mo is a perfect example.

2664
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:23,200
Why had to work on other shit?

2665
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:24,820
King Mo put him to sleep.

2666
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,570
You know why could really be King
Mo is a fucking elite wrestler.

2667
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,580
Good luck trying to take king mowed down
Gould that he's ever been taken down if

2668
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,680
he's cause he's Slippy.

2669
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:36,550
Yeah.

2670
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,570
King Moses

2671
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:41,350
and one of the best
coaches I've ever seen.

2672
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:41,830
There's,

2673
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,150
you can coat some wrestling,

2674
01:16:43,151 --> 01:16:44,140
very technical,

2675
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:44,411
you know,

2676
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:45,490
he's kind of how he guy.

2677
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,590
He's had a rough career man.

2678
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:51,700
You know he's had some real ups and real
downs but I always like King Mo and I

2679
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:52,390
always thought he's like,

2680
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,380
he's gotten massive,

2681
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:54,670
massive fucking potential.

2682
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:55,810
He hit that electric chair again.

2683
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,850
Eddie hit that electric chair again,

2684
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:00,070
but king mo also has,

2685
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,510
he has some serious knockout power man
and he knocked Haji route with him.

2686
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:08,230
Bomb of a right hand cause the common
quietly looking around see the problem

2687
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:09,830
with saying you only you Jitsu.

2688
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:10,040
Well

2689
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,150
what are you going to do with King Mo?

2690
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:13,310
You gotta Take Tango
Down Wet slippery body.

2691
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:18,340
Well it boys had this curriculum in this
system mastered of pulling guard and

2692
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:25,241
then another system master to finishing
people off his back in this MMA way.

2693
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,510
If he had those two
systems then I would say,

2694
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,561
I see what it Sam,

2695
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:32,060
because a guy like Paul Sas,

2696
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,140
only guy in UFC history
who had the strategy,

2697
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:38,570
every fight was the shoot,

2698
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,810
make you sprawl and then pull
guard and finish you off his back.

2699
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:44,900
He's the only fighter I
think and UFC history.

2700
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:45,710
I could be wrong.

2701
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:47,420
Dean Thomas was another guy like that.

2702
01:17:47,421 --> 01:17:47,531
He,

2703
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:50,090
he strategically went out to throw some,

2704
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,530
throw some strikes,

2705
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:52,131
shoot,

2706
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:52,821
make you sprawl,

2707
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:53,840
pull guard and then fuck,

2708
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:54,890
fuck you up off the back.

2709
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,120
In that case,

2710
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,890
if that's what voice is doing,

2711
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,230
then I understand where he's coming from,

2712
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:02,180
but I don't hear any of that from him.

2713
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,840
I don't ever hear them talking about
different strategies to pull guard and the

2714
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:07,190
best ways there should be.

2715
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:08,270
There's at least five,

2716
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:08,571
six,

2717
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:11,960
seven different ways to strategically
pull guard and I'm not hearing Hawaii.

2718
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,390
Think when it comes to hodge,

2719
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,880
he's saying Hodges never going
to fight for a belt or whatever.

2720
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,910
He has these crazy skills in Jujitsu.

2721
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,000
Quit wasting time on working
on your striking wrestling.

2722
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,440
Just win by Jitsu.

2723
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:25,303
That's retarded.

2724
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,210
You got to get your striking together.

2725
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:28,850
If you're going to be an MMA fighter,

2726
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:29,991
regardless,

2727
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:31,400
I think he's saying focus on,

2728
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:32,234
do you know well,

2729
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,230
well Haji Gracie has one of
the best motherfuckers ever,

2730
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:36,580
ever,

2731
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:36,960
ever.

2732
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,460
All right,

2733
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,370
so when Omar would tell you what I,

2734
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:40,820
what I would tell Joe Hodrick Gracie,

2735
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:44,210
based on my experience and watching
fighters coming in the UFC and kind of,

2736
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,223
I would say,

2737
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,880
don't get frustrated.

2738
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,460
The strikings going to take
about five or six years.

2739
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:50,960
Don't get frustrated.

2740
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,770
You got to get your fuck
and striking to get there.

2741
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:57,020
You got to keep pushing.

2742
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,660
You can't give up no
matter how many losses.

2743
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,260
There's no way you're going to get to
the top with suspect striking and you're

2744
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:04,490
on your feet and you're scared.

2745
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:07,400
There's no way you keep
working on your striking.

2746
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:09,110
You strive to be Jon Jones.

2747
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,640
You strive to be Anderson Silva,

2748
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,990
whether you reach them or not,

2749
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,501
whatever.

2750
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:13,340
At least you're trying.

2751
01:19:13,341 --> 01:19:17,950
You're trying to close the Tko James
McSweeney that he's turning into property.

2752
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,670
Superdome.

2753
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,730
Haji Gracie.

2754
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,710
I would say keep working that striking.

2755
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,870
Even if he loses his next two fights,

2756
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,560
striking,

2757
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,040
give them the right.

2758
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,180
What's the chief's going?

2759
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,800
Who Cares about your record?

2760
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:31,520
No one knows anybody's record and
it's not like box room boxing.

2761
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:32,420
It's all about the record.

2762
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,413
MMA,

2763
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,580
I'm a huge MMA fan.

2764
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:35,600
I don't know anybody's record.

2765
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:36,681
Emma is like,

2766
01:19:36,681 --> 01:19:39,890
how did you do your last couple of
fights and there's so much to learn.

2767
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,160
You got to understand that people are co,

2768
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:46,370
the fighters are constantly
in stages of development.

2769
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,910
You're not done it when you
think you're done in development,

2770
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,100
you are done in your career.

2771
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:53,780
You've got to remain a student.

2772
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:55,070
There's too much to learn.

2773
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,290
You can't think even even John Jones,

2774
01:19:57,291 --> 01:19:58,370
the baddest motherfucker out there,

2775
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:59,780
he's still got,

2776
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:01,280
there's still a lot did
you get to to learn.

2777
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,440
There's still what?

2778
01:20:02,441 --> 01:20:03,950
He's not Olympic caliber wrestling,

2779
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:04,850
so you strive,

2780
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:07,470
you keep learning new take downs off cage,

2781
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:08,304
new takedowns,

2782
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:12,240
different little takedowns off the cage
and and different setups off strikes.

2783
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,680
It's endless.

2784
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,790
You never stopped.

2785
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:15,653
I was impressive.

2786
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:19,160
Junior dos Santos is a clinch work
and he was much better than Steve Bay.

2787
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,690
The zoot cheese in your
mouth while you're talking.

2788
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:21,543
No,

2789
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,523
it's a cracker.

2790
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,590
It was more dramatic.

2791
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:25,731
Oh,

2792
01:20:25,731 --> 01:20:27,790
her brother's a junior Terramark mark.

2793
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,273
Listen,

2794
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,300
did you hear about it?

2795
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:34,100
How about Nate Diaz
versus a on Joe Sanchez?

2796
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,760
Dos Anjos.

2797
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:36,720
Holy Shit.

2798
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,790
I think we not talked about dose
Angeles and not so much amazing button.

2799
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:43,920
Then the other problem with that,

2800
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:44,150
uh,

2801
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,960
that he puts a lot of
weight on that front leg.

2802
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,870
He comes in strong with that
jab cause he's got good reach,

2803
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:50,580
but every time I've seen him I was like,

2804
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:51,001
my God,

2805
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:52,450
why isn't someone leg
kicking the shit out?

2806
01:20:52,451 --> 01:20:54,990
They're just not adapting to
the evolution of the game.

2807
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:55,171
Right.

2808
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:55,620
They're really not.

2809
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,870
We're kind of kicks wrestling.

2810
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,320
Exactly.

2811
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,480
Bostik's almost disdainfully
like he's joking around with you.

2812
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:01,820
Like he throws these like,

2813
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:02,940
like his brother does.

2814
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:04,290
They both do the same thing.

2815
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:07,410
They'll throw at kicks when you're
nowhere near him because I like,

2816
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:11,130
he'll like when you find across
and Nick Diaz kind kinda.

2817
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,590
He just threw like the sloppy round house.

2818
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,211
I tell you,

2819
01:21:14,211 --> 01:21:14,431
he goes,

2820
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:14,671
he goes,

2821
01:21:14,671 --> 01:21:14,791
oh,

2822
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:15,750
we're throwing spent shit.

2823
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:18,540
Now I tell all my fighters
coming through my gym.

2824
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,460
I tell him all whether they
want to hear it or not.

2825
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:22,500
I pull out my disclaimer.

2826
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:23,910
I'm not a strike route or no shit.

2827
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:24,990
This is just my opinion.

2828
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:30,030
But if you're not striving to be a
striker like Conor McGregor or like John

2829
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:30,270
Jones,

2830
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:30,850
damn,

2831
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:31,683
you're old school.

2832
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,290
You've got to strike everything
that they're throwing.

2833
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,431
Break it down.

2834
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:36,210
Technically.

2835
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:37,080
What is John Johnson?

2836
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,610
He's still spinning elbows.

2837
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:39,840
He's throwing sidekicks.

2838
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:44,100
Spinning kicks the leg
telling me we'll kicks.

2839
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:44,431
Don't work.

2840
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:45,810
And you're watching Edson Barboza.

2841
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,830
You're watching Vito Belfort who never
throw kicks before you saw him in his

2842
01:21:49,831 --> 01:21:50,370
career.

2843
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,860
Add a dangerous weapon
like a spinning heel.

2844
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:53,370
Crazy.

2845
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,203
Everybody.

2846
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,680
Alan Jobe on one of my fighters,

2847
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,910
he doesn't throw a spinning heel,

2848
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,840
heel kicks.

2849
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,550
He doesn't do,

2850
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,383
we'll kicks.

2851
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:00,510
I constantly tell him,

2852
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:01,200
dude,

2853
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,280
add that shit.

2854
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:03,600
You could do it.

2855
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,650
You're very athletic.

2856
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:05,910
It's going to take a little while,

2857
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:06,661
maybe six months,

2858
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:07,470
a year and a half,

2859
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:07,951
two years.

2860
01:22:07,951 --> 01:22:08,641
Time flies.

2861
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:09,540
We all know time flies.

2862
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,171
But man,

2863
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:11,004
before you know it,

2864
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,930
you got to fucking wheel kicked it.

2865
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,800
Your opponent has to train for and prepare
for and it throws them off balance.

2866
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:18,060
You got to turn in psychic.

2867
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:18,811
Look at that.

2868
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:22,410
Like I'm Dee Diego Brandao.

2869
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:23,160
What's his name?

2870
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:23,520
And he said,

2871
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:23,801
Brenda,

2872
01:22:23,801 --> 01:22:25,320
I was gather fought Conor McGregor.

2873
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:25,591
Yeah,

2874
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:26,820
those guys to steal everything.

2875
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,331
You never know.

2876
01:22:27,331 --> 01:22:28,200
They're just like right here.

2877
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,840
You don't know what the
fuck they're going to throw.

2878
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,170
Spinning back fist.

2879
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,010
We'll kick sidekick Conor McGregor
thrown couple of lyric kicks.

2880
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:36,450
In my opinion,

2881
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,000
that's the future right there.

2882
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,750
A guy that can throw any kick,

2883
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,890
any punch,

2884
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,960
any spinning elbow,

2885
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:43,980
all that shit.

2886
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,270
You've got to strive.

2887
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:49,710
Anybody listening out to strive for
that don't be one of those guys who just

2888
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:50,730
sticks with boxing.

2889
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:55,200
That's the other problem is guys get
into MMA and they get into MMA after a

2890
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:57,180
lifetime of one style.

2891
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:57,721
You know?

2892
01:22:57,721 --> 01:23:01,560
And sometimes it's very difficult for
them to incorporate other techniques.

2893
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:04,830
Like say if you spend a
lifetime of just wrestling,

2894
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,500
you know,

2895
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,240
and you've never thrown
a kick in your life.

2896
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,350
And then someone was saying,

2897
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:08,531
you know,

2898
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:09,490
you should throw head kicks.

2899
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:11,980
Like why the fuck I could barely
touch my toes as long time.

2900
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,150
That's a lot of these guys.

2901
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:17,080
It's like you're dealing with
an elite athlete in one area.

2902
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:19,750
But when it comes to like the
ability to learn how to kick,

2903
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:20,681
you know,

2904
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:23,170
I mean some work needs
to be done for sure.

2905
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:24,010
Do you stretch?

2906
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:24,850
Are you stretching now?

2907
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,490
Yeah man.

2908
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:26,323
He's stretching now.

2909
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:26,750
Promise.

2910
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:27,583
Promise.

2911
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:28,713
How much?

2912
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,673
How much does that change?

2913
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,230
Get obsessed with them up.

2914
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:32,650
So that's what,

2915
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:32,780
yeah,

2916
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:33,910
but he didn't use a stretch.

2917
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,013
A tall.

2918
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,700
Did you use a stretch at all?

2919
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:38,131
Crazy.

2920
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:43,131
With my system come through my
system and when I tell people,

2921
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,830
when people ask me,

2922
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,390
I want to learn the rubber guard,

2923
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:47,620
I wanted to do that flexible stuff.

2924
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:48,550
What do I have to do?

2925
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:49,811
All I tell him,

2926
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:50,644
I tell everyone,

2927
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,340
every guy,

2928
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,220
just all you gotta do is be
able to get into the Bolus.

2929
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:56,290
Basic Yoga positions of all time.

2930
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,790
It is in a rubber guard position.

2931
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,460
You're doing a lot of yoga.

2932
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:01,541
I don't do yoga.

2933
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:02,560
I do yoga stretches.

2934
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:02,830
Right?

2935
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,150
But what I'm saying is if you get,

2936
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:09,010
if you can get into the most basic yoga
position of all time load is full lotus,

2937
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:12,790
it's a position that you
have to learn in yoga.

2938
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:18,820
I'll do some yoga and nobody has done
yoga for 10 years and not been able to get

2939
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:19,570
into Lotus.

2940
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,610
Eventually you get into
whether it's four years,

2941
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,181
eight years,

2942
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:22,760
six years.

2943
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,040
It all depends on your work ethic.

2944
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:24,521
That's it.

2945
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:25,780
But what I tell people,

2946
01:24:25,781 --> 01:24:27,730
if you can get into that basic,

2947
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,970
the most basic like Buddhas in the Lotus,

2948
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,110
if you can get into that,

2949
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:35,680
you can play all positions in grappling,

2950
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:36,820
not just rubber guard,

2951
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:38,680
very pliable.

2952
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,770
And the real issue is there's a bunch
of studies that have been done on

2953
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:44,470
flexibility and there are a lot of them,

2954
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:45,221
I shouldn't say they're all,

2955
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:47,140
but a lot of them are very flawed.

2956
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,440
And I say this from a lifetime
of working out with people,

2957
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:51,970
teaching people,

2958
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,050
uh,

2959
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:53,651
techniques,

2960
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:55,180
especially kicking techniques,

2961
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,620
seeing guys become more flexible and
knowing my own flexibility limits that I

2962
01:24:59,621 --> 01:25:04,030
became very flexible and I became
very flexible by going through pain.

2963
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:06,850
So when they say like
someone is only able to,

2964
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:07,151
you know,

2965
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:08,500
get a certain amount of flexibility,

2966
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:08,950
I say,

2967
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:09,783
how do you know?

2968
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:10,271
Did you,

2969
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,010
do you know how much
effort they put into it?

2970
01:25:12,011 --> 01:25:14,770
How much time are they putting
in there to tell you what I did?

2971
01:25:14,771 --> 01:25:18,970
I put a fucking shit load of effort into
the reason why I could do a full splits

2972
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,000
like this way and this way and
this way is because I didn't,

2973
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,860
I couldn't do it when I first
started doing taekwondo.

2974
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,090
So Bro,

2975
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:25,923
black forced it.

2976
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,553
He's got better.

2977
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:32,140
We were at a meeting one
time and TV meeting and he
and we were just like these,

2978
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,010
you know,

2979
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:36,160
some people did a lot of TV and
he just grabbed both his ankles.

2980
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:36,993
I'm like hey,

2981
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,890
and put him straight up
and everybody's like,

2982
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:39,724
well I didn't like,

2983
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,200
but I don't remember why I did it.

2984
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:42,700
I said,

2985
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,180
yeah you got,

2986
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,410
I had been doing martial
arts for a long time.

2987
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:45,071
I'm really flexible.

2988
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:45,830
Check this out.

2989
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:46,450
Cause they were like,

2990
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:46,631
Joe,

2991
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:47,381
you do a lot of martial arts.

2992
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:47,551
He goes,

2993
01:25:47,551 --> 01:25:48,020
yeah I do.

2994
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:48,370
He goes,

2995
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:48,881
what are you doing?

2996
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:49,421
Cause I don't know.

2997
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:50,254
I just do it all.

2998
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,090
And they asked me to show them something.

2999
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:52,943
Right?

3000
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,040
We want to see some crazy,

3001
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:54,560
watch this.

3002
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,700
I grabbed both my ankles and
I pulled them apart like this.

3003
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:59,550
I can grab my ankles and I
think you want to grow in this.

3004
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:02,280
And now that picture
is used for gate gifts.

3005
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,020
And so that's a,

3006
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,850
that's from a men's fitness.

3007
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,301
But I mean,

3008
01:26:05,301 --> 01:26:05,481
you know,

3009
01:26:05,481 --> 01:26:06,710
when I did it was just for,

3010
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:09,220
well congratulations out
of the way you've got that.

3011
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,063
You've held onto it.

3012
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,420
We'll still do that.

3013
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:12,323
Yeah,

3014
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,381
that was a war.

3015
01:26:15,381 --> 01:26:15,991
How long has that been?

3016
01:26:15,991 --> 01:26:17,610
You know,

3017
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,180
you can kick like a mule.

3018
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:20,421
You know,

3019
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:21,200
I've seen he kicked,

3020
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,460
I've never seen you do the legs.

3021
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:25,610
Like you can't kick like
that unless you're flexible.

3022
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:27,283
You don't have that.

3023
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:30,020
This is like a witness
and a fluidity is part.

3024
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,960
It's like when you see a guy
who really knows how to punch,

3025
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,620
one of the things you realize is
they're not tense the whole way.

3026
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,900
It's not like it's like there's a,

3027
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:46,370
at the end of it there's like boom and
that's the same with kicking at the end

3028
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:46,790
of it.

3029
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:47,510
There's like a,

3030
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:50,150
there's a witness and a crack.

3031
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:52,550
It comes over and the the the,

3032
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:52,941
the,

3033
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:57,941
the amount of fluidity that you get and
you're kicking is directly proportionate

3034
01:26:58,341 --> 01:27:01,130
to the amount of effort you
put into your body type.

3035
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,050
The bone structure is a lot of variables,

3036
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:05,060
but a big one is flexibility.

3037
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:05,990
That's a big one.

3038
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,910
The more flexible you are,

3039
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,990
the more you can fucking crack.

3040
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:14,030
It's going to sound as good
a sound gay as fuck Brandon,

3041
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:14,900
but man,

3042
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:19,901
to have your good friend Joe Rogan
impresses world class fighters like GSP on

3043
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,110
striking with power

3044
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,830
that your friend,

3045
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,140
if you this guy,

3046
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:33,320
anybody he works with anybody
that holds pads with them.

3047
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:34,790
They always trip

3048
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:40,610
where everybody trips the fuck out,

3049
01:27:40,611 --> 01:27:41,000
right?

3050
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,180
Every for years this has
been going on for 15 years.

3051
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:44,571
Brendan,

3052
01:27:44,571 --> 01:27:45,620
this is nothing new to me.

3053
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,310
We've,

3054
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:47,510
this is going on forever.

3055
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:48,500
This guy,

3056
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:51,590
when you listen to
fucking powerful striking,

3057
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,300
it's the fear factor guy.

3058
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:54,620
How insane is that?

3059
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:56,780
That is the craziest thing ever.

3060
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,820
Nobody believes that shit.

3061
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,223
How was it possible?

3062
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:01,580
People warned me.

3063
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,220
Dwayne told me to kick
guy before that thought.

3064
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:03,610
Brian,

3065
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,030
everyone told me what a Dwayne say.

3066
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:06,970
Dwayne said this motherfucking kid,

3067
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,500
regardless for Fido test,

3068
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,020
whether it's a jab or the hook,

3069
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:13,460
everything he throws,

3070
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:13,770
it's,

3071
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:14,630
it's all from the hip.

3072
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,950
That's where all the power comes from.

3073
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:16,873
That's what they say.

3074
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:18,230
Common 30 he's got,

3075
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,790
he's got talents with his hips.

3076
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,310
I can only imagine how
you fucking laid pipe.

3077
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:28,070
Just be like blah,

3078
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:28,411
blah,

3079
01:28:28,411 --> 01:28:28,881
blah,

3080
01:28:28,881 --> 01:28:29,330
blah.

3081
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:32,140
Pictures are just
fucking basic in the day.

3082
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:33,520
Years ago,

3083
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,520
[inaudible] Coleman fate or we're
watching Coleman fee might be the hardest

3084
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:41,480
fucker ever.

3085
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:43,520
Logan's been with this girl forever,

3086
01:28:43,521 --> 01:28:44,390
so it's been a long time,

3087
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:47,960
but about 20 years ago for
sure will tell the story.

3088
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:49,370
It's like sure it none of these stories.

3089
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:49,911
Listen,

3090
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:50,240
look,

3091
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,930
look at Mark Coleman got fade
or down almost immediately.

3092
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,471
Look at this.

3093
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:55,460
Look at the difference here.

3094
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:56,511
Look at the difference now.

3095
01:28:56,511 --> 01:29:01,511
Magic Coleman had monster Jujitsu
cause look at this fade or down.

3096
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:02,983
Just beat up.

3097
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,530
Show it.

3098
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,970
Let's show it like right off the bat,

3099
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:06,151
like,

3100
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:06,690
look at this.

3101
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:07,560
This is the beginning of the

3102
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:10,140
elite.

3103
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,970
He 39 39 years old,

3104
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:12,930
39 he looks toward,

3105
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:14,230
by the way,

3106
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:15,180
these are all natural,

3107
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:16,090
not natural,

3108
01:29:16,091 --> 01:29:16,924
a little natural.

3109
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,910
None of them is not 100% natural.

3110
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,570
No tanning beds.

3111
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:22,590
No tanning beds at all.

3112
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,150
I think this is Coleman.

3113
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:26,240
Before he won the PR or did it,

3114
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,230
was it after he won the
heavyweight Grand Prix?

3115
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,270
I remember he won the
heavyweight grampy BlueCat.

3116
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:30,600
Wow.

3117
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,433
He takes him down.

3118
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,520
That's a mother fucker.

3119
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:33,840
That's strong as shit,

3120
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:34,741
dude.

3121
01:29:34,741 --> 01:29:35,590
Mark Mad.

3122
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,500
Everybody lifting weights.

3123
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,640
Mark Coleman is the reason house.

3124
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,051
Look at that.

3125
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:40,231
Look.

3126
01:29:40,231 --> 01:29:41,090
Fade or tried to get up.

3127
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,690
He's like negative.

3128
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:43,913
Not Happening.

3129
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:46,380
Do they do wizards in Russia?

3130
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:48,480
Wizards in Siberia,

3131
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:49,314
son,

3132
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,940
but he's got us back here.

3133
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:54,220
Joe Come on match and he's
got wrestling shoes on.

3134
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,600
He's got his full back man.

3135
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:02,310
Could you imagine if Mark Coleman had
a monster fucking guard and a monster

3136
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:03,400
fucking remake control.

3137
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:03,991
Yeah.

3138
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:04,740
Look at this.

3139
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,750
He's such an overlap or dude,

3140
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,183
relax.

3141
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:12,660
Look at just chuck the
and Mark Coleman's corner.

3142
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:17,070
Look at this chocolate out
with no sleeves on his robe.

3143
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:18,330
He never sleep.

3144
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,170
Chuck Liddell deal in Japan that year.

3145
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,100
Oh my God.

3146
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:28,290
Look Randleman isn't that 10 or under
10 Kevin Randleman who's a WHO's a who

3147
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,280
looks like a,

3148
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,360
like if,

3149
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,890
if Mike Tyson was in drag,

3150
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:33,300
oops.

3151
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,021
Oh look at this.

3152
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:34,740
Boom,

3153
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:35,573
boom.

3154
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:38,520
Look at this.

3155
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,353
Look at fader.

3156
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,430
Don't kick yourself.

3157
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:42,363
Have this drop.

3158
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:42,721
Drop,

3159
01:30:42,721 --> 01:30:42,991
drop,

3160
01:30:42,991 --> 01:30:43,290
drop.

3161
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:45,930
Well by this time Coleman was probably
already starting to get tired.

3162
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,441
Why?

3163
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,920
I don't understand metro one 17 no,

3164
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:50,754
he was,

3165
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:51,960
damn,

3166
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,990
that's a serious guilty.

3167
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,201
This is,

3168
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:56,360
this is where it becomes a problem.

3169
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:57,570
I forgot about this fight.

3170
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:58,530
I don't know how it ends.

3171
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,350
Don't tell apps a lot.

3172
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:02,880
I don't know how damn feet or
used to grab the ropes a lot.

3173
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,110
You ever see his fight with weapons?

3174
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:07,920
Take tests to easy takedowns
his fight with who?

3175
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:08,411
Matt Lynn.

3176
01:31:08,411 --> 01:31:08,681
Lynn,

3177
01:31:08,681 --> 01:31:10,770
Lynn Lynn and grabbing of the ropes,

3178
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,780
he reversed the position
because he grabbed the ropes.

3179
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:14,130
Lindland got a body lock on him,

3180
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:15,060
was about to take them down.

3181
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,950
Fade or fucking rope.

3182
01:31:16,951 --> 01:31:17,580
Grabbed,

3183
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,910
flipped the switch and got on top of
him and then went up arm barring them.

3184
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:23,850
Lucas Coleman just controlling
them on the ground.

3185
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:24,873
Yeah.

3186
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,870
Ah,

3187
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:27,640
Shit.

3188
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,473
Was He Tammy?

3189
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:31,140
Look how fast that shit was.

3190
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,710
You could do that.

3191
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,543
Wow.

3192
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,480
Easy.

3193
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,313
Watch this again.

3194
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:35,710
Keep wow.

3195
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:36,431
Fucking close.

3196
01:31:36,431 --> 01:31:39,780
Look and look how relaxed
he is until he locks it up.

3197
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:40,111
He's like,

3198
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:43,220
is he really going to leave his Ah,

3199
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,173
oh

3200
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:45,980
God.

3201
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,960
It's so beautiful that a thousand times.

3202
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:48,601
That's all there.

3203
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:51,510
The second time they
fought was in Las Vegas.

3204
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,430
What pipe came here?

3205
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,340
I was there.

3206
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,290
I was there and he brought his kids.

3207
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:56,663
Tries brother.

3208
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,613
Ooh,

3209
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:58,763
look at this shit.

3210
01:31:59,500 --> 01:31:59,751
Okay.

3211
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:00,460
How glorious

3212
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,293
that is.

3213
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,060
Oh,

3214
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,310

3215
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:03,641
man.

3216
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:04,474
He was so good.

3217
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,580
He's so good at that shit.

3218
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,080
He hid that shit on everybody.

3219
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:09,730
Didn't he hit that shit on semi shelter?

3220
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:10,961
He hit it on.

3221
01:32:10,961 --> 01:32:14,720
She'll every PSAP yet and
then now he never fought sal.

3222
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:16,030
He avoided Sab.

3223
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:16,451
That's right.

3224
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:16,871
He was like,

3225
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:17,970
no thank you.

3226
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:20,550
That was three 75 we're missing.

3227
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,280
Girl was like,

3228
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,113
fuck that.

3229
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,231
No gear for them.

3230
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:24,670
Then they wanted to fight him and again,

3231
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:24,881
he's like,

3232
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:25,714
Nah man,

3233
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:28,810
I had an hour conversation
with Bob sat one time about,

3234
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:29,260
yeah,

3235
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,520
hip hypnotism.

3236
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,620
Like he was really into it.

3237
01:32:31,621 --> 01:32:34,120
He's really smart guy.

3238
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:35,740
He is that dude his face.

3239
01:32:35,741 --> 01:32:36,580
I kept looking at his face.

3240
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:39,070
It was so wide and so big.

3241
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:39,461
He's just a,

3242
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:41,560
he's just a different kind of smart guy.

3243
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:42,970
Smart Guy.

3244
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:46,320
I'm a nice guy and was really into it.

3245
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:50,170
Really into I hypnotized like hypnotism
and just mind control and stuff were it,

3246
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:51,310

these books to read.

3247
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:52,090
Um,

3248
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:55,800
I want to watch the Fujita fight
cause I was a crazy cro cop.

3249
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,643
One's good too.

3250
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,670
Yes.

3251
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:59,020
Trying to find food.

3252
01:32:59,021 --> 01:32:59,520
Geeta.

3253
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,970

3254
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:01,804

3255
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,020
Gary Goodridge.

3256
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:04,240
I forgot about that one.

3257
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,420
You know the,

3258
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:08,500
the other thing is when you look at
these guys' careers and he see how many

3259
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:10,780
fighters that you forget how
many fights you forgot about.

3260
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:10,991
Oh,

3261
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:11,730
I know.

3262
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:12,760
Yeah.

Oh yeah,

3267
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:17,990
I remember that around him.

3268
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:21,070
He beat him dumb on his fucking head.

3269
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:23,830
Wow.

3270
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:24,670
Moments later.

3271
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,740
He did the same thing to him.

3272
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,520
Come Maura Cyborg versus,

3273

01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,523
Gina Corolla.

3278
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:37,090
Do you wonder if that's
[inaudible] concert?

3279
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:39,640
It sounds like a fucking Beatles.

3280
01:33:39,641 --> 01:33:40,750
Kind of like to see my crowd.

3281
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:43,030
It's a bunch of chicks
screaming in the audience.

3282
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,890
Gina Carano Cyborg.

3283
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:48,280
That's one of the craziest
lights of all cheering for Gina.

3284
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:50,970
Gina said I was doing movies.

3285
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,813
Fucking,

3286
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,890
it was like a Brittany Spears concert.

3287
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:54,973
Hmm.

3288
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:57,180
There's never been a
fight like that before.

3289
01:33:57,181 --> 01:33:58,300
Where did just chicks.

3290
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:58,421
Oh,

3291
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:00,290
this is pride bad to the bone,

3292
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,163
handsome.

3293
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,670
All Morocco was fighting
somebody else back then.

3294
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:04,010
Boy,

3295
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:05,560
he looked fucking different.

3296
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:08,740
He looked like street fighter Bolus.

3297
01:34:08,741 --> 01:34:09,574
We're done.

3298
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,150
It's really a shame that bus
route and never fought in pride.

3299
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,910
It would have been really interesting
to see him fight in pride.

3300
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,940
Boss was a fucking murderer.

3301
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:18,783
Do like,

3302
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,713
whew.

3303
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:20,330
I mean,

3304
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:25,330
was watching her real athlete first
real striker in MMA when he fought in,

3305
01:34:25,771 --> 01:34:26,270
um,

3306
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:26,861
pancreas.

3307
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:27,520
He got seat,

3308
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,990
he threw kicks the guys like,

3309
01:34:28,991 --> 01:34:30,690
what the fuck is this?

3310
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:33,730
I watched him hit a bad
kick a bag with his shin.

3311
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,080
It was the craziest
thing I've ever started.

3312
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,940
It sounded like a gun was going off.

3313
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,770
You Never Seen Pedro his,

3314
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:38,871
oh,

3315
01:34:38,871 --> 01:34:39,460
kick her back.

3316
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,090
No.

3317
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:43,120
Pedro his own throw some life
changing kicks on the bag.

3318
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:43,990
His coach said he won't,

3319
01:34:43,991 --> 01:34:45,050
he won't hold myths warm.

3320
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:46,643
What

3321
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:50,440
he said he did it once with
the hips are about this wide.

3322
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:50,771
They're there.

3323
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:52,540
They're literally about a quarter mile.

3324
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,670
He's got God damn tree
trunks for legs too.

3325
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:55,870
But the thing about Pedro,

3326
01:34:55,871 --> 01:34:56,110
his,

3327
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:56,943
oh his man,

3328
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,460
he would like,

3329
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:01,940
he had really good technique to
Real Holland style kickboxing,

3330
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:06,020
but he would hit guys with one leg kick
and you would see them go like what?

3331
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,153
Really?

3332
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:10,280
Because guys were used to eating
a certain amount of leg kicks.

3333
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:11,161
You know,

3334
01:35:11,161 --> 01:35:15,560
like guys were hit anybody kicked legs
the way Ernesto hoost does though I was

3335
01:35:15,561 --> 01:35:16,394
really good.

3336
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:18,650
Nesto was a technician,

3337
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,250
but Ernesto hoost didn't have the
kind of power that his overhead,

3338
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,520
his jab,

3339
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:25,970
right kick to the body and
freakish power when his,

3340
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:26,091
oh,

3341
01:35:26,091 --> 01:35:28,190
fought Rico Rodriguez in um,

3342
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:29,443
in the UFC,

3343
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,220
he hit Rico with one leg
kick like early in the fight.

3344
01:35:32,221 --> 01:35:33,054
Just,

3345
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,740
and you could see the look on
Rico's facing like fuck all this.

3346
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,070
And Rico just completely
adjusted and decided to survive.

3347
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:40,540
Oh,

3348
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:44,930
I key literally decided to survive from
like the opening moments of that fight

3349
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:45,600
he got.

3350
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,180
It'll change your career
so ruined your whole,

3351
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:47,510
it'll,

3352
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:48,320
they'll just change everything.

3353
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:48,471
Well,

3354
01:35:48,471 --> 01:35:49,131
he fucked up.

3355
01:35:49,131 --> 01:35:50,090
Randleman so bad.

3356
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:50,391
Random.

3357
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:52,580
His legs are still damaged to this day.

3358
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,690
He's go,

3359
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:54,200
yeah,

3360
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,080
he's got crazy all over his leg.

3361
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,070
He's got,

3362
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:59,060
who'd you say fade or?

3363
01:35:59,690 --> 01:35:59,931
No,

3364
01:35:59,931 --> 01:36:00,640
Randy couture.

3365
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,720
Oh yeah.

3366
01:36:01,721 --> 01:36:02,554
Yeah.

3367
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:06,180
Crazy dense Aly and I'm weird vein.

3368
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:06,800
God,

3369
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,350
he broke their veins open.

3370
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:09,830
The veins recuperate,

3371
01:36:09,831 --> 01:36:10,151
but they,

3372
01:36:10,151 --> 01:36:11,450
they form new channels.

3373
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:12,470
So like all over,

3374
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:12,981
you're like,

3375
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:13,171
he has,

3376
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:18,171
he's gnarly bubbling veins all over
his leg where his oak kicked him.

3377
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:20,930
Fuck that all over his leg.

3378
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:21,681
I'm sick in the car.

3379
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:22,580
I was going to get an MMA.

3380
01:36:22,581 --> 01:36:23,450
I'm gonna stick to comedy.

3381
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,600
I think maybe he honest with me,

3382
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,470
don't play with me.

3383
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:29,030
See this is fade or versus fruit.

3384
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:29,361
Geeta.

3385
01:36:29,361 --> 01:36:31,610
And this is like a fight
where he got in the worst,

3386
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:33,160
the worst fatal.

3387
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:36,350
It looks at these before
and after in a body contest.

3388
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:37,730
This looks like it before.

3389
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:38,360
Yes,

3390
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:38,810
he's got,

3391
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:40,370
he's got a bad stomach,

3392
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,293
but look at this.

3393
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,433
Watch this.

3394
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,880
He knows how to throw those hammers.

3395
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:44,540
Oh Dude.

3396
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,430
He also knows how to surprise you.

3397
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:47,151
I mean metal,

3398
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:48,330
that soccer ticklish,

3399
01:36:48,331 --> 01:36:50,790
big soccer kicks for big and properly,

3400
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,260
right?

3401
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,400
Totally different experience,

3402
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:52,950
man.

3403
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:53,783
Yeah,

3404
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,673
not a good thing.

3405
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,560
And you could need of the head right
when something's on the hasp knees.

3406
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:58,430
That's,

3407
01:36:58,430 --> 01:36:59,270
that's devastating.

3408
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:00,230
I'm surprised they don't have that.

3409
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,500
And you have to say that
that changed with cages.

3410
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:04,161
It's different.

3411
01:37:04,161 --> 01:37:05,150
Why is that the cage?

3412
01:37:05,151 --> 01:37:06,120
Because you could trap a guy up,

3413
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,840
stomp them soccer,

3414
01:37:08,841 --> 01:37:09,290
kick him.

3415
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:09,440
Right.

3416
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,530
The thing about the ropes as you can slide
around underneath it and avoid stuff,

3417
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:12,890
right.

3418
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:14,300
It's good in that respect.

3419
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,010
There's probably a better solution.

3420
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,290
Someone hasn't figured out yet.

3421
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,153
I don't know what it is,

3422
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:20,211
but here's a,

3423
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:25,010
here's where it gets rocked like fate or
comes in on Fujita and Fujita throws a

3424
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:27,920
fucking hammer his way and Fujita
look at the sides of his head.

3425
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,660
He was a big dude.

3426
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:31,070
He's all fucked up too.

3427
01:37:31,071 --> 01:37:31,620
Now man.

3428
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:33,140
Alistair Overeem changed his life.

3429
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:33,671
Oh,

3430
01:37:33,671 --> 01:37:37,790
that knee Fujita looks like he's
moving like an old man right there,

3431
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:38,121
I think.

3432
01:37:38,121 --> 01:37:39,560
I mean he's just stiff legged.

3433
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:42,440
Put a black suit on him
and he's the odd job.

3434
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:44,180
He's a bad guy from James Bond.

3435
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,130
The hit blesses.

3436
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:50,060
Oh snap dude.

3437
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:51,350
Rubber legs.

3438
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:52,430
He's all over the place.

3439
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,410
That mother fucker knows
how to survive though.

3440
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,470
Yes.

3441
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,690
It's an amazing that he
couldn't for Cheetah,

3442
01:37:57,691 --> 01:37:58,950
couldn't get them off him with grief.

3443
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,000
Believable,

3444
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,080
greasy arms is over.

3445
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:02,100
Hook was so strong.

3446
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,150
Then when he got hit,

3447
01:38:03,151 --> 01:38:03,630
he just took off.

3448
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,650
He was able to hold on.

3449
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:05,940
There's the ref cam right there.

3450
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:06,750
Wow.

3451
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,660
He just took a bad,

3452
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:11,430
the ref cam is pretty bad ass Christ and
if they had a ref cam today it would be

3453
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:12,031
high def.

3454
01:38:12,031 --> 01:38:13,410
So it'd be even more bad ass.

3455
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:14,360
That'd be sweet.

3456
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:14,940
Yeah.

3457
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:15,661
They probably should have.

3458
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:18,060
When I see that it's so rough.

3459
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:20,400
Could say I didn't see the IPOS pitch.

3460
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,120
How can we can see the eye poked
through the fucking roof cam you lazy.

3461
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:24,990
Fuck yes,

3462
01:38:24,991 --> 01:38:26,160
my head was looking that way.

3463
01:38:26,161 --> 01:38:27,650
But my eyes were looking that way.

3464
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,503
Your honor.

3465
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:33,750
One of them ring car
girls done distracted me.

3466
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:34,321
Yeah,

3467
01:38:34,321 --> 01:38:34,981
you could bring that.

3468
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:37,920
It's just they got a new
Brazilian ring card girl.

3469
01:38:37,921 --> 01:38:40,910
The judge like you got to
understand because the pictures,

3470
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:42,483
what's going on.

3471
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:45,450
A fitter is going to be a
little still a bunched up here.

3472
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,051
Yeah,

3473
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:49,050
he's back up to his feet while
he's probably slowly recovering.

3474
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,980
Cheetah almost throws him man.

3475
01:38:51,981 --> 01:38:53,250
He posted on his arm.

3476
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:56,190
That's fucking dangerous shit here.

3477
01:38:56,191 --> 01:38:57,024
This shit right here.

3478
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:57,571
Blip,

3479
01:38:57,571 --> 01:38:57,751
blip,

3480
01:38:57,751 --> 01:38:57,991
blip,

3481
01:38:57,991 --> 01:38:59,430
blip and it turns it around.

3482
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,090
Yeah.

3483
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,150
Well striking those.

3484
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,120
Boom,

3485
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:03,390
boom,

3486
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:03,651
boom,

3487
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:03,900
boom.

3488
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,501
Standing.

3489
01:39:04,501 --> 01:39:05,310
Standing right there.

3490
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:05,850
Right there.

3491
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:06,870
Kick to the body.

3492
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:07,960
Fucking well.

3493
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:10,400
I think he knows cause she
does a lot slower than he is.

3494
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,083
He doesn't know that

3495
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,040
both you guys quiet down for a second.

3496
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:17,723
Jab Hook.

3497
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,100
It's fake blood too.

3498
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,433
Huh?

3499
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:22,350
Thank you.

3500
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:23,350
Zoomed in all too big.

3501
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:24,910
Look at this kick.

3502
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:25,770
Boom.

3503
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:31,830
Oh fucking him up with strikes and then
closes out with a rear naked choke.

3504
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:33,324
Look at that shit.

3505
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:34,320
It's choking the shit.

3506
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:35,880
That's how you fight man.

3507
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:39,750
Having the ability to do
everything is so important.

3508
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:42,060
Having the ability to do everything,

3509
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:42,850
get them to,

3510
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:44,490
he got rocked in that fight.

3511
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,001
Fuck yeah,

3512
01:39:45,001 --> 01:39:45,270
you did.

3513
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,671
And look at him.

3514
01:39:45,671 --> 01:39:46,800
Walk around like nothing happened.

3515
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,473
Nothing happened.

3516
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:54,740
A bunch of homos naked men hitting
his back or branches tough.

3517
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:56,330
Oh No.

3518
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,470
He just got choked on.

3519
01:39:58,230 --> 01:39:58,830
Well that's,

3520
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:02,010
that's the least of is if
you watch his Overeem fight.

3521
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:02,970
Where did he fight over him?

3522
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:04,110
His dream was a dream.

3523
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:04,950
It was dreamy.

3524
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:05,520
Eats a need.

3525
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,440
It like concaves is fricking,

3526
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:10,620
he was out for half an hour.

3527
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,011
No,

3528
01:40:11,011 --> 01:40:11,550
stop it.

3529
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,270
It's tough to watch,

3530
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:12,580
man.

3531
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:12,900
Yeah.

3532
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,350
They said it was one of the
worst knock outs ever for a half.

3533
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,440
It sounded like a shotgun.

3534
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,730
Oh yeah.

3535
01:40:18,731 --> 01:40:19,564
That's horrible.

3536
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,891
Yeah,

3537
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:20,430
man.

3538
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:20,581
Well,

3539
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:21,510
how's he doing now?

3540
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:23,040
Fantastic,

3541
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:23,251
man.

3542
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:23,551
No,

3543
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,140
he's writing books and shit.

3544
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,133
Still

3545
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:27,820
Riding High.

3546
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:28,950
Curing cancer and shit.

3547
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:29,784
It's so cool.

3548
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:31,050
I said no one ever.

3549
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:31,411
Come on,

3550
01:40:31,411 --> 01:40:31,651
man.

3551
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:32,051
Who Do you,

3552
01:40:32,051 --> 01:40:32,350
uh,

3553
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,440
do you guys want to do?

3554
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,170
Doing now?

3555
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,450
Who Do you want to see some early,

3556
01:40:36,451 --> 01:40:38,550
it was Anderson a ever fight in pride.

3557
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:38,811
Yeah,

3558
01:40:38,811 --> 01:40:39,660
he fought in pride.

3559
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:40,150
Uh,

3560
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:40,983
Anderson,

3561
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:42,901
some of those.

3562
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:44,390
Nick Diaz file two.

3563
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:45,790
We fought Alex de bling,

3564
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,240
the Brazilian Kyla.

3565
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,520
Remember that tone and room tone up
with that beautiful flying scissors to a

3566
01:40:52,651 --> 01:40:53,250
heel hook.

3567
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:53,740
Yeah,

3568
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:54,520
I'm watched.

3569
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,390
I'm watching Nick Diaz.

3570
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,910
Let's watch some fucking classic Vandelay.

3571
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:59,223
Oh,

3572
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:05,520
let's watch vendorlink cro cop
because it was Vandelay cro cop too,

3573
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:08,590
especially was a real,

3574
01:41:08,591 --> 01:41:13,591
it was a real education in what happens
when an elite striker gets good at

3575
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:16,000
takedown defense.

3576
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,500
You know what,

3577
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:18,221
what happened?

3578
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:21,220
There's something that happens to
these guys when they get really good at

3579
01:41:21,221 --> 01:41:23,470
takedown defense where they start,

3580
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:27,760
they start figuring it all out and then
they get loose on their feet and then

3581
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:32,200
you see the gap between
them and an other people.

3582
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,420
You know what?

3583
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:34,571
Uh,

3584
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:35,350
which one did,

3585
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:36,670
did Vandelay fight?

3586
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,490
I have to start taking my
take down defense and my deep,

3587
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:42,160
I take down defense a lot more seriously.

3588
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:42,820
That happened.

3589
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:43,780
Shut the fuck up.

3590
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:44,643
What would I say?

3591
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,920
Shut the fuck.

3592
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,410
This is the big one.

3593
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:48,370
This is when,

3594
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:48,611
uh,

3595
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:53,590
for whatever reason Vandelay decided that
he was going to go up to heavyweight.

3596
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:54,920
Is there going to be a hangover?

3597
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:55,773
Five

3598
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,750
has been been a forum

3599
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,700
Mirko favorite fighter of all time.

3600
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:04,570
Really?

3601
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:04,751
No,

3602
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:05,021
Garrett.

3603
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:05,854
Number two.

3604
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,370
Wow.

3605
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,181
How weird is it?

3606
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:08,014
I fuck both of them.

3607
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,750
What fucking world do we live in?

3608
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:13,960
They have Marco was only 32 back then.

3609
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:19,580
Some Latin kind of crossover stuff like
Russia and kind of where we go look at

3610
01:42:19,961 --> 01:42:20,794
this shit boy.

3611
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,040
Dude.

3612
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,540
How scary was the natural hair?

3613
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:22,960
Yeah,

3614
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,640
but this is Vandelay as a heavyweight.

3615
01:42:24,641 --> 01:42:25,750
He was two 18 here.

3616
01:42:25,751 --> 01:42:26,021
Cro.

3617
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:28,630
Cop was actually two 14 he can throw,

3618
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:31,840
but this is cro cop at its best.

3619
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:32,920
Cops in the legs.

3620
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:33,671
This is cro.

3621
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:34,810
Cop had his best.

3622
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,760
This is when he was sponsored by Purina.

3623
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:37,751
No,

3624
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:38,471
that's the flag.

3625
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:39,304
Of course.

3626
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:40,720
Don't be rude.

3627
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:41,411
Boom.

3628
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:42,280
Look at Oh,

3629
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:43,840
can kick to the body.

3630
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,310
Jesus Christ.

3631
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:46,390
That shit was on.

3632
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:48,550
He was so gangster.

3633
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,800
He was so much better before the tattoo.

3634
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,270
Oh my God.

3635
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:53,540
Vandelay yeah,

3636
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:54,071
no,

3637
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:54,821
I'm talking about Cro.

3638
01:42:54,821 --> 01:42:55,091
Cop.

3639
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:55,924
Dude,

3640
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:58,060
look at this hammer fist.

3641
01:42:58,510 --> 01:42:59,343
He was just,

3642
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:00,131
Oh my God.

3643
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:03,190
He was just fucking
Vandelay up in this fight.

3644
01:43:03,191 --> 01:43:04,024
So strong.

3645
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,680
He was so good back then.

3646
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:10,030
He would just that kick to the
body and the opening round.

3647
01:43:10,031 --> 01:43:11,320
I could watch that all day long.

3648
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,290
That shit was ridiculous for sure.

3649
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:16,060
The greatest left kicker ever.

3650
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,013
Ever.

3651
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:21,220
How much different is wonderland look now?

3652
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,770
Driving a different face
lift or whatever he did?

3653
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:23,960
Well,

3654
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:24,071
yeah,

3655
01:43:24,071 --> 01:43:29,071
it is a piece of rib taken
out to reconstruct his nose
and he had his nose made

3656
01:43:29,351 --> 01:43:31,510
extra large so he'd get more air in it.

3657
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:33,430
You know what have they got a more pussy.

3658
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:33,940
Nice.

3659
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:34,780
I don't think it did.

3660
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,680
He's always agree with it,

3661
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:40,120
but watch this shit man.

3662
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,390
This is rough because he
was already beaten up.

3663
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:44,370
He was already beating out.

3664
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,101
Boom,

3665
01:43:45,101 --> 01:43:45,934
straight left.

3666
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,350
Mirko was so goddamn laser
beam accurate back then too.

3667
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:54,260
He's just fucking going off on Vandelay.

3668
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,600
There's also the first fight,

3669
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,810
which is maybe the scariest
fucking stare down ever.

3670
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,380
Ever.

3671
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:04,830
Hands down when Vandelay and cro cop was
standing vandelays doing all his normal

3672
01:44:04,831 --> 01:44:07,820
like intimidation shit and
cro cop's looking at him like,

3673
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:10,820
I've killed motherfuckers with a knife.

3674
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:11,121
You know,

3675
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:12,290
he's got like that face.

3676
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,041
Yeah.

3677
01:44:13,041 --> 01:44:16,070
That was the only time
Vander Lee has ever been out.

3678
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:16,790
Uh,

3679
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:17,980
scared out.

3680
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,800
Stare down,

3681
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:19,071
out,

3682
01:44:19,071 --> 01:44:19,700
stare down.

3683
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:20,533
Yeah.

3684
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,463
It was the only time.

3685
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,750
Usually we see cro go still
finding he's fighting.

3686
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:26,421
I think he,

3687
01:44:26,421 --> 01:44:27,350
she soon bully.

3688
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:28,041
Fond dream.

3689
01:44:28,041 --> 01:44:31,680
Yaks or in now she did well he,

3690
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:33,980
he won a k one,

3691
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:34,814
right?

3692
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:35,601
The heavyweight one.

3693
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:37,550
A version of a Grand Prix.

3694
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:38,443
Yeah.

3695
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,680
Like a year ago.

3696
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:39,971
Yeah.

3697
01:44:39,971 --> 01:44:40,920
Look at Vandalia

3698
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:43,970
knows how to curve.

3699
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,500
It was mashed.

3700
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:47,000
There's a lot of guys like that,

3701
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:48,680
so they get that sense that,

3702
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,470
that smash part of the middle of the nose.

3703
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:52,550
Oh,

3704
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,180
he wants to fight.

3705
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:54,013
Look in his eyes.

3706
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:55,970
The doctor's going to stop it.

3707
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,673
That's all fake.

3708
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,600
They very rarely kind of dots in Japan for

3709
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,320
giving him a break

3710
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:05,750
to let them recharge.

3711
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,710
Make the fight better.

3712
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,100
Yup.

3713
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:08,780
So they create some drama.

3714
01:45:08,781 --> 01:45:09,460
They make it look great.

3715
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,293
They might stop it.

3716
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,000
Oh,

3717
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,833
WWF.

3718
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:12,740
Not sure.

3719
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:13,970
They would never stop any,

3720
01:45:13,971 --> 01:45:14,391
there's not,

3721
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:16,010
there's not enough blood
to even consider it.

3722
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,610
The problem is while they're doing this,

3723
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:21,350
they're given cro cop a break too.

3724
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:24,680
And that fucking dude
was so goddamn explosive.

3725
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:25,940
Nope.

3726
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,960
He's not even yoked.

3727
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,210
Uh,

3728
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:29,770
he was only two 14 back then,

3729
01:45:29,771 --> 01:45:30,604
man.

3730
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:30,911
I mean,

3731
01:45:30,911 --> 01:45:31,660
he's yoked,

3732
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,310
but it's a different kind of yoked.

3733
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:35,200
He carries around a lot of weight now.

3734
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,270
It looks very different
than he looked right now.

3735
01:45:37,630 --> 01:45:40,740
Tell him I'll go up to 50 to 40 somewhere.

3736
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:42,183
Yeah.

3737
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:45,580
What think you ways to 35 you said he
was the strongest guy you ever tied up

3738
01:45:45,581 --> 01:45:45,791
with,

3739
01:45:45,791 --> 01:45:46,030
right?

3740
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:46,863
Hands down.

3741
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:47,320
Wow.

3742
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,153
Not even close.

3743
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,620
Jesus this,

3744
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:51,160
they started him on the ground again.

3745
01:45:51,161 --> 01:45:51,910
I liked that.

3746
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:52,743
I liked that.

3747
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,300
Vandelay throwing some
hammers from his back here.

3748
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,103
Hello.

3749
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:02,523
God

3750
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:05,043
Damn.

3751
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,170
I just want to see it when it gets to
the feet and I don't want to hear the

3752
01:46:08,171 --> 01:46:09,004
commentary

3753
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:14,230
trying for arm bars and shit.

3754
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:15,280
Nobody's even talking.

3755
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:17,350
Saw me carrying this podcast

3756
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:19,210
once.

3757
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:20,050
It's like Dennis,

3758
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,260
I haven't seen this first
time calendar ever seen it,

3759
01:46:23,261 --> 01:46:24,250
so he's just super,

3760
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,021
totally,

3761
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:25,854
I knew it.

3762
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,011
Yeah,

3763
01:46:27,011 --> 01:46:27,370
sure,

3764
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:28,203
sure.

3765
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:31,450
What does that you're,

3766
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:31,990
I wanted the,

3767
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:32,680
uh,

3768
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,530
this is amazing.

3769
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,700
It's a bar talking to the microphone.

3770
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,320
Probar yeah.

3771
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:38,770
Don't want to put you
on the mic or anything.

3772
01:46:38,771 --> 01:46:39,604
But this bars,

3773
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,140
I've been looking at it for two hours.

3774
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:41,441
Go on.

3775
01:46:41,441 --> 01:46:43,030
It's delicious and look good.

3776
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:46,320
Great.

3777
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,250
There are a couple though with the mic,

3778
01:46:48,251 --> 01:46:48,590
right?

3779
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:49,010
Yeah.

3780
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:49,440
Was on it.

3781
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,760
We should probably break
down too bad for the Mike.

3782
01:46:51,761 --> 01:46:52,440
How about that?

3783
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,320
When I went hunting Nazi bro,

3784
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,090
break out the pickles right now.

3785
01:46:57,091 --> 01:47:00,420
I just feel good and everybody else eat
a pickle and give me one this to stand

3786
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:01,770
up so I could see the end.

3787
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:03,900
Well we want pickles so you can,

3788
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,180
you want it to stand up and
I won't fucking pickles.

3789
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:07,380
I've been here for six hours.

3790
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:08,640
We'll get a fucking pickle.

3791
01:47:08,641 --> 01:47:08,861
Right?

3792
01:47:08,861 --> 01:47:11,240
And I haven't been here for six
hours and you were 40 months,

3793
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,413
whatever.

3794
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:16,650
I brought wine and and I brought Jesus
gets him to eat after this and you guys

3795
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:17,460
want to get some dinner?

3796
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:17,761
Too late.

3797
01:47:17,761 --> 01:47:19,110
I'm sorry I can't eat that thing.

3798
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:19,920
Come on.

3799
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,281
I'm sorry.

3800
01:47:20,281 --> 01:47:21,114
I have rules,

3801
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:21,620
rules,

3802
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:22,230
rules,

3803
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:22,730
Diet.

3804
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:23,320
I just,

3805
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,060
I'm sorry.

3806
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:24,990
There's some things I won't do.

3807
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,660
I want to be pushed that
far right here it goes.

3808
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,410
Here it goes.

3809
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:29,650
I should look at this.

3810
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:31,440
Eddie back up to the feet.

3811
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:32,070
Sweat.

3812
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:32,903
Here comes,

3813
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,700
there's not a Krispy Kreme from miles
away and you don't want to settle for

3814
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:36,030
less.

3815
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:36,631
You know what he the game,

3816
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:39,090
a yellow car fucked up back then.

3817
01:47:39,091 --> 01:47:40,890
Two men and they would give dude's yellow.

3818
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:42,480
What does that mean in activities?

3819
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,233
God,

3820
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:46,530
what's that?

3821
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:48,270
10% 10% baby.

3822
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:49,870
Here it goes though like this.

3823
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:50,873
Get randomly slapped,

3824
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,560
kicked out of his right eye.

3825
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:54,420
Wash this look up.

3826
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:54,871
Good Cro.

3827
01:47:54,871 --> 01:47:56,710
Cop's slides too.

3828
01:48:00,150 --> 01:48:00,570
Good.

3829
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:01,350
Good movement.

3830
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,720
Boom to the bodies.

3831
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:04,460
Hooks for days out of wonder.

3832
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,221
Oh my God.

3833
01:48:05,221 --> 01:48:05,401
Yeah,

3834
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:06,360
he never threw it straight.

3835
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:07,194
Parts of her.

3836
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:08,483
Very rarely.

3837
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:11,130
Well you had very narrow
shoulders for a big muscular guy.

3838
01:48:11,131 --> 01:48:12,660
Here comics comes here she comes.

3839
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:16,180
Oh my God who just setting them up.

3840
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:17,370
I got butterflies.

3841
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:18,550
I've seen it a hundred times.

3842
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,810
He's just setting them up though,

3843
01:48:19,811 --> 01:48:20,644
man.

3844
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:22,641
Oh yeah.

3845
01:48:22,641 --> 01:48:24,770
You can never give cro cop setup time.

3846
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,060
You cannot do it

3847
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:28,550
manually tagged him.

3848
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,601
But look,

3849
01:48:29,601 --> 01:48:29,781
Cro,

3850
01:48:29,781 --> 01:48:30,680
cop back forth,

3851
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:31,071
Cro,

3852
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:32,450
cop still out of Chin back then,

3853
01:48:32,451 --> 01:48:32,631
man.

3854
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:33,560
He could take it back then.

3855
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,960
Oh my Lord.

3856
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:39,440
The straight laugh to the
face and the hair comes,

3857
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,250
oh good Lord.

3858
01:48:43,251 --> 01:48:44,084
I refer stop.

3859
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:45,111
Oh my God,

3860
01:48:45,111 --> 01:48:45,950
look at that stuff.

3861
01:48:45,951 --> 01:48:48,920
Fucken Gash on the side of
his head with a Shin Land.

3862
01:48:48,921 --> 01:48:49,820
It's horrifying.

3863
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:50,750
Yeah.

3864
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:51,920
Well he was one of those dudes,

3865
01:48:51,921 --> 01:48:55,850
man that's caught me with that kick
the way he moved and that's awful.

3866
01:48:55,851 --> 01:48:56,870
So different.

3867
01:48:57,170 --> 01:48:58,220
He wasn't no world.

3868
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,050
Oh God.

3869
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:01,341
Oh Christ.

3870
01:49:01,341 --> 01:49:02,060
That's so bad.

3871
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:03,530
He moved so different back.

3872
01:49:03,531 --> 01:49:04,460
He looks dead dude.

3873
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:08,330
By the time he got into the
UFC and you kind of wonder,

3874
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:08,721
you know,

3875
01:49:08,721 --> 01:49:09,500
because of the,

3876
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:12,770
what they did in pride as far as
like the drug testing and shit.

3877
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:16,670
You gotta wonder what these guys
were and weren't on back then.

3878
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:20,980
And then you get off of it and there's
this like this period where your body's

3879
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:21,990
just not the same.

3880
01:49:21,991 --> 01:49:22,490
Right?

3881
01:49:22,490 --> 01:49:26,000
Like a perfect example that
I always use is Roy Jones Jr.

3882
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:28,460
When Roy Jones jr fought John Ruiz,

3883
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:32,000
he got up to like 199 pounds,

3884
01:49:32,001 --> 01:49:33,050
like ripped,

3885
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:33,981
shredded.

3886
01:49:33,981 --> 01:49:38,810
And then he got to go all the way down
to one 75 when he fought Antonio Tarver

3887
01:49:38,811 --> 01:49:41,210
after that and he looked like dog.

3888
01:49:41,211 --> 01:49:41,471
She just,

3889
01:49:41,471 --> 01:49:42,350
when he got knocked out,

3890
01:49:42,351 --> 01:49:46,070
right Tarver was the first guy to stop
him and Tara didn't just knock them out.

3891
01:49:46,071 --> 01:49:46,940
He changed his career,

3892
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,853
changed everything.

3893
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,630
Then after that he fucked Glen Johnson.

3894
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:51,790
Glen Johnson knocked him out bad.

3895
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:52,151
Well,

3896
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:52,641
they said that,

3897
01:49:52,641 --> 01:49:53,020
that,

3898
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:58,020
that he was so gifted physically and so
fast that he actually did he that when

3899
01:49:58,031 --> 01:50:01,660
he lost a step because he didn't really
have to work on fundamentals the way

3900
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:03,610
somebody who wasn't that fast fasted.

3901
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:04,990
Once he lost his step,

3902
01:50:04,991 --> 01:50:07,360
he was getting knocked out by
guys who were really educated.

3903
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:08,320
It was so fun to watch,

3904
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:08,650
man.

3905
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:08,801
Oh,

3906
01:50:08,801 --> 01:50:09,634
he's the best.

3907
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,563
My favorite ever.

3908
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,490
I hate her.

3909
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:12,750
Not that Mayweather pack yell.

3910
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,541
Foot's going to happen.

3911
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:13,900
Huh?

3912
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,380
Is it?

3913
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,220
That's what they're saying.

3914
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:16,590
Whether you call them out,

3915
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:19,060
call them out and then pack.

3916
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:19,331
I was like,

3917
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:19,571
cool.

3918
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:20,410
Money's not an issue.

3919
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:21,280
I don't care about the money.

3920
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:24,490
Let's just make it out because
money was what was holding it up.

3921
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:28,660
That's going to be the
biggest money making papers
they've done about five years

3922
01:50:28,661 --> 01:50:29,494
ago.

3923
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:29,741
Yeah.

3924
01:50:29,741 --> 01:50:30,940
But this is a good time for it.

3925
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,830
It would have been better five years ago,

3926
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:33,730
but it's still really good.

3927
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:34,650
So what he did to,

3928
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:35,411
to Algeria,

3929
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:36,550
I mean there's just took his whole game.

3930
01:50:36,551 --> 01:50:39,220
Well Algeria not on his level.

3931
01:50:39,221 --> 01:50:43,210
I mean I'll do it really do I really know
that before the fight when you listen

3932
01:50:43,211 --> 01:50:43,631
to people,

3933
01:50:43,631 --> 01:50:46,030
they weren't saying that he was going
to get out class that everyone knew was

3934
01:50:46,031 --> 01:50:47,560
too big of a jump for Algeria though.

3935
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:48,910
I didn't hear that.

3936
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:49,773
I heard,

3937
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,320
think about first off,

3938
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:53,270
personal drunk guys,

3939
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,143
vertical hunter,

3940
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:55,750
uh,

3941
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:56,351
Bradley,

3942
01:50:56,351 --> 01:51:00,450
Tim Bradley and they were talking and
they were very respectful of Algeria.

3943
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:03,030
Like a plus 1200 underdog.

3944
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:06,250
No one gave him a shot like Vegas.

3945
01:51:06,251 --> 01:51:08,140
Like he's exactly how
you would think of a guy.

3946
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:09,190
Lived with his parents,

3947
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,553
which he does.

3948
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:13,650
He does.

3949
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:14,080
Yeah.

3950
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,730
He lives with his parents in the basement,

3951
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:16,630
but it doesn't have,

3952
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:17,410
he has money now.

3953
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,700
I mean he beat providing the cough.

3954
01:51:18,701 --> 01:51:20,650
I know he made some money and
decide he's going to keep us

3955
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,100
200,000 miles.

3956
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:25,660
I like him even more.

3957
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,080
He just said it likes to
be around his family plot.

3958
01:51:28,090 --> 01:51:28,660
Floyd Mayweather.

3959
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:30,040
Don't be a box in a humbug.

3960
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:32,020
Give the fans the fight they want.

3961
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,820
They have waited long enough.

3962
01:51:33,821 --> 01:51:34,450
Wow.

3963
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,470
Dang son.

3964
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:37,820
I like the dot right
before Floyd Mayweather.

3965
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:39,280
Let everybody know.

3966
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,720
We'll put the little
period before for Amanda,

3967
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:43,990
so it's not just in his APP mentions.

3968
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,291
Oh,

3969
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:45,330
so if you go dot.

3970
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:47,580
I just learned that it's kind of a lame,

3971
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:48,820
that call out.

3972
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,930
Don't be a humbug.

3973
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,793
Cute.

3974
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:51,491
That's what he is.

3975
01:51:51,491 --> 01:51:52,051
He's a nice guy.

3976
01:51:52,051 --> 01:51:52,450
His yes.

3977
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,111
He's a nice guy.

3978
01:51:53,111 --> 01:51:53,980
That fucks people up.

3979
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:54,550
Yeah.

3980
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:55,450
He's an interesting guy.

3981
01:51:55,451 --> 01:51:57,710
They did a thing on skeleton.

3982
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,553
These facial hair

3983
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:01,023
feel

3984
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:04,190
Bieber haircut with a gang gets Khan

3985
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:06,400
who stops.

3986
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,940
They did a analysis of like his
skeleton apparently has a very,

3987
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,440
very large wrists,

3988
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:12,543
big bones.

3989
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:13,930
They're talking about like the d.

3990
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:17,800
One of the reasons why he's been able to
carry his punching power up through the

3991
01:52:17,801 --> 01:52:21,130
ranks and why he's so successful
and knocking guys out and they,

3992
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:21,491
they,

3993
01:52:21,491 --> 01:52:25,180
there's a direct correlation between
the size of certain parts of your bones,

3994
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,890
particularly like wrist size,

3995
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:28,470
like wrist size is like,

3996
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,230
his cats are huge,

3997
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:31,803
huge lessons.

3998
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,673
Manny Pacquiao,

3999
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:33,620
his speed,

4000
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:34,533
his speed,

4001
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:35,710
but it's speed.

4002
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:36,580
It's just so awkward.

4003
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:37,660
He's just a beast.

4004
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:40,240
And just to be Nice Guy Dick,

4005
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,980
he thinks so for a little guy,

4006
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:43,223
Dick size,

4007
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:46,010
size had effected your power.

4008
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:49,490
What have they learned that
and they tested him and I no,

4009
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:51,470
just carry a laugh in there.

4010
01:52:51,471 --> 01:52:52,304
And you kind of short,

4011
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:54,020
I'm not dumb.

4012
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,690
No serious question or serious question.

4013
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:57,524
Brendan,

4014
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:58,940
how many inches are you

4015
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:01,311
serious?

4016
01:53:01,311 --> 01:53:03,710
How should we have a voice dropped
and he got whispery about it.

4017
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:04,431
Serious question.

4018
01:53:04,431 --> 01:53:05,240
Brendan.

4019
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:07,910
How many inches are I like shit like that.

4020
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,440
Me Too.

4021
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,220
I like shit.

4022
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:10,170
All I want to know is about it.

4023
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:10,961
I care about.

4024
01:53:10,961 --> 01:53:12,050
It's got to be honest.

4025
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:12,500
Okay,

4026
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,910
this could get you more pussy.

4027
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,171
I'm all set,

4028
01:53:15,171 --> 01:53:15,530
man.

4029
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:16,730
I can't take it anymore.

4030
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:17,001
No,

4031
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:17,834
I'm just kidding.

4032
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:19,050
Oh,

4033
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:20,180
to 13 inches.

4034
01:53:20,181 --> 01:53:20,690
Eddie.

4035
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:21,411
Thank you for asking.

4036
01:53:21,411 --> 01:53:22,970
That's a very,

4037
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:24,940
that's bigger than Lexington style.

4038
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:25,521
I'm just kidding.

4039
01:53:25,521 --> 01:53:25,700
Dot.

4040
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:26,211
I forgot.

4041
01:53:26,211 --> 01:53:27,710
Roy Nelson fought cro cop.

4042
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:28,840
How'd he do it?

4043
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,990
Right after Roy.

4044
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:32,150
Roy took his back and smashed him.

4045
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:33,980
No oil be cro.

4046
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:34,420
Cop.

4047
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:35,253
Yeah.

4048
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:36,300
Now's the Cro.

4049
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,561
Cro.

4050
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:37,760
Cop had them wobbled though.

4051
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,630
Did you remember that Cro
cop had run the ropes?

4052
01:53:39,631 --> 01:53:42,800
They kicked him or something
straight left with or what was,

4053
01:53:42,801 --> 01:53:45,070
it landed a nasty body shot on him too,

4054
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:45,861
but yeah,

4055
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:46,071
Cro,

4056
01:53:46,071 --> 01:53:46,810
cop got him down.

4057
01:53:46,810 --> 01:53:47,643
Tk Odom?

4058
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,273
Yeah.

4059
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:49,401
Oh,

4060
01:53:49,401 --> 01:53:50,870
you mean a Roy got him down.

4061
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:51,973
Yeah.

4062
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:52,843
Um,

4063
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:55,700
I want to see Roy versus Nogueira.

4064
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:58,550
Oh really?

4065
01:53:59,090 --> 01:53:59,481
Yeah,

4066
01:53:59,481 --> 01:54:01,880
just to see like office at the end.

4067
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:02,810
What?

4068
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,010
The giant right hand.

4069
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,083
Yeah.

4070
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:06,380
I can't believe you want to watch that.

4071
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:07,190
You don't want to watch that.

4072
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:08,120
That's tough to watch,

4073
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:08,954
man.

4074
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:09,561
It's like,

4075
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:11,990
what's like no gears fricking oh,

4076
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:13,190

4077
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,233
it just gets

4078
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:15,480
okay.

4079
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,590
Annihilated.

4080
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,900
It's basically the end
of a freaking legend.

4081
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:19,410
I know.

4082
01:54:19,410 --> 01:54:20,020
Yeah.

4083
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:20,853
Made me sad.

4084
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:22,860
Definitely south stiff.

4085
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:25,053
MMM.

4086
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:27,770
It is what it is.

4087
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:29,173
Cost.

4088
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:31,130
What about the Bob Sapp days.

4089
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:32,223
Okay.

4090
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,970
Sap Nogueira Carlos Newton.

4091
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,380
Palae how about,

4092
01:54:36,381 --> 01:54:38,450
I'm sure we already saw Bob Sapp.

4093
01:54:38,451 --> 01:54:40,200
Nogueira we've done that
on the podcast before.

4094
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:41,120
I think people will go.

4095
01:54:41,121 --> 01:54:41,661
Oh yeah,

4096
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:42,494
that's true.

4097
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,120
How about Bob Sapp Cro cop?

4098
01:54:44,121 --> 01:54:45,110
Was that his kickboxing?

4099
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:45,800
Yes.

4100
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,810
Jose Conseco Hoe man choice.

4101
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:48,800
Oh No,

4102
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:51,500
you need to sleep more.

4103
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:53,103
How bad?

4104
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,050
How bad my car,

4105
01:54:55,051 --> 01:54:55,881
I remember Mark Current,

4106
01:54:55,881 --> 01:54:57,950
his body captain America right there.

4107
01:54:58,630 --> 01:54:59,310
Right.

4108
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:00,340
He had the craziest boats,

4109
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:01,540
Planet Mark Carr.

4110
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:02,300
Remember him?

4111
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:05,480
I heard mark likes the way the Dick Taste.

4112
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,433
Wow.

4113
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:07,820
What's your price?

4114
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,013
There was a rumor.

4115
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:09,590
Huh?

4116
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:11,150
What's your price from our car?

4117
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:14,020
I do 100,000 if anybody's
ever watched that documentary.

4118
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,650
Exactly what I was talking.

4119
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:16,910
You haven't watched that documentary.

4120
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:18,070
The smashing machine.

4121
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:19,190
Great documentary.

4122
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:23,270
I mean crazy documentary
cause they followed Mark Hunt
who at the time Mark Carr

4123
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:28,170
rather mark her at the time was a world
class mixed martial arts fighters,

4124
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:29,270
trashy guys,

4125
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:34,130
and had this unbelievable body and they
caught him in the middle of this like

4126
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,480
drug spiral.

4127
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,710
Downward spiral.

4128
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:37,020
Right.

4129
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:38,260
We know that when they were making it,

4130
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:40,880
they had no idea they got
there with the camera.

4131
01:55:40,881 --> 01:55:41,570
He fell apart.

4132
01:55:41,570 --> 01:55:44,100
The crazy thing about Margaret is he told

4133
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:49,100
me this is the pain because when Mark
Coleman was rising in the UFC and there

4134
01:55:49,621 --> 01:55:50,640
was a couple of the wrestlers,

4135
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:51,710
there's no Kara mops.

4136
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,730
Her said that guys were always telling me,

4137
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:54,301
look dude,

4138
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:55,320
you should do the UFC.

4139
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:56,154
You got to do it.

4140
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:57,420
You'd kill these guys.

4141
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:01,320
And Mark Her said he did not
have any interest in fighting.

4142
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:02,183
He kept saying,

4143
01:56:02,190 --> 01:56:03,180
those guys are animals.

4144
01:56:03,181 --> 01:56:04,710
I don't have that animal instinct.

4145
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:05,110
I mean,

4146
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:06,060
if people kept telling me,

4147
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:06,331
dude,

4148
01:56:06,331 --> 01:56:07,320
it'll be so easy.

4149
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:08,610
You look at Mark Coleman,

4150
01:56:08,611 --> 01:56:09,301
he's a star,

4151
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,290
he's making all this money.

4152
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:11,400
He's taken people down.

4153
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:12,234
You could do this.

4154
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,070
And then they twisted his arm.

4155
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:17,820
He signed a deal with the UFC and
then backed out of it cause he,

4156
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:19,500
he just was not confident.

4157
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:20,790
And then he decided,

4158
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:21,330
damn,

4159
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:25,830
maybe all he got off an offer in
Brazil to do an eight man tournament.

4160
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,461
And he said,

4161
01:56:26,461 --> 01:56:26,880
okay,

4162
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,720
I'll do this,

4163
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:28,783
uh,

4164
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,530
this low key tournament in Brazil.

4165
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:34,640
See how I do and then now we'll evaluate.

4166
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:35,071
After that,

4167
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,150
he went down to Brazil.

4168
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,800
He was scared shitless.

4169
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:39,150
Mark Kerr was scared shitless,

4170
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,710
throwing up in the bathroom,

4171
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:41,700
had diarrhea.

4172
01:56:41,701 --> 01:56:42,660
This is what he was telling me.

4173
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:43,643
He was

4174
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:45,750
freaked out.

4175
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,560
He went out there,

4176
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,240
one the eight man tournament,

4177
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:50,520
got to it was a bare knuckle,

4178
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:52,950
so he got the staph
infection all up his arms.

4179
01:56:52,951 --> 01:56:53,970
So he was in Brazil.

4180
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,230
He won this thing,

4181
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:56,310
he won this tournament.

4182
01:56:56,311 --> 01:56:57,001
He beat Fabio's,

4183
01:56:57,001 --> 01:57:00,720
your shell and the final and there was
no gloves and he got the staff up his

4184
01:57:00,721 --> 01:57:01,230
arm.

4185
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:03,270
He almost died in the hospital in Brazil.

4186
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:04,230
It was terrible.

4187
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,290
He was supposed to win $20,000
a promoter of the show said,

4188
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:07,710
Eh,

4189
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:08,820
it is Brazilian tax.

4190
01:57:08,821 --> 01:57:10,800
You're getting 11,000 or whatever.

4191
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,300
So he got fucked with the money.

4192
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:14,520
He would had a nightmare
experience in the hospital.

4193
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:15,510
When he finally got home,

4194
01:57:15,511 --> 01:57:15,721
he said,

4195
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:16,980
I'll never do this again.

4196
01:57:16,981 --> 01:57:18,760
But he started reading
stuff on the Internet about,

4197
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,310
they started calling him
the smashing machine and,

4198
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:22,220
and in Brazil,

4199
01:57:22,221 --> 01:57:25,140
a mucky Nadia fucking
a smushy or whatever,

4200
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,880
and all of a sudden he thought,

4201
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:27,714
wait a minute.

4202
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:28,973
Hmm,

4203
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,140
maybe I will do this again.

4204
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:32,240
And then that is funny.

4205
01:57:32,270 --> 01:57:32,610
Yeah.

4206
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:33,720
If you want to freak out.

4207
01:57:33,721 --> 01:57:37,560
He wrestled at one 88 and then he
fought to 60 look at the size of,

4208
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:37,701
yeah,

4209
01:57:37,701 --> 01:57:38,260
that's crazy.

4210
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:38,450
I mean,

4211
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:39,283
the size of Bob.

4212
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:40,740
Forget about anybody else.

4213
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:42,410
Anybody that's ever lived,

4214
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,930
never forget about anybody
when you talking to size.

4215
01:57:44,931 --> 01:57:46,170
So forget about anybody that ever lived.

4216
01:57:46,171 --> 01:57:47,880
Look at there's no Garrett's
still tries to take them down.

4217
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,850
Oh fuck this world up for five years.

4218
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:52,101
Right.

4219
01:57:52,101 --> 01:57:53,250
That really jacked it up.

4220
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:55,170
Powerball Paul Orndorff.

4221
01:57:55,171 --> 01:58:00,171
Mr. Wonderful driver pile driving first
pot first strong is seeing the first

4222
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:02,640
minute of a fight.

4223
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:05,040
Unbelievably the strongest
fighter ever for first minute.

4224
01:58:05,070 --> 01:58:05,431
Yeah.

4225
01:58:05,431 --> 01:58:06,600
He's unbelievably strong.

4226
01:58:06,601 --> 01:58:08,010
Him a car when he was three,

4227
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:09,110
he's bigger than car window.

4228
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:12,150
He's 375 pounds with a
gift that no one can.

4229
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:13,043
I mean that's,

4230
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:17,640
he's pile driving people and
he's on every drug known to man.

4231
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,440
I mean he's allowed to
take whatever he wants.

4232
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:20,640
I mean he's just,

4233
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:21,750
he was so much bigger.

4234
01:58:21,751 --> 01:58:22,650
He was a hundred pounds.

4235
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:24,420
So that's a natural.

4236
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:25,350
Some guys are that Beck.

4237
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:25,651
Yeah,

4238
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:26,484
totally.

4239
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:28,200
Three 75 would abs is totally normal.

4240
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:32,070
We see it all the Tate
Tate was in that movie,

4241
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:34,250
the longest yard with him and a tape.

4242
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:34,780
Tate was like,

4243
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:37,620
the dude carries around
doctor's bag everywhere he goes.

4244
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:39,083
He's just got,

4245
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:41,880
he's just got supplies like you.

4246
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:42,190
You

4247
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:42,591
can hear it.

4248
01:58:42,591 --> 01:58:44,080
He was terrified to fight.

4249
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:48,100
I'm sure they said he'd be in the
back like just a super nice guy.

4250
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:49,540
Super Nice Guy.

4251
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:50,890
Like a smart,

4252
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:51,880
smart.

4253
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:55,600
Ivan salivary is a friend of mine and
he's really close with Bob Sapp and he's

4254
01:58:55,601 --> 01:58:56,620
just like the sweetest,

4255
01:58:56,650 --> 01:59:00,250
nicest guy ever who just
found a way to make cash.

4256
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:02,770
I heard he made a killing
and ships in Japan.

4257
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:03,110
Yeah.

4258
01:59:03,110 --> 01:59:04,180
But then it all went away,

4259
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:04,531
man.

4260
01:59:04,531 --> 01:59:06,150
It all went away in a big way.

4261
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:07,290
Like he,

4262
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:07,680
when he,

4263
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,150
when he backed out of k one,

4264
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:09,511
you know,

4265
01:59:09,511 --> 01:59:10,111
that whole deal,

4266
01:59:10,111 --> 01:59:10,510
like they were,

4267
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:13,230
they the Yakuza apparently allegedly,

4268
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:14,010
uh,

4269
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:14,641
due to,

4270
01:59:14,641 --> 01:59:14,721
uh,

4271
01:59:14,721 --> 01:59:15,554
you know,

4272
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:19,680
unforeseen circumstances did not
have the contract ready for him.

4273
01:59:20,190 --> 01:59:22,710
And they were trying to get them
to fight without a contract.

4274
01:59:22,711 --> 01:59:23,041
He was like,

4275
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:23,641
fuck you.

4276
01:59:23,641 --> 01:59:24,890
So he backed out of the,

4277
01:59:24,891 --> 01:59:27,700
the main event and like
they don't play that shit.

4278
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:28,590
Don't play that shit.

4279
01:59:28,591 --> 01:59:30,030
Like he was worried about his life.

4280
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:30,271
Like,

4281
01:59:30,271 --> 01:59:31,680
look at the size of him here.

4282
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,970
Good Lord.

4283
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:37,230
No Garris still trying for that takedown.

4284
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:38,750
And that gets probably all jacked up.

4285
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:39,351
Yeah.

4286
01:59:39,351 --> 01:59:41,540
But if he was who some
are Paul Harvest it,

4287
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:42,703
you know,

4288
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:44,150
he could have at least grabbed a hold of

4289
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:46,220
like,

4290
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:46,601
you know what,

4291
01:59:46,601 --> 01:59:47,411
I'm not going to go through them.

4292
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:48,101
I got to pull guard,

4293
01:59:48,101 --> 01:59:49,810
I got to beat him off my back.

4294
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,370
And that's what he ends up doing in this,

4295
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:55,030
he sweeps someone that arm bar and his
neck is probably already injured pretty

4296
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:55,361
bad.

4297
01:59:55,361 --> 01:59:57,130
So at some point he made the decision,

4298
01:59:57,131 --> 01:59:59,560
I can't take this motherfucker
down if I keep trying.

4299
01:59:59,561 --> 01:59:59,860
It's,

4300
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:01,330
it's not gonna work.

4301
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,080
I gotta pull God,

4302
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,900
I got to meet him off my back and
he's got to do old school hoists.

4303
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:07,780
Gracie cook him then and
he's prepared for what?

4304
02:00:07,781 --> 02:00:08,980
He has confidence and he was like,

4305
02:00:08,981 --> 02:00:13,570
I can beat him off my back
because in the gym all day

4306
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:14,470
tire mount.

4307
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:14,641
Yeah,

4308
02:00:14,641 --> 02:00:16,110
but is he beating someone that's big.

4309
02:00:16,130 --> 02:00:17,610
I mean cause even know anybody that I peg.

4310
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:18,983
No,

4311
02:00:19,230 --> 02:00:20,330
that's the thing about SAP.

4312
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:21,300
You don't even know.

4313
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:22,500
You don't know anybody that big.

4314
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:23,610
Who are you going to get to train

4315
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:26,210
fucking difference in the size of them.

4316
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:27,283
I mean that's,

4317
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,720
that's Goddamn Komiko he
hates getting hit though,

4318
02:00:29,721 --> 02:00:30,260
doesn't it?

4319
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:30,441
Yeah.

4320
02:00:30,441 --> 02:00:31,430
He doesn't like to see that.

4321
02:00:31,431 --> 02:00:32,570
When he got hit and he hated it,

4322
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:34,810
it'd be that half ass.

4323
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:36,910
I know.

4324
02:00:36,910 --> 02:00:38,410
Welterweight to kick harder than that.

4325
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:42,640
Maurice was training him though.

4326
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:44,510
You know Maury Maury Sabbath,

4327
02:00:44,511 --> 02:00:44,830
right?

4328
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:45,190
Yeah.

4329
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:46,023
Maurice had them,

4330
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:46,511
you know,

4331
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:49,000
at least competent and Barnett,

4332
02:00:49,001 --> 02:00:49,241
right?

4333
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:49,450
Yep.

4334
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:50,820
Josh was in his corner for this.

4335
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,033
Yeah.

4336
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,580
I mean he's a Seattle guy.

4337
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:55,823
That's right.

4338
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:56,763
Boom.

4339
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:00,180
I started getting tired and this fight,

4340
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:04,570
it's crazy how far everything
has come since 2004

4341
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:07,290
I'll never forget watching this fight,

4342
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:10,180
watching the slide going fucking nuts.

4343
02:01:10,230 --> 02:01:13,470
All I was thinking about in
the beginning was he's too big.

4344
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,333
He's not going to win.

4345
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:15,360
He's just too big.

4346
02:01:15,361 --> 02:01:16,440
There's no way he can do this.

4347
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:17,460
He's too big.

4348
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:18,420
He's too big.

4349
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:19,253
Switch.

4350
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:20,123
Ooh.

4351
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:22,890
Oh Shit.

4352
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,010
That was Bob as a child.

4353
02:01:26,011 --> 02:01:27,150
Too late though for this round,

4354
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:28,830
but when he got Bob inside,

4355
02:01:28,831 --> 02:01:29,850
controller's working,

4356
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,730
trying for a Kimora on a 375 pound man.

4357
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,200
That's Hilarious,

4358
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:34,650
dude.

4359
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:38,100
Bob Sat up him in his guard.

4360
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:39,470
I don't know his neck looks fine.

4361
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,431
No,

4362
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:41,480
it's not filed.

4363
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:42,441
Shut the fuck up.

4364
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:44,710
380 pound dude slammed
you on your neighbor,

4365
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:45,090

4367
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:47,180
his weight on your neck.

4368
02:01:47,181 --> 02:01:48,014
Believe me,

4369
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,100
you've got an interview.

4370
02:01:49,110 --> 02:01:51,630
Said he [inaudible] give them a chance.

4371
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:52,320
What's that?

4372
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:52,500
Okay,

4373
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:52,940
that's fine.

4374
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:54,740
The speed or wouldn't find them just,

4375
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:58,550
I worked at lower body Mosley allows
your neck problems come from your lower

4376
02:01:58,551 --> 02:01:58,761
body,

4377
02:01:58,761 --> 02:01:59,594

4378
02:01:59,810 --> 02:02:00,643

4381
02:02:04,981 --> 02:02:06,440
the hips are super tight.

4382
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,600
It's one of those guys guys.

4383
02:02:09,730 --> 02:02:11,720
You think you'd have some magical secrets?

4384
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,190
Kurt's because your ass is a swear to God.

4385
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:19,490
I got a massage and calls with the guy
wanting to put his fingers up my hands

4386
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:20,520
and you let it out.

4387
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,353
I swear to God,

4388
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,270
he told me that there's
a nerve center there.

4389
02:02:23,271 --> 02:02:23,870
The releases,

4390
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:24,290
all the muscles.

4391
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:24,890

4392
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:25,221

4393
02:02:25,221 --> 02:02:26,054
That's cool bro.

4394
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:27,280
Me,

4395
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,490
I can't hurt anybody's feelings.

4396
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:29,533
I was going,

4397
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:29,901

4398
02:02:29,901 --> 02:02:30,471
but it's cool.

4399
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:30,801
It's cool.

4400
02:02:30,801 --> 02:02:31,810
But you know what I think I'm going to,

4401

I'm good with it.

4408
02:02:38,391 --> 02:02:39,590
I just need to this part,

4409
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:42,260

Told you that.

4412
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:44,660
Huh?

4413
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:45,860
Why don't you talk about that on stage?

4414
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:46,723
It's

4415
02:02:47,770 --> 02:02:48,860
a double fingers up.

4416
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:50,300
My write up my ass like,

4417
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:51,353

4418
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,580
he gave me a massage.

4419
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:57,760
You saying he was a mysterious and then
I sat and I was my back really hurt in

4420
02:02:58,071 --> 02:02:58,530
college.

4421
02:02:58,530 --> 02:02:59,480
I had a bad back,

4422
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:00,950
so my lower back and he goes,

4423
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:01,520
he goes,

4424
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:01,690
sure.

4425
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:04,250
So he's massaging me and he's touching.

4426
02:03:04,251 --> 02:03:04,600
Everybody were,

4427
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,720
but my feet on my is weird.

4428
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:06,411
My feet,

4429
02:03:06,411 --> 02:03:06,760
I mean my,

4430
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:07,180
my back,

4431
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:08,840
where's he saw my feet,

4432
02:03:08,841 --> 02:03:09,650
my legs.

4433
02:03:09,650 --> 02:03:11,180
Then he starts talking about my ass.

4434
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:12,040
And then he goes,

4435
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:13,490
your whole lot of tension here.

4436
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:14,211
And I'm like,

4437
02:03:14,211 --> 02:03:14,631
okay,

4438
02:03:14,631 --> 02:03:15,500
this feels good though.

4439
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:17,180
He's like a massage on my glutes.

4440
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:18,351
And then he goes,

4441
02:03:18,351 --> 02:03:18,711
he goes,

4442
02:03:18,711 --> 02:03:19,371
I swear to God.

4443
02:03:19,371 --> 02:03:19,760
He goes,

4444
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,110
so now this is going to be weird.

4445
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:23,900
Maybe in the beginning
you have a nerve center,

4446
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:26,570
you have a nerve center
right next to your prostate.

4447
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,171
And he goes to,

4448
02:03:27,171 --> 02:03:28,700
what I do is I'm going
to get right up here.

4449
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:32,151
And he goes,

4450
02:03:32,151 --> 02:03:32,430
let's begin.

4451
02:03:32,430 --> 02:03:35,160
So how are they gonna run up there
with my fingers and I'm in a massage,

4452
02:03:35,161 --> 02:03:35,391
the area.

4453
02:03:35,391 --> 02:03:37,430
And what's going to happen is
you're going to let go completely,

4454
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:38,770
but you got to really let go.

4455
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:39,501
Start letting go now.

4456
02:03:39,501 --> 02:03:40,040
And I go,

4457
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:41,720
I was the that w what do you mean?

4458
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:42,620
He goes,

4459
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:43,130
I'm going to put it,

4460
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:43,760
I'm going to put it.

4461
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,240
I'm going to have to go in your anus.

4462
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:46,221
And I go,

4463
02:03:46,221 --> 02:03:46,371
no,

4464
02:03:46,371 --> 02:03:46,470
no,

4465
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:46,820
no.

4466
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:47,171
I to know.

4467
02:03:47,171 --> 02:03:48,620
And it's okay because for me,

4468
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:49,190
I'm,

4469
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:50,540
I'm more tight here.

4470
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:52,790
I go,

4471
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:52,960
oh.

4472
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,870
So I'm not used to that.

4473
02:03:53,871 --> 02:03:54,790
So that's not something

4474
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:57,490
I'm not used to.

4475
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:58,610
Yup.

4476
02:03:58,610 --> 02:03:59,990
So then I find out,

4477
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:05,280
then I find out that my buddy who is
from Jordan and I really macho dude,

4478
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,890
macho dude,

4479
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:09,500
he was Jordan and from Jordan and Germany,

4480
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:10,760
good looking guy,

4481
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:14,540
always combed his hair with a brush and
wore tight jeans and pulled his balls

4482
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:15,620
and cocked to one side.

4483
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:17,840
And he was very happy
with the character I do.

4484
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:21,260
I take this woman to my bed I
made that was based on this guy,

4485
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:22,640
and I don't want to say his name,

4486
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:22,881
but he,

4487
02:04:22,881 --> 02:04:23,210
he,

4488
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:23,720
um,

4489
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:25,940
I found out that uh,

4490
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:27,100
he up fingered,

4491
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:29,600
fingered and then he let
the do blow and he's like,

4492
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:30,650
oh man.

4493
02:04:30,651 --> 02:04:31,760
Well we were all like this.

4494
02:04:31,761 --> 02:04:32,300
We were like,

4495
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:32,541
yeah,

4496
02:04:32,541 --> 02:04:34,850
but he's from Jordan and
it's probably kind of macho.

4497
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,333
Hello

4498
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:42,000
guys.

4499
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:42,631
Not from America.

4500
02:04:42,631 --> 02:04:44,130
Maybe it's like a cultural thing.

4501
02:04:44,131 --> 02:04:44,581
Wait a minute,

4502
02:04:44,581 --> 02:04:46,440
you lift that was talking about it again.

4503
02:04:46,441 --> 02:04:48,540
He let her go a finger
your ass and then blow you.

4504
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:49,600
That is a gay,

4505
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:50,483
I would imagine.

4506
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:51,931
That's what I would say.

4507
02:04:51,931 --> 02:04:52,810
No experiment.

4508
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,380
Not to be,

4509
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:57,990
but I was in college and I
saw him have sex with a girl.

4510
02:04:57,991 --> 02:05:00,510
I had sex in a room where
you know you're younger,

4511
02:05:00,511 --> 02:05:00,781
you're like,

4512
02:05:00,781 --> 02:05:00,901
oh,

4513
02:05:00,901 --> 02:05:02,000
we can't afford a hotel room.

4514
02:05:02,001 --> 02:05:02,834
We got to share one.

4515
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:03,751
I'm having sex.

4516
02:05:03,751 --> 02:05:05,190
He's having sex with a girl,

4517
02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:06,024
do it.

4518
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:07,650
He bangs girls as well.

4519
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:08,581
Girls at guys.

4520
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:09,060
Well,

4521
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:11,760
well in hard and he was working at peace.

4522
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:13,410
I know dudes go both ways,

4523
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,010
but he left a guy blowing shit.

4524
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:16,720
Put his fingers were right up in,

4525
02:05:16,730 --> 02:05:19,500
but this is a guy who hasn't
done that in other places.

4526
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:22,140
Just did it this one time or what's that?

4527
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:23,603
Look guys,

4528
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:24,493
I don't know man.

4529
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:25,890
We didn't really talk about it after that.

4530
02:05:25,891 --> 02:05:26,340
We were like,

4531
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:27,480
that's not the first time was the one.

4532
02:05:27,481 --> 02:05:27,721
I was like,

4533
02:05:27,721 --> 02:05:28,554
you know what man,

4534
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:30,570
we'll give him a pass on the control.

4535
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:33,420
Did you find out that he
got blown up by the guy?

4536
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,353
He,

4537
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,180
the guy who did it told my buddy,

4538
02:05:36,181 --> 02:05:36,661
Dan,

4539
02:05:36,661 --> 02:05:36,991
very,

4540
02:05:36,991 --> 02:05:37,980
very confidentially,

4541
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,330
very confidentially,

4542
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,141
because Dan,

4543
02:05:40,141 --> 02:05:42,270
my buddy was Dan and I also
got fingered in the bucket.

4544
02:05:42,271 --> 02:05:44,280
Dan was a little guy and he goes,

4545
02:05:44,281 --> 02:05:46,120
she used to hang out with substrate,

4546
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:50,100
fucking tricky gay guys university.

4547
02:05:50,101 --> 02:05:51,030
And Dan goes,

4548
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,050
so dang.

4549
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:52,920
So,

4550
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:54,330
so check it out like what?

4551
02:05:54,331 --> 02:05:54,880
He goes there,

4552
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,630
a lot of people didn't hear in your
myths that have had things with guys.

4553
02:05:57,631 --> 02:05:57,990
I was like,

4554
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:58,381
like,

4555
02:05:58,381 --> 02:05:59,120
who?

4556
02:05:59,120 --> 02:05:59,461
And he goes,

4557
02:05:59,461 --> 02:06:00,720
well don't tell him back,

4558
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:01,291
told you this,

4559
02:06:01,291 --> 02:06:01,950
but blah blah blah.

4560
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:02,341
And I was like,

4561
02:06:02,341 --> 02:06:03,210
Oh man,

4562
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:04,260
there it is.

4563
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,520
But he was so macho,

4564
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:07,200
but you hold on,

4565
02:06:07,201 --> 02:06:07,380
sorry,

4566
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:08,213
go

4567
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:10,823
back it up.

4568
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:11,791
So,

4569
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:12,330
um,

4570
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:13,320
I remember these stories.

4571
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:13,560
You,

4572
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:16,890
you forget stories and he got a
guy who tried to finger your ass,

4573
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,740
hold this other God,

4574
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:21,420
this is where the fingers
ass and blow them.

4575
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:23,790
But that guy never admitted
it to anybody else.

4576
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:24,311
No Way.

4577
02:06:24,311 --> 02:06:25,650
So how do you know it's even true?

4578
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:26,371
The Guy,

4579
02:06:26,371 --> 02:06:27,240
he's a trickster.

4580
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:30,690
You said the guy wasn't even the way
he did it because he only told my other

4581
02:06:30,691 --> 02:06:32,640
friend who was gay and
was getting made him say,

4582
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:36,270
not tell anybody because he's lying.

4583
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:40,200
It could easily be because he's lying
and he's got a fantasy of blowing your

4584
02:06:40,201 --> 02:06:40,741
heart ass.

4585
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:45,360
Jordanian friend may be her story up
and then you had big tells you like it's

4586
02:06:45,361 --> 02:06:45,640
look,

4587
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:46,930
guy blows everybody good.

4588
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:47,341
Let him blow.

4589
02:06:47,341 --> 02:06:47,520
Yeah.

4590
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,353
Yeah.

4591
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:49,620
But it was next thing you know,

4592
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:52,760
the guy who was a big
secret in mice in my house,

4593
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:53,670
he didn't want the Gig.

4594
02:06:53,671 --> 02:06:56,280
I didn't want anybody to know he cause
you probably thought your friend would

4595
02:06:56,281 --> 02:06:57,114
kill him.

4596
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:58,290
The Jordanian friend.

4597
02:06:58,291 --> 02:06:58,501
I mean,

4598
02:06:58,501 --> 02:06:59,640
he's a Middle Eastern guy.

4599
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:02,340
It's very likely is it must Zeus or not?

4600
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:03,350
Yeah,

4601
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:03,890
no,

4602
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:06,150
he weak bro.

4603
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:09,133
Crew was pretty,

4604
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:12,510
I used to tell a bit about bisexuals
that I don't think they really exist.

4605
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:15,810
I think there's gay dudes and
then there's really gullible,

4606
02:07:15,811 --> 02:07:19,060
straight dudes who get talked
into blow and crafty gay dude,

4607
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:23,250
this guy is like making my act real.

4608
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,030
That's probably true.

4609
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:25,530
That's what a bisexual is.

4610
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:28,360
There's guys who just crafty as fuck.

4611
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:29,490
My friend Jimmy used to say,

4612
02:07:29,491 --> 02:07:30,324
they're just greedy.

4613
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:31,253
That's what he used to say.

4614
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:33,510
Bisexual is their fucking greedy.

4615
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:34,151
He goes,

4616
02:07:34,151 --> 02:07:35,140
if you just create each one,

4617
02:07:35,141 --> 02:07:35,590
everything,

4618
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,390
eh.

4619
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:37,240
Gimme gimme

4620
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:43,090
gimme gimme pick a team.

4621
02:07:43,110 --> 02:07:44,590
He just liked attractive people.

4622
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:45,670
Well,

4623
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:46,510
does guy,

4624
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:46,990
um,

4625
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:48,180
do you still Facebook?

4626
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:50,200
No.

4627
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:54,160
Over how did you end up
sparring session on the massage?

4628
02:07:54,161 --> 02:07:55,090
They just gave me,

4629
02:07:55,091 --> 02:07:56,710
he finished it up and they said,

4630
02:07:56,711 --> 02:07:57,544
well,

4631
02:07:57,790 --> 02:07:58,121
he goes,

4632
02:07:58,121 --> 02:07:58,690
he goes back.

4633
02:07:58,690 --> 02:07:59,021
He goes,

4634
02:07:59,021 --> 02:07:59,291
he goes,

4635
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:00,124
I messed it up.

4636
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:00,281
Well,

4637
02:08:00,281 --> 02:08:01,090
we did it for awhile,

4638
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:02,320
but he charged them what?

4639
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:02,981
He goes,

4640
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:03,371
he goes,

4641
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:07,120
it's something you have to work
up to and it's something that I,

4642
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,340
I think I can read almost
had you for a little bit.

4643
02:08:09,341 --> 02:08:09,641
We were like,

4644
02:08:09,641 --> 02:08:09,810
yeah,

4645
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:10,690
maybe I,

4646
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:11,381
I was like,

4647
02:08:11,381 --> 02:08:12,490
that would be weird.

4648
02:08:12,491 --> 02:08:13,390
How would I do that?

4649
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:17,501
Wait,

4650
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:18,640
I'm going to tell you something else.

4651
02:08:19,190 --> 02:08:20,710
I'm making this up now that I remember it.

4652
02:08:20,711 --> 02:08:21,780
I blocked some of it actually

4653
02:08:23,650 --> 02:08:25,310
he did massage my tank.

4654
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:30,490
[inaudible] I swear to God he massage
that area because he told me that area is

4655
02:08:31,691 --> 02:08:33,070
where a lot of tension and I was like,

4656
02:08:33,071 --> 02:08:34,030
this is awful.

4657
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:35,700
I remember my toes kept pointing.

4658
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:36,740
I don't know.

4659
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:37,260
I was like,

4660
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,093
Oh,

4661
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:39,380
oh,

4662
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:40,171
oh God.

4663
02:08:40,171 --> 02:08:43,270
I feel bad with confrontation.

4664
02:08:43,271 --> 02:08:45,250
I didn't want to be employed
so I just thought it happen.

4665
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:45,610
Yeah.

4666
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:45,930
I was like,

4667
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:46,041
Oh,

4668
02:08:46,041 --> 02:08:46,840
I'm good man.

4669
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:47,590
That's cool.

4670
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:48,281
My lower back,

4671
02:08:48,281 --> 02:08:50,990
I get pointed in my lower back
muscles that were over here.

4672
02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:55,690
Jokes come from probably
that's all I do on your tape.

4673
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:57,340
You got to do besides your team.

4674
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,510
She have been picked up.

4675
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:02,150
I haven't had a bad back problems
since you've been picked up for cross.

4676
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:03,910
He got arrested for prostitution.

4677
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:04,923
When

4678
02:09:06,460 --> 02:09:08,470
I don't eat crackers,

4679
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:09,670
the crackers.

4680
02:09:09,670 --> 02:09:10,450
I was um,

4681
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:11,170
this is great.

4682
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:12,340
I just felt the other day,

4683
02:09:12,341 --> 02:09:13,690
but everybody thinks that it was fighting,

4684
02:09:13,691 --> 02:09:14,101
so I was like,

4685
02:09:14,101 --> 02:09:14,861
people like you got arrested?

4686
02:09:14,861 --> 02:09:15,191
Yeah,

4687
02:09:15,191 --> 02:09:15,551
why?

4688
02:09:15,551 --> 02:09:16,211
I was fighting.

4689
02:09:16,211 --> 02:09:17,200
I have a whole story about it.

4690
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,570
Prostitution up.

4691
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:19,210
Well,

4692
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:19,931
no it wasn't,

4693
02:09:19,931 --> 02:09:21,040
but that wasn't,

4694
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,870
I was not trying to pick up prostitutes.

4695
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:25,370
I'm see the story that you
tell me what he was doing it,

4696
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:26,980
I have paid for sex.

4697
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:27,221
Now.

4698
02:09:27,221 --> 02:09:29,110
Anyone who knows me knows
that and I believe in it.

4699
02:09:29,111 --> 02:09:29,944
I just haven't done it.

4700
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:31,330
I believe it,

4701
02:09:31,331 --> 02:09:31,781
believe in it.

4702
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:33,160
I think it really does exist.

4703
02:09:33,161 --> 02:09:34,210
It's not Santa Claus.

4704
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:34,930
That's true.

4705
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:35,281
And,

4706
02:09:35,281 --> 02:09:36,310
and I don't do it.

4707
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:39,250
I don't do it in my adult
years because I don't want to.

4708
02:09:39,610 --> 02:09:40,020
I don't,

4709
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:40,151
I,

4710
02:09:40,151 --> 02:09:40,871
it doesn't turn me on.

4711
02:09:40,871 --> 02:09:41,710
And for a lot of reasons,

4712
02:09:41,711 --> 02:09:42,640
I just don't want to be part of it.

4713
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:43,473
But you're married.

4714
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:44,020
Well,

4715
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:44,231
yeah,

4716
02:09:44,231 --> 02:09:45,041
but even if I wasn't married,

4717
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:47,290
I wouldn't do it because
I have my own spot.

4718
02:09:47,630 --> 02:09:49,450
You want someone to be attracted to?

4719
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:51,610
You don't know what it is.

4720
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:54,790
I don't want to contribute to
someone else's destruction.

4721
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:55,601
There are a lot of reasons.

4722
02:09:55,601 --> 02:09:56,560
I have a philosophy behind it.

4723
02:09:56,561 --> 02:09:57,120
It doesn't matter.

4724
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:57,470
But,

4725
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:57,800
but,

4726
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:58,390
um,

4727
02:09:58,390 --> 02:09:59,380
I come out of,

4728
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:00,130
uh,

4729
02:10:00,130 --> 02:10:01,030
Jimmy Burke's apartment.

4730
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,100
It's late at night.

4731
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,570
I am literally been on a plane and I,

4732
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:06,160
these,

4733
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:11,160
these two blondes were in a car and I
look in and I go and they go high and I

4734
02:10:11,201 --> 02:10:11,450
go,

4735
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:12,283
hi,

4736
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:13,460
what are you doing?

4737
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:13,811
I go,

4738
02:10:13,811 --> 02:10:14,330
not much,

4739
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:14,800
and Emilia,

4740
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:15,100
I'm like,

4741
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:15,490
hmm,

4742
02:10:15,490 --> 02:10:16,323
interesting.

4743
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:16,871
And I figured,

4744
02:10:16,871 --> 02:10:17,080
man,

4745
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:18,940
I think I don't know what
they look kind of Hungary.

4746
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:19,211
And they go,

4747
02:10:19,211 --> 02:10:20,470
you want to have a good time nine ago?

4748
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:21,580
How much?

4749
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:22,683
And they go,

4750
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:23,350
how much do you have?

4751
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:23,750
And I go,

4752
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:24,370
I don't know,

4753
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:27,040
$5,000 how's that sound like?

4754
02:10:27,041 --> 02:10:27,641
That's silly.

4755
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:28,000
Right?

4756
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:28,630
Right.

4757
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:29,920
So they go,

4758
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:30,791
sounds great.

4759
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:31,541
We'll be right here.

4760
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:31,871
I go,

4761
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:32,620
okay,

4762
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:37,320
I'm going to go right to the bank machine
and she can't give five now that can

4763
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:40,730
be seen by the way to get to cash.

4764
02:10:40,731 --> 02:10:42,860
I had no cash to get in a cab and go home.

4765
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:43,843
Guess what?

4766
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:44,601
I go to the bank,

4767
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:46,130
Shane guess was waiting for me.

4768
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:47,060
Bunch of cops.

4769
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,200
Guess what those calls were?

4770
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:49,010
Cops.

4771
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:52,850
It was a sting operation and they
caught me and I looked the cubs and go,

4772
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,170
you guys are really going to arrest me.

4773
02:10:54,171 --> 02:10:54,561
I said,

4774
02:10:54,561 --> 02:10:55,760
$5,000 guy goes,

4775
02:10:55,761 --> 02:10:55,971
yeah,

4776
02:10:55,971 --> 02:10:56,491
I know that.

4777
02:10:56,491 --> 02:10:57,051
Here's the problem.

4778
02:10:57,051 --> 02:10:58,060
You got caught up in the suite.

4779
02:10:58,061 --> 02:11:00,890
We've got to take in sat next to a guy
who was dressed like a woman who was

4780
02:11:00,891 --> 02:11:04,340
trying to pick up women and
he was peeling his knee.

4781
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:05,450
He was so nervous.

4782
02:11:05,451 --> 02:11:07,850
He was peeling his a nail Polish off.

4783
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:09,650
I spent two days in jail.

4784
02:11:09,651 --> 02:11:10,640
It was a lot of fun and I

4785
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:17,740
thank God there were there to protect
and serve and a class for John's for um,

4786
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:22,370
where I had to go to a class for a,

4787
02:11:22,430 --> 02:11:23,120
you know,

4788
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:23,661
whatever.

4789
02:11:23,661 --> 02:11:24,141
Like you know,

4790
02:11:24,141 --> 02:11:25,250
for John John's,

4791
02:11:25,251 --> 02:11:27,770
for people that this is also a story
you should be telling on stage.

4792
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:28,653
Right.

4793
02:11:29,310 --> 02:11:30,580
Kind of funny way to do it.

4794
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:31,101
Well,

4795
02:11:31,101 --> 02:11:33,090
it's just unbelievable.

4796
02:11:33,091 --> 02:11:33,270
Yeah.

4797
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:33,641
Busted.

4798
02:11:33,641 --> 02:11:34,700
Trying to pick up prostitutes.

4799
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:39,701
Someone can what come up to you and ask
you if you want to have a good time and

4800
02:11:40,461 --> 02:11:42,500
then when you respond to that.

4801
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:45,050
But especially to show the cops were cool.

4802
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:45,381
They were like,

4803
02:11:45,381 --> 02:11:46,100
Bro,

4804
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:47,300
I mean look for me,

4805
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:48,380
by all means,

4806
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:49,070
I get it.

4807
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:52,340
The problem is you got caught up
in the sweep in and they were like,

4808
02:11:52,341 --> 02:11:53,000
don't worry about it.

4809
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:53,330
They're like,

4810
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:54,890
it'd be knocked down to
a misdemeanor just to,

4811
02:11:54,891 --> 02:11:55,620
it's a pain in the ass.

4812
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:55,851
I know.

4813
02:11:55,851 --> 02:11:56,511
They were all cool.

4814
02:11:56,511 --> 02:11:56,751
I mean,

4815
02:11:56,751 --> 02:11:56,931
you know,

4816
02:11:56,931 --> 02:11:57,190
but,

4817
02:11:57,190 --> 02:11:58,520
but you were in jail for two days.

4818
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:03,530
That's not a misdemeanor and I had to
make up a story up next to you in a car

4819
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:04,610
and say shit like that.

4820
02:12:04,611 --> 02:12:06,110
You got to know that they'll park.

4821
02:12:06,190 --> 02:12:07,460
They were parked like music,

4822
02:12:07,461 --> 02:12:08,271
video type shit.

4823
02:12:08,271 --> 02:12:09,320
That shit don't exist.

4824
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:10,400
It does exist though.

4825
02:12:10,401 --> 02:12:14,630
That's the problem you hear about and
fucking penthouse letters and maybe this

4826
02:12:14,631 --> 02:12:18,500
is the time I was getting married the
next day or something and my wedding would

4827
02:12:18,501 --> 02:12:18,891
be over.

4828
02:12:18,891 --> 02:12:21,560
I mean there's all kinds of shit
I just learned when girls go,

4829
02:12:21,561 --> 02:12:21,681
Oh,

4830
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:22,514
you want a party?

4831
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:25,900
They're not talking about
dancing to some tunes as well.

4832
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:26,743
Do a little drugs.

4833
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:29,480
Hats with rubber bands at the bottom.

4834
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:29,960
Yeah,

4835
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:33,980
they're not talking about
celebrate two times in Vegas.

4836
02:12:33,981 --> 02:12:34,340
I got,

4837
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:36,350
I got had with a girl,

4838
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:37,100
met her.

4839
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:37,881
She's cute.

4840
02:12:37,881 --> 02:12:38,541
We're talking,

4841
02:12:38,541 --> 02:12:43,190
hanging out gets get upstairs and we
started kissing and she goes and I started

4842
02:12:43,191 --> 02:12:43,401
moving.

4843
02:12:43,401 --> 02:12:43,730
She goes,

4844
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:44,151
oh wait,

4845
02:12:44,151 --> 02:12:44,751
hold on,

4846
02:12:44,751 --> 02:12:45,590
hold on.

4847
02:12:45,650 --> 02:12:47,390
You have no idea how
much fun this could be,

4848
02:12:47,391 --> 02:12:48,620
but nothing's free.

4849
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:49,340
I was like,

4850
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:50,111
aw,

4851
02:12:50,111 --> 02:12:50,944
you got me.

4852
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:52,190
Then another girl,

4853
02:12:52,191 --> 02:12:53,170
we were hanging dancing,

4854
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:53,720
beautiful,

4855
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:54,501
having a great time.

4856
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:55,334
Kissy Kissy,

4857
02:12:55,410 --> 02:12:56,600
go to my room and she goes,

4858
02:12:57,020 --> 02:12:57,201
oh,

4859
02:12:57,201 --> 02:12:58,460
the problem is I have to go to work.

4860
02:12:58,461 --> 02:12:58,761
I go,

4861
02:12:58,761 --> 02:12:59,271
oh wow.

4862
02:12:59,271 --> 02:13:00,470
What do you mean what didn't work where?

4863
02:13:00,471 --> 02:13:01,304
Almost like meg.

4864
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:01,880
She goes,

4865
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:02,211
well,

4866
02:13:02,211 --> 02:13:03,570
it cost me $1,000 you know,

4867
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:04,061
I'll lose it.

4868
02:13:04,061 --> 02:13:05,780
Thousand dollars tonight if I don't dance.

4869
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:06,621
I was like,

4870
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:08,690
you want $1,000 I kicked
her out of my room.

4871
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,100
You 100% gave her.

4872
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:10,690
I didn't.

4873
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:11,523
I was like,

4874
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:13,160
I really didn't.

4875
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:13,581
I'd be like,

4876
02:13:13,581 --> 02:13:13,821
you know what?

4877
02:13:13,821 --> 02:13:14,550
I'm just going to grow.

4878
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:16,640
We take check and of course she like,

4879
02:13:16,641 --> 02:13:16,770
no,

4880
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:17,720
actually take credit cards.

4881
02:13:17,721 --> 02:13:18,850
I didn't like the way she did it.

4882
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:21,530
I just didn't like the way she was
trying to pull a fast one on me.

4883
02:13:21,890 --> 02:13:23,240
That is hilarious.

4884
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:23,541
I was like,

4885
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:24,830
you gotta be careful these days.

4886
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:26,030
These hoes ain't loyal

4887
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:31,870
their John.

4888
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:32,953
You know,

4889
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:34,453
John,

4890
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:38,760
my real problem with all of it is
when you make something illegal,

4891
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:43,770
it puts all this extra energy in
something because you create consequences.

4892
02:13:43,771 --> 02:13:46,830
The consequences being
you could go to jail,

4893
02:13:46,831 --> 02:13:47,790
crime,

4894
02:13:47,791 --> 02:13:48,210
you know,

4895
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:49,830
all sorts of issues can happen.

4896
02:13:49,950 --> 02:13:50,311
It's a,

4897
02:13:50,311 --> 02:13:50,910
is it a,

4898
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:51,840
it's a misdemeanor.

4899
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:52,770
So as a prostitution,

4900
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:53,100
right,

4901
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:54,000
that's not a felonies.

4902
02:13:54,001 --> 02:13:57,930
She still get knocked down to carry
a gun and you could still vote,

4903
02:13:57,931 --> 02:13:58,764
but either way,

4904
02:13:58,950 --> 02:13:59,990
the idea behind her,

4905
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:03,030
they're taking what your freedom
and putting you in the system.

4906
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:06,230
You also probably have to register
as some sort of a sex offender

4907
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,560
dates.

4908
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:09,160
You do.

4909
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:11,940
I had a bed in some states
in Calabasas for sure.

4910
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:13,141
For sure.

4911
02:14:13,141 --> 02:14:15,000
You're not a street man.

4912
02:14:15,001 --> 02:14:17,100
I mean it depends on what
the fuck you're doing.

4913
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:17,461
You know,

4914
02:14:17,461 --> 02:14:19,950
like what are you doing with the
prostitute and you get this figured out.

4915
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:22,960
You're still making a fire from your
job and kind of big consequences.

4916
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:27,120
Here's the point is in countries like
Australia where they have legalized

4917
02:14:27,121 --> 02:14:27,954
prostitution,

4918
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:29,880
they're divorce rate is way lower.

4919
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:30,550
Sure.

4920
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:35,550
They don't have like all this
violent crime and prostitution need.

4921
02:14:36,301 --> 02:14:37,134
First of all the,

4922
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:38,670
with the violent crime,

4923
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:40,230
they don't need John's.

4924
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:40,980
Okay.

4925
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:44,820
They work in these places where they
have security to get people tested.

4926
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:46,380
When people walk through the door,

4927
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:46,981
they know,

4928
02:14:46,981 --> 02:14:48,390
you know they take their id.

4929
02:14:48,391 --> 02:14:49,320
Sounds like the way to go.

4930
02:14:49,730 --> 02:14:50,940
We're going to do it regardless.

4931
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:56,260
It show me GP legal fuck someone for free,

4932
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:57,653
which it is.

4933
02:14:57,690 --> 02:15:00,480
Why isn't it legal to
fuck someone for money?

4934
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:01,373
What's the difference?

4935
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:05,580
If it's legal to give
someone a massage for money,

4936
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:10,760
why isn't it legal to stick to [inaudible]
guys consensual and all free him free

4937
02:15:11,221 --> 02:15:15,390
me to consensual adults and
all my nerve endings are,

4938
02:15:15,391 --> 02:15:19,350
they're two consenting adults in all
my nerve endings and I want to relax.

4939
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:24,620
I can't let the guy problems jam his
ring finger right up my shit or strong

4940
02:15:25,201 --> 02:15:26,820
lower back issue I do.

4941
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:30,820
You can't have him jam his ring finger
and his middle finger right up my shit or

4942
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:31,500
yeah,

4943
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,370
couple of digits.

4944
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:34,100
No matter what that opening again,

4945
02:15:34,350 --> 02:15:35,280
three knucks deep.

4946
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:35,821
Well it's,

4947
02:15:35,821 --> 02:15:36,061
it's,

4948
02:15:36,061 --> 02:15:38,160
I always bring it back to if there was,

4949
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:39,090
if this room,

4950
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:40,530
okay the five of us in this room,

4951
02:15:40,531 --> 02:15:44,040
if we were the only
people on earth and uh,

4952
02:15:44,041 --> 02:15:47,190
for whatever reason and then you know
the people and there was like four of the

4953
02:15:47,191 --> 02:15:49,440
prostitutes and you know,

4954
02:15:49,441 --> 02:15:54,210
w w would one of us arrest the other
one and lock us in jail for having sex

4955
02:15:54,211 --> 02:15:54,530
aside.

4956
02:15:54,530 --> 02:15:56,320
How new laws the law about the restaurant,

4957
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:58,710
about how crazy that would
be if it was four of us.

4958
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:00,210
And one of us said,

4959
02:16:00,211 --> 02:16:00,741
I mean it was really,

4960
02:16:00,741 --> 02:16:03,990
you only met on the planet and what we
found out Brent and found out that you

4961
02:16:03,991 --> 02:16:05,880
were having sex with
prostitutes and he's like,

4962
02:16:05,881 --> 02:16:07,080
I've got to bring in Bro,

4963
02:16:07,081 --> 02:16:07,611
I got to bring you.

4964
02:16:07,611 --> 02:16:07,951
And you're like,

4965
02:16:07,951 --> 02:16:08,590
what?

4966
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:12,030
He's got some crazy cage set
up with bamboo fucking bars,

4967
02:16:12,150 --> 02:16:15,360
some fucking lost cage
on an island somewhere.

4968
02:16:15,361 --> 02:16:18,630
Cause we're the only people like you
can't have prostitution in the civilized

4969
02:16:18,631 --> 02:16:19,200
world.

4970
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:19,920
That's it.

4971
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:20,071
Well,

4972
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:21,090
it's just as ridiculous.

4973
02:16:21,091 --> 02:16:22,320
If there's 400 million,

4974
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:25,860
it's just as ridiculous a grown
adult telling another grown adult,

4975
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:27,720
whether it's male or female,

4976
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:30,190
what they can do or do that harms

4977
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:30,730
no one.

4978
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:34,510
The woman makes a decision whether for
whatever reason decides she wants to have

4979
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:36,460
sex with a man and she
wants to get paid for it.

4980
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:37,990
The man makes a decision.

4981
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:38,890
He decides,

4982
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:40,300
I'm tired of dealing with this bullshit.

4983
02:16:40,301 --> 02:16:41,440
I don't want a relationship.

4984
02:16:41,441 --> 02:16:42,670
I just want to pay for sex.

4985
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:43,713
And these women,

4986
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:46,210
they pretend that they liked
me and they really don't.

4987
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:47,440
So I'll just give them what they want.

4988
02:16:47,441 --> 02:16:48,220
Which is money,

4989
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:48,520
right?

4990
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:51,100
That for guys who are unattractive,

4991
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:53,920
that is the only way bang hot shit.

4992
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:55,090
It's easier to control.

4993
02:16:55,230 --> 02:16:56,220
And there's nothing wrong with that.

4994
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,280
Have a personality.

4995
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:01,360
It's easier to control people even that
are married with kids than single dudes

4996
02:17:01,361 --> 02:17:02,230
banging prostitutes.

4997
02:17:02,231 --> 02:17:03,370
You can't control those dudes.

4998
02:17:03,371 --> 02:17:03,820
Yeah,

4999
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:04,271
you can't.

5000
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:05,710
So you've got to make that shit illegal.

5001
02:17:05,890 --> 02:17:06,700
It's amazing.

5002
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:07,141
Amazing.

5003
02:17:07,141 --> 02:17:07,690
It's illegal.

5004
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:08,291
It's amazing.

5005
02:17:08,291 --> 02:17:09,430
It's a pure technical law.

5006
02:17:09,610 --> 02:17:10,600
It goes back to,

5007
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:11,200
you know,

5008
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:11,831
it's stupid.

5009
02:17:11,831 --> 02:17:12,820
It's a stupid law.

5010
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:13,901
This is,

5011
02:17:13,901 --> 02:17:14,141
you know,

5012
02:17:14,141 --> 02:17:16,840
you don't want your daughter
Toby man doing prostitution.

5013
02:17:16,841 --> 02:17:18,220
I don't want my daughter
doing prostitution.

5014
02:17:18,430 --> 02:17:23,140
But the reality is people are
going to have sex with people.

5015
02:17:23,141 --> 02:17:26,500
And one of the reasons why prostitution
has a stigma attached to it is the

5016
02:17:26,501 --> 02:17:27,640
legality of it.

5017
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:29,440
That's the one of the main reasons.

5018
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:32,440
It's just we're all for it.

5019
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:34,320
We're fucking weird with sex man.

5020
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:36,880
Varying things always happened.

5021
02:17:36,881 --> 02:17:37,960
I think it goes back though,

5022
02:17:37,961 --> 02:17:42,610
I think it goes back to the kinds of
diseases we didn't have cures for.

5023
02:17:42,611 --> 02:17:45,610
I think about antibiotics only
been around for about 60 years,

5024
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:46,990
maybe even less.

5025
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:47,580
I mean,

5026
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,200
when you got syphilis and gonorrhea
and you got other diseases,

5027
02:17:50,201 --> 02:17:51,970
it was no joke.

5028
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,400
Oh No,

5029
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:53,051
no one knew.

5030
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:54,760
If you're a stigma,

5031
02:17:54,761 --> 02:17:55,990
there was a stigma too.

5032
02:17:55,990 --> 02:17:56,920
Especially syphilis.

5033
02:17:56,921 --> 02:17:57,754
She went crazy.

5034
02:17:58,030 --> 02:17:58,630
I mean,

5035
02:17:58,630 --> 02:17:59,381
I mean you did.

5036
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:01,840
I mean there was a stigma to sexual,

5037
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:02,853
uh,

5038
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:07,390
liberal sexual activity
because it was in many cases,

5039
02:18:07,391 --> 02:18:11,830
very unhealthy in the way these systems
in like some kind of institution.

5040
02:18:11,831 --> 02:18:12,011
Well,

5041
02:18:12,011 --> 02:18:12,521
that's what happened.

5042
02:18:12,521 --> 02:18:13,354
How could you do?

5043
02:18:13,370 --> 02:18:15,160
That's what happened at
alcohol and people die.

5044
02:18:15,190 --> 02:18:16,060
What happened in Nietzsche,

5045
02:18:16,061 --> 02:18:17,370
Nietzsche would became simplitic.

5046
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:19,300
I mean a lot of things,

5047
02:18:19,350 --> 02:18:20,183
modern days,

5048
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,820
celebrities coming down with,

5049
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,530
well now they hit you with antibiotics.

5050
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:25,060
Penicillin actually
clears it up right away.

5051
02:18:25,061 --> 02:18:25,900
You got a shot in your ass.

5052
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:27,340
They can cure that shit quick.

5053
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,500
But until penicillin came along,

5054
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:34,690
syphilis was awful because what happened
was you would get Soren from your deck.

5055
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:36,040
No,

5056
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:36,870
I don't think so.

5057
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:39,050
So on the end of your deck
and then you would go then,

5058
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,960
then incubate for a long time,

5059
02:18:40,961 --> 02:18:43,240
like 10 years and then you would
start to lose your fucking mind.

5060
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:45,400
There's no way can incubator
for 10 fucking years.

5061
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:46,411
There is a way in.

5062
02:18:46,411 --> 02:18:47,244
It did.

5063
02:18:47,530 --> 02:18:48,363
There's a lot of,

5064
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:51,790
there's a lot know about it could
be in your body for a long time.

5065
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:52,510
Yeah.

5066
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:56,200
That was the thing about HIV was that
the incubation people see the incubation

5067
02:18:56,201 --> 02:18:57,730
period is what scared the fuck out of it.

5068
02:18:57,731 --> 02:18:59,510
What about that teaching is on HIV counts.

5069
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:01,900
Really interesting because of the
protease inhibitors and stuff.

5070
02:19:01,901 --> 02:19:06,490
It's had to mutate so many times that it
actually has weakened itself that make

5071
02:19:06,491 --> 02:19:07,540
so many compromises.

5072
02:19:07,810 --> 02:19:09,150
You born at a time come it,

5073
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:09,460
right?

5074
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:10,211
No HIV,

5075
02:19:10,211 --> 02:19:10,761
you're straight.

5076
02:19:10,761 --> 02:19:15,340
You believe that Michael Jordan's the
virus is actually weakened over time.

5077
02:19:15,341 --> 02:19:18,880
You have to listen to this radio
lab podcast called patient zero.

5078
02:19:18,881 --> 02:19:20,650
It's fucking amazing.

5079
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:25,680
It's amazing because they
tracked HIV from the top.

5080
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:28,070
They used to have this guy
they thought was patient

5081
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,640
zero.

5082
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:32,000
He was a gay guy that was having sex
with all these people and he knew that he

5083
02:19:32,001 --> 02:19:37,001
was infected with it was the early days
of aids in America for like in the 1980s

5084
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:41,300
and everybody thought this guy was patient
zero and he was infecting all these

5085
02:19:41,301 --> 02:19:41,810
people.

5086
02:19:41,810 --> 02:19:44,090
Then they found out they
trace the lineage back.

5087
02:19:44,091 --> 02:19:45,470
I want to encourage everybody,

5088
02:19:45,471 --> 02:19:48,020
if you haven't listened to radio lab,

5089
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:50,750
it's a fucking amazing podcast.

5090
02:19:50,751 --> 02:19:51,920
It's so good.

5091
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:56,570
It's so consistently good and really
well produced and really well edited.

5092
02:19:56,571 --> 02:19:57,440
It's genius.

5093
02:19:57,770 --> 02:19:59,060
And they had this,

5094
02:19:59,061 --> 02:19:59,570
um,

5095
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:00,170
this,

5096
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:01,400
these doctors,

5097
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:04,940
the scientists that
traced the lineage of the,

5098
02:20:04,941 --> 02:20:05,330
the,

5099
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:06,163
the disease,

5100
02:20:06,290 --> 02:20:09,900
they brought it all the way back
to the early 19 hundreds monkeys,

5101
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:11,233
well the rig,

5102
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:11,581
they will,

5103
02:20:11,581 --> 02:20:11,721
will,

5104
02:20:11,721 --> 02:20:15,530
they brought it all the way back to the
early 19 hundreds in America and then

5105
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:17,320
they brought it all the way back to uh,

5106
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:19,580
even earlier than that in Africa.

5107
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,500
It came from a hunter and the,

5108
02:20:21,501 --> 02:20:25,820
the number one theory is a cut hunter
like a hunter because in Africa they kill

5109
02:20:25,821 --> 02:20:26,631
a lot of monkeys.

5110
02:20:26,631 --> 02:20:27,770
They eat them,

5111
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:28,161
you know,

5112
02:20:28,161 --> 02:20:28,301
their,

5113
02:20:28,301 --> 02:20:29,240
they call it Bushmeat,

5114
02:20:29,241 --> 02:20:34,241
they'll kill monkeys and chimps and
that someone killed a monkey or a chimp.

5115
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:35,570
And that champ,

5116
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,830
as they were cutting it,

5117
02:20:36,831 --> 02:20:41,240
they cut themselves and they got the
blood in the cut and that chimp had killed

5118
02:20:41,241 --> 02:20:45,740
a neat and two different types of
monkeys that had two different types of

5119
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:47,210
infectious diseases.

5120
02:20:47,270 --> 02:20:49,020
So different types of virus,

5121
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:52,400
two different types of
immune if immunodeficiency,

5122
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:53,210
diseases.

5123
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:58,210
And those two mutated inside that chimps
body and then got into a person and

5124
02:20:58,311 --> 02:21:02,600
then it became loud and know how hard
that is to believe that they nailed that

5125
02:21:02,601 --> 02:21:03,590
shit down to subdue,

5126
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:04,770
to go listen.

5127
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:07,760
If you listen to the podcast,

5128
02:21:07,761 --> 02:21:09,470
they explain the lineage,

5129
02:21:09,471 --> 02:21:11,420
they explain how they did it is,

5130
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:12,520
and it is fascinating.

5131
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:13,281
Also isolated.

5132
02:21:13,281 --> 02:21:13,680
Yeah.

5133
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:14,650
Which I thought was fascinating.

5134
02:21:14,651 --> 02:21:16,900
Why didn't HIV,

5135
02:21:16,901 --> 02:21:18,280
why was it a disease,

5136
02:21:18,281 --> 02:21:22,020
a heterosexual disease in Africa and not
an in among your northern Europeans and

5137
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:22,960
Europeans in general?

5138
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:23,291
Well,

5139
02:21:23,291 --> 02:21:23,981
it didn't make any sense.

5140
02:21:23,981 --> 02:21:26,620
They kept thinking as our
secondary infections and
stuff and what they found was

5141
02:21:26,621 --> 02:21:28,960
that anybody of European lineage,

5142
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:29,651
black plague,

5143
02:21:29,651 --> 02:21:29,801
right?

5144
02:21:29,801 --> 02:21:30,430
Yeah.

5145
02:21:30,430 --> 02:21:31,600
If you survive the black played,

5146
02:21:31,601 --> 02:21:35,440
you had a mutation in your gene that
made you resistance to the HIV virus,

5147
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:38,110
which is wild and they've isolated that.

5148
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:43,270
And so what's really wild is like I'm
always encouraged people to read a book

5149
02:21:43,271 --> 02:21:44,590
called why evolution is true.

5150
02:21:44,591 --> 02:21:49,591
Evolution is true by Jerry Coyne and
he's at an evolutionary biologist and a

5151
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:50,711
man.

5152
02:21:50,711 --> 02:21:53,230
When you really look at the science
of how they isolate these things.

5153
02:21:53,231 --> 02:21:57,880
When they look at the genome and they
look at like what they can read on a gene

5154
02:21:58,060 --> 02:21:58,811
like viruses,

5155
02:21:58,811 --> 02:22:00,520
that word that that were dormant,

5156
02:22:00,670 --> 02:22:01,171
that you,

5157
02:22:01,171 --> 02:22:03,240
you share the same kind
of viruses that uh,

5158
02:22:03,350 --> 02:22:03,700
you're,

5159
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:04,720
you're like ancestors,

5160
02:22:04,721 --> 02:22:07,420
your monkey ancestors did
really fascinating stuff.

5161
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:09,850
The overwhelming evidence,

5162
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:12,430
like as we learn more about evolution,

5163
02:22:12,431 --> 02:22:13,480
it becomes more true,

5164
02:22:13,481 --> 02:22:14,171
not less true,

5165
02:22:14,171 --> 02:22:15,340
which is fascinating to me.

5166
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,071
So there,

5167
02:22:16,071 --> 02:22:18,640
there are a lot of things
when then evolution,

5168
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:21,370
but the whole HIV thing,

5169
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:21,670
you know,

5170
02:22:21,670 --> 02:22:24,270
I listened to Duisburg and that guy,

5171
02:22:24,271 --> 02:22:25,530
rex is a good for him.

5172
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:26,460
Yeah.

5173
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:26,731
Yeah.

5174
02:22:26,731 --> 02:22:27,370
You know what man?

5175
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:27,890
A lot of sense.

5176
02:22:27,890 --> 02:22:28,110
Yeah.

5177
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:28,741
But here's the problem.

5178
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:30,150
It doesn't make sense to biologist,

5179
02:22:30,180 --> 02:22:31,120
not a biologist.

5180
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:32,990
He doesn't make sense to viral ologists.

5181
02:22:33,210 --> 02:22:36,120
He doesn't make sense to any of the
researchers that have been working for

5182
02:22:36,121 --> 02:22:36,954
decades.

5183
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:38,250
If it was a really,

5184
02:22:38,251 --> 02:22:41,520
I thought I was with you before I talked
to Duisburg and then talk to other

5185
02:22:41,521 --> 02:22:42,450
scientists about it.

5186
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:47,840
And if it was a real issue where they
really couldn't understand the differences

5187
02:22:47,911 --> 02:22:52,080
between with Duesberg was saying and
with other biologists are saying it would

5188
02:22:52,081 --> 02:22:52,800
make sense,

5189
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:53,421
but it's,

5190
02:22:53,421 --> 02:22:54,061
it's out there.

5191
02:22:54,061 --> 02:22:56,550
All the information's out
there and it's hotly disputed.

5192
02:22:56,551 --> 02:23:01,170
Like Duesberg is wrong about so many
different things about how viruses behave

5193
02:23:01,171 --> 02:23:05,010
and about HIV in general
on a specialty man.

5194
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:05,491
Yeah.

5195
02:23:05,491 --> 02:23:05,760
It's,

5196
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:09,360
I'm pretty convinced that he made some
pretty critical errors in the early days

5197
02:23:09,361 --> 02:23:13,690
of HIV and then stayed with
that also testify with Maddie.

5198
02:23:13,691 --> 02:23:13,861
Yes.

5199
02:23:13,861 --> 02:23:14,131
Wrath.

5200
02:23:14,131 --> 02:23:14,351
Matty.

5201
02:23:14,351 --> 02:23:19,110
His wrath who was pushing his vitamins
on South Africans and telling them not to

5202
02:23:19,111 --> 02:23:20,360
go with regular um,

5203
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:20,900
uh,

5204
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:22,710
produce protocols and he said,

5205
02:23:22,711 --> 02:23:25,860
take my vitamins and that's
how you'll cure your disease.

5206
02:23:25,861 --> 02:23:30,861
HIV and Duesberg was with him when he
testified and you can see the people in

5207
02:23:31,330 --> 02:23:31,540
that.

5208
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:34,030
They were talking about the people that
working on the ground with these things

5209
02:23:34,031 --> 02:23:35,130
and they were like
shaking their head going,

5210
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:35,973
this guy has an ego.

5211
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:37,020
He just flew in.

5212
02:23:37,021 --> 02:23:38,400
He has no idea what we're dealing with.

5213
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:39,210
He doesn't know.

5214
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:41,520
He's just not see what we're
dealing with on the ground.

5215
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:44,910
He doesn't see the kind of the kind
of disaster we're dealing with.

5216
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:49,860
The health crisis disaster and watching
people die and get sick and stuff and

5217
02:23:49,861 --> 02:23:54,550
this Guy Duesberg is coming
in and testifying that
that wells well of Duisburg

5218
02:23:54,551 --> 02:23:55,384
is wrong.

5219
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:58,770
Then we basically stopped aids,

5220
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:01,370
like aids was going to be a
thing that affected in the nut.

5221
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:04,590
If the in the 80s when you heard
all the predictions one out,

5222
02:24:04,591 --> 02:24:09,591
a lot of people are hit dot four but
they predicted one out of four people

5223
02:24:09,781 --> 02:24:13,020
between the ages of 18 and
35 something like that.

5224
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:13,973
It was going to be,

5225
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:19,100
it was going to be like the black plague
and if Duesberg is wrong then man we'd

5226
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,783
licked aids.

5227
02:24:22,530 --> 02:24:23,370
When you say that,

5228
02:24:23,371 --> 02:24:24,300
like people saying that,

5229
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:27,780
you know who was saying that shit
the media and you know the media,

5230
02:24:27,781 --> 02:24:29,010
if it bleeds it leads.

5231
02:24:29,011 --> 02:24:32,180
Anything that's controversial it
everybody was going to die but everybody's

5232
02:24:32,190 --> 02:24:33,570
going to be talked to
health like nationals.

5233
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:34,411
A lot of people,

5234
02:24:34,411 --> 02:24:34,771
first of all,

5235
02:24:34,771 --> 02:24:38,050
did die in Africa a lot and and
a lot of people in this country.

5236
02:24:38,051 --> 02:24:39,300
Do you know what is killed?

5237
02:24:39,330 --> 02:24:42,690
Half of the people that
have ever died ever wait,

5238
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:44,280
wait,

5239
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:45,120
malaria.

5240
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:46,110
I was going to say I,

5241
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:49,500
the malaria is a mother familiar by far.

5242
02:24:49,501 --> 02:24:51,720
It kills more than a million people year.

5243
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:53,490
Malaria kills the shit out.

5244
02:24:53,491 --> 02:24:54,030
I everybody.

5245
02:24:54,030 --> 02:24:56,160
That's why Bill Gates
was so instrumental in,

5246
02:24:56,161 --> 02:24:56,670
and he said,

5247
02:24:56,670 --> 02:24:58,080
what you really need is mosquito nets.

5248
02:24:58,500 --> 02:24:58,980
Yeah.

5249
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:01,320
I had a dude on my podcast
that had fucking malaria.

5250
02:25:01,321 --> 02:25:01,770
I've seen it.

5251
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:03,060
I've seen malaria with my own eyes.

5252
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:04,470
I've seen somebody suffer from that.

5253
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,490
Malaria is terrifying.

5254
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:05,971
I was a kid.

5255
02:25:05,971 --> 02:25:07,020
I went from the mosquitoes.

5256
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:10,370
You shake your so called Ooh,

5257
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:12,480
and you could fucking die easy.

5258
02:25:12,481 --> 02:25:15,990
A lot of people die from a good
percentage of the people that get malaria.

5259
02:25:15,991 --> 02:25:16,230
Dot.

5260
02:25:16,230 --> 02:25:17,460
Ebola is another one.

5261
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:19,860
Both fucking terrifying.

5262
02:25:19,890 --> 02:25:23,040
What do you think about this Ebola shit
that's been going on in the last couple

5263
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:23,050
of months?

5264
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:23,860
Pretty contagious.

5265
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:24,010
You

5266
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:24,401
know what,

5267
02:25:24,401 --> 02:25:24,710
man,

5268
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:26,200
there's a bunch of shit that's going on.

5269
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:27,123
It's not hype.

5270
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:27,470
It's,

5271
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:28,151
it's real.

5272
02:25:28,151 --> 02:25:29,290
It's contagious as fuck.

5273
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:30,880
Cause AIDS workers are getting it.

5274
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:33,630
People that are giving people
that are medical people,

5275
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:34,660
aid workers,

5276
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:36,970
people that are medical
professionals are getting it.

5277
02:25:37,300 --> 02:25:37,931
So you know,

5278
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:38,171
they,

5279
02:25:38,171 --> 02:25:40,720
they're dealing with situations
that we're trying to help people.

5280
02:25:40,721 --> 02:25:44,230
And you're around people all the time
because they figured out a way to close it

5281
02:25:44,231 --> 02:25:45,160
off in the United States.

5282
02:25:45,161 --> 02:25:46,780
It's so very few cases

5283
02:25:48,590 --> 02:25:49,780
of dying for me.

5284
02:25:49,781 --> 02:25:51,800
Bolas so I mean the chances,

5285
02:25:51,801 --> 02:25:54,640
I mean other countries in other countries,

5286
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:55,630
if you get it,

5287
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:57,070
it's almost a death sentence.

5288
02:25:57,090 --> 02:25:57,430
Right?

5289
02:25:57,430 --> 02:26:01,750
But in America it's about 40% 40%
of the people that get American men,

5290
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:02,643
it's very hot.

5291
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:04,030
But 40% of the people,

5292
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:06,700
the people that have all come
over from Africa that had had it,

5293
02:26:06,701 --> 02:26:07,450
they're all fine.

5294
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:08,283
Yeah.

5295
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,210
They all know they were talking about it.

5296
02:26:10,211 --> 02:26:12,520
They were trying to isolate why some
people survive and others don't.

5297
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:13,271
They actually don't know.

5298
02:26:13,271 --> 02:26:14,380
They think it is genetic.

5299
02:26:14,381 --> 02:26:17,290
They think you had to have
a genetic resistance to it.

5300
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:19,750
Where because typically the overall,

5301
02:26:19,751 --> 02:26:23,530
if you look at the grants statistic 70
you got a 70% chance I believe of dying.

5302
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:24,460
If you get Ebola.

5303
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:26,230
If you look at the broad statistic,

5304
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:27,453
something like that,

5305
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:30,440
what are the odds that the
Ebola thing all over the news?

5306
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:34,630
It was a distraction from like let's
say Syria is that that I don't think the

5307
02:26:34,631 --> 02:26:37,450
news can work that way because there's
so many different independent outlets,

5308
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:40,720
so many different independent in remember
let people on the ground like the

5309
02:26:40,721 --> 02:26:43,180
doctors that are going there and
making no money and just going there.

5310
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:45,190
That's where we're getting
a lot of our information.

5311
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:48,180
We're also getting our information from
mostly health workers aren't getting our

5312
02:26:48,190 --> 02:26:53,190
information from CNN and Fox News turned
to get America to panic all the time.

5313
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:55,720
There's a possibility
that's all a distraction.

5314
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:59,920
I think the media makes
money by sewing fear I think.

5315
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:00,793
I think the meaning.

5316
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:04,360
You don't think the media is controlled
by whoever's running everything.

5317
02:27:04,570 --> 02:27:07,570
You think that people that are
running everything half don't.

5318
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:11,830
I think think about control too
complicated and there are too many other

5319
02:27:11,831 --> 02:27:13,120
interests for anybody to run everything.

5320
02:27:13,121 --> 02:27:13,571
For example,

5321
02:27:13,571 --> 02:27:14,560
take the administration,

5322
02:27:14,590 --> 02:27:15,190
take a pray,

5323
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:16,090
take a presidency.

5324
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:17,950
First thing any president
always says what?

5325
02:27:17,951 --> 02:27:18,430
I had no car.

5326
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:19,091
I had no control,

5327
02:27:19,091 --> 02:27:19,511
no power.

5328
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:22,420
Why so many different people in
his cabinet have different agendas.

5329
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:26,320
Everybody's undermining everybody and so
I think it's very difficult for any one

5330
02:27:26,321 --> 02:27:28,750
group to take total control
and they usually get found out.

5331
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:30,750
I just think the media usually eat out.

5332
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:33,140
Typically.

5333
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:33,973
What do you,

5334
02:27:34,390 --> 02:27:35,223
what do you think?

5335
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:37,560
I think that you can't trust,

5336
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:39,191
it's not a bad,

5337
02:27:39,191 --> 02:27:40,990
you see a CNN Fox,

5338
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:46,000
I think everything that's coming through
the major news that works all have an

5339
02:27:46,001 --> 02:27:47,200
agenda behind it.

5340
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:48,520
Whether it's district,

5341
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:50,080
because if I was running shit,

5342
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:51,010
I would,

5343
02:27:51,010 --> 02:27:52,150
if I was wearing this shit and they said,

5344
02:27:52,151 --> 02:27:52,510
hey,

5345
02:27:52,510 --> 02:27:53,380
what do you think we should do?

5346
02:27:53,381 --> 02:27:53,980
I'm like,

5347
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:54,410
wait a minute.

5348
02:27:54,410 --> 02:27:55,750
Are you guys controlling the media?

5349
02:27:55,810 --> 02:27:56,530
First of all,

5350
02:27:56,530 --> 02:27:58,210
if they say no,

5351
02:27:58,211 --> 02:27:59,560
we're not really controlling the media.

5352
02:27:59,561 --> 02:28:00,460
They do whatever they want.

5353
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:03,190
I would say control the goddamn media.

5354
02:28:03,191 --> 02:28:04,150
What the fuck are you guys,

5355
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:05,700
how would you control
me to explain to me how,

5356
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:07,300
how do you think you
would control the media?

5357
02:28:07,301 --> 02:28:08,134
For example,

5358
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:09,460
like the Ebola thing for example,

5359
02:28:09,461 --> 02:28:09,671
like,

5360
02:28:09,671 --> 02:28:13,600
like when you have all those
different people dying,

5361
02:28:13,601 --> 02:28:14,410
right?

5362
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:17,660
And you have people getting more
people dying than the Fluor you,

5363
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:17,831
no,

5364
02:28:17,831 --> 02:28:17,901
no,

5365
02:28:17,901 --> 02:28:18,071
no,

5366
02:28:18,071 --> 02:28:18,281
no.

5367
02:28:18,281 --> 02:28:18,431
But,

5368
02:28:18,431 --> 02:28:19,264
but Ebola same.

5369
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:20,090
Devastating.

5370
02:28:20,090 --> 02:28:20,890
Exactly.

5371
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:21,723
Exactly.

5372
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:24,440
Because Evil Ebola is,

5373
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:28,160
his heart is very difficult to
cure and probably a uncurable.

5374
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:32,090
And also because it's so devastating
and it's so contagious and it,

5375
02:28:32,091 --> 02:28:35,480
and it spreads like wildfire because a
lot of these people who were there were,

5376
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:37,340
were when their loved ones was sick,

5377
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:40,690
they would take care of their loved
one and they would absorb the fluid.

5378
02:28:40,691 --> 02:28:45,691
And why isn't the news covering all the
innocent women and children dying in

5379
02:28:47,841 --> 02:28:51,290
these Middle Eastern
countries through US bombs?

5380
02:28:51,350 --> 02:28:52,820
Why are they not covering that?

5381
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:53,331
Well,

5382
02:28:53,331 --> 02:28:54,560
I think they are.

5383
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:55,090
They're not.

5384
02:28:55,090 --> 02:28:55,620
I think,

5385
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:58,310
I think that sometimes
the news can be sanitized.

5386
02:28:58,311 --> 02:28:59,144
And I agree with you.

5387
02:28:59,150 --> 02:29:00,710
But what I'm saying is that I think,

5388
02:29:00,711 --> 02:29:03,020
and I agree that I think
that how many people die,

5389
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:04,720
right?

5390
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:05,450
On the trust.

5391
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:06,590
How many people died in Iraq?

5392
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:07,940
I don't know.

5393
02:29:07,941 --> 02:29:10,250
But a lot over 1 million civilians.

5394
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:11,440
Over 1 million civilians.

5395
02:29:12,190 --> 02:29:13,120
A lot of different,

5396
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:14,240
I've heard a lot of 1 million.

5397
02:29:14,241 --> 02:29:15,500
How many people have died of Ebola?

5398
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:16,970
Not many fucks.

5399
02:29:16,971 --> 02:29:17,910
Zach thousand

5400
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:22,850
over 1 million civilians died in Iraq.

5401
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:25,580
You don't hear you heard about that?

5402
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:26,870
They're not covering that.

5403
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:27,620
That's,

5404
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:29,000
that's a holocaust right there.

5405
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:30,080
Why aren't we,

5406
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:31,160
uh,

5407
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:32,900
aiding the families,

5408
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:34,071
families of these people?

5409
02:29:34,071 --> 02:29:35,000
Why aren't we talking about this?

5410
02:29:35,001 --> 02:29:35,151
No,

5411
02:29:35,151 --> 02:29:35,984
we're talking about some.

5412
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:37,160
So to me,

5413
02:29:37,460 --> 02:29:38,060
to me,

5414
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:39,350
if I was running shit,

5415
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:42,470
I would have the media
on motherfucking lock.

5416
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:47,450
I would have the movie industry
on lock out out of the TB easy.

5417
02:29:47,510 --> 02:29:52,510
The CIA's been in checking scripts since
the 50s to make sure that communism

5418
02:29:54,770 --> 02:29:56,440
doesn't infect,

5419
02:29:56,550 --> 02:30:00,620
Louise has no say and
could never tell a studio.

5420
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:03,440
That's ridiculous.

5421
02:30:03,441 --> 02:30:04,274
You don't know that.

5422
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:05,373
You're not a what?

5423
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:06,460
When?

5424
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:09,670
One of the things about wikileaks and
one of the things about finding out more

5425
02:30:09,671 --> 02:30:12,580
about what kind of information the CIA,

5426
02:30:12,910 --> 02:30:13,241
uh,

5427
02:30:13,241 --> 02:30:15,910
or what kind of a operations
CIA has been involved with.

5428
02:30:15,911 --> 02:30:18,850
They've been involved with the
influence of Hollywood movies forever.

5429
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:21,970
Operation mockingbird
operation mockingbird is a real

5430
02:30:24,970 --> 02:30:25,301
jerk.

5431
02:30:25,301 --> 02:30:26,200
A lot of these guys,

5432
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:27,923
these guys,

5433
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:30,500
God's first of all want to be patriots.

5434
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:31,251
A lot of these guys,

5435
02:30:31,251 --> 02:30:33,740
he's producer assholes that
are involved in these movies.

5436
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:34,574
Studios.

5437
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:35,360
They also,

5438
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:37,510
they want access to information.

5439
02:30:37,511 --> 02:30:40,130
It's going to allow them to
make a very realistic film.

5440
02:30:40,131 --> 02:30:42,470
They want the government to be behind it.

5441
02:30:42,471 --> 02:30:44,300
So if you're doing a movie like on,

5442
02:30:44,301 --> 02:30:45,010
you know,

5443
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:45,890
fill in the blank,

5444
02:30:46,210 --> 02:30:47,300
Black Hawk down,

5445
02:30:47,301 --> 02:30:48,134
so shit,

5446
02:30:48,620 --> 02:30:51,020
they got in trouble because there
are dark 30 a lot of people in the

5447
02:30:51,021 --> 02:30:53,900
intelligence community got in
trouble because it was so real.

5448
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:55,430
And a lot of those things,

5449
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,000
the,

5450
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,340
the intelligence community
didn't want exposed.

5451
02:30:58,700 --> 02:30:59,050
I don't,

5452
02:30:59,050 --> 02:30:59,883
I don't mean there's

5453
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:02,570
no,

5454
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:02,811
you're,

5455
02:31:02,811 --> 02:31:04,040
you're saying Hollywood is,

5456
02:31:04,041 --> 02:31:05,330
if it's one guy,

5457
02:31:05,630 --> 02:31:06,740
it's not one guy.

5458
02:31:06,770 --> 02:31:08,480
You're talking about dozens of students,

5459
02:31:09,250 --> 02:31:10,940
parents and producers,

5460
02:31:10,941 --> 02:31:12,920
money coming from all sorts
of different directions,

5461
02:31:12,921 --> 02:31:13,970
a lot of it foreign,

5462
02:31:14,210 --> 02:31:14,511
you know,

5463
02:31:14,511 --> 02:31:14,941
so you,

5464
02:31:14,941 --> 02:31:15,350
you know,

5465
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:20,350
by saying the CIA had one problem with
one film discrediting CIA influence on

5466
02:31:20,581 --> 02:31:23,460
Hollywood is kind of like
CIA has influenced this,

5467
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:26,873
but what do you like,

5468
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:29,370
how about there's a great
article in the Guardian.

5469
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:30,570
There's a one,

5470
02:31:30,610 --> 02:31:30,850
uh,

5471
02:31:30,850 --> 02:31:31,171
there's,

5472
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:33,540
there's a great article on
global research called lights,

5473
02:31:33,541 --> 02:31:35,010
camera action,

5474
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:36,930
the deep politics of Hollywood.

5475
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:37,530
And it's,

5476
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:37,650
uh,

5477
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:38,150
it's,

5478
02:31:38,150 --> 02:31:40,460
I mean there's just not just one thing.

5479
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:43,020
Ron Howard wanted to make a movie,

5480
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:44,760
I doubt very much.

5481
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:46,070
And the runners in the essence,

5482
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:47,070
I doubt very much their list,

5483
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:48,210
the CIS coming and saying,

5484
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,050
hold on guys,

5485
02:31:49,050 --> 02:31:50,070
you can't do this.

5486
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:51,900
You already talking
about what you're saying.

5487
02:31:51,901 --> 02:31:52,720
Like they're,

5488
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:53,400
you're company.

5489
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:55,770
You're the CIA is telling those guys.

5490
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:00,200
The CIA is telling us guys
what they can and can't do.

5491
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:01,110
The CIA,

5492
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:01,860
yes,

5493
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:02,840
they're controlling how you,

5494
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:03,181
okay,

5495
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:03,451
listen,

5496
02:32:03,451 --> 02:32:07,050
Harry Anslinger was the first
drugs are in the United States.

5497
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:09,450
He's single handedly responsible.

5498
02:32:09,451 --> 02:32:11,140
If you've done the research of ah,

5499
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:13,050
making marijuana,

5500
02:32:13,470 --> 02:32:14,910
putting it into a schedule,

5501
02:32:14,911 --> 02:32:15,900
one category,

5502
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:16,920
Harry Anslinger,

5503
02:32:16,921 --> 02:32:18,890
he was the one guy who was,

5504
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:24,090
who was standing in front of Congress
with fake newspaper report that stated,

5505
02:32:24,091 --> 02:32:24,510
Look,

5506
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:24,931
Congress,

5507
02:32:24,931 --> 02:32:25,890
we've got an outlaw,

5508
02:32:25,891 --> 02:32:27,840
this dangerous drug called marijuana.

5509
02:32:27,841 --> 02:32:29,010
It's making people listen.

5510
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:30,750
Nobody's that gullible.

5511
02:32:30,751 --> 02:32:31,021
I mean,

5512
02:32:31,021 --> 02:32:31,531
I'm not,

5513
02:32:31,531 --> 02:32:32,040
you're not.

5514
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:32,521
Wow.

5515
02:32:32,521 --> 02:32:33,270
You see?

5516
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:34,103
You just don't know.

5517
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:35,063
You just don't know.

5518
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:37,740
Listen,

5519
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:38,160
listen,

5520
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:43,160
Harry Anslinger was the guy responsible
for marijuana after marijuana's

5521
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:45,540
prohibition.

5522
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:50,160
He got into investigating or
looking into Hollywood scripts.

5523
02:32:50,310 --> 02:32:55,310
He was in charge of making sure
that communist screenwriter
shirt weren't trying

5524
02:32:55,921 --> 02:32:57,830
to brainwash the public.

5525
02:32:57,831 --> 02:32:58,090
That's right.

5526
02:32:58,090 --> 02:33:00,700
So the CIA McCarthy era,

5527
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,310
they never pulled out.

5528
02:33:02,350 --> 02:33:04,880
You think they pulled out once
you're in your fucking name,

5529
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:06,480
you think they pulled out Eddie?

5530
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,050
I can.

5531
02:33:07,050 --> 02:33:07,800
I can write.

5532
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,060
I can write anything I want.

5533
02:33:09,061 --> 02:33:09,894
Criticize him.

5534
02:33:09,970 --> 02:33:10,800
They pulled out.

5535
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:13,290
You think they're told
that they got in it?

5536
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:14,580
Everybody was,

5537
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:15,533
have a conversation.

5538
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:16,680
I can make a movie.

5539
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:17,700
Yeah,

5540
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,980
I can make a movie criticizing the CIA,

5541
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:20,850
right?

5542
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:21,121
No,

5543
02:33:21,121 --> 02:33:21,780
you can.

5544
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:23,190
You're telling me that I couldn't do that.

5545
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:23,821
You can't.

5546
02:33:23,821 --> 02:33:23,911
It.

5547
02:33:23,911 --> 02:33:25,230
Depending on how you criticize them,

5548
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:27,000
they will come down at you.

5549
02:33:27,150 --> 02:33:30,090
They will knock on your
fucking door and talk to you.

5550
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:31,073
That's what they will do.

5551
02:33:31,210 --> 02:33:34,840
That just turn on your fucking
laptop camera and kitchen beaten off.

5552
02:33:36,290 --> 02:33:36,810
Kidding.

5553
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:37,643
Are you kidding?

5554
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:38,551
They were in.

5555
02:33:38,551 --> 02:33:42,630
It's a fact that they were in Harry
Anslinger was the guy who brought in the

5556
02:33:42,631 --> 02:33:46,320
government to inspect the scripts to
make sure there was no communist plot.

5557
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:47,860
You think they put him so,

5558
02:33:47,861 --> 02:33:48,051
so,

5559
02:33:48,051 --> 02:33:53,051
so does the CIA control the news
outlets know it had established an

5560
02:33:55,621 --> 02:33:57,510
entertainment liaison office,

5561
02:33:57,690 --> 02:34:02,690
which would collaborate in a strictly
advise a Tori advisory capacity with

5562
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:03,270
filmmakers.

5563
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:04,650
They would be idiots if they didn't.

5564
02:34:04,710 --> 02:34:07,110
If they didn't and they
brought me in the CIA,

5565
02:34:07,111 --> 02:34:07,501
80 medical,

5566
02:34:07,501 --> 02:34:08,970
you motherfuckers got the fuck out.

5567
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,350
You guys were in and you got out.

5568
02:34:10,470 --> 02:34:11,570
How retirement are you?

5569
02:34:11,571 --> 02:34:13,770
Have you talked to the New
York Times editorial board?

5570
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,720
They would laugh you out
of the room if you said,

5571
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:17,543
oh,

5572
02:34:18,570 --> 02:34:18,940
I don't.

5573
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:20,950
I don't know if they control everything.

5574
02:34:20,950 --> 02:34:23,910
What I think both fluids.

5575
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:24,821
Hold on Eddie.

5576
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:25,121
Come on,

5577
02:34:25,121 --> 02:34:25,720
man.

5578
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:30,160
I think they've had some influence on
some movies because especially movies

5579
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:32,110
about the agency themselves,

5580
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:35,460
they've been consulted and
national security secrets.

5581
02:34:35,461 --> 02:34:35,831
You can't,

5582
02:34:35,831 --> 02:34:37,990
wanting to make sure that
they know how to you look.

5583
02:34:37,991 --> 02:34:42,980
If you're a guy and you live in Hollywood
and you have no history at all in in

5584
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:44,470
secret service or anything,

5585
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:46,310
you want to know how the
fuck things word right.

5586
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:47,290
How does it work?

5587
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:47,650
What?

5588
02:34:47,650 --> 02:34:50,620
What kind of a conversation does the
president have if they're were about to

5589
02:34:50,621 --> 02:34:51,640
drop a bomb on somebody,

5590
02:34:51,650 --> 02:34:54,560
what happens if someone is
trying to kidnap the president,

5591
02:34:54,561 --> 02:34:55,061
his family?

5592
02:34:55,061 --> 02:34:55,480
What?

5593
02:34:55,480 --> 02:35:00,480
What steps take place if we are going to
plant a phony dictator in place or you

5594
02:35:00,821 --> 02:35:01,001
know,

5595
02:35:01,001 --> 02:35:04,240
so there is without a
doubt some discussion.

5596
02:35:04,241 --> 02:35:07,000
I mean they've had some discussion
of us had been laid bare,

5597
02:35:07,001 --> 02:35:10,690
haven't they in this past like look
at how bad they look with this torture

5598
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,500
report from,

5599
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:12,660
from the intelligence committee.

5600
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:13,710
I have a Mike big way.

5601
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:14,553
What do you think of that?

5602
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:16,960
Because the CIA was,

5603
02:35:17,250 --> 02:35:20,800
is is the one everyone blames?

5604
02:35:20,830 --> 02:35:21,371
It's okay.

5605
02:35:21,371 --> 02:35:22,710
The people above the theater,

5606
02:35:22,711 --> 02:35:23,620
they're like playing the Thea.

5607
02:35:23,621 --> 02:35:24,454
I looked at CIO,

5608
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:26,800
so the CIO has different directors.

5609
02:35:26,801 --> 02:35:27,790
They keep rotating.

5610
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:29,470
Nobody's accountable for anything.

5611
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:30,790
It's just CIA,

5612
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:31,550
the CIA's,

5613
02:35:31,550 --> 02:35:31,961
but you know what?

5614
02:35:31,961 --> 02:35:36,961
The Iran Contra Contra scandal with
George Sr was the vice president was the

5615
02:35:38,261 --> 02:35:39,490
head of the CIA,

5616
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:40,960
became vice president.

5617
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:45,130
There was a assassination attempt on
Ronald Reagan who is known as one of the

5618
02:35:45,250 --> 02:35:46,031
most oblivious,

5619
02:35:46,031 --> 02:35:46,390
dumb,

5620
02:35:46,390 --> 02:35:47,260
dumbest presidents.

5621
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:52,440
Only second to George W and
George singer becomes president.

5622
02:35:53,560 --> 02:35:56,260
The head of the the the CIA,

5623
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:59,770
his father Prescott Bush started the CIA,

5624
02:35:59,860 --> 02:36:00,521
his father,

5625
02:36:00,521 --> 02:36:04,330
Prescott Bush finance the
Nazis through union bank.

5626
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:06,990
That's not a conspiracy theory that,

5627
02:36:06,991 --> 02:36:07,420
oh wait,

5628
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:08,253
hold on.

5629
02:36:09,630 --> 02:36:10,960
And also knowledge on

5630
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:14,633
notes.

5631
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:15,840
So it's the CIO.

5632
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:16,880
You're saying it's not the CIA,

5633
02:36:16,881 --> 02:36:17,530
there's somebody.

5634
02:36:17,530 --> 02:36:19,190
The CIA is just this,

5635
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:20,320
the whipping boy.

5636
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:23,710
There's nobody accountable in this
who's really running this shit.

5637
02:36:23,711 --> 02:36:26,200
Then who knows the people
with all the money,

5638
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:27,610
the Rockefellers,

5639
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:29,770
JP Morgan on the international bankers,

5640
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:30,730
but the CIS,

5641
02:36:30,731 --> 02:36:31,420
perfect.

5642
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:33,220
The CIO has been busted many times.

5643
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:34,840
The CIO has been busted,

5644
02:36:34,841 --> 02:36:35,674
Bro,

5645
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:38,410
that you listen to Rick Ross.

5646
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:41,740
The CIA is the biggest drug
dealer in the United States.

5647
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:42,700
How crazy is that?

5648
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:44,080
That's not a conspiracy theory.

5649
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:49,200
They brought over $5 billion a
coke in the 80s feel Brazilian,

5650
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:51,480
all those drug cartels and

5651
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:56,740
all the little drug [inaudible]
it on the news in Mexico,

5652
02:36:56,741 --> 02:36:58,180
in Juarez and all that shit.

5653
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,260
That's a distraction.

5654
02:36:59,410 --> 02:36:59,861
Meanwhile,

5655
02:36:59,861 --> 02:37:03,460
the CIS bringing him coke by the military.

5656
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:04,870
This is not conspiracy theory.

5657
02:37:05,050 --> 02:37:06,220
You don't see anything wrong with that.

5658
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:09,850
Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan
dare to keep kids off drugs.

5659
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:14,050
Yet the vice president of
bringing in all the drugs to MENA,

5660
02:37:14,051 --> 02:37:14,884
Arkansas,

5661
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:17,420
bill vice president is bringing in drugs.

5662
02:37:18,650 --> 02:37:18,970
I like.

5663
02:37:18,970 --> 02:37:19,803
He's

5664
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:23,203
busted.

5665
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:24,690
His legs are almost off.

5666
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:29,710
George senior got busted all
over north Iran Contra 1980

5667
02:37:31,770 --> 02:37:33,230
that was about Steven.

5668
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:34,353
That was,

5669
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:37,460
that was about bringing
drugs in selling arms.

5670
02:37:37,850 --> 02:37:38,900
Well busted.

5671
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:39,890
It's a fact.

5672
02:37:39,891 --> 02:37:40,970
That wasn't the con.

5673
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:43,760
The Iran Contra scandal
wasn't actually about drugs,

5674
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:49,630
guns and drugs.

5675
02:37:49,631 --> 02:37:50,464
The drugs,

5676
02:37:50,510 --> 02:37:51,650
they got busted

5677
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,380
selling.

5678
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,540
Real question is how far up does it go?

5679
02:37:56,541 --> 02:37:59,120
The guy who was getting
the drugs to Rick Ross,

5680
02:37:59,121 --> 02:38:01,870
who was he actually being green liberal,

5681
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:05,660
dropping off the gloves and
Mena Arkansas bill officers.

5682
02:38:05,690 --> 02:38:07,070
Is it the head of the CIA?

5683
02:38:07,071 --> 02:38:08,470
That's where it gets you say,

5684
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:12,020
why would the CIA do that for money?

5685
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:14,590
They can make us about money finance,

5686
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:15,673
the Iran Contra,

5687
02:38:16,050 --> 02:38:16,883
he hit in the haunt,

5688
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:17,660
the CIA,

5689
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:21,110
the CIA had and getting all the money
they want from us because they do

5690
02:38:21,111 --> 02:38:21,580
whatever.

5691
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:21,721
No,

5692
02:38:21,721 --> 02:38:21,860
they,

5693
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:22,160
yeah,

5694
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:24,380
but they don't because they have to do,

5695
02:38:24,381 --> 02:38:25,214
you know what their budget,

5696
02:38:25,330 --> 02:38:27,430
they have to prove to

5697
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:31,423
them

5698
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:34,070
that they weren't with this.

5699
02:38:34,070 --> 02:38:35,560
I ran out booking,

5700
02:38:35,620 --> 02:38:36,220
so hold on.

5701
02:38:36,220 --> 02:38:36,490
So,

5702
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:36,741
so,

5703
02:38:36,741 --> 02:38:38,960
so let's say they sell drugs
and they get that money.

5704
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,710
Yeah.

5705
02:38:39,710 --> 02:38:40,340
Okay.

5706
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:41,650
So they played hard.

5707
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:42,590
They did it illegally.

5708
02:38:42,591 --> 02:38:43,160
Right,

5709
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:43,550
of course.

5710
02:38:43,550 --> 02:38:44,030
Okay,

5711
02:38:44,030 --> 02:38:45,180
so now,

5712
02:38:45,230 --> 02:38:45,920
now hold on.

5713
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:46,401
Who,

5714
02:38:46,401 --> 02:38:47,840
what do they do with that cash?

5715
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:49,040
I mean,

5716
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:49,873
you're right.

5717
02:38:50,210 --> 02:38:51,260
We don't know what they do with it,

5718
02:38:51,261 --> 02:38:51,921
so fuck it.

5719
02:38:51,921 --> 02:38:52,754
It's not real.

5720
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:56,630
I'm just saying that the CIA
is such a big bureaucracy,

5721
02:38:56,660 --> 02:39:00,440
so you need their tent and everything
they do basically is under civilian

5722
02:39:00,441 --> 02:39:00,981
control.

5723
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:01,310
I mean,

5724
02:39:01,310 --> 02:39:02,950
I'm just saying technically.

5725
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:03,231
Yeah.

5726
02:39:03,231 --> 02:39:03,460
Right.

5727
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:05,790
So what's the word they
get as many they get,

5728
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:06,560
they get,

5729
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:06,821
they,

5730
02:39:06,821 --> 02:39:08,950
the Senate intelligence
committee gives them any,

5731
02:39:09,050 --> 02:39:12,140
pretty much they went outside to check.

5732
02:39:12,141 --> 02:39:13,080
They have a lot of money.

5733
02:39:13,081 --> 02:39:14,420
That's not true.

5734
02:39:14,450 --> 02:39:18,910
They don't get all the money for through
Congress that they get it all black ops

5735
02:39:18,911 --> 02:39:19,250
style.

5736
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:20,350
They sell drugs,

5737
02:39:20,351 --> 02:39:21,380
sell arms.

5738
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:22,281
That's what they do.

5739
02:39:22,281 --> 02:39:24,020
Have ovens that it's already,

5740
02:39:24,021 --> 02:39:25,850
it's an it's buff to just Google it.

5741
02:39:25,851 --> 02:39:26,481
Look it up.

5742
02:39:26,481 --> 02:39:26,871
Google,

5743
02:39:26,871 --> 02:39:27,890
Iran Contra.

5744
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:30,260
They got busted and the
crazy thing about that,

5745
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:35,860
not only did George senior get
busted doing it as a vice president,

5746
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:38,450
but he became president.

5747
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:40,940
He got Boston and then the dude,

5748
02:39:41,130 --> 02:39:42,050
he didn't get busted.

5749
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:43,580
He got busted,

5750
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:45,140
but nobody gets indicted.

5751
02:39:45,170 --> 02:39:46,850
Nobody is held accountable.

5752
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:47,240
Well,

5753
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:48,730
all of the waste of time they put up

5754
02:39:50,510 --> 02:39:51,500
all over north.

5755
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:52,670
When you say busted,

5756
02:39:52,700 --> 02:39:54,470
like in what way was he busted?

5757
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:54,891
Busted.

5758
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:55,701
Everybody knows that,

5759
02:39:55,701 --> 02:39:58,640
looks into it and and doesn't
trust the fucking government.

5760
02:39:58,641 --> 02:39:58,881
They go,

5761
02:39:58,881 --> 02:40:00,110
you fucking criminal.

5762
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:01,070
He's a criminal.

5763
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:04,250
There's a criminal or all the
press and throw a criminal.

5764
02:40:04,450 --> 02:40:06,380
You can't be a president
unless you're a criminal.

5765
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:07,220
I understand that.

5766
02:40:07,220 --> 02:40:08,600
But when you say busted,

5767
02:40:08,601 --> 02:40:13,601
like what specifically points to the
fact that George Bush was involved in

5768
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:14,993
selling drugs?

5769
02:40:15,570 --> 02:40:16,141
He was,

5770
02:40:16,141 --> 02:40:18,810
his boss was George Sr.

5771
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:20,040
He was the vice president.

5772
02:40:20,041 --> 02:40:21,380
Everything was wanting towards,

5773
02:40:21,810 --> 02:40:24,240
Oliver North has never
said anything about drugs.

5774
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:28,110
I'll never admitted that he
was an art of selling drugs.

5775
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:28,973
What do you think?

5776
02:40:29,220 --> 02:40:29,851
I don't know.

5777
02:40:29,851 --> 02:40:31,410
But the point is when you say busted,

5778
02:40:31,411 --> 02:40:32,520
like if you're going to point,

5779
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:34,710
like if you were in a court
of law and you said this,

5780
02:40:34,711 --> 02:40:39,270
you said that he was mentioned drugs
and when they didn't go to jail for

5781
02:40:39,271 --> 02:40:40,680
murdering a Nicole,

5782
02:40:40,681 --> 02:40:41,140
but we,

5783
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:42,780
we know he did it right.

5784
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:43,321
Don't do,

5785
02:40:43,321 --> 02:40:44,640
do believe that he did or didn't.

5786
02:40:44,730 --> 02:40:49,440
Well this is a really distorted argument
though because you know when you say

5787
02:40:49,441 --> 02:40:54,120
George Bush was busted for selling drugs
or George Bush was busted for enabling

5788
02:40:54,121 --> 02:40:57,030
Oliver North to let drugs
go through south central La,

5789
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,860
I don't really think he was,

5790
02:40:58,920 --> 02:40:59,510
I mean it would,

5791
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:00,660
did he have anything to do with it?

5792
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:05,610
If the CIA had something to do with drugs
and they use that money to fund the,

5793
02:41:05,611 --> 02:41:06,050
you know,

5794
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:07,380
theory conscious versus

5795
02:41:10,650 --> 02:41:14,580
using that money for our list
hill on a boat they got caught.

5796
02:41:14,581 --> 02:41:15,540
Who want to believe that shit.

5797
02:41:15,541 --> 02:41:18,240
You can believe it then nobody,

5798
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:20,790
nobody will ever be
accountable for that shit.

5799
02:41:20,820 --> 02:41:22,680
No one gets thrown in prison for that.

5800
02:41:22,681 --> 02:41:26,160
Show me just note on the message board
that we need to fight companion for this

5801
02:41:26,161 --> 02:41:26,994
fight companion.

5802
02:41:28,670 --> 02:41:29,503
No

5803
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:33,420
gets accountable for shit.

5804
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:35,190
CIA agent,

5805
02:41:35,630 --> 02:41:36,230
uh,

5806
02:41:36,230 --> 02:41:39,310
true both for freezing the restaurant.

5807
02:41:42,210 --> 02:41:43,043
Hey listen,

5808
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:48,080
he Howard a a who for years defended the
CIA against any involvement in the JFK

5809
02:41:51,511 --> 02:41:52,830
assassination for years.

5810
02:41:52,950 --> 02:41:53,460
He our,

5811
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:55,080
and he was involved in Watergate as well.

5812
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,670
Very well known,

5813
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:58,980
high level CIA for years.

5814
02:41:58,981 --> 02:42:00,630
What's the one guy in the,

5815
02:42:00,631 --> 02:42:03,630
in those documentaries about
the JFK conspiracy theory?

5816
02:42:03,730 --> 02:42:03,920
He,

5817
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:04,290
how does,

5818
02:42:04,290 --> 02:42:06,390
like you all ain't got no proof.

5819
02:42:06,570 --> 02:42:07,530
What do you guys got?

5820
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:08,040
You know,

5821
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:09,870
he was killed by a lone nut,

5822
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:10,520
uh,

5823
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:10,830
uh,

5824
02:42:10,830 --> 02:42:12,990
the Harvey Oswald on his deathbed.

5825
02:42:12,991 --> 02:42:14,490
He said that was all bullshit.

5826
02:42:14,491 --> 02:42:14,761
He goes,

5827
02:42:14,761 --> 02:42:15,320
listen,

5828
02:42:15,320 --> 02:42:18,250
it was audience think CIA guy.

5829
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:19,350
His bed confessions.

5830
02:42:19,351 --> 02:42:20,130
First of all,

5831
02:42:20,130 --> 02:42:21,210
I've never seen it.

5832
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:22,940
Have you ever seen a
video of the deathbed?

5833
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:24,720
You're saying some crazy shit.

5834
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:28,180
There's many interviews
where he was dying.

5835
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:30,510
He was like he dude,

5836
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:33,670
and it's never made any of
this he hour to like the guy.

5837
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:37,650
But if you've seen it was
he fucked up confession.

5838
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,140
You tell me the two minutes.

5839
02:42:40,170 --> 02:42:40,890
It's two minutes,

5840
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:41,790
but there's okay,

5841
02:42:42,390 --> 02:42:42,680
hold on.

5842
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:43,510
See minutes of it.

5843
02:42:43,510 --> 02:42:43,880
Heady.

5844
02:42:43,880 --> 02:42:44,713
C'Mon man.

5845
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:47,160
If if people are old they like,

5846
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:48,030
they get delusional.

5847
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:49,980
I'm going to say some crazy shit.

5848
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:52,261
No lie.

5849
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:52,741
Anyways,

5850
02:42:52,741 --> 02:42:53,760
I mean listen,

5851
02:42:53,850 --> 02:42:54,720
I'm not sure if it's true.

5852
02:42:54,721 --> 02:42:55,081
You know what?

5853
02:42:55,081 --> 02:42:55,531
You're right.

5854
02:42:55,531 --> 02:42:57,310
I believe you guys it,

5855
02:42:57,950 --> 02:42:58,783
we say let's get,

5856
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:00,810
let's watch two and a half minutes.

5857
02:43:00,990 --> 02:43:01,823
If

5858
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:06,060
you listened to him and then you tell me
with your judgment of if this guys like

5859
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:07,300
this guy is a high level CIO.

5860
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:08,720
Let me ask you a question
I didn't ask you.

5861
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:10,590
Let me ask you one question.

5862
02:43:10,590 --> 02:43:11,423
Do you believe,

5863
02:43:11,970 --> 02:43:12,010
I

5864
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:12,701
don't believe in anything.

5865
02:43:12,701 --> 02:43:13,570
I'm just trying to smell question.

5866
02:43:13,630 --> 02:43:16,180
I'm just trying to appreciate
it that you just love you.

5867
02:43:16,210 --> 02:43:17,043
I love you and you are.

5868
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:18,670
But here's what I always,

5869
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:20,510
when whenever you guys like and,

5870
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:20,961
and you,

5871
02:43:20,961 --> 02:43:21,220
you know,

5872
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:23,050
you'll have a guy you're
talking about who,

5873
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,840
who admits all of these things
and there's video on it that,

5874
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:28,090
the only thing that I
always go back to is this.

5875
02:43:28,480 --> 02:43:30,700
There are so many
investigative journalists,

5876
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:33,130
so many who are good people who
are trying to find the truth.

5877
02:43:33,131 --> 02:43:33,880
A lot of people,

5878
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,740
I mean if you look at the
New York Times and economist,

5879
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:36,160
let me just,

5880
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:37,810
let me just listen to NPR,

5881
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:38,620
New York Times,

5882
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:39,453
The economist,

5883
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:40,361
Wall Street Journal,

5884
02:43:40,361 --> 02:43:41,380
these people don't make a lot of money,

5885
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:43,210
but they do go to countries.

5886
02:43:43,211 --> 02:43:44,450
They risked their own lives and they,

5887
02:43:44,470 --> 02:43:47,650
they are as concerned with the truth
and exposing the truth as they,

5888
02:43:48,130 --> 02:43:48,810
as anybody.

5889
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:50,110
A lot of going to amber Lyon.

5890
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:50,680
But hold on,

5891
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:51,031
hold on,

5892
02:43:51,031 --> 02:43:51,630
on,

5893
02:43:51,630 --> 02:43:52,000
and,

5894
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:57,000
and what happens the way
the way an editorial board
works is when you go and you

5895
02:43:57,521 --> 02:43:57,701
say,

5896
02:43:57,701 --> 02:43:58,540
here's my story.

5897
02:43:58,541 --> 02:44:00,850
The first thing your editor
says in a credible newspaper,

5898
02:44:00,851 --> 02:44:02,620
like the economist is the oldest magazine.

5899
02:44:02,621 --> 02:44:03,454
How do you know this?

5900
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:04,750
How do you know what's the first night?

5901
02:44:04,751 --> 02:44:04,960
I said,

5902
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:07,430
I know a lot of journalists I've
interviewed and I've interviewed,

5903
02:44:07,450 --> 02:44:09,320
the first thing we say is
what the first thing they say,

5904
02:44:10,350 --> 02:44:11,470
let them finish man.

5905
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:16,330
And the first thing they say is what
you need at least I believe it's three

5906
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:20,740
credible sources that we can check
up on before we can run a newspaper,

5907
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:21,070
uh,

5908
02:44:21,070 --> 02:44:21,341
Max.

5909
02:44:21,341 --> 02:44:22,750
And they're very careful about that.

5910
02:44:22,751 --> 02:44:23,340
Okay.

5911
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:23,860
And so,

5912
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:27,790
so when you have that much information
and you have the mainstream media,

5913
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:30,490
which is the economist that
NPR that makes no money,

5914
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:35,540
they rely on public funding and stuff
when everybody is essentially sharing the

5915
02:44:35,681 --> 02:44:37,870
same story and checking these things out.

5916
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:39,220
These guys are so credible.

5917
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:40,361
But they are,

5918
02:44:40,361 --> 02:44:41,194
I mean,

5919
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:45,840
so you were saying that these journalists
that are risking their lives are,

5920
02:44:45,880 --> 02:44:48,970
are lying and you're one guy
is the one who has the truth.

5921
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,830
That's what you're talking about.

5922
02:44:50,831 --> 02:44:51,680
Some black and white.

5923
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:52,840
This one,

5924
02:44:52,840 --> 02:44:53,571
I said that there's,

5925
02:44:53,571 --> 02:44:55,540
there's one guy who has all the truth.

5926
02:44:55,541 --> 02:44:57,310
I said that this one guy will do,

5927
02:44:57,460 --> 02:45:00,100
and these journalists that you'll
know so well aren't full of shit.

5928
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:01,960
I believe you that you,

5929
02:45:01,961 --> 02:45:03,970
all these journals that you
know aren't full of Shit.

5930
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:06,850
You're talking about what
journalists with the,

5931
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:07,713
with the,

5932
02:45:08,230 --> 02:45:11,800
with the CNN ask them is give
me three credible sources.

5933
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:13,600
You don't know that yet.

5934
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:15,430
How do you know that CNN,

5935
02:45:15,550 --> 02:45:19,040
he's talking about the times you want to,

5936
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:23,440
but what really I think
the reality is that uh,

5937
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:26,680
the major networks are full of shit.

5938
02:45:27,310 --> 02:45:32,290
The government at the high levels is
solely corrupt and you could just follow

5939
02:45:32,291 --> 02:45:35,590
the money and find out
how corrupt everyone is.

5940
02:45:35,740 --> 02:45:40,180
And the people at the top and politics
are not waking up thinking about what can

5941
02:45:40,181 --> 02:45:41,350
I do for the people.

5942
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:42,610
They're not thinking about that shit.

5943
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:46,300
They're thinking about how I keep
my power and how I make money.

5944
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:47,470
That's my guests.

5945
02:45:47,530 --> 02:45:49,150
I don't believe any of
those mother fuckers.

5946
02:45:49,151 --> 02:45:51,670
So you don't think anybody is in the news?

5947
02:45:51,671 --> 02:45:52,451
I didn't say anybody.

5948
02:45:52,451 --> 02:45:53,020
Okay.

5949
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:57,580
But you don't think the majority of
journalists have have the interest of the

5950
02:45:57,581 --> 02:45:58,540
truth in mind?

5951
02:45:58,541 --> 02:46:00,250
You think I'm being paid by somebody else.

5952
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:00,700
Phone.

5953
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:01,960
Do you ever read the New York Times?

5954
02:46:01,961 --> 02:46:04,080
Have you ever read the New
York Times or the economist or,

5955
02:46:04,081 --> 02:46:05,080
or do you listen to NPR?

5956
02:46:05,081 --> 02:46:05,741
Do you listen to,

5957
02:46:05,741 --> 02:46:06,730
do you read in The Wall Street Journal?

5958
02:46:06,731 --> 02:46:09,010
Did you ever I watch CNN.

5959
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:12,280
Do you read those identifications?

5960
02:46:12,350 --> 02:46:13,183
I don't.

5961
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:18,190
I don't watch CNN on a regular basis
because I feel that I'm getting fed an

5962
02:46:18,891 --> 02:46:19,480
agenda.

5963
02:46:19,480 --> 02:46:19,880
Okay.

5964
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:21,230
Every now and then I'll watch it.

5965
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:23,180
Why would I re read the New York Times?

5966
02:46:23,430 --> 02:46:26,390
I think that the people at the
top have all that shit on lock.

5967
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:27,830
So why would I waste my time?

5968
02:46:27,950 --> 02:46:32,630
The only time I do read New York
Times or watch the CNN report,

5969
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:33,950
I'm always watching and going,

5970
02:46:34,100 --> 02:46:35,300
what are these motherfuckers,

5971
02:46:35,301 --> 02:46:40,070
what is their agenda and how are they
trying to steer the public into a certain

5972
02:46:40,071 --> 02:46:40,670
opinion?

5973
02:46:40,670 --> 02:46:41,503
I don't believe,

5974
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:43,160
I think they're all fucking corrupt.

5975
02:46:43,310 --> 02:46:46,990
I think they're all full of shit
and it's been like that for 35 40

5976
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:48,151
at all.

5977
02:46:48,151 --> 02:46:49,050
And I think you're,

5978
02:46:49,230 --> 02:46:53,340
I think that's very arrogant to conciliate
think that you somehow have the truth

5979
02:46:53,341 --> 02:46:54,330
and all these people,

5980
02:46:54,380 --> 02:46:54,470
well,

5981
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:55,303
I never

5982
02:46:56,430 --> 02:46:58,220
have the truth and shakers.

5983
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:03,020
Are you using like mechanisms to fuel
your argument instead of it's fun.

5984
02:47:03,450 --> 02:47:04,920
I'm not using anything.

5985
02:47:04,921 --> 02:47:05,754
I'm not sure.

5986
02:47:06,010 --> 02:47:06,960
I'm just saying you will.

5987
02:47:06,961 --> 02:47:07,910
You just did his,

5988
02:47:07,930 --> 02:47:12,330
his death because he never said that
you have all the truth that when people,

5989
02:47:12,331 --> 02:47:13,164
I love people.

5990
02:47:14,990 --> 02:47:16,380
You're saying all these journalists,

5991
02:47:17,010 --> 02:47:21,600
Howard Hunt's deathbed confession and
we were talking about the CIA's admitted

5992
02:47:21,601 --> 02:47:22,860
role in Hollywood.

5993
02:47:23,070 --> 02:47:25,980
You tend to like not want to
buy into any of that stuff.

5994
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:27,540
I tend to be the middle ground,

5995
02:47:27,541 --> 02:47:27,840
so we,

5996
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,000
what we have is the mama bear,

5997
02:47:30,001 --> 02:47:30,541
papa bear,

5998
02:47:30,541 --> 02:47:31,374
baby bear.

5999
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:34,950
I'm the middle there

6000
02:47:35,230 --> 02:47:40,230
because my podcast host is
you times 10 he will not,

6001
02:47:40,990 --> 02:47:43,030
he think he was day.

6002
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:44,180
He'll say stuff like that.

6003
02:47:44,181 --> 02:47:45,330
He will say stuff like,

6004
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:46,801
trust me,

6005
02:47:46,801 --> 02:47:48,420
I know the government's full of shit.

6006
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:49,161
I know that.

6007
02:47:49,161 --> 02:47:50,250
It's always been that way.

6008
02:47:50,580 --> 02:47:51,510
I know that,

6009
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:52,860
that they're fucking us.

6010
02:47:52,890 --> 02:47:53,670
I know that.

6011
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:57,930
But he says that and then
he believes no conspiracy,

6012
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,250
government conspiracy theories.

6013
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:00,233
So it's kind of weird.

6014
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:02,580
So it's way more over the top.

6015
02:48:02,630 --> 02:48:02,941
The new,

6016
02:48:02,941 --> 02:48:04,400
I think for me the fun

6017
02:48:05,990 --> 02:48:06,980
is Brian reads.

6018
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:08,000
Yeah.

6019
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:08,800
And you know what,

6020
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:09,650
Zach reads a lot

6021
02:48:11,710 --> 02:48:13,550
to educate yourself.

6022
02:48:13,551 --> 02:48:13,840
Grind.

6023
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:15,260
Zach reads a lot of books too.

6024
02:48:15,261 --> 02:48:15,610
Dude.

6025
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:16,443
Zach,

6026
02:48:17,150 --> 02:48:19,400
the problems that might be the problem,

6027
02:48:20,350 --> 02:48:20,720
right?

6028
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:23,030
That I think is that sometimes when we,

6029
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:24,080
and we all do this,

6030
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:25,340
when we,

6031
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:26,173
um,

6032
02:48:26,210 --> 02:48:27,980
we decide that this is the enemy,

6033
02:48:28,250 --> 02:48:28,580
right?

6034
02:48:28,580 --> 02:48:29,091
When we go,

6035
02:48:29,091 --> 02:48:29,330
well,

6036
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:29,931
for example,

6037
02:48:29,931 --> 02:48:30,920
I don't believe any of this.

6038
02:48:30,921 --> 02:48:31,910
I'm not going to read any of this.

6039
02:48:31,911 --> 02:48:32,744
And I think they're all,

6040
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:33,171
you know,

6041
02:48:33,171 --> 02:48:33,261
are,

6042
02:48:33,261 --> 02:48:34,140
most of them are,

6043
02:48:34,141 --> 02:48:35,240
are not trustworthy.

6044
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:39,740
I think that you do several of the surface
in some ways because I think the real

6045
02:48:39,741 --> 02:48:40,280
enemy is,

6046
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:43,670
is a lot less insidious
and a lot less glamorous.

6047
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:45,410
And I think the real enemy for example,

6048
02:48:45,411 --> 02:48:45,831
is like,

6049
02:48:45,831 --> 02:48:47,540
let's just take campaign finance reform.

6050
02:48:47,820 --> 02:48:48,150
Uh,

6051
02:48:48,150 --> 02:48:52,160
which is probably the most important
thing to talk about the money in politics

6052
02:48:52,310 --> 02:48:56,810
and the way basically somebody in Congress
has to spend 40 to 60% of his time

6053
02:48:56,811 --> 02:48:59,660
calling people he doesn't know just
to get enough money to get reelected.

6054
02:49:00,050 --> 02:49:01,250
Now you got a problem.

6055
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:02,031
Or for example,

6056
02:49:02,031 --> 02:49:02,990
here's a huge enemy

6057
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:05,090
disagreeing with that at all.

6058
02:49:06,450 --> 02:49:06,691
Yeah.

6059
02:49:06,691 --> 02:49:07,524
And so in thousand

6060
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:08,933
my,

6061
02:49:09,470 --> 02:49:09,810
yeah,

6062
02:49:09,810 --> 02:49:11,430
leafs in 2010 for example,

6063
02:49:11,431 --> 02:49:13,980
this is fascinating that we had
some real problems in this country,

6064
02:49:13,981 --> 02:49:16,860
some real challenges and the thing that
they were arguing about on the floor and

6065
02:49:16,861 --> 02:49:21,240
congress was swipe swipe
fees for a tms swipe fees.

6066
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:22,110
Why?

6067
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:23,730
Because you had corporate behemoths,

6068
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:27,810
they were arguing about their bottom line
and influencing congress because they

6069
02:49:27,811 --> 02:49:31,920
wanted to make more money and they didn't
give a shit about the real issues that

6070
02:49:31,921 --> 02:49:32,461
faced you.

6071
02:49:32,461 --> 02:49:33,780
Me and the average person,

6072
02:49:33,781 --> 02:49:35,150
I guess what I'm talking about,

6073
02:49:35,160 --> 02:49:36,480
I've totally believe right and,

6074
02:49:36,481 --> 02:49:36,821
and but,

6075
02:49:36,821 --> 02:49:38,370
but remember now that was very,

6076
02:49:38,371 --> 02:49:42,270
very much dilated and really exposed
by some of the mainstream media is like

6077
02:49:42,271 --> 02:49:43,340
look for New York Times,

6078
02:49:43,341 --> 02:49:44,550
said some great stuff on that.

6079
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:49,620
Lawrence Lessig who's a Harvard lawyer
and wrote a great book called Republic

6080
02:49:49,621 --> 02:49:50,100
loss.

6081
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:53,640
So there's really great information out
there and if you know where to look,

6082
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:57,180
I think that a lot of people in earnest
and a lot of great journalists do a

6083
02:49:57,181 --> 02:49:59,970
great job trying to expose
what the real enemy is.

6084
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:03,240
And I'm always fascinated with the fact
that it's not even so much the CIA.

6085
02:50:03,241 --> 02:50:05,370
I though I'll say they come
out looking terrible in this,

6086
02:50:05,371 --> 02:50:06,030
what they did.

6087
02:50:06,030 --> 02:50:07,830
You know that he's 39 detainees and stuff,

6088
02:50:07,831 --> 02:50:09,480
but how many people were involved?

6089
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:10,633
That's what I want to know.

6090
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:11,401
We don't want to know,

6091
02:50:11,401 --> 02:50:12,001
like when you,

6092
02:50:12,001 --> 02:50:14,880
when you leave someone
alone with detainees,

6093
02:50:14,881 --> 02:50:18,180
like how many people are involved
in the decision to torture them,

6094
02:50:18,390 --> 02:50:21,930
how many people or shield themselves
from that to protect themselves?

6095
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:22,853
They don't want to know.

6096
02:50:23,130 --> 02:50:24,330
They just want the information.

6097
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:24,931
I wonder,

6098
02:50:24,931 --> 02:50:25,261
you know,

6099
02:50:25,261 --> 02:50:27,000
they did a five year study
and one of the things that,

6100
02:50:27,001 --> 02:50:31,770
one of the reasons to see I got caught
was because a lot of CIA officers were,

6101
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:34,770
were sending emails back
to their superior saying,

6102
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:35,760
I don't like this.

6103
02:50:35,970 --> 02:50:37,200
This is really bad.

6104
02:50:37,230 --> 02:50:37,351
Well,

6105
02:50:37,351 --> 02:50:38,184
you know,

6106
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:39,570
arrested was the whistle blower.

6107
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:40,890
The whistle blows and Jay,

6108
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:43,140
the whistle blowers in jail.

6109
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:45,360
Everybody else who fucking froze,

6110
02:50:45,361 --> 02:50:46,140
none of them.

6111
02:50:46,140 --> 02:50:48,240
None of them frozen stuff frozen.

6112
02:50:48,241 --> 02:50:48,490
Got It.

6113
02:50:48,490 --> 02:50:49,440
I did awful stuff.

6114
02:50:49,980 --> 02:50:50,370
And,

6115
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:50,840
and,

6116
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:54,140
and the other issue from what I understand
is that a lot of this world will

6117
02:50:54,270 --> 02:50:56,100
contract was subcontracted out,

6118
02:50:56,370 --> 02:50:57,360
put them in a room naked.

6119
02:50:57,361 --> 02:50:58,680
They chained him to a wall,

6120
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:01,200
they changed the law and he
was naked and it was cold.

6121
02:51:01,250 --> 02:51:02,083
Yeah.

6122
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:02,890
Anytime.

6123
02:51:02,890 --> 02:51:03,680
Anytime.

6124
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:03,960
Yeah.

6125
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:04,793
Died overnight.

6126
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:08,400
And we don't really know,

6127
02:51:08,401 --> 02:51:09,120
by the way,

6128
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:14,120
we don't really know how many people
this happened to and we don't know a lot.

6129
02:51:14,300 --> 02:51:15,420
Got To get that info.

6130
02:51:15,930 --> 02:51:16,763
Uh,

6131
02:51:16,770 --> 02:51:17,340
yes,

6132
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:20,460
but I worked off does Eddie probably he
probably just for everyone else at home

6133
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:22,410
and he probably just
went to Pete's fantastic.

6134
02:51:22,411 --> 02:51:23,970
He gets so worked up.

6135
02:51:23,971 --> 02:51:26,540
I was hoping you'd jump over here
and choke the shit out of room.

6136
02:51:26,670 --> 02:51:28,800
He loves conspiracy theories.

6137
02:51:28,950 --> 02:51:30,890
He gets upset if there's a rational,

6138
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:31,340
I,

6139
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:33,810
I hope he gets upset and I love him.

6140
02:51:33,811 --> 02:51:34,680
I love my Eddie Brock.

6141
02:51:34,690 --> 02:51:35,700
I don't see any bravo enough.

6142
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:37,410
He loves his conspiracy theories.

6143
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:38,960
I nobody loves conspiracy theories

6144
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:42,690
nine 11 and you don't have educate him.

6145
02:51:42,691 --> 02:51:45,810
Unfortunately we don't
have any time out of time.

6146
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:47,610
The Howard Hunt deathbed confession,

6147
02:51:47,611 --> 02:51:48,690
which is interviews with him,

6148
02:51:48,691 --> 02:51:50,070
talking about what really happened,

6149
02:51:50,071 --> 02:51:50,670
and Jeff,

6150
02:51:50,670 --> 02:51:51,820
Jeff K's assassination.

6151
02:51:51,821 --> 02:51:56,040
That's CIA agent telling you what
place on the map he's telling you,

6152
02:51:56,041 --> 02:52:00,000
but no one would that for Callan
real quick before you play.

6153
02:52:00,001 --> 02:52:02,310
You got to understand we're
not going to the basic,

6154
02:52:02,850 --> 02:52:03,683
I mean why not?

6155
02:52:04,040 --> 02:52:04,873
Why not?

6156
02:52:05,060 --> 02:52:06,190
We'll be able to show something

6157
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:06,670
on that.

6158
02:52:06,670 --> 02:52:09,640
That's what I'm saying is
when you looked at JFK.

6159
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:09,821
Yeah.

6160
02:52:09,821 --> 02:52:10,630
We don't have any time.

6161
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:11,280
Okay.

6162
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:11,630
All right.

6163
02:52:11,630 --> 02:52:11,950
All right.

6164
02:52:11,950 --> 02:52:13,000
You wouldn't want to hear,

6165
02:52:13,001 --> 02:52:13,511
I wanted to hit,

6166
02:52:13,511 --> 02:52:16,840
I wasn't here nine to 11 it's
deep like game of Thrones deep.

6167
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:20,560
Jfk Is this deep and
complicated as game of Thrones.

6168
02:52:20,561 --> 02:52:21,160
Seriously,

6169
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:25,600
you have this many members involved in
that assassination as game of Thrones.

6170
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:26,553
The names,

6171
02:52:26,580 --> 02:52:29,320
the how they affected the SASA nation.

6172
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:30,213
Everything.

6173
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:31,330
It's so deep.

6174
02:52:31,331 --> 02:52:31,991
If you look into it,

6175
02:52:31,991 --> 02:52:32,801
it's so deep.

6176
02:52:32,801 --> 02:52:37,600
It's fucking insane how deep it is and
how deep the CIA was involved in it.

6177
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:39,940
It's very widely known.

6178
02:52:39,941 --> 02:52:44,530
It's not a conspiracy theory that Jed
Kate did not support the CIA's invasion,

6179
02:52:44,531 --> 02:52:45,364
the Bay of pigs.

6180
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:45,970
They did not.

6181
02:52:45,970 --> 02:52:50,710
They did cid fog operation 40 40
assassins to take out Fidel Castro.

6182
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:54,250
The Bay of pigs was their
mission to go get Fidel Castro.

6183
02:52:54,910 --> 02:52:57,550
JFK didn't support them,

6184
02:52:57,551 --> 02:52:58,960
didn't support air support.

6185
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:00,370
They lost the Bay of pigs.

6186
02:53:00,371 --> 02:53:02,110
The CIA wanted,

6187
02:53:02,170 --> 02:53:03,520
was so pissed at JFK.

6188
02:53:03,580 --> 02:53:06,520
JFK fired the director of the CIA,

6189
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:11,640
Allen Dulles fire the director of the
CIA as a result of what happened in the

6190
02:53:12,191 --> 02:53:13,024
Bay of pigs.

6191
02:53:13,030 --> 02:53:16,990
So the CIS director is fired by JFK,

6192
02:53:17,140 --> 02:53:18,130
the whole operation.

6193
02:53:18,131 --> 02:53:23,131
40 40 elite international assassins
assigned and put together to kill Fidel

6194
02:53:23,710 --> 02:53:23,970
Castro.

6195
02:53:23,970 --> 02:53:27,880
The craziest assassins ever hate JFK.

6196
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:33,190
The vice president Lyndon B Johnson was
about to be indicted for two murders.

6197
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:36,580
Mac Wallace was his bodyguard
who murdered people for Lyndon.

6198
02:53:36,581 --> 02:53:37,210
B Johnson.

6199
02:53:37,210 --> 02:53:39,220
Lyndon B Johnson was a known gangster.

6200
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:41,470
He mingled with the top mobster.

6201
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:42,370
He was so,

6202
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:43,330
and he,

6203
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:46,870
he decided the budget on the CIA and
the FBI and it was really close to,

6204
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:48,033
um,

6205
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:48,580
uh,

6206
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:49,420
j Edgar Hoover.

6207
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:50,650
When you look at the,

6208
02:53:50,651 --> 02:53:51,610
what went down,

6209
02:53:51,790 --> 02:53:55,750
the only reason Lyndon B Johnson didn't
go to prison for two murders that he

6210
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:58,060
ordered at Mac Wallace on to kill people.

6211
02:53:58,060 --> 02:54:00,970
He was a gangster was because Jeff died.

6212
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:03,400
He became president and clean that out.

6213
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:05,230
When you look at all that shit.

6214
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:09,460
And then you also look at JFK in
his and his 33 months in office,

6215
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:10,210
he had,

6216
02:54:10,210 --> 02:54:11,043
uh,

6217
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:15,790
he had every month he
had a different mistress.

6218
02:54:17,350 --> 02:54:22,350
Every must one of his
[inaudible] was higher,

6219
02:54:25,930 --> 02:54:27,420
was quite as like this hustle.

6220
02:54:27,610 --> 02:54:28,000
Yeah.

6221
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:31,360
Cord Meyer was one of the
top CIA guys back then.

6222
02:54:31,810 --> 02:54:32,531
JFK,

6223
02:54:32,531 --> 02:54:36,070
this was judge Kaye was
banging cored wires and wife.

6224
02:54:36,340 --> 02:54:37,500
So when you listen to this,

6225
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:37,720
he,

6226
02:54:37,720 --> 02:54:39,430
Howard hunt concessional,

6227
02:54:40,140 --> 02:54:42,820
he said Lyndon B Johnson work
a straight at the whole thing.

6228
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:43,630
He lives,

6229
02:54:43,630 --> 02:54:48,490
he's telling you a CIA agent famous on
his deathbed saying you'd look at it was

6230
02:54:48,491 --> 02:54:49,420
cord Meyer cord.

6231
02:54:49,421 --> 02:54:50,310
Meyer wanted him dead.

6232
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:51,490
So Lyndon B Johnson,

6233
02:54:51,670 --> 02:54:52,410
he had cord.

6234
02:54:52,410 --> 02:54:54,640
Marie [inaudible] at the
time was Eddie Bravo,

6235
02:54:54,641 --> 02:54:55,690
spent smoking weed,

6236
02:54:55,691 --> 02:54:57,410
peering out curtain senior bars.

6237
02:54:59,710 --> 02:55:00,580
Why wouldn't you play

6238
02:55:03,400 --> 02:55:04,950
[inaudible]?

6239
02:55:05,380 --> 02:55:06,320
Don't have any time,

6240
02:55:06,370 --> 02:55:09,290
but we'll tell everybody to go to Brian.

6241
02:55:09,291 --> 02:55:11,810
Be Nice to play a fucking 11 o'clock.

6242
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:12,261
But still,

6243
02:55:12,261 --> 02:55:12,951
if he's going to learn,

6244
02:55:12,951 --> 02:55:17,951
he's got alert Howard
[inaudible] why you fucker?

6245
02:55:21,350 --> 02:55:22,131
You should be like,

6246
02:55:22,131 --> 02:55:22,911
oh my God,

6247
02:55:22,911 --> 02:55:23,744
let me listen to this.

6248
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:24,613
I don't believe

6249
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:28,370
you're a smart guy.

6250
02:55:28,370 --> 02:55:30,980
This guy is breaking down
and several people on,

6251
02:55:36,690 --> 02:55:41,210
no news ever and this guy
is telling you how JFK went.

6252
02:55:41,211 --> 02:55:42,044
The fuck down.

6253
02:55:42,110 --> 02:55:43,160
He's telling you he was there.

6254
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:44,540
He's telling you I was there.

6255
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:47,480
He saying every assassin was there.

6256
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,770
They all knew about it.

6257
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:51,200
All operation 40 they
were dressed like bumps.

6258
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:52,040
He said that.

6259
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:52,281
He goes,

6260
02:55:52,281 --> 02:55:53,270
I wasn't involved in it,

6261
02:55:53,390 --> 02:55:55,880
but I was on the bench for the big event.

6262
02:55:55,881 --> 02:55:56,750
They called it the big event.

6263
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:57,830
Everybody knew about it.

6264
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:58,783
They all set up.

6265
02:55:58,870 --> 02:56:00,070
They were all involved in,

6266
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:02,030
it was a huge game of Thrones thing,

6267
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:04,010
gave me as a great TV show,

6268
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:04,853
damage.

6269
02:56:05,230 --> 02:56:06,530
They have dragging Howard Hunt,

6270
02:56:06,650 --> 02:56:07,550
deathbed confession.

6271
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:08,850
Time to play it for you.

6272
02:56:10,510 --> 02:56:11,343
We don't have time.

6273
02:56:11,570 --> 02:56:13,460
Do you go and you do your research?

6274
02:56:15,720 --> 02:56:17,150
He has anyone to look at it.

6275
02:56:20,280 --> 02:56:21,113
You don't want,

6276
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:23,830
you don't want to learn.

6277
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:30,410
I think the news cares about the people.

6278
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:37,260
It's a straw man.

6279
02:56:37,261 --> 02:56:37,951
You can't really say that.

6280
02:56:37,951 --> 02:56:38,880
He never says that.

6281
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:39,811
It's just he's,

6282
02:56:39,811 --> 02:56:43,210
he's talking about the ethics
of journalism and the importance

6283
02:56:43,490 --> 02:56:45,160
Kelly's wrong end of the day calendar.

6284
02:56:45,460 --> 02:56:48,820
The reality is neither does any of those.

6285
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:53,010
Some information is very difficult
to acquire for journalists.

6286
02:56:53,011 --> 02:56:57,000
So they sent me information
about Seaberry seals.

6287
02:56:57,060 --> 02:56:57,361
When you,

6288
02:56:57,361 --> 02:56:58,530
when someone says Barry Seal's,

6289
02:56:58,531 --> 02:56:59,420
you know a lot about them,

6290
02:56:59,421 --> 02:56:59,591
right?

6291
02:56:59,591 --> 02:57:01,050
Barry Seal's without a doubt.

6292
02:57:01,080 --> 02:57:04,260
Listen to Lou drugs into Mena
Arkansas without a doubt.

6293
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:08,220
And what Barry Seals was involved in the
murder of two kids that found a drop.

6294
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:10,140
They found a drop of cocaine.

6295
02:57:10,170 --> 02:57:11,790
This guy was flying back and forth.

6296
02:57:11,791 --> 02:57:13,440
There's numerous pictures of him,

6297
02:57:13,441 --> 02:57:14,880
not just with CIA agents,

6298
02:57:14,881 --> 02:57:19,470
but with numerous known drug dealers
from South American Central America.

6299
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,513
Without a doubt.

6300
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:21,360
The pilot,

6301
02:57:21,360 --> 02:57:21,661
yes,

6302
02:57:21,661 --> 02:57:22,494
without a doubt.

6303
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:26,430
That is older news.

6304
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:27,960
But more recent news,

6305
02:57:27,961 --> 02:57:29,170
there was a CIA drug playing.

6306
02:57:29,171 --> 02:57:30,930
They'd been to Guantanamo Bay twice,

6307
02:57:31,080 --> 02:57:33,360
that crash of four tons of cocaine,

6308
02:57:33,540 --> 02:57:37,950
100% guaranteed verified fact.

6309
02:57:38,070 --> 02:57:41,580
A jet that had been to Guantanamo
Bay and been used by the CIA,

6310
02:57:41,730 --> 02:57:46,590
was guilty of transporting cocaine into
the United States crashed because the

6311
02:57:46,591 --> 02:57:48,660
Mexican authorities would
not let them refuel.

6312
02:57:48,910 --> 02:57:49,331
That's like,

6313
02:57:49,331 --> 02:57:53,190
you know what you seeing video that's
like you see in video of Joe Rogan's

6314
02:57:53,191 --> 02:57:55,120
sucking Dick and not believing he's gay.

6315
02:57:55,700 --> 02:58:00,700
[inaudible] relax,

6316
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:03,370
relax.

6317
02:58:03,370 --> 02:58:05,230
You're not going to get it right.

6318
02:58:05,380 --> 02:58:07,890
It's a waste of fucking time
to even try no matter what.

6319
02:58:07,940 --> 02:58:08,320
It was like.

6320
02:58:08,320 --> 02:58:09,153
I don't hear that.

6321
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:10,161
I'm frankly,

6322
02:58:10,161 --> 02:58:10,994
I'm sick.

6323
02:58:11,150 --> 02:58:11,983
Leave you

6324
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:13,921
guys,

6325
02:58:13,921 --> 02:58:14,754
man.

6326
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:15,241
Hey man,

6327
02:58:15,241 --> 02:58:16,350
you're jumping ship over here.

6328
02:58:16,380 --> 02:58:17,140
Oh yeah.

6329
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,120
It feels good.

6330
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:20,100
It feels good on this side.

6331
02:58:20,310 --> 02:58:21,143
Just to,

6332
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:23,730
that's some serious shit.

6333
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:25,350
The CIA got busted for,

6334
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:28,650
for importing $5 billion
with a coke through MENA,

6335
02:58:28,651 --> 02:58:29,071
Arkansas,

6336
02:58:29,071 --> 02:58:32,010
while Bill Clinton was
the governor of Arkansas.

6337
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:33,600
Why do you think he became president?

6338
02:58:36,210 --> 02:58:37,043
He was huge.

6339
02:58:37,080 --> 02:58:38,400
He was the governor of Arkansas,

6340
02:58:38,430 --> 02:58:39,780
allowing all this shit to happen.

6341
02:58:40,020 --> 02:58:41,010
Look at these photos.

6342
02:58:41,100 --> 02:58:41,911
This is hilarious.

6343
02:58:41,911 --> 02:58:42,870
This is the plane.

6344
02:58:43,070 --> 02:58:45,140
This is all the coke that
was on the plane for,

6345
02:58:45,890 --> 02:58:46,350
yeah.

6346
02:58:46,350 --> 02:58:48,940
This is the plane that crashed a calendar,

6347
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:51,750
but it's not going to mean Shit the count.

6348
02:58:51,751 --> 02:58:53,320
He still believes that it's all cocaine.

6349
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:54,900
Believes lamb four times.

6350
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:55,360
Damn.

6351
02:58:55,360 --> 02:58:55,710

6353

6354
02:58:58,141 --> 02:58:58,591
It's late,

6355
02:58:58,591 --> 02:58:59,190

6360
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:12,750
Brian Calendars took off his headset.

6361
02:59:15,530 --> 02:59:16,380
Same with this guy.

6362
02:59:16,381 --> 02:59:17,220
Then I got to go home.

03:00:21,091 --> 03:00:21,650
he doesn't,

6406
03:00:21,650 --> 03:00:22,321
he doesn't want to hear it.

6407
03:00:22,321 --> 03:00:22,531
All right,

6408
03:00:22,531 --> 03:00:23,364
my friends,

6409
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:25,930
let's do this again next time
I actually watched fights

6410
03:00:28,220 --> 03:00:29,053
two and a half.

6411
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:31,680
Well we the fade or fucking Cro,

6412
03:00:31,681 --> 03:00:35,940
cop one was pretty bad at cro
cop Vandelay it was great.

6413
03:00:36,210 --> 03:00:39,750
So was a fade or those were great.

6414
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:40,621
We'll do more of these,

6415
03:00:40,621 --> 03:00:40,801
man.

6416
03:00:40,801 --> 03:00:43,460
We can do these anytime and then they
turn into whatever the fuck they turned

6417
03:00:43,470 --> 03:00:43,560
on.

6418
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:45,870
So we need to do again
to a whole nine 11 thing.

6419
03:00:45,871 --> 03:00:46,704
Cause you got to

6420
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:51,450
understand this is not real.

6421
03:00:51,620 --> 03:00:52,111
You understand?

6422
03:00:52,111 --> 03:00:53,250
He's playing a role right now.

6423
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:58,280
[inaudible] slash tongue in
cheek smilers Kotlin Jeez,

6424
03:01:05,570 --> 03:01:07,100
I don't know.

6425
03:01:10,540 --> 03:01:15,130
The CIA has sponsored this
