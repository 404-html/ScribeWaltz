1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,470
That's why I don't understand
how anybody could do like,

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,920
like ketamine,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,170
like people that do like
recreational ketamine.

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:10,830
Never done it.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,730
Never done it either.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,421
But it's scary.

7
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:16,260
You go into that k hole as they talk
about what sound good Kale doesn't sound

8
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:17,070
good.

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,210
That doesn't sound good to me.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,111
I don't want to do that.

11
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,030
It's some sort of animal tranquilizer,

12
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:21,660
right?

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,230
Something,

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,840
you know.

15
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,673
Thanks Bro.

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,223
What is it?

17
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,451
What is it?

18
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,170
Um,

19
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,220
what's it called?

20
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,020
K Hole.

21
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,853
If it was called,

22
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,970
uh,

23
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,180
wonder lust.

24
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,430
If something was called wonder lost,

25
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,413
I'd be like,

26
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,313
let me try it.

27
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,501
Yeah,

28
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,480
but they call it a k hole
after they've been in it.

29
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:39,781
Yeah.

30
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,920
It sounds horrible.

31
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,450
It sounds like darkness.

32
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:43,111
I don't want to go there.

33
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,570
I never had the desire to do something.

34
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,670
It was going to put you in a k hall flux.

35
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,780
Like acid,

36
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,703
not into it.

37
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,130
I,

38
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,080
we did that acid podcasts with Joey.

39
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,460
I didn't think I can go.

40
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,271
That was the only guy,

41
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:54,991
not on acid,

42
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,190
but Ari was on acid.

43
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,080
Joey Lee.

44
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,610
It was fucking hysterical.

45
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:00,020
I was,

46
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,853
I was like,

47
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,340
you gotta change the name.

48
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,440
You can't call it a hazard.

49
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,970
I'm not going to take
anything called acid.

50
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:06,804
That fucks me up.

51
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,800
That's hilarious.

52
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,130
And He,

53
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,990
they should've called it
something else they saw.

54
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
If they just call it Cuti love.

55
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,581
Yeah.

56
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,231
You want some QT?

57
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,064
Love.

58
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,520
Yeah.

59
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,241
I'll take some QT.

60
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:15,870
Love.

61
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,703
What's it going to do?

62
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh,

63
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,070
just make you look at yourself.

64
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,900
That's funny.

65
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,720
Joe would drop some acid.

66
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,491
You don't give a fuck,

67
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:29,760
man.
