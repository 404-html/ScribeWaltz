1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,850
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,230
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,310
Mike Baker,
ladies,

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,620
gentlemen.
And we're live,

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,450
ladies and gentlemen.
What's going on buddy?

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,330
Yeah,
the usual some wolves over here.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,650
So that's,
that's right.

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,670
All right.
Okay.

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,270
I left the state of Idaho because,
because we're overrun with wolves,

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,310
wolves and,
and uh,

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,071
and that's it.
Yeah,

12
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:20,904
that's all we got was just listening to 
a podcast where these guys were talking 

13
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:24,444
about wolves and about how they were 
hiking and they found four dead mature 

14
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,414
bull elk inside of like a couple miles 
stretch that had been torn apart by 

15
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,170
wolves.
And they started to freak out.

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,243
Well,
I mean,

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,610
at two things,
we got this time of year,

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,800
we've got a lot of wolves and we've got 
a lot of rattlesnakes.

19
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,560
Rattlesnakes are starting to pop up and 
make their appearance warm.

20
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,520
Yeah,
exactly.

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,440
And there are some seasons where you 
can't swing a dead cat without hitting a

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,390
rattlesnake.
And of course if you swing a dead cat,

23
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,224
a wolf will show up.
So that's not a good idea in case 

24
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:59,220
anybody's wondering.
I've never been,

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm going June 30th to boise.
I just announced it tickets today and 

26
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,220
it's fantastic.
I'm excited to be there.

27
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,650
But I,
I keep hearing about wolves.

28
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,530
Is that a real issue up there?
Is it not?

29
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:11,670
It's not exaggerating the century link 
arena.

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,370
It won't be a problem.
So you should be safe from that.

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,990
But uh,
yeah,

32
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,720
bring your gear and you know,
it's,

33
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:20,100
it's,
Idaho is an interesting place because,

34
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,200
you know,
it's a part time legislature,

35
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,440
right?

36
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,273
So,
which is the way I think all states 

37
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,480
should operate,
which means everybody goes home to their

38
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:28,410
jobs.
Well,

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,360
if you just look at the top of the 
state,

40
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,220
the governor,
Butch Otter,

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,380
great guy,
Brad little lieutenant governor,

42
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,850
terrific guy.
They're both ranchers,

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,350
right?
So full time,

44
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,190
full time.
Well,

45
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,060
yeah,
basically.

46
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,590
Um,
and uh,

47
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,483
they,
they look at it from a different 

48
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,560
problem.
A perspective,

49
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,170
right?
So,

50
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,290
you know,
here in California,

51
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,640
you know,
if you say you got a wolf problem,

52
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,710
I mean that,
that racist,

53
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,673
you know,
one perspective and one issue and then 

54
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,300
go,
no,

55
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,133
we have a people problem.
So we have a piece that the wolves are 

56
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:54,594
amazing.
Those wolves are so special and in a 

57
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,564
place like Idaho or you know,
you get a place like Montana or 

58
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,910
somewhere else,
I suppose they look at it differently,

59
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,380
right?
It's a,

60
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,180
it's a working issue that you got it.

61
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
You got to sort out,
particularly if you're a rancher or 

62
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,270
you're,
you're,

63
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,280
you're,
you're living off the land,

64
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,114
whatever.
So,

65
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,270
um,
but I,

66
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,104
I tell you what,
boise is going to go crazy when they 

67
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,760
find out that he's coming up because you
get,

68
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,230
it's a huge fan base.
They love you up there.

69
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,120
It's all people stop me and want to talk
about,

70
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,910
right.
I keep thinking,

71
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,360
you know,
some said,

72
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,580
I'm sorry for interrupting.
And I think,

73
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,530
okay,
they can ask maybe something about North

74
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,330
Korea,
about Iran or some bigger,

75
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,380
it's not that you're not a big issue,
but then they'll say,

76
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,590
what's Joe like?
And well that's kind of what I say.

77
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,470
You know,
what about Iran,

78
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,380
North Korea,
you fucking kids today,

79
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,530
you don't even care.
Dammit.

80
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,383
Did you know Joe North Korean?
You didn't know that I'm on the seat 

81
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,510
tip.
But,

82
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:45,931
oh,
by the way,

83
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,720
before four,
I disappeared down rabbit holes.

84
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,670
I need to,
I need to say your biggest support.

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,210
It your biggest fan probably in the 
entire UK,

86
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,360
uh,
is a young fellow named Jack Burden.

87
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,070
I have noticed family forever known this
kid since he

88
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,570
was a baby,
basically.

89
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,340
And going to school with my,
my,

90
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,174
uh,
my daughter.

91
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,640
And he is an enormous fan,
uh,

92
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,080
highly respects what you do.
Uh,

93
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,900
he's getting his master's in physics and
I promised him I'd give him a shout out.

94
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,110
So I've just done the Jack Burton,
Jacques Birdman.

95
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,200
Outstanding Guy by wolves.
Yeah.

96
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah.
They don't have that problem in London,

97
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,960
although that would make some kind of 
movie,

98
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,010
I think a,
that's the werewolf out front.

99
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,913
That's right.
Yeah.

100
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,340
It's a great space,
by the way.

101
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,120
Thank you.
Yeah.

102
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,310
I haven't been here since you moved to 
give you the full tour.

103
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,600
I didn't give you the,
the gym side.

104
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,010
Did you go to the other side?
I have not.

105
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:33,770
Not yet.
No.

106
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,603
No sides.
Where the gym is the Cim and the indoor 

107
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,530
pool.
We got a lot of stuff here.

108
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,760
It's a great,
uh,

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,620
how many,
how big is that?

110
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,210
It looks like about 200,000 square feet.
Now it's 14,

111
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,390
14,000.
But compared to the last studio is a lot

112
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,250
bigger and I got bored with another 
place.

113
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,163
You have too little,
you gotta expand where you get your 

114
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,350
roller blades out and you can go do laps
or something.

115
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,940
So we got a lot of shit to talk about.
Baker,

116
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,620
there's a lot going on in the world.
What are you scared about?

117
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,330
Oh,
should I be scared about?

118
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,890
Well,
I mean,

119
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,920
people are losing their minds right now 
over the past 24 hours because of Iran.

120
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,330
Right?
So what you're hearing as you're hearing

121
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,950
a lot of the,
um,

122
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,640
the,
uh,

123
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,473
the critics of the current president,
and apparently there are some that are 

124
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:14,981
saying,
oh,

125
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:15,491
he's,
you know,

126
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,220
he's in Chicos closer to a military 
conflict with Iran.

127
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,233
Well,
these are the same brainiacs that said 

128
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,050
he was entering gets closer to war with 
North Korea and they,

129
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,430
everybody was completely wrong on that.

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,713
Uh,
I'm not saying that behind me and the 

131
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,900
others in the Iranian regime might not,
you know,

132
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,240
decide to become more bellicose.
But,

133
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,190
um,
I think they're,

134
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,830
I think they're looking at it wrong.
I mean there's this idea that,

135
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,870
um,
because there's a couple of parts,

136
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,160
part one is that they're saying,
oh,

137
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:39,910
look at,
you know,

138
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,743
he doesn't have a plan b implying that 
it's either this deal which even our 

139
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,700
European allies say is inadequate.
Right?

140
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,340
Uh,
or it's a military conflict.

141
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,580
And that's kind of what the previous 
president was,

142
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,414
was all about.
We either get this deal or we're having 

143
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,170
a military conflict.
No,

144
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,490
there's other things in the works.
There's other options in that,

145
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,500
in that decision tree.
Um,

146
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,890
and so I think that's,
that's a false premise.

147
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,830
And the other thing when they talk about
it over the past 24 hours anyways,

148
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,390
is that,
well look at this.

149
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,790
This is going to make it harder to get a
deal with,

150
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,624
with Kim Jong.
None from North Korea is cause he's 

151
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,870
going to think that we don't,
we don't support our deals.

152
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,210
Well,
I look at a different way.

153
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,400
I think that Kim Jong Un is going to 
look at this and think,

154
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,840
uh,
okay,

155
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,670
they're not going to put up with an 
inadequate deal.

156
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,350
Right.
So he's gonna look at it and say,

157
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,184
well,
yeah,

158
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,130
because nobody disagrees with the 
Iranian deal.

159
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,350
They want to talk about,
they want to talk about how it looked.

160
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,350
The Iranians are complying with it.
Well,

161
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,190
the Iranians are complying with what 
they agreed to allow him the deal.

162
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,460
Right.
Which is none of their military sites,

163
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,923
the number of times inspectors have,
have actually gotten on and inspected a 

164
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,490
military site,
including Parchin,

165
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,383
the most important military facility in 
Iran since that deal was signed in 2015 

166
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:51,514
was zero.

167
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,800
Haven't been there because the Iranians 
didn't agree to allow any of those sites

168
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,150
in this deal.
So that's like,

169
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,013
that's like saying,
that's like saying if you're a serial 

170
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,074
killer,
you'll allow the police to come in and 

171
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,080
search your home,
but you can't go in the basement.

172
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,270
Right.
Not that also he called us,

173
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,860
put their bodies in the basement,
but I,

174
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,270
you know,
I suspect that's the case.

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,913
So anyway,
that's,

176
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,710
it's an interesting thing.
I guess I wanted to throw that out there

177
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,544
right off the bat because I think Iran 
right now is consuming so much of the 

178
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,720
oxygen for,
for people out there.

179
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,200
So people thinking that the reason why 
we're backing out of the deals,

180
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,180
because the presence being unreasonable 
home,

181
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:29,180
we're forcing what you're just saying.
It's a shit deal.

182
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,440
Period.
Yeah.

183
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,274
I think the idea that we have to stay in
it because it's better than the 

184
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,240
alternative and the alternative,
you know,

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,000
being a war is not framing it properly.

186
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't think that,
that doesn't make any sense to me.

187
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,330
But I think that the fact that the UK,
the,

188
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:46,721
the,
the,

189
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:47,554
the French,
the Germans have all agreed publicly 

190
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,700
that it's an inadequate deal.
It needs to be fixed.

191
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,863
That tells you something.
But it also tells you that they have 

192
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,390
real strong financial incentives for 
continuing to do business in Iran.

193
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,640
They,
and as to Russia and China,

194
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,210
frankly the other signatories.
So you know,

195
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,044
and,
and also here's the other part would be 

196
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,300
trump,
you know,

197
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,134
what does it,
now we're 16 or 17 months into trump's 

198
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,250
administration.
So it's not like he,

199
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:14,210
he got into the White House and the next
day he,

200
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,860
you know,
he can the deal,

201
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,200
he's been talking,
but nobody listens to anything.

202
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,034
I'm not,
I'm not a supporter of trump 

203
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,391
necessarily.
I mean,

204
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:23,000
I want the government to work.
So it's not that I'm supporting trump.

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,833
I support that.
I want the government to work just like 

206
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,020
the previous administration.
I wasn't as supportive Obama,

207
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,160
but hey,
I want it to work.

208
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,400
I like things to happen.
And so he,

209
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,293
you know,
he went out there and there was some 

210
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:33,681
talk about,
look,

211
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:37,010
let's see if we can't find some way to 
get rid of the sunset clause,

212
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,180
some way to rein in their ballistic 
missile development program.

213
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,950
Um,
some way,

214
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,170
although it's not going to happen to 
reign in all the,

215
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,483
the,
uh,

216
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,091
you know,
the,

217
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,661
the,
the,

218
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:49,280
the shenanigans,
if you want to call it that,

219
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,840
the Dura engaged in,
in the Middle East.

220
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,030
And that didn't happen.
So I think he,

221
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,940
he,
you know,

222
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,980
took a step that is not as God awful as 
his critics would like us to believe.

223
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,920
Well that isn't that,
that's a real problem.

224
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,180
And your phone's going off over there.

225
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,130
A little fella.
Oh,

226
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm going to check your watch too.
I got a world we're living in.

227
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,800
I know.
This is good.

228
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,600
Your phone,
you've got to check your watch.

229
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,190
My wife got me this,
uh,

230
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,820
this,
this apple now float.

231
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,090
Now we'll get to it.
It does.

232
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:20,924
It's waterproof,
I think took to a certain period of 

233
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,080
time.
Uh,

234
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,131
but it's,
it,

235
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:25,790
uh,
it does all sorts of things.

236
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,624
I don't have a clue what it does.
She got it for me so I could check my 

237
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,040
heart rate and just,
you know,

238
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,910
for health reasons,
just,

239
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,330
you know,
if I'm,

240
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,460
if I'm out running and working out and 
she said,

241
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:35,600
yeah,
you should have something like that.

242
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,980
Cause I refused to wear a fitbit or 
whatever they call it.

243
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,940
What's the difference between a fitbit 
and that will this eye,

244
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,140
it's like Dick Tracy.
I could,

245
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,210
if I knew how to do it,
I could talk on my phone.

246
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
I could answer it.
It rings.

247
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,160
I have no clue.
It can't be too hard.

248
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,140
I don't think it's that hard.
But I'm just trying it on air.

249
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,003
Yeah.
Okay.

250
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,860
Somebody called me,
somebody give me a shout.

251
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,030
I,
it seems like a great thing.

252
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,610
But honest to God,
the only thing I've used it so far is to

253
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:00,444
glance at the time and then to check my 
heart rate all the other crap on there 

254
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:04,560
and everything happens on it.
Right.

255
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,860
So if I'm using my phone for directions,
I get directions on my watch.

256
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,950
I mean it's a little bit overwhelming so
I'm going to go back to a normal watch I

257
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:11,784
think.
And,

258
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,290
and if my heart gives out it gives out.
Yeah,

259
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,670
I got this g shock.
It does all kinds of shit.

260
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Never used it once.
I used the time part,

261
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,260
the altimeter and it works as a compass 
and all kinds of shit.

262
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,190
I've never compas is good.
I think this is good.

263
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,470
We used to have,
we spent,

264
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,430
we spent a long time,
if this is,

265
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,690
this is how old I'm getting I guess,
but not early training.

266
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,313
Um,
we spent a long time working maps and 

267
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,803
compass,
right.

268
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,793
Shooting Asthma's and figuring out where
you're at and trying to and shoot an 

269
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:45,240
asthma.
Yeah.

270
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,790
You know what,
I,

271
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,940
I'll figure figuring out.
You're basically,

272
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,043
I don't want to oversimplify this,
but you're basically triangulating and 

273
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:53,970
figuring out where you are at any given 
point in time.

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,830
What do you call it,
asthma with eh?

275
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,170
Yeah,
that is a very good question.

276
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,660
And not one that I asked when I was in 
the,

277
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,663
in the outfit.
That was one of those people that would 

278
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:04,560
just accept things as they were told to 
me.

279
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,260
And uh,
that's why I got along so well.

280
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,260
I never questioned anything,
which is an interesting point.

281
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,094
I don't want to,
I don't want to roam all over this 

282
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,744
place,
but today was a confirmation hearings 

283
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:19,060
for Gina Hospital.
And I,

284
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,780
I'll caveat this by saying I'm a big 
supporter of hers.

285
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:23,480
I think she's an outstanding choice for 
this.

286
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:28,020
She's the new head of the CIA,
the new director designate for the CIA.

287
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,150
And so today she went up on Capitol 
Hill.

288
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,310
I had,
uh,

289
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,223
open and uh,
then subsequently closed door session 

290
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,810
with the senators and some of the 
senators.

291
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,644
The reason I bring this up is because a 
handful of the senators were asking her 

292
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,290
and seem to focused on saying,
well,

293
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,860
you know,
how,

294
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,693
when would this rendition program,
they rendition and interrogation 

295
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,400
program,
how did you feel about it?

296
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,120
What morally,
what,

297
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,780
you know,
did you have any quandary is what we,

298
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,800
you know,
we know that you,

299
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,301
you,
you,

300
00:10:59,301 --> 00:10:59,791
you,
you know,

301
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,310
the agency was doing what was allowed 
within the Department of Justice.

302
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,313
Uh,
because the office of legal counsel was 

303
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,920
directing that from the Department of 
Justice for that program all those years

304
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,500
ago.
And lots of subsequently changed.

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,633
But at the time they didn't want to 
necessarily talk about that cause I 

306
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,874
don't think they wanted to highlight the
fact that the doj had said this is what 

307
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,300
is able to be done.
Um,

308
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,460
so instead they focused on how did you 
feel?

309
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,970
And I guess the reason I bring it up is 
because when I was in the outfit,

310
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm not a deep thinker,
right?

311
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:30,990
So I never sort of around and thought to
myself,

312
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,910
how do I feel about this?
So I'm going to give it a moment,

313
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,410
right?
I mean,

314
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,330
no matter what we were doing,
it never occurred to me to sit there and

315
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,530
question it.
You know,

316
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,364
as long as we knew what we were doing 
was proper and legal and was pursued of 

317
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,420
tasking from,
from,

318
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,410
uh,
uh,

319
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,900
national security concerns,
then yeah.

320
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,530
And I don't think you want you your 
military or your Intel service.

321
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,170
I don't think you want everybody out 
there at the pointy edge of the spear,

322
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,891
you know,
saying,

323
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:53,724
well,
I'm going to do things based on how I 

324
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:55,204
feel about it in the moment.
And it just seemed like a strange line 

325
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:02,290
of questioning,
questioning who is responsible for that?

326
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,670
Let me think.
They were actually,

327
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,210
uh,
there were,

328
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,590
there were three or four.
Yeah.

329
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,910
Senator Reed and,
and,

330
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,744
uh,
so trial Democrats obviously trying to 

331
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:15,040
understand well,
so what they did then was different than

332
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,810
what is legal today.
Is that the case?

333
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,950
Uh,
yes,

334
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,240
exactly.
So the DOJ,

335
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,490
um,
in,

336
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,270
in the wake of nine 11,
I mean,

337
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,260
there's so much here.
I mean,

338
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,200
in the wake of nine 11,
you think about the context.

339
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,340
Most people,
you know,

340
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,350
young people don't even know what it 
feels like.

341
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:29,830
Right?
I mean,

342
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,663
you know,
and other people have forgotten or they 

343
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,380
just tired of it all and they don't want
to think about it.

344
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,880
But in the wake of nine 11,
there was a,

345
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,970
um,
there was a feeling there was a sense,

346
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,860
right,
that it was going to happen again.

347
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,870
And there certainly was evidence and 
there was,

348
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,704
there was a very large effort here to 
try to ensure that we protect American 

349
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:49,444
lives.

350
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,293
So the DOJ was issuing a very clear 
guidance on what could and could not be 

351
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,560
done for the rendition and interrogation
program.

352
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,663
And that guidance was provided to the 
general counsel at the agency that was 

353
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:07,090
then disseminated to personnel out in 
the field and tell,

354
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,943
tell people.
So if they're just listening to us for 

355
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,050
the first time,
what you used to do for the CIA,

356
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,430
so they understand that you're coming 
from a position of you,

357
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:15,210
you actually understand this stuff.
Uh,

358
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,591
yeah.
I,

359
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:16,424
I was in the Operations Directorate,
so the agency is made up of essentially 

360
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,270
they'd change the name sometimes,
but four directorates.

361
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,830
So you have operations,
you have intelligence,

362
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:26,110
which is all the smart people that 
reports,

363
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,940
or officers or sorry,
the analysts,

364
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,523
you have science and technology,
which is where they develop all the 

365
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,100
amazing gear that comes out of the 
agency,

366
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,470
a lot of which then ends up in the 
commercial sector.

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,930
So if anybody's walking around with a 
defibrillator,

368
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:41,200
that battery technology came out of s 
and t research,

369
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,630
drones,
satellite technology,

370
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,830
um,
uh,

371
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,500
youtube stealth program,
Youtube,

372
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,560
you know,
plain was,

373
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,900
was developed out of and run out of the 
agency.

374
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,610
So incredible things to come out of 
there.

375
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,743
And then admin.
But I was in the Operations Directorate 

376
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,313
and worked on everything from counter 
narcotics operations to 

377
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,670
counterinsurgency operations and,
and,

378
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,780
and then obviously counter terrorism 
operations.

379
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:09,781
So I guess the point is that,
I mean there's,

380
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:10,684
there's something here.
I,

381
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,643
I'm not quite sure how to explain it,
but there's an interesting point that I 

382
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,094
think I've been pondering,
which is that listening to the hearing 

383
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,920
today and listening to the way that the 
senators,

384
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,940
the Democratic senators who were looking
to kind of make this the key issue,

385
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,760
um,
there's,

386
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,653
there's a,
a sense of we're not putting it in 

387
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:33,640
context of the time and the national 
mood.

388
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,380
And that's a dangerous thing because the
laws were different than they are now.

389
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,243
And they were different.
And what that means is that because of 

390
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:46,060
in the wake of nine 11,
and I don't want to say that that values

391
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:47,350
change,
um,

392
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,440
but I think that they do in the sense of
what people are willing to,

393
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,580
uh,
to do.

394
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,200
And whether you're talking about,
okay,

395
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,034
we're willing to have a rendition 
interrogation program in the wake of 

396
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,370
nine 11.
Now we're not,

397
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:01,010
of course.
And uh,

398
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,220
so I think it's,
anyway,

399
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,054
I think there's a,
there's a danger to that line of 

400
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,570
questioning where they kept talking 
about how,

401
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,520
how did it,
how did you feel about it?

402
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,491
And it's not you,
you,

403
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:11,931
you,
you're,

404
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,960
you're there.
They're mixing this and I'm not eloquent

405
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,780
enough to explain it,
but I found it fascinating that that was

406
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,370
a question they wanted to focus on.

407
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,263
I think there's a real danger to people 
or for people that don't have any 

408
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:27,494
experience in the actual war and,
or really understand combat or really 

409
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:31,454
understand what can happen and what can 
go wrong in talking about it with the 

410
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:40,820
same sort of language that you would use
to describe office politics.

411
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,230
Yes.
Yes.

412
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:45,770
I they got to say that's what damn it.
That's what I was trying to say.

413
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,060
You know,
like how you feel,

414
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,640
how do you feel about this?
We don't want a bad work environment.

415
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,400
Should we torture right now.
We want to save lives,

416
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,010
but we don't want this guy to feel bad.
We don't want him to feel bad.

417
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:55,790
And I mean,
look,

418
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,190
there was actually this,
this is,

419
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,270
some people were entertaining the idea 
that,

420
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,123
you know,
Khaleed Sheikh Mohammed would come out 

421
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,400
and talk to the senators.
Uh,

422
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,234
you know,
as you're going through this 

423
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:09,830
confirmation process about what his 
feelings,

424
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,340
we'll clean check.

425
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,173
Muhammad was a mastermind of nine 11 and
he actually requested to talk about her 

426
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,661
right.
And about,

427
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:20,480
about his [inaudible] just wanted to 
reflect on the,

428
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,860
had the whole,
you know,

429
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,440
from his perspective and isn't he still 
locked up?

430
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,510
He shown Guantanamo Bay.
Yeah.

431
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,130
You know,
God forbid he should rot in jail,

432
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,990
but um,
you know,

433
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,850
I think it's,
it's kind of where we,

434
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,980
that's sort of where we've come to.
And I think in part,

435
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:35,060
again,
because there's distance,

436
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,020
right?
There's two months.

437
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,250
And so anyway,
I,

438
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,370
I,
she showed again,

439
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,320
she should be confirmed.
Um,

440
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,603
the,
the whole rendition interrogation 

441
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:47,960
program was reviewed at Nauseum,
thousands of pages written.

442
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,660
And interestingly enough,
a lot of the people up there on the hill

443
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:51,494
right now in this confirmation process,
the senators who are saying that they 

444
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,230
need to know more,
but the same ones who were there before.

445
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,750
So theoretically,
either they didn't read all the material

446
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,330
that was given to them about this,
where they've forgotten it,

447
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,440
where there,
you know,

448
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,320
or in reality this is more about trump 
than it is about her,

449
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,570
which I don't want to be shocking anyone
by saying that perhaps there's political

450
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,404
grandstanding going on,
but she is eminently qualified and it 

451
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,070
happened.
No,

452
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,580
it wouldn't happen up there.
Not In America,

453
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,160
maybe somewhere else,
not here.

454
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,560
So anyway,
you support her.

455
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,800
He thinks she's an excellent choice and 
look seven,

456
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,510
seven operational tours,
uh,

457
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,503
several management positions.
And I guess at the end of the day it 

458
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,340
comes down to,
um,

459
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,970
I would rather have somebody who's gone 
through that experience.

460
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,804
She played a small role.
She was not as a senior person by the 

461
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,354
way.
John Brennan was far more senior in the 

462
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,080
organization at the time of that program
being run.

463
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,740
And he was confirmed as President 
Obama's director.

464
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,923
Um,
so maybe the senators have a different 

465
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,130
standard for a female candidate.
I don't know.

466
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,610
But do you think it's down or anything?
It's maybe more time since nine,

467
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,630
11.
You know,

468
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:59,631
obviously Obama came into office,
it was not that long after nine 11,

469
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,200
there was still,
you know,

470
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:03,960
seven years later still thoughts in 
people's mind about it.

471
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,831
Well,
interesting enough,

472
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:07,110
I mean that was in 2013 when he was 
confirmed,

473
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,160
but in 2009 he was,
they wanted to confirm it or they wanted

474
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,950
to bring him up as the appointee for the
director of the CIA.

475
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,243
Again,
it would have been president Obama's 

476
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:16,884
first term,
but they decided not to because for the 

477
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,120
reason that they thought,
well maybe it's too close to after the,

478
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,390
and they didn't want to go through the 
heartburn of having this process.

479
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,520
So instead they brought him into the 
White House.

480
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,354
He became assistant to the president and
deputy national security dude for 

481
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,194
counter terrorism.

482
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,570
And then four years later they brought 
him in as a,

483
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,493
you know,
then confirmed him as the director for 

484
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,194
the CIA.
So,

485
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,490
um,
I guess,

486
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,310
and he has now come out in support of 
Gina Hospital,

487
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,343
the new director designate.
So I think she will get there as she 

488
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,970
should.
The focus should be going forward.

489
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,430
She's been very clear about,
we're not revisiting the old,

490
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,000
the old days of,
of a rendition interrogation.

491
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,450
It's not going to happen.
And she's been very clear about that and

492
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,710
including today during the hearing.
So hopefully,

493
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,850
hopefully it'll,
it'll,

494
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
it'll get done because it's,
it would be nice to think the senators 

495
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:06,690
would do their job and choose somebody 
who's appropriate for the job.

496
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,703
Well,
it's just,

497
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,993
it's strange who gets to choose and who 
doesn't get to choose who runs an 

498
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:17,721
organization like the CIA and whether or
not they have an actual understanding of

499
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,110
what goes on behind the scenes.

500
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,940
Yeah.
That's a really good,

501
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,783
it's a good point because some of the 
questions today from some of the 

502
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:26,420
senators made you believe that perhaps 
they don't really do that.

503
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,630
I don't want,
I don't want to be Glib,

504
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,201
you know,
look,

505
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,250
they all sit on the committees.
They theoretically are,

506
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,860
are,
are privy to all this information.

507
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:32,694
There is a very well worn path that goes
from lying light where the agency 

508
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,144
headquarters is based up to Capitol Hill
from briefers going back and forth and 

509
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,190
back and forth and discussing programs.
And that,

510
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,450
you know,
the classified material,

511
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,530
but these people,
that gang of eight,

512
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:48,420
that people that are the minority 
majority leaders,

513
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,910
the heads of the committees,
the Intel committees,

514
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,053
uh,
they're all privy to this information 

515
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,963
and they were all privy to the 
information about the rendition program 

516
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:59,100
and the interrogation program.
And they all knew about it.

517
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,870
There were no objections raised at that 
time.

518
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:01,411
2000,
two,

519
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:03,240
2003.
So these people all knew about it.

520
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:04,074
So maybe those senators are asking her 
how she feels about it now maybe they 

521
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:08,154
should turn around and look in the 
mirror and ask themselves how they feel 

522
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,590
about it,
but they're not going to do that.

523
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,640
So anyway,
that and I,

524
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,120
enough set,
she's eminently qualified should happen.

525
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,070
Uh,
because we've got big issues.

526
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,330
We got it wrong.
We've got North Korea,

527
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:22,440
we've got the dealings with China in the
south and the South Pacific.

528
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:25,540
We got issues with Russia.
We had a lot of things going on.

529
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,374
What I really wanted to ask you about,
cause we've been discussing this and I 

530
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,940
don't really understand it.
Um,

531
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,260
it was about wowway that a Chinese 
company,

532
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,113
electronics company,
they make these tick ass phones and the 

533
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,910
State Department has said,
please do not buy them.

534
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,190
Yes.
Yeah.

535
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,950
Along with cte and other corporation,
um,

536
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,183
if you start from the premise that the 
China is the number one perpetrator of 

537
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:56,200
economic espionage and theft of 
intellectual property,

538
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,940
uh,
and also by the way,

539
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,910
the number one perpetrator out there of 
cyber shenanigans,

540
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,510
you know,
activity in cyberspace

541
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,413
because so bad with that theft of 
intellectual property that they have 

542
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:11,061
fake apple stores over in China with all
fake apple stuff.

543
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,740
Yes.
Fake apple laptops,

544
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,020
fake apple phones,
everything fake.

545
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,220
The labels look identical.
None of it is actually apple products.

546
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,460
And it all works frankly as well.
Does this,

547
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,080
yeah,
it's all good stuff.

548
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,913
Enough.
Um,

549
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,813
you know,
uh,

550
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,300
I would say,
um,

551
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,101
it,
yeah,

552
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:33,980
it's astounding.
And so the reason why they're,

553
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:34,814
they're raising the alarm with Huawei 
and zte is because of the voracious 

554
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:44,721
appetite of the Chinese government and 
the commercial sector for information.

555
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,503
And it's a little bit like shutting the 
door after the horse is headed down the 

556
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:54,114
hill because we're late to the game.
They've been doing this for years and 

557
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,300
years and years.
They've been oddly enough of it,

558
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:02,600
you know,
a lot of our military gear have parts in

559
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,290
a manufacturing in China.
Right.

560
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,890
And so,
you know,

561
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,724
if we should have been raising the 
concern about this and talking with 

562
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:14,250
China and trying to come to terms with 
this issue years ago,

563
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,861
I mean we get,
we're,

564
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:15,694
we're,
we're trying to have that conversation 

565
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:19,420
with them now and up on Capitol Hill,
you know,

566
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,263
the,
the congress is trying to enact 

567
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,210
legislation,
kind of like this quality thing.

568
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,463
They're doing it in a clumsy fashion.
But the overriding principle is correct 

569
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,890
in that China made some decisions years 
ago,

570
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,743
that they were going to become a major 
power in the world in a certain 

571
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,750
timeframe.
And to do that,

572
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,883
by definition,
you got to compress your research and 

573
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:43,670
development time.
Right.

574
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,070
And as one way to do that.
And essentially,

575
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:47,904
and that's the steal information to 
acquire information if I want to be 

576
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:53,730
diplomatic about it.
And that's what they've done.

577
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,653
Japan came out of World War II and their
idea was we're going to become a major 

578
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,650
power through manufacturing.
So they did,

579
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,320
they built up their manufacturing base 
and created this,

580
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:02,010
uh,
this,

581
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,843
this amazing result.
China decided we're going to skip the R 

582
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,060
and d for the most part.
Um,

583
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,830
and all of that entails the cost and 
time involved.

584
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,320
And they've,
they're very adept at it.

585
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,333
They,
they throw an enormous amount of 

586
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,400
resource out there into hoovering up 
everything,

587
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:18,810
not just from us but from everybody.

588
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,183
And using that to advance their goals.
They have no firewall between their 

589
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:25,824
Intel service and the PLA,
military intelligence and others and 

590
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:30,840
their commercial sector.
So,

591
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,230
you know,
not only are they,

592
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:35,070
they are to protect national security,
they're there to promote,

593
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,380
uh,
the commercial side of,

594
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:39,340
of China.
Uh,

595
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,223
and that's why it's so important.
And so that's why they're there talking 

596
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:43,050
about Huawei,
uh,

597
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,290
because of the potential for them to,
uh,

598
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,090
use their,
uh,

599
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,650
their reach,
uh,

600
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:51,740
to further their desire for information.
Whatever it may be.

601
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,830
They'll hoover it up and then decide 
whether it's useful or not.

602
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,110
But they have the resource to do that as
opposed to,

603
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,143
you know,
a smaller country that maybe doesn't 

604
00:23:58,821 --> 00:23:59,654
have the resource and is much more 
targeted and focused on their Intel 

605
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,760
collection.
Are there efforts to gather information?

606
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,390
So that's,
that's sort of the,

607
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,010
you know,
that was a wordy explanation.

608
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,210
No,
but it makes sense.

609
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,640
And it's a,
when I read it,

610
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:14,474
I read a bunch of tech articles where 
people were questioning whether or not 

611
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,260
it's even possible for while way to be 
using those phones to spy on people.

612
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,970
But then there was some other articles 
where while we was being charged with a,

613
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,560
what was it again,
they were using,

614
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,930
there were,
there were selling illegal technology to

615
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:31,760
Iran.
There was,

616
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,630
there was something.
They were,

617
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,130
they were breaking the sanctions,
I think.

618
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,140
Yeah,
they were,

619
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,390
no,
no,

620
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,920
I'm saying I say that correct.

621
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,340
Yeah,
there were.

622
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,970
But is that what,
so they were,

623
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:48,810
they were selling things to Iran and 
this was a big part of it,

624
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:49,644
that they were,
what the tech people were saying they 

625
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:55,080
were incredulous here.
Walway under is that you again,

626
00:24:55,081 --> 00:24:56,730
you son of a bitch.
Jesus Christ.

627
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,720
I've turned this thing off to.
I don't understand why it keeps going.

628
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,683
You know what?
I been dope.

629
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,490
I would,
I would put it on airplane mode,

630
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:07,520
but I don't have a clue how to put it on
the swipe up from the bottom.

631
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,820
Swipe up from the bottom.
Okay.

632
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:13,670
Everybody get your phones or your watch 
is ringing?

633
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,950
Watch out.
I feel like Dick Tracy,

634
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,290
it really does feel like Dick Tracy when
we were kids.

635
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,900
The idea of talking on your phone be so 
ridiculous.

636
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,870
Like what?
That's never going to happen.

637
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,130
You've got your password on that.
Oh Christ.

638
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,690
You take it off the path or it comes on 
immediately.

639
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,060
Oh really?
So you just take it down.

640
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,000
No,
that's a dial tone.

641
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,260
That's set.
It's a keyboard.

642
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah.
I don't even know.

643
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,453
I can't right now.
People to think and really that guy 

644
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,170
worked like I worked at the CIA.

645
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,290
Let's listen to him.
It's perfect.

646
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,530
Would you call?
Hopefully they,

647
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,463
I don't know.
It's hilarious because you're talking 

648
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:50,330
about technology and then this happens.
So we're talking about whether or not we

649
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,164
should be worried about walway and you 
can't even figure out how to use your 

650
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,190
fucker.
That's,

651
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,483
that's perfectly understand.
But anybody that knows me knows that 

652
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,570
that's the case because,
I mean,

653
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,600
to be fair,
back in the old days I,

654
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,503
we encompasses and maps,
but even when we started developing new 

655
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:06,740
technology and cure it,
quite frankly,

656
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,373
if you've got to go out and do anything,
if first thing you do is throw 

657
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,030
everything away that's got a battery in 
it.

658
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,443
And so we weren't necessarily getting 
dumb it down because you assumed 

659
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,610
something's gonna go wrong.
And usually it does.

660
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,510
And usually it's based on kit,
on gear.

661
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,920
And so,
yeah,

662
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,050
I never really became very adept at it.

663
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,950
We've got,
we've got a,

664
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,040
I got a,
there's three little boys scooter sluggo

665
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,770
on and,
and I got delirious names and they're,

666
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,310
they're hilarious.
It's great kids.

667
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:40,760
But we got a,
we got a gaming system and I'm trying to

668
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:43,220
remember what the hell,
xbox or playstation,

669
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,790
uh,
xbox,

670
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,330
xbox and uh,
cause my youngest mugsy,

671
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,230
he's,
uh,

672
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,250
he's,
he's always six.

673
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,090
And so he still says,
yeah,

674
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,800
he's,
he's thrilled or pronounces words,

675
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:53,710
right?
So it's x,

676
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,610
x patch and it's really cute.
I can't do it.

677
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:57,800
It doesn't,
it sounds stupid when I do it.

678
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,040
What he does,
it's enormously cute.

679
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,760
So we get to sing and I'll sit there 
with them and try to play like NBA Two k

680
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,400
or something and it just doesn't work.
It's not intuitive to me.

681
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,160
There's nothing that's intuitive about 
it.

682
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,530
Know how to find Shit and press the 
right button.

683
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,340
They're not,
they just assume they're going to get it

684
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,240
online.
Yeah.

685
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,400
Hidden characters by moving the joystick
Dick.

686
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:18,170
A funny way.

687
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,840
Yeah.
Mugs.

688
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,673
He talks to the Lebron James directly.
Apparently they communicate through 

689
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,420
x-box now.
There you go.

690
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,033
The tech people that are skeptical,
what they're saying is that if walway 

691
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,530
really did have something in their 
phones that allow them to spy on people,

692
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,530
you'd be able to find it and the tech 
guys would find it.

693
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,983
Do you buy that?

694
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,530
Um,
here,

695
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,630
here's what I would say about that is 
that,

696
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,620
um,
I'm sure,

697
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,563
yeah,
there's obviously a lot of very smart 

698
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:53,670
tech guys and within a diligence for all
your information and security needs,

699
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,773
we have some very smart tech people,
but when you're talking about the 

700
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:03,090
Chinese state and the resources and 
capabilities that that entails,

701
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,620
uh,
yes.

702
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,990
If you're,
if you're saying that NSA could possibly

703
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:07,824
detect this,
but if you're talking about just 

704
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:09,744
dispersing kid out into the marketplace 
and the way that that thing gets spread 

705
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:15,980
and disseminated and inserted into 
companies and,

706
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,700
and then potentially allow us points of 
access into these businesses.

707
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,690
And again,
it doesn't matter,

708
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,460
it's,
it's not like they just have to go after

709
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,833
ibm or Raytheon or something.
They're going after everything because 

710
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,920
it potentially is all of interest to 
them.

711
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,843
So their ideas to just steal as much 
technology and as much intellectual 

712
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,470
properties they can and recreate it over

713
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,820
China.
That has been the,

714
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,810
the plan.
I don't want to keep,

715
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:38,980
I don't want to,
you know,

716
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,690
uh,
demonize an entire nation,

717
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,513
but they have proven themselves 
enormously adapted doing this and 

718
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,310
they've,
they,

719
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,640
and not that others don't.
Right.

720
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,560
Russia does the same thing.
I'll have a variety of others,

721
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:50,920
you know,
that,

722
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,850
you know,
even,

723
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,900
you know,
a lot of our allies,

724
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:53,734
everybody if to the degree that they 
have the resources and the motivation 

725
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,140
and they consider it an issue related to
national security,

726
00:28:59,141 --> 00:29:01,000
whatever it might be,
they're willing to do it.

727
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:03,790
They're willing to try.
So it is,

728
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,020
uh,
it is interesting.

729
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:05,471
But yeah,
the,

730
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,750
the,
the hallway thing and the zte again,

731
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:08,584
I think the roll out of that con a 
concern and the roll out of sort of 

732
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:13,900
trying to provide guidance has been a 
little clumsy.

733
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,323
So one,
one thing that was speculation was that 

734
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,550
people didn't have to worry about the 
phones,

735
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,390
but what is essentially they're trying 
to do is cripple the company financially

736
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,493
and not allow them to get a foothold in 
America because they're the third 

737
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:31,510
largest cell phone manufacturer in the 
world.

738
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,890
Number one,
apple,

739
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:34,030
number two,
Samsung,

740
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,160
they're number three.
But in America,

741
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,023
no one knows who they are.
And so the idea is what they're trying 

742
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:39,694
to do is make sure that the Chinese 
government doesn't get a foothold in 

743
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:43,204
this company,
in this country where those companies 

744
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,290
are wowway the company while way becomes
a,

745
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,610
a popular brand for people to buy.
And that would allow them,

746
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,280
even if they didn't have any spy device 
on this phone,

747
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,263
it would allow them to get other devices
into people's homes that could 

748
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,490
potentially spy on them and then more 
importantly,

749
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,530
get into companies,
right.

750
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,393
And spying the companies.
And this was one of the pieces of 

751
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:05,644
speculation that I read about was that 
they had certain servers that were 

752
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,260
sending an exorbitant amount of 
information,

753
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,303
uh,
out and they were trying to figure out 

754
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:14,824
what was going on with them and that 
there's like an excessive amount of 

755
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:22,060
information that was data that was 
leaving the servers versus coming in and

756
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:22,894
they're like,
this really seems like some fucked up 

757
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:25,960
Shit's going on with this.

758
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,080
Right.
[inaudible] first of all,

759
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:30,130
who always already present here in the 
country,

760
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,230
they manufacture a lot of things besides
phones.

761
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:35,820
And so they've already got a pretty big 
footprint in this country and,

762
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,270
and with our allies as well.
Um,

763
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,583
so I think it's smart to consider the 
nature of a particular regime or 

764
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,270
government,
you know,

765
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,133
when you're talking about the potential 
for their products to enter into the 

766
00:30:56,861 --> 00:31:00,130
commercial sector where they may have 
access,

767
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,293
because if,
if they've shown a pattern of activity 

768
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,210
for acquiring intellectual property,
which is again,

769
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:11,290
a very delicate way to put it,
then I don't think it's a stretch to say

770
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:14,740
we should be concerned by their efforts 
to put,

771
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,290
um,
communications gear,

772
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,600
even if it seems pedestrian at the 
outset,

773
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,730
uh,
into the marketplace.

774
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,750
So I,
I'm not sure that I'm,

775
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,603
I'm buying the idea that it's some 
nefarious plan to shut out Huawei so 

776
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,970
that either they don't get a foothold in
the phone business.

777
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,770
Um,
no,

778
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,750
and I say that because I had been,
you know,

779
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,290
30 years I've been dealing with a 
Chinese,

780
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,120
uh,
in terms of their,

781
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,460
uh,
efforts to acquire information posted on

782
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,350
the government and commercial side of 
things.

783
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,130
So,
uh,

784
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,400
I come at it from a very cynical point 
of view,

785
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,880
a much like I did with the Iranian issue
and,

786
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:54,160
and the likelihood that they have not 
been living up to,

787
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
you know,
they're,

788
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:58,090
they're part of the bargain and people 
will say,

789
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:58,601
well,
again,

790
00:31:58,601 --> 00:31:59,700
I go back to the same thing.
Well,

791
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,553
boy,
boy them inspecting and they've been 

792
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,320
complying with all of that.
Well,

793
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,480
yeah,
you know,

794
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,110
there's limited amount of inspection 
that we have to their civilian sites and

795
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,510
[inaudible] it's not a secret,
you know,

796
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,640
at this point,
it shouldn't be a secret that again,

797
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,420
we have no access to their military 
facilities.

798
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:15,540
So,
um,

799
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,423
I,
I tend to look at things in that view 

800
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:18,904
and I,
and I,

801
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,100
I,
if I see a pattern of activity,

802
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:21,881
uh,
I'm,

803
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:22,714
I'm very reluctant to think they're 
somehow going to stop that pattern of 

804
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,200
activity for whatever reason.

805
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,700
So again,
North Korea,

806
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:29,020
same thing.
The problem with all of this,

807
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:29,831
North Korea,
Iran,

808
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:30,970
Syria,
and chemical weapons.

809
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,310
The problem with all of that,
I realize I'm kind of jumping around and

810
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:34,190
I've just,
uh,

811
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,040
uh,
uh,

812
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,300
walway's over here,
but is,

813
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,920
uh,
the verification.

814
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,243
It's always the week Lincoln,
any type of agreement related to a 

815
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,250
containing a weapons program is 
verification.

816
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:48,190
And we know that we,
you know,

817
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,850
it's,
it's something we should know anyway.

818
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,620
We keep,
we seem to keep forgetting it.

819
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,120
So,
uh,

820
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,570
unless we can lock that down with the 
North Koreans,

821
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,681
then,
you know,

822
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:58,514
a deal with them or a deal with the 
Iranians or deal with a Syrians over 

823
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:02,560
their chemical weapons efforts.
And it's,

824
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,070
it's,
it's not worth anything.

825
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
So that's,
that's where the focus has to be.

826
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,723
And for whatever reason,
the previous administration was keen to 

827
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,024
get this deal done and they were willing
to set aside this issue of all the 

828
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:17,060
military sites set aside the issue of 
ballistic missiles.

829
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,893
And by the way,
that deal that president has just 

830
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,864
scuttled,
did nothing to impact or effect or tamp 

831
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:26,784
down or moderate their behavior.
They've got more influenced in the 

832
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,170
Middle East and they've had ever before,
they're engaged in more,

833
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,570
uh,
activity related to,

834
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,730
uh,
you know,

835
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,950
uh,
the countries in the Middle East against

836
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,320
our interests other than they have been 
in,

837
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,840
in decades.
So that,

838
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,090
that all by itself should tell us,
well,

839
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,503
you know,
I'm not saying that they're using all 

840
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,170
the money.
We gave them to a support,

841
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,070
you know,
uh,

842
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,810
actions against our interest by 
Hezbollah or by a revolutionary guard or

843
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:58,430
others.
But they are.

844
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,060
And so,
you know,

845
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,610
I,
I,

846
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,443
again,
I don't have a lot of angst over the 

847
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,124
idea that we,
we step away from the deal for a period 

848
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:06,494
of time.
Maybe we can come up with something 

849
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,664
better and we should,
we should always keep the mock a 

850
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,543
diplomacy open,
always have a channel of communications 

851
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,310
that's important.

852
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,173
Keep doing that,
but be pragmatic and realistic about 

853
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:17,900
what you got.
And right now we don't,

854
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:20,420
we don't have that much and don't buy 
walway phones.

855
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,323
Don't.
Wow.

856
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,580
Interesting that actually,
Kayla,

857
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,423
I know they make a great father,
but that came up in that and the CIA 

858
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:27,950
confirmation hearing.
Oh really?

859
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,240
Yeah.
They literally said,

860
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,600
um,
I forget which senator it was asked Gina

861
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,433
Hospital about Huawei and zte and um,
I don't know where they were going with 

862
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:40,070
it,
but then it devolved into just trying to

863
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,230
get us all those Senate confirmation 
questions do,

864
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:43,390
it just comes at,
you know,

865
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,031
the senator saying,
well,

866
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:45,770
I just want a yes or a no answer.
You know,

867
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,843
like,
wait a minute,

868
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,530
why don't you want some detail?
But,

869
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:51,500
so they say yes or no.
Would you buy Huawei in Chino Hospital?

870
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,400
Was like,
well,

871
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:54,170
no,
I wouldn't buy a hallway fault.

872
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:56,270
Okay,
there's your answer.

873
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,433
So,
but I'm sure it left a lot of people 

874
00:34:58,641 --> 00:34:59,870
wondering and scratching their heads and
go,

875
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:01,510
what are they talking about Chinese 
phones for it?

876
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,670
That's a weird thing to ask someone yes 
or a no.

877
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:07,160
It seems like it was pretty complex 
situation.

878
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,380
Yeah.
Are you,

879
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,790
uh,
are we gonna take care of North Korea?

880
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:11,541
Yes or no?
I,

881
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,400
you know what I mean?
Well,

882
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:13,631
I,
I,

883
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:14,151
you know,
it,

884
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,580
it becomes a bit of a side show and it's
a format as well.

885
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,380
Any confirmation hearing is,
you know,

886
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,450
five minutes for each senator and he 
can't,

887
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,284
you know,
they spend three minutes making a 

888
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:23,260
statement,
you know,

889
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,660
that they can then send back and sound 
clips to their constituents.

890
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,300
Uh,
maybe they get a question in and,

891
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,810
and it kind of goes from there.
So it's,

892
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,950
you don't really learn much,
which is fine.

893
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:34,963
You know,
they learned a lot in the closed door 

894
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:36,704
sessions and we rely on the senators to 
make decisions when it's classified 

895
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,070
information on behalf of the people they
represent.

896
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:43,020
So that's how it's supposed to work.
Yeah.

897
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,003
What do I know?

898
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,823
I always like to finish my sentences 
with what do I know when my wife always 

899
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:48,860
says,
what are you talking?

900
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,590
Why do you do that?
What are you leaving the impression that

901
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:54,180
you don't know anything?
People are gonna say,

902
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:57,060
well,
why is he off the hook a little bit when

903
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,940
we get out of here?
What do I know it is what it is?

904
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:02,220
Thinking about what I said,
what the fuck do I know?

905
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:04,850
It's like running up the flag pole to 
salutes.

906
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,143
What are you most concerned with?
If you look at all the international 

907
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,660
stuff that's going on.
Yeah,

908
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,340
that's a really good question.
Um,

909
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,660
is there one thing that you don't think 
people are looking at?

910
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,390
Well,
you know,

911
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,790
I give people a,
you know,

912
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,770
a lot of credit.
I think people are a lot more um,

913
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,740
engaged then sometimes I think the media
gives them credit for,

914
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,953
uh,
I mean listen to conversations I have 

915
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,300
when people want to talk about something
other than Joe Rogan,

916
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,570
I get the impression that they are 
paying attention to what's happening out

917
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:37,090
there.

918
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,480
Um,
and I,

919
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:40,314
yeah,
Iran.

920
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,293
Is it a big deal?
Well it is a big deal but it's a 

921
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,420
regional issue.
Um,

922
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,050
and I think there is a,
uh,

923
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:50,910
a way we're going to get some success 
here.

924
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:55,170
I think it actually is going to work out
to our benefit.

925
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,350
I'm not buying the doomsayers you say 
it's,

926
00:36:57,351 --> 00:37:01,410
it's all heading to a conflict,
so I'm not looking at that one.

927
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,920
You know,
nothing really stands out.

928
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,783
I guess if you said,
what's the biggest concern from a 

929
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,140
security perspective to the,
to the country,

930
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,540
it would be the same thing.
It's been last year and the year before.

931
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,374
And for a number of years,
which is the frailty of our 

932
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:19,740
infrastructure and its susceptibility to
either cyber attack or physical attack.

933
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,960
And that's the power grid power net,
all of that.

934
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,953
The banking system and water,
Russian submarines camped out over the 

935
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,830
internet lines and the ocean.
I know,

936
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,470
which sounds like a cold war movie.
Right.

937
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,760
But it happens.
I mean,

938
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,843
the Russians,
the Russians never thought there was a 

939
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:39,620
peace dividend from the end of the Cold 
War.

940
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,860
They never thought the Cold War ended.
And we,

941
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,763
we all act surprised that Putin was 
engaged in meddling in the 2016 

942
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,800
election.
Of course he was.

943
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,300
They've been through it that forever.
So,

944
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,220
and we have to them as well.
Right?

945
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,190
Oh,
I don't know about that.

946
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,790
Wow.
Maybe from a defensive point of,

947
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,380
sure.
We're just looking out for our own.

948
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,540
Here's what I would say about that is,
um,

949
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,543
and again,
everybody speaks from their own 

950
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:08,280
experience.
People have their own perspective.

951
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,960
My perspective is based on what I've 
seen,

952
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,771
uh,
in,

953
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,920
in a lot of places around this planet.
Uh,

954
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,993
we better hope we do it and we've been 
hope we do it well because it's a very 

955
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:22,110
aggressive world out there.
And so when people kind of roll our eyes

956
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,370
and go,
Oh wow,

957
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,290
we do it as well,
you know,

958
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,330
so we kind of like dismissing the whole 
activity.

959
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,410
I guess my point is,
yeah,

960
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:29,640
I get what you're saying.
You know?

961
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,270
Okay.
We,

962
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,103
you know,
I'm not saying it from a self righteous 

963
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:32,544
point that the Chinese are very good at 
acquiring an intellectual property or 

964
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:36,700
I'm not saying it from self righteous 
points.

965
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:38,590
The Russians had been meddling in our 
elections.

966
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,180
I'm just saying that's the way it is.
You better hope we do it very,

967
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:44,014
very well.
That's my argument for people that are 

968
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,900
super progressive and really

969
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,560
bro,
when the,

970
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,650
when it comes to these conversations,
I always say,

971
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,940
all right,
if the world is the way it's described,

972
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,863
if China really is constantly meddling,
if Russia is really actively trying to 

973
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:05,800
sabotage our elections,
if I ran is really doing what the,

974
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,713
what should we do?
You don't think that we should be 

975
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,610
involved in,
in meddling,

976
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,463
you don't think should be involved in 
manipulating or monitoring or making 

977
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:15,990
sure that our interest are safe or that 
we're not going to get attacked.

978
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,880
The idea that we're never going to get 
attacked,

979
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,230
you know,
no one's going to get attacked.

980
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,530
That doesn't even,
well,

981
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:24,870
you look at human history,
that is completely preposterous.

982
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,943
The inside of the,
all the tax and all wars going to 

983
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,220
somehow or another stop because you eat 
vegan.

984
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,910
Right?
That's fucking crazy.

985
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,850
I mean,
that's a crazy way to look at the world.

986
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,100
And that leaves you incredibly 
vulnerable to attack.

987
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,910
No,
it does.

988
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,660
It does it.
But that,

989
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,890
but you're right,
I hadn't thought about it,

990
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:41,160
but,
but that is this notion that if we,

991
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,020
if we just,
we have to speak to our better angels.

992
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,540
You know Jesus.
Well that's great because nobody else is

993
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,374
going to write.
Every other nation acts in its own best 

994
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:49,974
interest.
And we're the ones who seem to always 

995
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:54,040
apologize for it,
but we better hope that we do because it

996
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,180
is a chaotic,
messy,

997
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:58,150
aggressive place out there.
And you may want it to be different,

998
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,020
but it's not.
And it's kind of like that,

999
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,940
that questioning today and the CIA 
designate confirmation hearing.

1000
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,470
How do you feel about it?
Well,

1001
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,540
at the end of the day,
it doesn't matter how you feel about it.

1002
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,000
What are the laws on the books?
Follow those laws,

1003
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,153
you know,
protecting American interests and in 

1004
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:15,820
national security.
And if you don't feel good about it,

1005
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:16,654
then leave and go do something else.
But this idea that somehow we're all 

1006
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,771
gonna.
I mean,

1007
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:21,650
could you imagine,
you know,

1008
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:23,710
a combat gate out there and half of them
decide,

1009
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:24,131
well,
I mean,

1010
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,380
I don't really feel good about this 
particular action.

1011
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,750
You know,
maybe we should stay back it.

1012
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,190
That's not how the world works.
So I know,

1013
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,450
I dunno.
Hey,

1014
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:35,200
it'd be great if we all could be better 
people,

1015
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,034
isn't it?
Again,

1016
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,120
we're talking to,
and you know,

1017
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:39,460
this is coming from a person that has an
experienced combat,

1018
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:40,294
but we're,
we're talking about a bunch of people 

1019
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:42,664
that really don't understand and really 
haven't seen things that you've seen or 

1020
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,610
seen.
The things that the military is seen and

1021
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:49,444
they're talking about the world in this 
sort of idealized rose colored glasses 

1022
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,040
view of things that's not accurate.
And so their,

1023
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:03,340
their version of what America should do 
is based on,

1024
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,690
it's based on ignorance in this idea 
that we don't need intelligence,

1025
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,643
we don't need a military.
We don't need a presence in all these 

1026
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:12,600
other countries.
I,

1027
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,080
yeah,
I just don't,

1028
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,003
I don't buy that.
I don't think that makes sense when you 

1029
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:19,450
look at all the different conflicts that
are going on in the world.

1030
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,370
Yeah,
I know,

1031
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,800
I agree.
I think that there is a,

1032
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,320
there's an element out there that says 
if we just take her on as an example,

1033
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,320
um,
in obs spoken with people who,

1034
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,700
who honestly seemed to believe that in 
part because the previous,

1035
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,273
I mean now former secretary carries out 
their public aid and abet President 

1036
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,570
Obama's out there,
but they're all saying,

1037
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,310
well,
but the Iranians have been complying.

1038
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,270
So it's,
you know,

1039
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,330
they're implying that it's our fault.
It's our fault for backing out of this.

1040
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,164
It's our fault that somehow that the 
Iranians have been cheating on the 

1041
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,080
missile sanctions.
Look,

1042
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:49,630
the,
the,

1043
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,463
the,
the UN even agreed in it at the end of 

1044
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:56,780
2014 that in just in October of that 
year,

1045
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,614
the Iranians had been busting a 
agreements related to their ballistic 

1046
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:00,884
missiles and their development.
And we signed that agreement a few 

1047
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,443
months later,
three months later.

1048
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,393
Right.

1049
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,380
Um,
it happens,

1050
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,120
you know,
no matter what you may want to think.

1051
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,710
Uh,
it is a,

1052
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:14,130
it's a,
it's a messy place at the,

1053
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:14,964
I would love it to be different.
I would love everybody to get along and 

1054
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,340
he would be great.
Think what we could do if we didn't have

1055
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:21,620
a defense budget and we can all be on,
be happy.

1056
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:22,031
Yeah,
it'd be,

1057
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:24,140
it'd be wonderful,
but flowers everywhere.

1058
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,430
Oh my God.
And UNICORNS.

1059
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,533
Well maybe not unicorns.
I guess that physically they're just 

1060
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:29,420
sort of real.
You can make one now.

1061
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,090
All the money that you don't spend on 
war.

1062
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,363
That's right.
I could probably have one pop out of my 

1063
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:38,720
watch if I knew how to work it.
I'm impressed.

1064
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:39,554
I know the passcode.
I was about to actually do the passcode 

1065
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,104
and say it out loud.
Sometimes you ever find yourself doing 

1066
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:43,280
that?

1067
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,113
Like when you're typing a number,
I was about to do that here when I was 

1068
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,680
putting in my passcode anyway.
Well,

1069
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,870
people are always going to have an 
idealized version of the world,

1070
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:51,704
especially,
especially with they own experience it 

1071
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:55,100
themselves.
But I think that,

1072
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,510
uh,
for the most part,

1073
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,270
when people think of intelligence 
community,

1074
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:00,104
so thinking about the CIA or the FBI,
generally for whatever reason in 

1075
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,060
America,
you get a negative response.

1076
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,313
People don't think about it in terms of 
something that's necessary and 

1077
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:09,974
beneficial and really a cornerstone of 
the protection of the people in this 

1078
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:17,450
country.
They don't think of it that way.

1079
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,520
No,
I think that's been a tradition.

1080
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,050
Um,
you could go back to,

1081
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,260
we'll work to the end of World War II,
um,

1082
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,850
oss,
which was the,

1083
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,030
the founding organization that then 
became later on the CIA,

1084
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,180
uh,
amazing people involved in,

1085
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:33,560
in oss and basically,
um,

1086
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,800
they,
they,

1087
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,280
um,
what they did during the war,

1088
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:37,790
it was incredible.

1089
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,290
So anyway,
but they do this.

1090
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,620
And while Bill Donald Donovan was the 
head of Oss.

1091
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,250
So imagine all these dedicated people 
dropping in behind enemy lines,

1092
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:51,251
both in the European and Japanese 
theater and engaged in all this activity

1093
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,730
for the years that it took to win that 
war.

1094
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,000
And we got out of the war,
we finished and I,

1095
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:01,790
I'm assuming most people listening know 
how that ended.

1096
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,310
And Truman literally just kind of writes
a little note to Bill Donovan.

1097
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,460
I've seen the note and it says,
you know,

1098
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,800
Bill,
you know,

1099
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,870
hey,
great job,

1100
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:13,520
thanks so much.
Uh,

1101
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:14,870
wrapping it up.
You know,

1102
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:18,770
all the best good luck in the future.
And they shut down Oss,

1103
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,120
right?
They don't need it anymore.

1104
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:20,954
They didn't need the Intel service 
because we won the war and things are 

1105
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,920
gunna be looking pretty good.
Well,

1106
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,290
about a year later,
uh,

1107
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,150
you know,
they,

1108
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,983
they got the band back together because 
what was happening and the Soviets 

1109
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,230
running,
you know,

1110
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,413
all over the place and it was the cold 
war and the Soviets had no intention of 

1111
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:40,440
being benign and living in a community 
of nations.

1112
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,080
And so suddenly they got the band back 
and said,

1113
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:43,561
let's,
okay.

1114
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,810
So that's when the CIA was created in 
1947,

1115
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,700
uh,
at the end of the Cold War,

1116
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,170
uh,
not that long ago.

1117
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,033
Um,
although it seems like ancient history 

1118
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:52,164
now,
there were a lot of serious people in 

1119
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,540
Washington dc at when the wall fell,
who basically said,

1120
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,000
let's wrap up the age so we don't need 
the CIA anymore.

1121
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,740
So there's this pattern of,
you know,

1122
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,440
people want and that's good back.
People want to think the best.

1123
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:05,370
And I,
that's a good thing.

1124
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:06,630
I mean,
Americans tend to be,

1125
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,610
whether it's ideological or,
or naive or optimistic,

1126
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:12,840
whatever it is,
that's a good thing.

1127
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,910
Right?
But it,

1128
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:14,744
it,
it butts up against the reality of how 

1129
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:16,800
the world actually works.

1130
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,660
Well,
because in America,

1131
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:21,240
things are pretty good.
I mean,

1132
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,093
yeah,
they're about as good as it gets in the 

1133
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:25,960
world when you wander around America for
a,

1134
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,843
as a large nation as this is,
things are pretty God damn good for the 

1135
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,074
most part.
Yeah.

1136
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,870
And I think that's part of the problem 
is that these people,

1137
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:37,620
they're not traveling to these war zones
and not experiencing,

1138
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,603
I've talked to so many people that have 
been overseas and been to these places 

1139
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,084
of conflict and they come out with an a 
dark view of what is possible if you're 

1140
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,960
in the wrong place on the planet.

1141
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,853
Yeah.
What people can do to each other is a 

1142
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,150
uh,
yeah,

1143
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,611
it,
it,

1144
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:55,970
it can get messy.
Um,

1145
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,743
but I think there would be value if 
somehow we could enact some program 

1146
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,213
where everybody had to spend a couple of
years in service of some sort of 

1147
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:10,260
military service or oversee service.
I know we had the peace corps and all of

1148
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:10,980
that,
but,

1149
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,561
you know,
and,

1150
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,990
and,
and high school kids say,

1151
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,824
wow,
I went to Bermuda and I built a house 

1152
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:15,683
for a week.
And so I got my international 

1153
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:19,080
experience.
That's better than nothing.

1154
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,400
It's better than nothing.
But I mean,

1155
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:21,234
I think something that would would mean 
people would have a little more skin in 

1156
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:24,180
the game and,
and,

1157
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:24,811
uh,
but you're right.

1158
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:26,370
I mean,
you go to some of these places.

1159
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:28,770
Fourth and fifth world countries.
And uh,

1160
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:29,940
and you do realize,
and I'm an I,

1161
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:31,290
you know,
people roll their eyes,

1162
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,710
but I damn it,
this is the best country in the world.

1163
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,140
And I say that repeatedly and I believe 
it firmly,

1164
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,750
we make mistakes.
There's no doubt about it.

1165
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,030
But we tend to course correct.
We try,

1166
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,100
sometimes it takes a little bit longer.
Uh,

1167
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,350
we,
no matter what administration is there,

1168
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,730
we try to do the right thing.
And so when people talk about,

1169
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,580
you know,
us just stepping off and,

1170
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,140
and not worrying about our place in the 
world,

1171
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,893
uh,
you know,

1172
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,773
someone's going to try to take that 
position on the ladder and it's not 

1173
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:03,750
going to be as benign as,
as we tend to be.

1174
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:04,590
Not always.
Again,

1175
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:06,210
again,
I realize we make mistakes.

1176
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:06,811
That's fine.
Okay,

1177
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:07,644
fine.
I'm not going to self flagellate over 

1178
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,180
it,
but you know,

1179
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,460
still we do a pretty damn good job.

1180
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,550
We tried to be the moral authority of 
the world or the moral compass at least.

1181
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,930
I mean,
that's the thought process behind it for

1182
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:19,570
the most part.
Yeah.

1183
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,950
That's the thought process.
And,

1184
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:21,551
and,
and,

1185
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:22,271
you know,
sometimes,

1186
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:23,104
again,
it's a human endeavor so it's not going 

1187
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:25,494
to work all the time.

1188
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,543
Don't you think that people are more 
open to this idea that it's necessary 

1189
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:32,290
now because of the Russian situation and
because of understanding the,

1190
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,124
the amount of power that Putin wheels 
and the way he has just really ultimate 

1191
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:39,610
control over that part of the world.
And he really does.

1192
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,653
I mean,
you could drone on all you want about 

1193
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,400
democratic elections,
but we all know that's horse shit.

1194
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,800
I mean,
he fucking kills anybody over there.

1195
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:50,110
That's a legitimate threat.
Kills anybody over there.

1196
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,840
Journalists over there.
I mean,

1197
00:47:51,841 --> 00:47:52,321
look,
they just,

1198
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:54,550
they tried to scribble and his daughter 
you'll,

1199
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:55,120
yes,
she was,

1200
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,220
she was collateral damage.
But uh,

1201
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,130
put some shit on a door knob.
Yeah,

1202
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,273
they touched with their hands.
I nerve agent them and put them in the 

1203
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:04,044
hospital.
And who knows if they're even going to 

1204
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:05,850
recover from that.
I mean,

1205
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:06,451
think about it.
She's,

1206
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,860
she's out of the hospital now.
She's doing good.

1207
00:48:07,861 --> 00:48:09,270
He's doing a little bit better.
Uh,

1208
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,193
but I mean,
think about what that entails as an 

1209
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:11,571
operation.
Right.

1210
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:12,111
Not that they haven't,
they,

1211
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:13,140
they've been doing this since they 
killed,

1212
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,580
what's his name?
Trotsky in Mexico.

1213
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:15,330
Right.
I mean they,

1214
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,540
this is what they do.
But yeah.

1215
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:20,400
Markov liftfund ankle,
Alexander Olympia and ankle,

1216
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,700
they killed him with a polonium and that
was just a handful of years ago.

1217
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,430
So they go after Sergei,
he's living in a small,

1218
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,350
relatively small quiet,
you know,

1219
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:30,180
I'm British town,
Salisbury.

1220
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:33,210
And so that requires him to surveil 
Sergei.

1221
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,990
They got to get,
you know,

1222
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,000
cause you always had to do that.
You gotta do some operation like this.

1223
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:37,040
You gotta know what you're getting into 
it.

1224
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,460
You got to figure out how you're going 
to do it.

1225
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,950
And so there's a lot of,
you got to front load all that work.

1226
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:41,784
Right.
And so they're doing all this 

1227
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:43,074
surveillance.
They're figuring out what their 

1228
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,030
operational game plan's going to be.
You know,

1229
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,310
this is in the UK and their whole point 
of the exercise is to teach other people

1230
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,770
don't,
don't betray us.

1231
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,800
Right.
And,

1232
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:54,643
and,
uh,

1233
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,860
so,
you know,

1234
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:57,090
then they put this on a door,
not,

1235
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,620
they didn't care who else touch said 
Nah,

1236
00:48:58,621 --> 00:49:00,510
it wasn't like they could,
they could guarantee that,

1237
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:01,344
you know,
the postman and a variety of visitors 

1238
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:04,680
weren't going to come through the door.
So they really,

1239
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:06,300
they really don't care.
Um,

1240
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,620
yeah,
he is,

1241
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,600
uh,
he is definitely,

1242
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:11,730
he's a,
he's an old school kgb,

1243
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,640
very easy cat to understand,
you know,

1244
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,760
and we've always kind of acted like,
you know,

1245
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,330
we don't get it or somehow he's going to
change his stripes.

1246
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,164
He's never going to change his stripes 
and he's going to always act in what he 

1247
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,060
believes to be the best interest of what
he would like to believe.

1248
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,750
Is that still the former Soviet Union 
and Gary

1249
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,680
far off was talking about him and you 
know,

1250
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,563
he's a vocal critic of Putin.
And he was saying that if you look into 

1251
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:39,661
all the different companies that they've
confiscated and acquired,

1252
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:41,710
and you know,
th th th this what they do,

1253
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:42,544
like if they have a political enemy,
they essentially just take over their 

1254
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:48,190
company and charge them with some sort 
of a crime and throw him in jail.

1255
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,010
And they do,
they do this too.

1256
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:49,843
Billionaires,

1257
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:53,330
right?
Kowski he spent years in jail and um,

1258
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,100
and his,
his mistake was,

1259
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,313
uh,
his mistake was he started getting 

1260
00:49:58,431 --> 00:49:59,264
political aspirations.
And so the deal has always been with 

1261
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:04,970
Putin as far as the oligarchs concern.
You keep your nose in business,

1262
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,800
right?
You focus on your business,

1263
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:07,803
you know,
there's going to be a cut going towards 

1264
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:09,880
the government.
Um,

1265
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,540
and you're good because it furthers my 
agenda.

1266
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,190
Right now you're building up these 
businesses and you know,

1267
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,200
we're making some money on the side,
but as soon as any of them start to veer

1268
00:50:22,221 --> 00:50:25,010
off that path and maybe get some 
political aspiration,

1269
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,570
then it's done.
And that's,

1270
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:27,980
and that's when turns on them.
So,

1271
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:29,360
and he's been very effective at doing 
it.

1272
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,373
Yeah,
I mean terrifyingly so it does it open 

1273
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,990
publicly.
Yeah.

1274
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,053
Yeah.
And it gets,

1275
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,033
again,
we look at it from a different 

1276
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:36,950
perspective.

1277
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,950
We look at it go like,
how could people with a straight face,

1278
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:42,380
you know,
stand by while he gets a fourth term and

1279
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:43,200
he's just like,
you know,

1280
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,430
president for life.
Right.

1281
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,500
Well,
look over China.

1282
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,560
She has spent the past few years locking
that down,

1283
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,900
right.
Building up the security apparatus.

1284
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,360
Um,
you know,

1285
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,890
kind of stepping on this idea that 
somehow there's a rule of law.

1286
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,380
Uh,
he's now built back up this,

1287
00:50:57,381 --> 00:50:58,214
this,
this a cult of personality that we 

1288
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,004
haven't really seen since Shell Ping or 
are certainly Mau and he's there for 

1289
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:05,924
good.
And so that gives them a strategic 

1290
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:08,121
advantage,
right?

1291
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:10,250
Because they can look at problems in the
long haul.

1292
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,950
Whereas here we're looking at it in an 
election cycle.

1293
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,030
So when we've got a major issue to deal 
with with China,

1294
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,040
she's not looking at it and thinking,
okay,

1295
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,400
well yeah I got to sort this out in the 
next short period of time.

1296
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,770
He's looking at it and thinking trump's 
got maybe two years left.

1297
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,620
Right,
right.

1298
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,630
Maybe,
maybe he gets reelected,

1299
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:27,770
maybe he doesn't,
you know,

1300
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,910
I have no idea.
But that's how he,

1301
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,183
that's how he's processing this and it's
going to be a transitionary time in 

1302
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:34,094
between the two candidates or the two 
presidents where things get real sloppy 

1303
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,650
and they might be able to slip in 
something.

1304
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,200
Right.
And you talk about that.

1305
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,950
I mean the Chinese really do play the 
long game,

1306
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,630
right?
They really play the long game.

1307
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:46,850
They'll,
they'll put a,

1308
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:50,150
an asset here in the country to go to 
school.

1309
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,360
Right.
And they'll,

1310
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,233
their only job is to get excellent 
grades and then they'll go to grad 

1311
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:58,820
school and they'll get excellent grades 
and then they'll go get a job somewhere.

1312
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,490
And it doesn't really matter necessarily
where they get a job,

1313
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,563
but they'll get a job and then they'll 
get another job and eventually they are 

1314
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:04,904
working at a raytheon or they're working
at corning or they're working at some 

1315
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,060
company that's got some relevance,
um,

1316
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,000
from their perspective in terms of what 
they do.

1317
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,090
And that's a 25,
30 year commitment.

1318
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:14,831
Right.
And they,

1319
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,120
and they,
they do that all the time.

1320
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,223
And you know,
we tend to look at things in a shorter 

1321
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,760
timeframe,
right.

1322
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,030
I mean,
even from an Intel service,

1323
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,023
we'll,
our officers will get out there and 

1324
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:26,451
they'll think,
okay,

1325
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:28,010
we've got to make some recruitment's,
you know,

1326
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:28,844
and I got maybe two years here and on 
the ground and it's that sort of 

1327
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:34,220
deployment or that sort of tour.
And,

1328
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:38,330
uh,
it's not that 30 year commitment because

1329
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,223
if I'm the officer,
I'm getting promoted based on how many 

1330
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:42,104
recruitments I get,
I'm not getting necessarily promoted 

1331
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:46,730
based on how well I handle assets that 
have already been promoted.

1332
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,850
And that was a critic,
the plot of the young American,

1333
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,510
the American's show,
right?

1334
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,563
The,
the show about Russian spies who 

1335
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,720
pretended to be just normal American 
citizens moved in,

1336
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,880
did the whole thing talk with the normal
accent.

1337
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,373
That's right.
That came out of that New Jersey 

1338
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,340
incident with Anna Chapman.
And that was those,

1339
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:09,650
those individuals were just basically 
there to exist.

1340
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:10,484
Right.
Their whole point of of being was just 

1341
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:12,404
to see whether they bump into somebody 
of interest and they wouldn't going to 

1342
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:16,670
be responsible for them developing that 
potential target.

1343
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:17,743
That would be somebody else's 
responsibility and that person who was 

1344
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:21,530
had the responsibility to develop that 
target,

1345
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,573
it wouldn't be their responsibility to 
maybe task them or make some sort light 

1346
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:27,690
pitch that would be somebody else's 
responsibility.

1347
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:28,524
So there's people up that food chain 
that take on more and more 

1348
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:33,350
responsibility if they find happened to 
find the targets of interest.

1349
00:53:33,351 --> 00:53:35,570
That's,
and that's just the resources devoted to

1350
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,190
one part of the country.
So it's a cautious,

1351
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:40,830
well thought out,
long term plan.

1352
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,881
Yeah.
I mean it's,

1353
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:42,810
it's,
and it's,

1354
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,120
I mean sometimes the Russians are just 
as like a shotgun approach,

1355
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:45,300
right.

1356
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,310
They'll pitch everybody and see what 
happens right there.

1357
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,144
They're not quite as,
as a patient and as long term as the 

1358
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:52,360
Chinese are.
Um,

1359
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,433
we've caught,
yeah.

1360
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,650
Chinese spies doing this as well.
Oh,

1361
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:56,101
sure.
Yeah.

1362
00:53:56,101 --> 00:53:57,110
We just bagged one,
uh,

1363
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,240
who was working on behalf of the Chinese
government against the interests of the,

1364
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:02,940
of the agency.
How long ago was this?

1365
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:04,190
And it's just passed a,
I mean,

1366
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:06,250
it's,
it's become public over the past weekend

1367
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,750
in particular,
but it's been bubbling away for a while.

1368
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,580
What's this dude's name?
Um,

1369
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,660
I,
yeah,

1370
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:15,630
I'm going to leave it at that only 
because it's know,

1371
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,660
I'm not sure if I've seen it in print,
but a Chinese American and,

1372
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,290
um,
you know,

1373
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:26,100
obviously part of the attraction for 
bringing that person into the agency was

1374
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:27,500
there Chinese language.
Right,

1375
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:28,171
right.
Well,

1376
00:54:28,171 --> 00:54:29,004
part of the attraction from the Chinese 
Intel perspective is the Chinese ethnic 

1377
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:34,410
background,
first generation,

1378
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:35,580
second generation,
third generation,

1379
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:36,150
doesn't matter.

1380
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,020
They tend to play off that very well.
So anyway,

1381
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:43,890
this individual worked for the agency 
for a period of time,

1382
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,410
uh,
then left and then,

1383
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,270
uh,
set up shop overseas.

1384
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:52,530
Um,
and then his actions became suspect.

1385
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,500
Um,
and so that's,

1386
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,110
that's when we ended up getting him.
But uh,

1387
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,980
that,
that happens.

1388
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:01,650
And when you catch somebody who's been 
engaged in that first thought is,

1389
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,240
you know,
thank God we caught them.

1390
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,470
Um,
and the second is how,

1391
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,390
you know,
how does someone,

1392
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,320
how does someone do that?
How does somebody now I say that again,

1393
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:12,900
not to be self righteous because we're 
always out there looking for targets,

1394
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,800
you know,
to recruit,

1395
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,900
to turn on their country.
So,

1396
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,513
you know,
if we could find ourselves in Iranian 

1397
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:19,950
scientists,
it's not like we would be coy and say,

1398
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:20,784
well,
we don't want to put them in under that 

1399
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:22,830
stress of recruiting them.

1400
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,720
Of course we do for national security 
interests.

1401
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,940
But I mean,
just from a psychological perspective,

1402
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:27,270
you,
you,

1403
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,350
you,
you think about that,

1404
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,790
you know,
in terms of our ideas,

1405
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,280
that we're doing that stuff for good and
that they're doing that stuff for bag,

1406
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,640
which is very convenient that we think 
that way,

1407
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,253
but,
right,

1408
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,000
right.
But I,

1409
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,481
I guess,
uh,

1410
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:38,851
you're,
you're,

1411
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:39,770
you're absolutely right.
And,

1412
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:40,640
and,
you know,

1413
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,020
I understand they'll,
the people out there who say,

1414
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:43,561
well,
that's,

1415
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:45,240
you know,
you can't make that equivalent.

1416
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,550
I don't know.
But I had never had any problem.

1417
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,370
I never had any problem,
uh,

1418
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:52,170
determining the good people from the bad
people.

1419
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,420
You know.
And that's like today,

1420
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:55,940
one of the senators in the confirmation 
hearing,

1421
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,110
and he,
I'm sorry to keep going back to the CIA,

1422
00:55:58,111 --> 00:56:00,750
does a director designate confirmation 
hearings up on the hill.

1423
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,800
But,
uh,

1424
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:02,663
one of the senators,
it almost sound like he was trying to 

1425
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:09,030
make some moral equivalency between 
terrorists and agency officers who were,

1426
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,160
uh,
doing what they were,

1427
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,013
uh,
allowed to do underneath the laws of 

1428
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:14,100
that time.

1429
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,680
And the Doj Department of Justice 
regulations,

1430
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,420
uh,
and legal readings.

1431
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,460
And,
uh,

1432
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,540
and his point was,
well,

1433
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,553
if you a somebody,
well then what happens if one of your 

1434
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:26,614
people got picked up by terrorists and 
they were waterboarded would you think 

1435
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:32,050
that that was justified?
And I'm thinking,

1436
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,560
okay,
wait,

1437
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,990
wait,
it's a very odd construct.

1438
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:39,560
Or if we're for a question and you know,
I think frankly if isis or al Qaeda or,

1439
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,000
or Boko Haram picked up one of our 
people and all they did would waterboard

1440
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:43,541
them,
you know,

1441
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,190
that would be a happy day,
right?

1442
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:47,230
Because they don't operate under any 
laws,

1443
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,210
which is what you need.
A hospital said she handled the question

1444
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:52,240
very well and kind of shut it down.
Um,

1445
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,780
but this idea that sometimes you'll bump
into that where people,

1446
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,110
I don't know what it is,
it the,

1447
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:00,970
they're apologists

1448
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,700
act as if we're the bad guys and anyway,
yeah,

1449
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:05,690
yeah.
What am I to know?

1450
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:06,890
That's exactly what it is,
right?

1451
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,090
I was about to say,
what do I know?

1452
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,520
Dammit.
He pulled away from it.

1453
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,223
But that is exactly what it is.
It's like there's apologist and they're 

1454
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,423
also trying to frame a narrative instead
of trying to understand the situation 

1455
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:22,790
objectively,
instead of really asking someone who was

1456
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:23,624
there,
asking a bunch of people who were there 

1457
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:29,060
getting a sense of what was the climate,
what was going on,

1458
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,480
what actually happened.
Instead they're trying to frame it in it

1459
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,333
like wouldn't it be justified if someone
got hold of one of our troops and did 

1460
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:37,730
that to them?
Would that be justified?

1461
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,650
There's scoring Brownie points.

1462
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:40,561
Yeah.
Yeah.

1463
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:41,400
No,
I think that's true.

1464
00:57:41,401 --> 00:57:42,234
I think there's so little,
and it's obviously much worse right now 

1465
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:45,630
with the,
with the current administration,

1466
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:49,420
the president trump,
it just seems like nobody,

1467
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,450
I mean it's like World War One,
right?

1468
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:53,190
Everybody's in their trenches throwing 
hand grenades,

1469
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:55,080
each other.
Nobody's in the middle ground.

1470
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,300
Nobody is even trying to get up and go 
into the middle crown.

1471
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,180
And so nobody's having those 
conversations like you said,

1472
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:00,960
where they,
they,

1473
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,793
they even make a lame attempt to try to 
understand what the other perspective 

1474
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:08,760
might be.
And in particular,

1475
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,980
it's exhausting in the sense that not 
everything that this administration,

1476
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:14,814
and again,
you know,

1477
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,440
the caveat being I didn't vote for 
trump,

1478
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,970
I didn't vote for Clinton.
I,

1479
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,833
you know,
we've got 320 million people in this 

1480
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:21,474
country.
You think we could've come up with two 

1481
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:24,000
other candidates,
but,

1482
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,470
uh,
who did you vote for?

1483
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,730
Uh,
you know what,

1484
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:28,980
I,
this sounds really lame,

1485
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:33,360
but I just sat it out.
I couldn't get myself to go vote for,

1486
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,430
I just thought,
I mean,

1487
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,860
I was gonna vote for Ronald Reagan,
his ashes or something,

1488
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:40,620
but I figured I'd be the only person.
So,

1489
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,240
um,
I didn't,

1490
00:58:42,241 --> 00:58:43,140
I didn't vote.
I couldn't,

1491
00:58:43,141 --> 00:58:45,870
I couldn't figure out how we got to that
point.

1492
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,020
Um,
and yeah,

1493
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,430
the one person who should really be 
pissed off was Bernie Sanders.

1494
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:51,264
I mean,
the only collusion we've really proven 

1495
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:52,854
up to this point,
it's a DNC colluding to keep Bernie 

1496
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:55,340
down.
Yeah.

1497
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,100
And people sweep that under the rug so 
quick.

1498
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,083
It's so adorable.
It's adorable how people just make it 

1499
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,520
like,
that's not a big deal.

1500
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,480
The deleting of 30,000 emails,
not a big deal.

1501
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:13,670
The collusion with the DNC to rig the 
primary's not a big deal.

1502
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,841
Yeah.
And Bernie,

1503
00:59:14,841 --> 00:59:17,010
God bless him,
he played the good soldier and you know,

1504
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,900
fell on the sword and hasn't really,
well,

1505
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,990
he hasn't made much of an issue of it.
I think it's,

1506
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,430
he has aspirations

1507
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,263
to move forward and the knows they owe 
him one now and he knows that Hillary 

1508
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,500
Clinton is essentially done.
That's interesting.

1509
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,180
If they try to bring her back in 2020 
people go fucking crazy.

1510
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:33,041
Like,
Hey,

1511
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:33,874
you really got it.
You imagine she might have actually be 

1512
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,131
thinking that.
Well,

1513
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:38,380
I'm sure she was.
Yeah,

1514
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,283
they've probably got an or on a vitamin 
IV drip right now and given her hormone 

1515
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:45,530
replacement therapy and I started to do 
yoga.

1516
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't think she'll,
I don't,

1517
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,510
I just don't see her being resurrected.
But maybe we'll try.

1518
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,690
Maybe.
So I tell you,

1519
00:59:51,691 --> 00:59:53,900
I do think Joe Biden is coming in.
You think so?

1520
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,730
Yeah.
I think he's viewing this.

1521
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:58,760
I think he's very upset with himself.
Not upset with others,

1522
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,594
but I think he,
he probably thinks at this stage of the 

1523
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,420
game and times were different.
It was tough.

1524
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:03,254
We didn't regarding his family,
but I think he probably regrets not 

1525
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:06,260
going in the last time.

1526
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,503
And I think we're going to see him throw
his hat in the ring because he's going 

1527
01:00:09,491 --> 01:00:11,450
to look around and he's going to think,
what am I up against?

1528
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:14,720
I'm up against a Harris and booker and 
you know who else?

1529
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:17,270
But I mean,
I think he's got some baggage though.

1530
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,970
People forget about when I was in 
Boston,

1531
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:20,804
we used to have Joe Biden tonight at 
stitches comedy club where we would 

1532
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,620
plagiarize each other's jokes because 
Joe Biden,

1533
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,483
people don't remember this,
but in the 1980s he got busted 

1534
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:33,520
plagiarizing Kennedy's speeches.
People forgot about that.

1535
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,760
He ran for president in [inaudible] 88.
Yeah.

1536
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,190
Yeah.
And that's a good point.

1537
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,033
But you know,
everybody loves the guy that's sitting 

1538
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:39,764
on the bench,
right?

1539
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,080
So there were a lot of Democrats,
I think after the fact that we think,

1540
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:43,850
oh my God,
if joe had just run,

1541
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,130
but he's run a couple of times,
it hasn't worked out.

1542
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,450
And so I'll put the chewed him up.
Yeah,

1543
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,530
I mean,
it's real.

1544
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,010
Um,
so I,

1545
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,120
you know,
anyway,

1546
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,540
but what I,
it's,

1547
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,320
it's the politics of it all or are 
fascinating,

1548
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:58,154
but it's just the crazy shit.
When trump was saying they'd beat him 

1549
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:00,464
up,
he's like crazy Joe Biden so that he 

1550
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:04,290
could beat me,
beat me up,

1551
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:09,420
that he would go down fast and hard.
That's what it said.

1552
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,890
I think they should've just gone with 
that.

1553
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:15,000
I think they should have done some sort 
of celebrity match.

1554
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:17,180
That's what I was done.
I was saying that like,

1555
01:01:17,181 --> 01:01:18,890
let me,
let me be the commentator.

1556
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,940
Can you see what that,
I mean,

1557
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,270
that'd be the president of,
he definitely peaked this man.

1558
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,150
Both of them would die.
Yeah.

1559
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,821
Oh No,
no.

1560
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:27,830
They get in the cage and it'd be all 
over.

1561
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:29,570
I'm thinking five minutes at the hair 
pull,

1562
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:31,760
amy pull whatever little hair they have 
left,

1563
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,970
the old school,
the old school wrestling trunks,

1564
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,220
boots that,
oh,

1565
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,440
we got to get this going.

1566
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:47,100
And he was just so ridiculous to see 
trump tweeting that he would beat up Joe

1567
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,620
Biden if they ever fought.
Yeah.

1568
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,800
Who the fuck have you ever fought ever?
If you ever even thrown a punch,

1569
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,930
this is the world we live in.
I mean,

1570
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:54,764
if,
if,

1571
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,450
I mean you think about it,
all the,

1572
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,013
you think,
you think about the things we should be 

1573
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,870
talking about on a daily basis.
Right.

1574
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,193
And yet,
because of the self inflicted wounds 

1575
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:05,564
that they constantly have coming out of 
that White House because of his 

1576
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,570
tweeting,
for the most part,

1577
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,880
people aren't focusing on,
you know,

1578
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:11,570
it's like,
look,

1579
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,810
we should all be able to agree.
Democrats and Republicans should be able

1580
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:15,420
to agree that,
yeah,

1581
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:18,320
if you can get your way to peace on the 
Korean Peninsula,

1582
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,340
that's pretty good.
Yes.

1583
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,100
Um,
no,

1584
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,700
they just released the three North 
Korean prisoners.

1585
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,910
Well,
American citizen prisoners who were held

1586
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,250
in North Korea.
So Secretary Pompei,

1587
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,103
I was flying back right now from 
Pyongyang and he's bringing those three 

1588
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:35,220
back.
That's a good thing.

1589
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,140
That's a very good thing.
But we can't,

1590
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,220
the way they got there,
that freaks people out.

1591
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,800
I am saying,
is nuclear buttons bigger than the other

1592
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:44,140
guys?
And it's like,

1593
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:48,700
but I gotta tell you,
I was really happy watching the video of

1594
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,800
Kim Jong.
Ooh.

1595
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:54,310
And shaking hands with the president of 
South Korea and the meeting and the DMZ.

1596
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,470
I was happy that,
that to me was like,

1597
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:59,280
wow,
like that made me think this might,

1598
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:02,740
they're both smiling.
I know Kim Jon wounds a fucking murderer

1599
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:03,574
and he killed his own uncle,
nephews and all these different people 

1600
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:07,654
that he thought might go against him.
But seeing him shake hands with the 

1601
01:03:12,011 --> 01:03:13,900
president of South Korea made me think 
like,

1602
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:14,770
wow,
they might

1603
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,240
settle this.
They,

1604
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:16,751
they,
they could,

1605
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,580
I mean,
look as a fairy first time,

1606
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,570
uh,
his Grandad,

1607
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,650
uh,
give me a song and then his dad,

1608
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,570
Kim Jong Il,
um,

1609
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,050
neither of them ever step foot on the 
southern side of that.

1610
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,530
DMC on the south side of peace village 
never happened.

1611
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:34,780
So that in itself,
you're absolutely right,

1612
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:37,570
was that,
that's a major development.

1613
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:39,190
Now maybe nothing comes of it,
right?

1614
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,770
It's a low percentage shot yet to agree 
there's so many moving parts.

1615
01:03:41,771 --> 01:03:42,604
So maybe nothing comes of it.
And then I think the administration is 

1616
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,550
making that case saying,
look,

1617
01:03:45,551 --> 01:03:47,170
we have to be realistic,
but you know,

1618
01:03:47,171 --> 01:03:49,420
this is a good thing that it's moving in
that direction.

1619
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:50,923
Right.

1620
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,220
And in fact,
this guy,

1621
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,790
a young guy who actually likes Dennis 
Rodman,

1622
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,600
I mean Jesus Christ in his playing days.
Yeah.

1623
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,400
I like Dennis Rodman a lot.
Right.

1624
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:01,980
I just didn't it to somebody now.
Yeah.

1625
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,570
I didn't get to,
he would develop into the character that

1626
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:05,404
he is now,
but he also seems to be like some sort 

1627
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:11,080
of a spokesman.
If you're America talking to Korea,

1628
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:13,450
it's weird.
Do you remember Robin as a player?

1629
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:15,990
Man was fantastic.
A hustler.

1630
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,050
Ah,
defense.

1631
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:18,860
He was out of rebounding.
That guy could,

1632
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,990
man,
that guy could rebound.

1633
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,410
And if you talk to people that know him 
that we're,

1634
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:23,244
we're partying with him.
That guy would be up all night drinking 

1635
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:29,630
and partying and then show up and play 
fucking phenomenal.

1636
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,500
The next day on zero sleep comes another
title.

1637
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,410
Oh,
good.

1638
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,790
Yeah.
Billy Corgan was friends with Rodman and

1639
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:37,624
billy Corgan from the smashing pumpkins 
on the podcast was talking about how 

1640
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:41,014
they were mad at him because Rodman was 
taking billy corgan partying and then 

1641
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:48,070
showing up the next day with zero sleep 
and playing,

1642
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,870
and they were blaming billy corgan.
He's like,

1643
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:51,340
motherfucker,
I went to sleep.

1644
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,410
He's like,
that guy was still out up.

1645
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,830
That's fantastic.
Pumpkin's and coming out to boise.

1646
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,820
Oh everybody.
Pigs coming out.

1647
01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,830
The boys.
I liked boys.

1648
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,001
Listen,
men,

1649
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,610
the way you talk about it or thinking 
about getting a fucking house out there,

1650
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,720
Wall Street Journal just had some of my 
friends said,

1651
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:07,554
you've got to stop talking about Boise.
But the of the Wall Street Journal just 

1652
01:05:09,921 --> 01:05:11,880
had articles if fastest growing state in
the nation.

1653
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,013
Find a hopes.

1654
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:14,110
Well,
still.

1655
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

1656
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:16,410
Well,
we get so many people coming in.

1657
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,680
We're bringing the wolves,
the sort of,

1658
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,040
sort

1659
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,510
that out.
It's a balancing thing.

1660
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:20,800
Yeah.
Don't hike too far.

1661
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,810
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

1662
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,331
Well,
you could go,

1663
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:23,920
you go 10 minutes outside of,
of,

1664
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:24,540
of,
uh,

1665
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,320
amy,
we're right downtown basically.

1666
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,420
But you go right at 10 minutes time 
church wilderness,

1667
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:31,210
right up in the foothills and you don't 
see anybody in the next name.

1668
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,860
It's fantastic.
Fishing is great.

1669
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:35,680
We got more river mileage than any other
state except for Alaska.

1670
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:37,180
Yeah,
the fishing supposed to be incredible.

1671
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:39,820
Fly Fishing for trout and if you like 
fly fishing,

1672
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:41,380
if you like,
if you like trout,

1673
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,550
this is,
it's a place to be.

1674
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:44,110
I mean other states,
Montana,

1675
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,200
some other spots will say no,
I tell us.

1676
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:50,260
But them two is what it really,
it shouldn't be.

1677
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,960
Whose number one?
It's like they're both fucking awesome.

1678
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:53,801
I mean we,
we,

1679
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:54,634
to be fair,
we got the best trout but still better 

1680
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:56,794
than Montana.

1681
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,253
I think.
So.

1682
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:01,060
Well of a trout off.
Well,

1683
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:01,894
I have friends up there in,
what is that fucking we're firstlight 

1684
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,020
is,
where the hell are they?

1685
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,870
They're in some small town,
some ski resort area.

1686
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:13,390
Real high end ski place up in Montana.
No,

1687
01:06:13,391 --> 01:06:13,860
no,
no,

1688
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,980
no.
Oh uh,

1689
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:16,743
oh.
Catch him.

1690
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,940
The cat town is catch them.
The resort at Sun Valley.

1691
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,700
They rave about it.
They say it's fucking incredible.

1692
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,553
Yeah.
We were just up there.

1693
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,273
We've got a place up in another ski area
and it sits on a lake and like Sun 

1694
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,000
Valley Ketchum doesn't have a big 
summertime.

1695
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,530
They'll traction attraction like the 
massive lake.

1696
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,364
But our place sits on a pay at lake and 
it's got a great little ski place 

1697
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:40,420
nearby.
But there are a lot of areas like that.

1698
01:06:40,421 --> 01:06:41,830
But catch him,
catch him is a great town,

1699
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,840
great little community.
Um,

1700
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,030
the skiing at Sun Valley's is,
is really good.

1701
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:48,150
It's not like Aspen or,
or good,

1702
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,010
it's not exactly,
exactly,

1703
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:50,903
but it's park city where there places 
those are just filled with rich people 

1704
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,201
too.
It's like,

1705
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:57,034
it's,
they're overrun with like high end 

1706
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:00,490
stores.
And look,

1707
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:02,380
I love Sun Valley.
I think it's gorgeous.

1708
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:03,580
I mean,
I'm not Sun Valley,

1709
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,580
um,
uh,

1710
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:07,480
Deer Valley,
Utah.

1711
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:10,030
It's fucking gorgeous up there.
But man,

1712
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:12,790
it's just all like wealthy skiing 
places.

1713
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,710
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1714
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:14,380
It,
yeah.

1715
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,370
When I want to spend,
you know,

1716
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,770
$2,000 for a pair of ski boots,
that's where I go.

1717
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,290
But if you want like a normal burger and
a beer,

1718
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,400
you know,
catch him or mccall up there in Idaho,

1719
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:22,730
it's,
it's,

1720
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:23,563
it's,
it's really good.

1721
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:24,071
You're gonna,

1722
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:25,680
you're gonna love,
you're gonna get a great reception up.

1723
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:26,850
I can't wait.
Boyz II men.

1724
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:30,100
I purposely decided to go there just to 
check it out.

1725
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:31,630
I decided to book a Gig up there.

1726
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,510
Just take a couple of days and,
and you know,

1727
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,250
spend a little time up there,
maybe do some fish and we'll,

1728
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,630
we'll go fishing.
I'll take you out fishing.

1729
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,030
Well,
I have a friend up there that I actually

1730
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:41,500
just know from Internet,
but he,

1731
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:43,010
uh,
he got into knows,

1732
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,223
well,
I know people who actually know him in 

1733
01:07:45,551 --> 01:07:46,241
real life,
but I've,

1734
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,900
I've only talked to him online,
but he's got a pet coyote.

1735
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,363
He actually took a kylie as a cub and 
we've talked about him on the podcast 

1736
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,024
many times.
I'm going to meet his pet coyote and he 

1737
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:57,364
recently got a pet badger.
He found a fucking baby badger this 

1738
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,380

Yeah.

1746
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,830
Jamie,

1747
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:23,270
Ryan Callahan,

1751
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,533

Seth Simpson.

1754
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:37,490
Two Oh eight.
Somebody sent me a clip.

1755
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:40,100
It is fucking,
so they're shooting squirrels.

1756
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,140
And then look,
he's got his little,

1757
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:45,650
this is a new pet coyote that he has and
this is a new one.

1758
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,730
And this little coyote puppy is chewing 
on this squirrel.

1759
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,680
But,
or I'm sorry,

1760
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:53,290
not squirrel.
They're shooting pigeons.

1761
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,990
That squirrels.
But he's a go down and see the badgers.

1762
01:08:56,991 --> 01:08:58,970
See The badger up there in the right 
hand side corner.

1763
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,130
Look at this.
This is a badger baby.

1764
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,960
So it says,
um,

1765
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:03,973
someone was shooting ground squirrels is
shore Badgett caring what they thought 

1766
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:06,974
was a squirrel.
They shot it and it was actually 

1767
01:09:08,451 --> 01:09:09,284
carrying a baby.
So they took this baby badger and now 

1768
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:17,380
they're raising it and he's raising this
baby badger and he says that you can,

1769
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,160
uh,
given the option of fight or flight,

1770
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:20,960
they're often fight,
but if their bottle fed,

1771
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:23,870
handled constantly and extremely well 
socialized,

1772
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:28,820
they can be kept in captivity for four 
easily or easily and make fun pets.

1773
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,510
How crazy is that guy's got a pet 
badger.

1774
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,280
God,
don't Piss that thing off.

1775
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:34,750
No.
Uh,

1776
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,673
this,
this guy has had nothing to do with a 

1777
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:38,134
badger,
although it's a boost to talking about 

1778
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,810
small animals.
Uh,

1779
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,250
somebody sent me a clip of,
of,

1780
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:43,084
uh,
an incident where a police officer's 

1781
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:46,504
driving down the road.
Then he stopped traffic on both sides 

1782
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:50,410
cause a groundhog was trying to come 
across the street.

1783
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,180
Right?
And so he was trying to,

1784
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,353
it was about a quarter of the way across
this two lane road and he was trying to 

1785
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,490
back it off the street.
Okay.

1786
01:09:57,491 --> 01:09:58,840
That was a nice humanitarian thing,
right?

1787
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:01,120
He's trying to help this animal get off 
or it doesn't get hit by cars.

1788
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,240
And this,
uh,

1789
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,100
uh,
he keeps trying and keeps trying.

1790
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,150
It's not working.
You know,

1791
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,480
the groundhog won't leave and eventually
the groundhog,

1792
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,330
I guess something snapped in his mind.
Then he decided,

1793
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:13,901
you know,
fuck this,

1794
01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:15,580
I'm going to go after this police 
officer.

1795
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:16,690
Right.
I guess he got tired.

1796
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,753
So he,
he kind of waddled up to the police 

1797
01:10:18,701 --> 01:10:19,341
officer.
But it,

1798
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:19,901
this is it.
Yeah.

1799
01:10:19,901 --> 01:10:21,340
This is it.
Now watch what happens.

1800
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,030
This is insane.
So the COP has 10.

1801
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,020
Oh,
he didn't shoot it.

1802
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,190
He did.
He got on his knees and shot the fucking

1803
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,590
groundhog.
I like how they blur it out.

1804
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:35,380
Yeah.
The identity.

1805
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,550
The identity of the groundhog.
Yeah.

1806
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,900
So it's moving away now.
It's still moving.

1807
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,910
Does he show it again?
Yes.

1808
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,790
But watch it comes at form again.

1809
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,573
Well

1810
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:50,003
that seems inappropriate.
I grabbed the police said was blocking 

1811
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:57,820
traffic was fatally shot Sunday.
I knew I was in the New York daily.

1812
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,300
There was this Maryland.

1813
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,640
Oh boy.
Uh,

1814
01:11:03,641 --> 01:11:06,280
he realized that it was not responding 
as an,

1815
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,173
as expected for an animal that was not 
being cornered or trapped believing the 

1816
01:11:11,411 --> 01:11:13,740
groundhog to be either sick,
injured.

1817
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,320
He shot it.
And I love it.

1818
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:18,870
I love this response.
I am sure the officer did the best thing

1819
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,240
in this situation.
It's not for me to judge.

1820
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,320
Yeah.
If you can't kick a groundhogs ass,

1821
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:29,070
you shouldn't be a cop.
That's what I have to say that because I

1822
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:31,560
don't know.
It's coming after you sidestep pitch and

1823
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,070
also you can't take it down with one 
shot.

1824
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,830
What the Hell is wrong with that?
Wow.

1825
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,650
How slow is it moving too?
It was just,

1826
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:38,520
it was,
it was like,

1827
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,060
you know,
they're not the fastest animals,

1828
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,580
so,
uh,

1829
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,840
it was not in a full sprint towards this
officer.

1830
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,860
I'd just say,
who knows?

1831
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,260
None of us can put ourselves in that 
officer's shoes.

1832
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:50,094
Let's just put it that way.
These getting an irrational fear of 

1833
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:54,690
mammals.
None of us have been in combat against a

1834
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:57,860
small animal creature,
would it?

1835
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:01,230
I mean I fucking groundhog.
I know.

1836
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:02,613
What do you got it too?
It seems like you just get out of the 

1837
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:06,820
way.
You have to shoot a groundhog.

1838
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,610
Yeah.
Just get back in your cruiser and assume

1839
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,000
people are going to drive around it.
Yeah.

1840
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,393
Anyway.
I thought that was interesting and 

1841
01:12:12,211 --> 01:12:13,770
someone thought it was interesting 
enough to send along,

1842
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,420
so that was crazy.
I did that.

1843
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,283
I think sometimes you give people a gun 
that just looking to shoot some after a 

1844
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:20,710
while I'm shooting something.
Oh,

1845
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:23,950
this groundhog is fucking with society.
It's like,

1846
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,133
it's like that old far side cartoon with
the vultures sitting up there and 

1847
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:27,060
saying,
damn it,

1848
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,930
I'm just going to kill something.
Right.

1849
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,910
So you know that expression,
if you only have a hammer,

1850
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:34,740
everything seems like a male.
Exactly.

1851
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,740
Yeah.
I mean if you gave that Cabo can of bear

1852
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:39,570
spray,
well that's a good point.

1853
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,370
Less than deadly force.
Right?

1854
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,040
It could have tased it.
Uh,

1855
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,140
probably,
Eh,

1856
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,140
probably would've killed it.
Killed it.

1857
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,273
Killed it.
Right.

1858
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,810
Would it made for a more interesting 
video?

1859
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,330
Just give him a tennis racket.
Slapping in the ass.

1860
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,793
I could get a move on a little fella.
Just pull the tennis racket off your 

1861
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,850
utility belt.
It stopped traffic.

1862
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:58,860
That sounds like a dumb ground squirrel 
too.

1863
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,930
He's about to get fucked up by a dumb 
ground.

1864
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:03,120
Squirrel.
It was suicide by cop.

1865
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:03,954
Maybe it was one of those deals you 
think it was just you got an issue on 

1866
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,420
squirrel.
I had enough,

1867
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:09,270
like crazy person that rushes the cop 
because he wants to die.

1868
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,200
We get that night.
Oh,

1869
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,160
you get that deer that just like,
I just want to end it all they do.

1870
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:13,994
They just come out of nowhere and you 
know they've been sitting in the bushes 

1871
01:13:16,681 --> 01:13:21,681
waiting for you to drive by so they get 
super confused during September,

1872
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,870
October,
November during the Rut in particular,

1873
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:26,850
like when they get horny,
there's a video,

1874
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:27,750
a hilarious video.

1875
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:28,583
This deer that's so fucked up from the 
Rut that this guy walks up to it and 

1876
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,500
taps it on the head with an Arrow on the
like,

1877
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,510
I've seen that joan,
I deer hunter in the country was like,

1878
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:40,344
well fuck,
this is what I was hunting because most 

1879
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:46,890
of the time of deer even catches wind 
that you're a 200 yards away.

1880
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:49,950
They fucking bound out of there like the
hills are on fire.

1881
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,840
How did you do out in Hawaii?
I've got two.

1882
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,820
I've got two axis deer that looked 
great.

1883
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:54,654
Yeah.
This deer is just a macy aided for 

1884
01:13:57,661 --> 01:14:02,661
running paralyzed and confused with his 
own hormones and this guy walks up to it

1885
01:14:02,701 --> 01:14:05,250
and just taps it.
This is crazy.

1886
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,910
Like this thing is just so baffled.
Hey Buddy.

1887
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,290
I mean,
that is crazy.

1888
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:15,910
The deer.
Hi.

1889
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,770
It looks like he's definitely done.
Yeah.

1890
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,350
When they get run it up.
Yeah.

1891
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,323
Like when they're like,
I've never seen anything like this 

1892
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:27,610
before,
but sometimes they just blow a fuse.

1893
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,010
This,
he's tapping the antlers.

1894
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:30,873
Hey Fella.
It's just too much to to process for 

1895
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,180
that deer.
Yeah.

1896
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:35,430
Look at it.
Yes,

1897
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,720
I could leave,
but I don't know what to do,

1898
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:41,020
but it doesn't seem like it understands 
life anymore.

1899
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,120
Like we thought it'd be just stands 
really still.

1900
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:47,110
He won't be spotted now is that,
and now he takes off.

1901
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:50,980
What in the fuck man.
That's just,

1902
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,870
that's his hormones.
That's men.

1903
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,023
That's great.
That's what happens when you do is get 

1904
01:14:54,651 --> 01:14:59,140
boners guys get their kidney stolen from
Russian.

1905
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,900
You know those gals that take your 
kidney,

1906
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:06,280
you wake up in a bathtub full of ice and
your wallet's rid of that before.

1907
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,300
Oh yeah.
Oregon missing.

1908
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:11,350
Yeah.
It used to happen out in Southeast Asia.

1909
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,560
There were occasionally reports of that.
Yeah.

1910
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:17,140
I that was out there for quite a while 
and occasionally you'd hear a yeah,

1911
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:19,160
some reports,
some dude getting screwed up and,

1912
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,650
and uh,
you know,

1913
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:22,730
next thing you know,
he wakes up and he's missing a kidney or

1914
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:23,983
yeah.
Think it really did happen or did 

1915
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:26,350
happen.
You think about what that means.

1916
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,920
So not only does it do get knocked out,
but then you got to get the doctor in.

1917
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:30,431
Right.
Cause they're not,

1918
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,264
you know,
the girls probably aren't doing it 

1919
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:33,850
themselves with rubber gloves on weight.
Right.

1920
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:34,684
Just say,
yeah.

1921
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:35,790
It sounds like a bad movie.
What?

1922
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,630
It could be a good movie actually.
Not very good.

1923
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,320
Yeah.
So it does,

1924
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,400
it does,
it does happen.

1925
01:15:40,401 --> 01:15:41,234
And,
and uh,

1926
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,840
all the more reason to always know where
your pants are.

1927
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,700
That's a good move.
Yeah.

1928
01:15:45,701 --> 01:15:46,240
I don't,
I don't know.

1929
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,460
You should definitely know.
Your parents are,

1930
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:50,380
your parents are,
I know what you're drinking kids just,

1931
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:51,214
I'm just telling you kids,
I used to tell my dog my daughter's 

1932
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,283
phone off.
You know how I keep bashing China and 

1933
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:57,930
their intellectual property 
acquisitions.

1934
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:00,070
Uh,
my daughter's now in China.

1935
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:00,821
Well,
no,

1936
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:04,000
working in Beijing.
She working for the government?

1937
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:04,721
No,
no,

1938
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:05,051
no,
no.

1939
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:05,900
She's,
she's worshiping.

1940
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,220
Thank you.
Uh,

1941
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:11,890
and uh,
she's a great kid,

1942
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:13,690
but she always says,
you know,

1943
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,441
dad,
could you just,

1944
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:15,274
uh,
could you just not maybe bash them as 

1945
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:19,200
often as you do if I'm flying back over 
there to,

1946
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:21,550
you don't have to work.
They asked her questions.

1947
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,370
Oh No,
no,

1948
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,740
I don't think that Swat,
I don't think they give a crap,

1949
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,840
although I will say I was giving a 
speech one time about,

1950
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:31,570
uh,
about national security issues and I got

1951
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:32,404
off on the subject of the intellectual 
property theft that's perpetrated by a 

1952
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:38,320
lot of different countries and it was a 
large conference.

1953
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,213
And uh,
so I'm talking about the Chinese and 

1954
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,170
their tendency to do this.
And I looked down in there,

1955
01:16:44,171 --> 01:16:45,004
I see a guy that I know who's with one 
of the companies that brought me in for 

1956
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:49,990
this speech and he's got this funny look
on his face.

1957
01:16:49,991 --> 01:16:50,950
Like,
oh my God,

1958
01:16:50,951 --> 01:16:52,120
I can't believe you're talking about 
this.

1959
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,463
And he kind of like motions over there 
and they're in like the third row of 

1960
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,113
this,
this area is this contingent of Chinese 

1961
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:01,840
business folks sitting there and they 
just look,

1962
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,580
and I've just been spending 10 minutes 
just,

1963
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:05,460
just railing and talking about,
you know,

1964
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,720
how awful they can be sometimes in this 
whole,

1965
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,643
although good,
I praise them because they're good at 

1966
01:17:10,011 --> 01:17:10,844
it.
Uh,

1967
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,650
and they,
they looked to it,

1968
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:14,900
they were just horrified about this 
whole thing.

1969
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,330
What am I gonna do?
I can't walk that back,

1970
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,193
you know.

1971
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,101
Anyway,
look,

1972
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,290
it is what it is.
If you don't want me to talk about it,

1973
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,090
don't do it.
Don't do it.

1974
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,450
Yeah.
Um,

1975
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,480
so that's,
uh,

1976
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,950
that's another issue.
I'm just ticking off all the issues that

1977
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:28,784
we've solved here so far.
We get that we're going to face the 

1978
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:31,160
world here,
Mike Baker,

1979
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,280
but that the North Korean released to 
those prisoners.

1980
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:35,720
That's a good thing.
This is a good thing.

1981
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,583
And I think both trump and pence,
I think of going out to Andrews Air 

1982
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:43,590
Force base to meet them as they come in.
And,

1983
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,590
you know,
but it will be,

1984
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,630
it'll be interesting to see,
look,

1985
01:17:46,631 --> 01:17:49,460
it was,
I think it was an easy give for Kim Jong

1986
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,400
Un to do.
Right.

1987
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,210
And what were they over there in prison 
for?

1988
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,290
Well,
one of them what I'm wants a businessman

1989
01:17:57,110 --> 01:18:01,460
and he was serving 10 years hard labor.
Imagine hard labor camp and with Korea,

1990
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,520
uh,
for supposedly for espionage.

1991
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,310
He's a business guy and they don't care.
I mean,

1992
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:09,050
they've done this numerous times in the 
past.

1993
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,210
It really doesn't matter if you show up 
and you're in business.

1994
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,750
The other two were also interesting.
They were academics.

1995
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:19,580
They were at the Pyongyang University 
for Science and technology.

1996
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,103
Both of them were teaching there,
which is oddly enough where I got my 

1997
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:25,600
degree.
Um,

1998
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,510
and um,
uh,

1999
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:30,020
my undergrad degree,
Pyongyang University,

2000
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,330
uh,
I went there for the sports.

2001
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,130
Uh,
and uh,

2002
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:40,790
and I worked during the year as the mat.
It's the peel and gang missiles.

2003
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,640
Um,
like a guy dressed as a missile.

2004
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,070
You know,
I just,

2005
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,220
I can't,
you know,

2006
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,053
honest to God,
I can't remember where I was going with 

2007
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:49,754
the story.
And so I just like rambling until I get 

2008
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:53,990
my head straight.
I'm like that deer in that video.

2009
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:58,430
So those two were,
were again the same thing,

2010
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,940
supposedly engaged in espionage and so 
they got chucked in.

2011
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:04,010
Um,
so we'll see.

2012
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:04,430
I mean,
I,

2013
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,263
you know,
whether,

2014
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,490
whether we're able to get anything from 
this,

2015
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:09,620
who knows,
but that's a good sign.

2016
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:11,330
The fact that he met with,
as you pointed out,

2017
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,850
President Moon from South Korea.
Very good sign.

2018
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:16,020
Um,
the Chinese have a,

2019
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,350
they sent their foreign minister over to
Pyongyang,

2020
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,090
um,
couple of weeks ago.

2021
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,600
First time foreign minister has been 
over there and maybe 11 years,

2022
01:19:23,601 --> 01:19:24,250
12 years.

2023
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,083
Wow.
So they understand the importance of 

2024
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:30,860
this and I think everybody's,
the dynamic has shifted because I think,

2025
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,723
you know,
we've kicked the can down the road for 

2026
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,434
so long that there were basically at the
point where their programs are close to 

2027
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:40,120
being fully developed.
And I think the,

2028
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:40,963
you know,
the Chinese understand that that means 

2029
01:19:42,021 --> 01:19:42,854
that all those other options perhaps of 
kicking the can down the road aren't on 

2030
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:47,810
the decision tree anymore.
And so,

2031
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,060
you know,
they don't want chaos on the peninsula.

2032
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,550
They don't want military conflict.
Nobody does.

2033
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,833
And so I think the Chinese for basically
the first time I've been aggressively 

2034
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,673
assisting with the sanctions that were 
put in place that had a very quick 

2035
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:03,320
response on Kim Jong Un,
he's not suicidal,

2036
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:05,630
he just wants to survive in position of 
leadership.

2037
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,320
Right?
So he's looking at it thinking,

2038
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:08,154
okay,
the calculus has changed so I gotta do 

2039
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:11,400
something different.
And again,

2040
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,510
you know,
being pragmatic,

2041
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,790
maybe it doesn't work,
but at least we're trying.

2042
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,360
And I think that's a good thing.
So

2043
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:17,680
no,
unquestionably,

2044
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:18,514
it's a good thing.
And also the video that North Korean 

2045
01:20:20,261 --> 01:20:25,261
soldier fleeing and getting shot shot at
as he escapes North Korea,

2046
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:29,020
I mean that had to get to North Korea 
to,

2047
01:20:29,021 --> 01:20:29,854
and they realize like Jesus Christ is 
the second guy and how many months that 

2048
01:20:32,951 --> 01:20:37,720
was fleeing like that and got away and 
they're finding parasites in their body.

2049
01:20:37,721 --> 01:20:41,800
And extreme malnourishment.
And this is a soldier.

2050
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:45,940
So you gotta think everybody over there 
is probably in an in dire straits.

2051
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:46,803
Right?
And we've talked about this in terms of 

2052
01:20:47,891 --> 01:20:48,760
just,
just a simple,

2053
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,620
not simple,
but the idea that,

2054
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,633
you know,
the population in terms of its physical 

2055
01:20:53,111 --> 01:20:56,140
stature compared to the South Korea,
they're shorter.

2056
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,350
They're,
they're uh,

2057
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,690
uh,
a malnutrition issue.

2058
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,533
Yeah.
I think also I think they've realized 

2059
01:21:01,781 --> 01:21:06,781
that there's only so much they can do 
going forward to lock the place down.

2060
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:08,740
Right.
And technology at some point,

2061
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:11,230
even though it's North Korea and there's
not a lot there,

2062
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,730
there's enough.
And I think there's a sense that they,

2063
01:21:13,731 --> 01:21:14,564
you know,
how long can they can control the 

2064
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:17,920
population the way they have.
So again,

2065
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:19,670
he's not the Kim,
uh,

2066
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:22,750
is not suicidal.
He wants to maintain power.

2067
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:24,500
When you think about every country 
action,

2068
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,010
its own best interest for every leader 
acts in their own best interest.

2069
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:30,460
That's his thought process.
And how do I do that?

2070
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,630
Well,
okay.

2071
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:32,980
You know,
maybe,

2072
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:33,903
so I think that it could happen.
We could get something really good out 

2073
01:21:36,341 --> 01:21:37,174
of this.
We'll see.

2074
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:40,420
You know,
but the Iranians who are watching it and

2075
01:21:40,421 --> 01:21:42,190
North Koreans are watching what we did 
over the Iran.

2076
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,730
I disagree with that.
That whole notion that North Koreans are

2077
01:21:45,731 --> 01:21:46,860
going to look at it and go,
Eh,

2078
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:48,490
it means we can't trust them.
Look,

2079
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,710
if President Obama was so enamored with 
that,

2080
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,920
that deal that he made with the Iranians
will then take it to the Senate,

2081
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,020
right.
Get it,

2082
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,630
make it a treaty.
You made it a,

2083
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:01,210
an agreement,
an executive order basically.

2084
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:04,180
And so,
you know,

2085
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,073
they're not looking,
I don't think the North Koreans were 

2086
01:22:05,691 --> 01:22:08,050
looking at this and going,
trump is going back on his word.

2087
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,120
I think they're looking at and going,
trump's okay.

2088
01:22:10,121 --> 01:22:11,700
He means that he's not gonna put up with
a,

2089
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:15,310
a bad deal and this wasn't that good a 
deal.

2090
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,860
So I think that's the way that they 
would process it.

2091
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,900
And,
and we'll see.

2092
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,250
But you know,
who knows where they were on,

2093
01:22:21,251 --> 01:22:22,420
he was going to go with what they're 
doing.

2094
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,230
And,
uh,

2095
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,490
people right now listening are probably 
thinking,

2096
01:22:24,491 --> 01:22:25,324
okay,
I'm tired of listening about the 

2097
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:26,690
Iranians.
I mean,

2098
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,180
well that seems to be something that you
were really concerned about.

2099
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,700
Well,
I think only because,

2100
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:31,870
um,
you know,

2101
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:32,651
if,
if it's,

2102
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:34,780
if it's not handled properly and there's
a lot of moving parts,

2103
01:22:34,781 --> 01:22:36,540
meaning our allies,
uh,

2104
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,670
meaning the wildcard of what Rouhani and
the regime was going to do.

2105
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,720
But look,
make no mistake,

2106
01:22:40,721 --> 01:22:41,554
there's no this,
no,

2107
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:45,220
this idea that somehow that this was a 
moderate Iranian regime,

2108
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,173
all you gotta do is look at what they're
engaged in doing in the Lebanon and 

2109
01:22:48,491 --> 01:22:51,850
Yemen and the proxy war with,
with the Saudis and others,

2110
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,620
uh,
in Iraq and Syria,

2111
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:56,230
in,
in the work that they're doing it in all

2112
01:22:56,231 --> 01:22:57,770
the soldiers,
US soldiers,

2113
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,230
they killed in Iraq,
you know,

2114
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:04,231
through the provision of weapons,
the training that they gave to,

2115
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,680
uh,
to,

2116
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:06,514
uh,
the Iraqis that were fighting against 

2117
01:23:07,961 --> 01:23:10,030
us.
Yeah.

2118
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,100
Look at all of that.
And you think,

2119
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:11,963
you know,
at what point did somebody make some 

2120
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:15,820
decision that the Iranians were,
you know,

2121
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:18,210
somehow moderate because they're there.
They're not,

2122
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:19,470
that regime isn't,
you know,

2123
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:21,750
the people themselves.
I think we keep hoping one day.

2124
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:25,290
I mean you go all the way back to the 
fall of the Shah and you know,

2125
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,250
people hoping that the people will rise 
up and overthrow the clerics.

2126
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:30,040
Do you think

2127
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,260
same attitude that causes people to be 
apologists,

2128
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:34,480
like the same attitude it's causing 
people to ask.

2129
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:38,320
How do you feel about those people being
tortured?

2130
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:39,154
Is it the same sort of mentality that 
allows people to want those Iranians to 

2131
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:44,584
be a,
the want the people that are empowered 

2132
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:46,504
to be moderate?

2133
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:47,761
Yeah,
I think so.

2134
01:23:47,761 --> 01:23:48,594
I think it's a,
it's,

2135
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,790
I think there's an element of that.
I think it's,

2136
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:51,624
it's,
um,

2137
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:55,230
it's a desire to,
um,

2138
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,630
again,
sort of think,

2139
01:23:57,631 --> 01:24:00,180
well I'd add that part of it I don't 
really understand.

2140
01:24:00,181 --> 01:24:01,014
Again,
cause you would think that you would 

2141
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,124
base that on people's performance and 
all you gotta do is look at past 

2142
01:24:03,751 --> 01:24:06,690
performance of the clerics and the 
regime there in Iran that runs things.

2143
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,090
And I don't know how you come away from 
it thinking,

2144
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:09,511
well,
you know,

2145
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,190
they're being actually pretty,
pretty moderate.

2146
01:24:11,191 --> 01:24:13,400
They're being pretty conciliatory.
I,

2147
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:14,643
you know,
and that's what we got to previous 

2148
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:16,284
administration did.
They just stretched themselves then 

2149
01:24:18,151 --> 01:24:21,780
trying to sell this deal.
I mean,

2150
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:24,420
they did everything they could to try to
race to it,

2151
01:24:24,421 --> 01:24:26,520
make sure it was going to happen.
They set things aside.

2152
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,120
Uh,
and you know,

2153
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,430
we've caught the Iranians in the past 
cheating and that,

2154
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,790
this,
this business with Netanyahu,

2155
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:33,624
when he came out with this information 
that they pulled out of this warehouse 

2156
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:36,294
where it's being stored.

2157
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:37,770
Yes.
That was,

2158
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:40,260
you know,
historical covered the period of 1999 to

2159
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:42,450
2003.
What was that again?

2160
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,880
Well,
the Word Messiah,

2161
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:46,050
uh,
had an operation that they engaged in.

2162
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:48,020
Um,
there was a warehouse in tech,

2163
01:24:48,021 --> 01:24:49,230
Ron,
where,

2164
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,050
um,
the Iranian regime,

2165
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,463
um,
rather than destroy all their research 

2166
01:24:55,201 --> 01:24:57,150
and all the work that we're doing on 
nuclear weapons,

2167
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,230
uh,
up until that time,

2168
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,333
you know,
uh,

2169
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:00,323
during that time they stored it.
And so they put it in a warehouse 

2170
01:25:05,371 --> 01:25:07,170
facility.
Um,

2171
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:09,300
massage.
Um,

2172
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:12,240
and some others liaison service found 
out that,

2173
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,103
uh,
that the location and then they mounted 

2174
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,194
an operation,
which is a very labor intensive to try 

2175
01:25:18,421 --> 01:25:19,890
to,
you got to do a lot of surveillance.

2176
01:25:19,891 --> 01:25:22,590
You gotta recruit assets.
Who can provide you with key information

2177
01:25:22,591 --> 01:25:23,424
about this.
And then eventually they hiked out a 

2178
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:25,730
bunch of these documents.
They don't,

2179
01:25:25,731 --> 01:25:28,620
you know,
50,000 pages of documents and almost 200

2180
01:25:28,621 --> 01:25:29,930
cds,
uh,

2181
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:30,773
or,
um,

2182
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:35,820
and that information covers 1999 to 
2003.

2183
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,713
And one of the things that it shows 
definitively is that one of the things 

2184
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:40,474
that you're running is,
were doing were they were designing and 

2185
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,550
looking to build a minimum of five 
nuclear warheads,

2186
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:45,623
right.
For their ballistic missiles that they 

2187
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:47,824
are also developing a building,
which puts a nail in that whole idea 

2188
01:25:50,371 --> 01:25:51,990
that it was nothing but a peaceful 
program.

2189
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,480
Um,
but people looking at it,

2190
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,810
they're apologists and the sink,
oh,

2191
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:57,000
it's,
it's old history.

2192
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:58,830
It's old news.
It doesn't tell us anything new.

2193
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,693
Well,
it tells us and confirms to us what 

2194
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:02,970
we've been saying all along,
which is,

2195
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,063
you know,
they were lying about it and they were 

2196
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:07,154
lying about the,
the extent of their centrifuge 

2197
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:10,650
operations,
um,

2198
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:14,390
the extent of the stored materials that 
they had.

2199
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,810
And so I,
you know,

2200
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:19,430
I'm not,
I just don't know how you make that leap

2201
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:20,091
to then say,
okay,

2202
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:20,924
now they're fine.

2203
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,580
You know,
now that now we can believe them.

2204
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:25,270
Why?
Because why I don't get,

2205
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,123
I don't get that part.
So I'm not willing to see it until they 

2206
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:30,440
want to give us 100% access to all their
sites.

2207
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,423
They want to say,
come on in and look at Parchin come on 

2208
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:33,314
and look at the military facilities that
we used to be where we are used for 

2209
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:37,310
weapons development in the past.
Great.

2210
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,740
Now you got something and now I'll back 
off and say,

2211
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:40,970
okay,
you know,

2212
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,833
maybe that's a good deal.
Actually give us access to all those 

2213
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:44,900
sites.
Um,

2214
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:48,470
and let us go in and look around the 
IAEA,

2215
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:51,130
which is the international organization 
for inspection of,

2216
01:26:51,131 --> 01:26:52,610
of,
of these nuclear sites.

2217
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,650
They spent 12 years trying to figure out
what the hell was going on at Parchin,

2218
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,700
which is a military site near terror and
never,

2219
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,950
never were able to get the access they 
needed,

2220
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:05,540
never were able to solve the,
you know,

2221
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:06,410
the,
the question.

2222
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:08,450
And they went on and on with the 
investigation.

2223
01:27:08,451 --> 01:27:09,081
Well,
guess what,

2224
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:12,230
as a result of the drive by the 
administration to get a deal signed,

2225
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:13,723
part of the,
the conditions from the Iranian regime 

2226
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,600
was that they stopped this 
investigation,

2227
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,580
just draw a line under it.
They had no,

2228
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,620
they had no answers,
but they just said,

2229
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:21,911
well,
no,

2230
01:27:21,911 --> 01:27:24,050
we're not gonna sign a deal unless you 
stop that investigation.

2231
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:25,490
So,
so we did,

2232
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,620
we stopped the investigation.
And then,

2233
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:28,550
like I said,
they also say,

2234
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:29,630
well,
you can visit our sites,

2235
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:30,500
our military.
Ah,

2236
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:31,100
okay,
fine.

2237
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,630
We won't,
uh,

2238
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:33,261
you know,
by the way,

2239
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:33,621
we,
we,

2240
01:27:33,621 --> 01:27:34,720
you know,
this doesn't affect our business.

2241
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:37,670
A ballistic missile technology 
developments are a weapons program.

2242
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:38,481
Ah,
okay,

2243
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:40,790
fine.
Who's doing made this decisions?

2244
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,081
Well,
this was,

2245
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:43,300
this was,
uh,

2246
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,860
two years is as his former secretary 
Kerry would like to say,

2247
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:46,310
well,
you know,

2248
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:49,160
it was two years of diplomatic work and 
hard negotiation,

2249
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:49,960
hard negotiation.

2250
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:50,793
It's,
come on,

2251
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,280
you know,
so,

2252
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,140
uh,
you know,

2253
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:57,440
we worked reportedly in concert with the
Brits and the French and the Germans and

2254
01:27:57,441 --> 01:27:58,850
the Russians and the Chinese.
Uh,

2255
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:00,080
although it was mostly,
you know,

2256
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:01,790
from our side,
um,

2257
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:05,420
and yeah,
know it is what it is.

2258
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,270
So are they complying with what they've 
got in,

2259
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,540
in the terms of the agreement?
Yeah,

2260
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,760
fine.
But I like,

2261
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:11,900
like I said,
I just think,

2262
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,820
and it kind of goes to that point about 
there's,

2263
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,590
the truth is always kind of in the 
middle,

2264
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:16,011
right?
I mean,

2265
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:18,380
the truth is somewhere there,
it's not like it's not,

2266
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:22,010
it's not me throwing grenades at the,
at the progressive is little laughter.

2267
01:28:22,011 --> 01:28:23,540
The Democrats saying,
Eh,

2268
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:24,840
you know,
it's a terrible deal at socks.

2269
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:25,311
And Alex,
I said,

2270
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:25,821
no,
look,

2271
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:26,654
I deal could be good.
And I'm glad that we've been able to 

2272
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,160
inspect those sites that have been 
available.

2273
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:31,993
That's a good thing.
But don't couch it as something that's 

2274
01:28:34,611 --> 01:28:36,350
not,
and you know,

2275
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:37,243
if the Brits and the French and the 
Germans are now willing to say it's an 

2276
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:42,350
inadequate deal,
but we still want to stay in,

2277
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,290
um,
you know,

2278
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:47,290
that should,
that should tell people something and,

2279
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:48,320
and,
you know,

2280
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:50,900
but anyway,
that's not where we're at.

2281
01:28:50,901 --> 01:28:52,850
We're at,
everybody stands around screaming at the

2282
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:55,010
sky because they're upset about one side
or the other.

2283
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,260
And you know,
crap doesn't get done.

2284
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,120
How much time do you spend thinking 
about this?

2285
01:28:59,121 --> 01:28:59,990
Cause you're,
you're,

2286
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:01,680
you're in civilian life now.
Yeah.

2287
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,010
Yeah.
Um,

2288
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:05,360
uh,
are you,

2289
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,440
are you ever really in civilian life?
Oh,

2290
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:08,380
you were in civilian?

2291
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,090
Yeah.
No,

2292
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:12,930
we are.
Of course we are.

2293
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:13,764
Yeah.
Um,

2294
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,200
and uh,
and thank God for that.

2295
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:18,870
Uh,
because it's a young person's game.

2296
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,040
Um,
but,

2297
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,020
uh,
I spend,

2298
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:24,570
I probably spend more time,
I don't have a lot of friends,

2299
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,170
so I invite you to go fishing.
Come on Joe,

2300
01:29:29,171 --> 01:29:30,810
be my friend.
Go fishing with me,

2301
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,300
I'll go fishing with him.
We'll just sit around and say it like it

2302
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,134
was good fishing,
but he only wanted to do was talk about 

2303
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:37,080
it.
Ron fucking boring.

2304
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:39,200
So,
um,

2305
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:40,171
yeah,
I,

2306
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:41,700
you know,
I'd probably spend a little more time,

2307
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:43,710
but I will tell you what's fun is it,
is it,

2308
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,060
some of it does rub off,
right?

2309
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:47,090
Like my three little guys,
you know,

2310
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:49,490
or even my daughter,
she loves international fair.

2311
01:29:49,491 --> 01:29:52,500
She loves international relations.
And what's going on in the world.

2312
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:54,150
She travels a lot and I think that's 
good.

2313
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:55,650
Right?
So maybe some of that rubbed off,

2314
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:56,484
you know,
sitting around the dinner table and 

2315
01:29:56,761 --> 01:29:57,594
talking about these things or me banging
on about it and I thought every now and 

2316
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:00,534
then I think I'm being boring.
But maybe they picked up on something 

2317
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:04,350
and sometimes my kids will,
will say something,

2318
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,850
you know,
and they'll like,

2319
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,170
like scooter the oldest one,
he's wanting me it shit.

2320
01:30:08,171 --> 01:30:10,030
He's only 10 years old.
Um,

2321
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,990
the governor came in or a governor 
candidate can make,

2322
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,310
cause we're coming up on an election 
cycle.

2323
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,630
A governor candidate came in and go,
guy,

2324
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:18,270
we don't,
you know,

2325
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,103
nice guy.
And he came in and to talk to Her ben's 

2326
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:21,121
class,
right?

2327
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:23,240
Fifth Grade Class.
And you know,

2328
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:26,850
ben raised his hand during the question 
period and said,

2329
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:27,893
so what would you do differently?
Because Idaho was ranked 43rd in 

2330
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:31,644
education.
And I know he said this because this 

2331
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:35,100
guy,
they called me later and he says,

2332
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:36,630
your kid has his question.

2333
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:38,980
First of all,
I was going to say,

2334
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,440
hey,
come on.

2335
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,130
You know,
we want more homework.

2336
01:30:41,131 --> 01:30:41,964
Lighten up.
Yeah.

2337
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:44,160
Give us more homework.
But you know,

2338
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:45,390
the point being is,
is you know,

2339
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,730
my wife,
uh,

2340
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:49,000
the world's greatest person,
um,

2341
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,943
is in politics and focused and you know,
strategy and campaign problems and all 

2342
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:55,350
sorts of things.
So she talks about it as well.

2343
01:30:55,351 --> 01:30:57,150
So maybe the kids absorb something like 
that.

2344
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:59,370
And maybe if you talk about these things
at home,

2345
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:00,660
oh,
this is not rocket science,

2346
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,220
right?
But maybe you talk about these things at

2347
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:03,900
home.
Maybe the kids do pick up on some of it.

2348
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:04,734
Are they,
they start to imagine that there's 

2349
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:07,380
something else other than just,
you know,

2350
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:08,880
what happens on the school yard,
you know?

2351
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,780
I Dunno.
I know.

2352
01:31:09,781 --> 01:31:10,614
So I guess there's an upside to it.
I don't know where I'm going with that 

2353
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:14,610
to look on like,
oh my God,

2354
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,640
this is certainly an upside to talking 
about things.

2355
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,820
And the more kids know now,
the better it is.

2356
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,650
But we don't teach civics.
Right?

2357
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,510
I mean,
we don't teach civics in school that the

2358
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:27,360
workings of government,
how the government is supposed to work.

2359
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,223
Yeah.
Most people get out of high school and 

2360
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:29,724
they barely understand what's the 
difference between the Congress and the 

2361
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:32,310
Senate.
Right.

2362
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:33,780
And so then,
then you get what we get,

2363
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:34,614
which is people reading crap on twitter 
and thinking that it's always true or 

2364
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:41,220
that's how they formed their opinion.
Or it's all this,

2365
01:31:41,221 --> 01:31:42,054
or it's all of that.
The world is not that the world exists 

2366
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,940
somewhere in the,
in the middle ground.

2367
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,940
But we don't,
we don't,

2368
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:47,701
I don't think we,
you know,

2369
01:31:47,701 --> 01:31:48,121
we're,
we're,

2370
01:31:48,121 --> 01:31:50,460
we're failing our kids,
um,

2371
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:54,510
by a desire to make life easier for 
them.

2372
01:31:54,511 --> 01:31:55,344
Maybe.
I don't know.

2373
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,390
I think there's definitely some truth to
that.

2374
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,470
Um,
I mean,

2375
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,333
I think

2376
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:05,990
there's a shocking lack of adversary or 
adversity rather,

2377
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:09,370
that a lot of people have to go through 
in this life.

2378
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:10,923
And,
um,

2379
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:14,290
when you,
you go through too much soft living,

2380
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:19,210
you start to develop these lazy habits 
and this distorted perception of reality

2381
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,403
and a lack of understanding of what,
what really hard work is and how 

2382
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:25,504
difficult it is to get by in this life 
if you don't live in this cushy place 

2383
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:30,120
that we live in.
Yeah.

2384
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,530
Did you work when you were a kid?
Did you work summer jobs?

2385
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:33,360
Yeah,
yeah,

2386
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,860
yeah.
A lot of construction jobs mostly.

2387
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,060
Yeah.
I mean the same thing when we,

2388
01:32:38,061 --> 01:32:38,521
we,
you know,

2389
01:32:38,521 --> 01:32:40,980
I blacktop parking lots.
There's a fix it job.

2390
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:42,010
Right.
That's,

2391
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:44,600
it's a good,
it's,

2392
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:45,550
it's,
but you know what?

2393
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,280
You made some money yet.
You felt good about it.

2394
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:48,450
At the end of the day you were 
exhausted.

2395
01:32:48,451 --> 01:32:49,530
But,
um,

2396
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:49,981
I,
you know,

2397
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:50,820
I tell my kids,
I mean,

2398
01:32:50,821 --> 01:32:51,840
they get you,
they to have to start,

2399
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:52,471
you know,
the,

2400
01:32:52,471 --> 01:32:53,304
the oldest one's going to be 11 soon.
It's time for him to do something and 

2401
01:32:55,911 --> 01:32:56,970
get a paper route,
you know,

2402
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:00,060
mow lawns.
So he's talking make a mow lawns at 11.

2403
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:01,240
Sure.
Yeah.

2404
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:03,480
You could have mowed lawns this year.
Um,

2405
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:05,910
but uh,
uh,

2406
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,580
yeah.
I mean it seems early that early to push

2407
01:33:08,581 --> 01:33:09,710
a lawn mower.
That's not,

2408
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:12,120
I didn't have a lawnmower job when I was
11.

2409
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:13,170
That seems early.
No,

2410
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,130
I don't think so.
I think it's,

2411
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:14,964
you know,
you tell them where not to put their 

2412
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:16,620
feet in their hands and their gut.

2413
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:21,150
Let the little fella have a life,
get them involved in sports.

2414
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:23,910
They don't play,
they'll play a lot of lacrosse.

2415
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:25,950
They play a lot of basketball.
They shovel snow yet.

2416
01:33:25,951 --> 01:33:26,671
Swim team.
Yeah.

2417
01:33:26,671 --> 01:33:28,500
They shovel snow.
They get out there and the 10 year old,

2418
01:33:28,501 --> 01:33:31,020
the eight year olds a shovel snow during
the winter,

2419
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,180
a six year olds like,
yeah,

2420
01:33:33,181 --> 01:33:34,170
mugs,
he's not doing a lot.

2421
01:33:34,171 --> 01:33:38,460
Got figure out a way out of this shit.
He's going to be management.

2422
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:41,340
I think that's what he's gonna do.
He's going to be management somehow.

2423
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:42,780
Uh,
but uh,

2424
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:43,790
yeah,
the,

2425
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:44,850
the,
the work ethic.

2426
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,910
I think you're absolutely right.
I mean we every,

2427
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,030
okay,

2428
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,960
every generation,
right?

2429
01:33:49,961 --> 01:33:52,270
Like my parents wanted it to be easier 
for me and my brothers,

2430
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,000
right.
And their parents I'm sure want it to be

2431
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:56,080
easier for them.
Right.

2432
01:33:56,081 --> 01:33:57,340
And nobody,
and so you do that,

2433
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,174
but eventually you get to diminishing 
returns because it becomes so easy and 

2434
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,200
you know,
the kids forget what it is.

2435
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:06,034
Like to actually have to work for 
something and to compete and to compete 

2436
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:10,571
and yeah,
we can't all,

2437
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:13,150
it's,
it's like that I saw some story,

2438
01:34:13,151 --> 01:34:15,070
not that I troll them,
the social media,

2439
01:34:15,071 --> 01:34:18,880
but there was a story that popped up 
that some community,

2440
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:19,893
uh,
they had a cheer squad try out and one 

2441
01:34:22,451 --> 01:34:24,700
of the girls didn't make it on cheer 
squad.

2442
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,880
I didn't even know what cheer squad,
I guess the cheerleaders and the mom was

2443
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:28,714
upset and so she went and complained.
And so the school decision was that 

2444
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:35,290
everybody who tried out gets to be on 
this squad.

2445
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,750
Yeah.
You can imagine what that looks like.

2446
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:46,490
You got to teach kids the opposite,
that if you didn't do good enough,

2447
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,353
you need to figure out what you did 
wrong and go back and improve and work 

2448
01:34:49,881 --> 01:34:52,130
on it.
And then if you do get in next year,

2449
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,113
you'll get an amazing feeling of 
accomplishment rather than an amazing 

2450
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,260
feeling of entitlement.
Right.

2451
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,123
You,
you belong in everything you try out 

2452
01:34:59,721 --> 01:35:00,320
for.
Well,

2453
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,390
that's going to be a big fat wake up 
call when you go out to compete

2454
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:05,500
the workforce.
Right.

2455
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:07,060
Nobody's going to chow.
My God.

2456
01:35:07,061 --> 01:35:08,560
Nobody.
Nobody's going to cut you any slack.

2457
01:35:08,561 --> 01:35:10,160
Theoretical fully.
Yeah,

2458
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:11,170
but no,
that's,

2459
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:11,891
that's,
that's right.

2460
01:35:11,891 --> 01:35:14,050
The idea that,
you know,

2461
01:35:14,051 --> 01:35:15,770
you got to you,
I mean it's like my,

2462
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:18,620
my two older boys or if people are 
thinking,

2463
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:19,463
oh gosh,
Mike's now talking about his kids all 

2464
01:35:20,741 --> 01:35:21,574
the time.
Uh,

2465
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,920
my two little boys,
I have gotten to the point now where the

2466
01:35:23,921 --> 01:35:27,190
sports thing they play and if they don't
play well,

2467
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,830
they sit right.
Because earlier than that,

2468
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:31,090
you know,
everybody plays right.

2469
01:35:31,091 --> 01:35:32,050
It's equal playing time.
You know,

2470
01:35:32,051 --> 01:35:34,360
that's what you typically get the 
coaches here and that's a good thing.

2471
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:35,194
They little kids are learning how to 
play the game of where to stand and all 

2472
01:35:36,851 --> 01:35:37,990
the rest of it.
So,

2473
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:39,063
but then they get to a certain point,
it becomes merit based or it should 

2474
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:41,703
anyway,
which is how it works in Idaho 

2475
01:35:42,431 --> 01:35:42,970
basically.

2476
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,370
At least with the teams that were we 
were associated with.

2477
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:46,091
Instead,
if you're,

2478
01:35:46,091 --> 01:35:49,000
if you don't play that well then maybe 
you don't make the team.

2479
01:35:49,001 --> 01:35:49,834
And if you make the team and you're not 
playing as well as the other kids and 

2480
01:35:50,981 --> 01:35:53,590
you're sitting on the bench.
And so you know,

2481
01:35:53,591 --> 01:35:54,440
my kids,
you know,

2482
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:56,500
when it first started happening,
you know,

2483
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,120
they were just,
they were complaining,

2484
01:35:58,150 --> 01:35:58,983
you know,
like,

2485
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,310
you know,
screw it,

2486
01:36:00,311 --> 01:36:01,690
I'm not getting any playing time.
And I'm thinking,

2487
01:36:01,691 --> 01:36:02,291
well,
okay,

2488
01:36:02,291 --> 01:36:03,124
what's the next part of that thought 
process that you need to work your way 

2489
01:36:04,901 --> 01:36:05,734
through?
If you're not getting enough playing 

2490
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:09,250
time,
it's because you're not what planning as

2491
01:36:09,251 --> 01:36:12,640
well as you should be compared to the 
other kids.

2492
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:13,900
Therefore,
what do you need to do?

2493
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,730
So you have to walk them through this 
process.

2494
01:36:15,731 --> 01:36:18,280
And that's okay because kids don't know 
this stuff inherently.

2495
01:36:18,281 --> 01:36:20,800
Maybe.
And so you teach them that,

2496
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,530
but you don't teach them that while 
you're,

2497
01:36:22,531 --> 01:36:23,364
you're right.
Why don't you try a different sport or 

2498
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:25,930
you know,
or you're right,

2499
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,670
we should talk to the coach about your 
characters.

2500
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:31,780
You too difficult for the children and 
they're not having a good time.

2501
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:35,710
And it should be about companionship and
it shouldn't be about competition.

2502
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:37,203
Well,
you're setting your kid up for failure 

2503
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:41,680
because it can be about both.
It could be about companionship,

2504
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:43,610
but also about competition and,
right.

2505
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,660
Look,
the world's competition,

2506
01:36:46,661 --> 01:36:48,490
it's filled with it.
If you're not competing,

2507
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,353
if you're,
if you just decide you don't want to 

2508
01:36:50,591 --> 01:36:52,960
have anything to do with competition,
that's your choice.

2509
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:56,440
But if you engage in something that does
require competition,

2510
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:58,540
you want special access.
Right,

2511
01:36:58,541 --> 01:36:58,750
right,

2512
01:36:58,750 --> 01:36:59,560
right,
right.

2513
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,241
Yeah.
If you,

2514
01:37:00,241 --> 01:37:01,740
if you don't,
if you're not that nature,

2515
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,890
if you don't have that competitive side 
of you and okay,

2516
01:37:04,891 --> 01:37:05,724
fine,
but then don't go through the rest of 

2517
01:37:06,781 --> 01:37:07,710
life thinking,
we'll just,

2518
01:37:07,711 --> 01:37:10,540
because life is a competition,
which you know,

2519
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:11,403
may upset you when you find that out,
that you don't get special dispensation 

2520
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:15,720
just because you're not a competitive 
person.

2521
01:37:15,721 --> 01:37:16,181
It does it.
Yeah.

2522
01:37:16,181 --> 01:37:18,720
So I agree with it.
Participation Trophies,

2523
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,540
all the nonsense that's going on today.
Well,

2524
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:22,141
I was,
I was,

2525
01:37:22,141 --> 01:37:23,160
uh,
I was walking,

2526
01:37:23,161 --> 01:37:24,570
one of my boys,
they all just went off the,

2527
01:37:24,571 --> 01:37:27,510
off the lacrosse field not too long ago.
And he said,

2528
01:37:27,511 --> 01:37:30,120
how'd I do?
And I said,

2529
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:32,520
well,
you could've done better.

2530
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:34,890
You could have played harder.
He just wasn't into it.

2531
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:36,120
Right.
It was tired or whatever.

2532
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:37,823
So he kind of looked at me and I didn't 
realize I was walking and there were 

2533
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:42,570
some parents around me and as we were 
walking across the field,

2534
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:45,270
and so he kind of looks at me and I knew
what he was thinking,

2535
01:37:45,271 --> 01:37:47,250
which is Dan,
that's not right.

2536
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:48,930
And so I looked at her,
I said,

2537
01:37:48,931 --> 01:37:49,764
do you want me to be honest with you and
you want me to just stand here and blow 

2538
01:37:51,811 --> 01:37:52,644
smoke up your ass?
And I found out did a couple of parents 

2539
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:57,570
who were upset about the fact that I 
would say that,

2540
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,580
but he knew exactly what I meant.
And he said,

2541
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:00,414
no,
you should be honest.

2542
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:01,141
And I said,
well,

2543
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:01,974
this,
the parents were upset at you for being 

2544
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:03,654
honest.
Yeah,

2545
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,470
yeah,
exactly.

2546
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:05,460
And,
and you know,

2547
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:06,294
to be fair,
muggsy the youngest one got called in 

2548
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:08,514
for,
uh,

2549
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,760
uh,
I've done,

2550
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:11,623
it's just,
he got called a fuse in the word Douche 

2551
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:14,340
bag one time,
but a funnier,

2552
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:18,510
funnier one was when he and two of his 
buddies who shall not be named,

2553
01:38:18,511 --> 01:38:21,960
we're out in the playground not too long
ago and there were sitting down in,

2554
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:22,910
they're playing some game,
right?

2555
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:23,753
It was recess and all the kids,
all the different grades are out there 

2556
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:27,720
running around.
And everybody knows my little kid,

2557
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:29,430
you know,
mugsy he's like the mayor of the town.

2558
01:38:29,431 --> 01:38:30,930
He's,
he's just a jolly happy guy.

2559
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:31,560
He's got,
he's got to,

2560
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,750
he's going to be the guy that takes 10 
years to get out of college.

2561
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,960
Right.
And so he,

2562
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:37,380
he and his two little buddies are 
sitting there.

2563
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:39,480
They're playing some game where they got
to count with their fingers.

2564
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:42,630
So at one point,
Jack has the number one knee and he puts

2565
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:43,464
up a finger,
right?

2566
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:44,603
And one of the other kids starts 
laughing and cause he's got an older 

2567
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:50,070
brother who told them what it means.
So he tells me what it means.

2568
01:38:50,071 --> 01:38:51,530
So they start shouting this out,
right?

2569
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:53,670
And this word,
they start shouting and,

2570
01:38:53,671 --> 01:38:55,300
well,
a couple of the older kids walk by,

2571
01:38:55,301 --> 01:38:56,630
any here,
here,

2572
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,660
these three kids,
six years old.

2573
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,090
She's yelling this way,
laughing.

2574
01:39:00,110 --> 01:39:00,943
Uproariously cause they think it's the 
funniest fucking thing they've ever 

2575
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:03,234
heard.
And so they get called into the 

2576
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:07,410
principal.
Well what happens next?

2577
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,060
I have to find out about this,
right?

2578
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:12,230
So now they notify the parents and you 
know,

2579
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,650
admittedly the principal's laughing when
they,

2580
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,573
when they're telling you the story.
But now I have to have a conversation 

2581
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:17,670
with mugsy when,
when I come home.

2582
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:20,100
So I come home and I said much anything 
happened today?

2583
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:20,631
And he goes,
Nah,

2584
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:22,830
that didn't happen.
And me walked right by me and I said,

2585
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:23,131
wait,
wait,

2586
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:23,641
wait,
come back here.

2587
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:25,170
I said,
did you get called into the principal's?

2588
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:27,060
He goes,
oh yeah.

2589
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:28,380
He said,
we were,

2590
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:29,243
let me see.
We were playing on the playground and I 

2591
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:33,300
went like this.
And you know what this means?

2592
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:36,330
I said,
no,

2593
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,500
I don't need to know.

2594
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,840
And I look out of the corner of my eye,
see his two older brothers,

2595
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:42,690
like around the corner just waiting 
because they know he's gonna get his ass

2596
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,650
kicked right for,
for this.

2597
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:45,390
And they're just like,
they can't wait.

2598
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,070
And so I said,
don't,

2599
01:39:47,071 --> 01:39:49,350
I don't need to know what it is.
Just don't do it again.

2600
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,270
Whatever you do,
don't do it again.

2601
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:51,991
And he goes,
no,

2602
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:52,321
no,
no,

2603
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:54,000
no.
You got to know what this means.

2604
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,700
He's really intent on it.
And so I said,

2605
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,440
and he's two other boys skirts.
I go,

2606
01:39:58,441 --> 01:39:59,580
they're like,
oh,

2607
01:39:59,581 --> 01:40:02,040
he's going to get so.
And I said,

2608
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:02,880
all right,
what does it mean?

2609
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:05,760
And I had no idea what he was going to 
say.

2610
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:10,790
But what he did say was mother Fucker,
and that's what they were yelling on the

2611
01:40:11,791 --> 01:40:12,624
playground.
All three of them at the top of their 

2612
01:40:14,971 --> 01:40:18,480
lungs Gel and no mother fuckers six 
that's six years old.

2613
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,850
That's a door.
And I started laughing and the two other

2614
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:22,800
boys walked away,
disgusted that I was laughing.

2615
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:26,820
And that's the end of my story.
So they're great kids.

2616
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:29,970
So how do you take that gene?
You put it back in the bottle,

2617
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,140
do you know?
You know,

2618
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,990
you just say don't use it all starts 
screaming motherfucker.

2619
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:38,190
And there,
there's not much you can do.

2620
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:41,130
Lee throwing their finger up in there.
It's hard to do.

2621
01:40:41,131 --> 01:40:42,750
I mean,
I find myself having to constantly catch

2622
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:43,301
myself.
I'll,

2623
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:44,340
I'll say,
you know,

2624
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:45,110
things like,
you know,

2625
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:47,730
you'll quit jackass and around and then 
I'll think,

2626
01:40:47,731 --> 01:40:49,020
okay,
I probably shouldn't say that,

2627
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:49,883
you know,
but,

2628
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:51,630
but that's fine.
I can't get,

2629
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,860
you know,
my dad was the guy I've ever known in my

2630
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:55,760
life and he swore and I'd,
I'd,

2631
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:57,820
uh,
it didn't scare me in any way.

2632
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,920
Well,
I don't have a problem with it.

2633
01:40:58,921 --> 01:41:01,110
It's part of what I do for a living.
But when I was,

2634
01:41:01,111 --> 01:41:03,220
uh,
when I wa I was,

2635
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:05,220
we were in,
we were skiing with my,

2636
01:41:05,221 --> 01:41:07,850
uh,
youngest daughter who was three and a,

2637
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:08,703
we're packing up the stuff and she 
forgot to pack her helmet and a helmet 

2638
01:41:12,961 --> 01:41:15,750
wasn't packed and the thing,
and she looks down at her luggage.

2639
01:41:15,751 --> 01:41:18,220
She looks down at the helm and she goes,
Oh shit,

2640
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,360
this is something adorable.
But she was three at the time,

2641
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,170
about a three year old sage.
Let's see if you could get together with

2642
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:29,004
mugsy.
Then she could have said Shit and you 

2643
01:41:30,271 --> 01:41:31,470
could just say what happened?
And she just said,

2644
01:41:31,471 --> 01:41:36,471
I forgot my mother fucking helmet.
Then she's got a completely sentenced.

2645
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:40,170
Gosh,
I mean,

2646
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:42,300
there's something really cute about 
kid's swearing.

2647
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:45,060
It's just adorable.
We tried to tell him,

2648
01:41:45,061 --> 01:41:45,661
you know,
don't,

2649
01:41:45,661 --> 01:41:46,440
don't,
yeah,

2650
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,540
we try to teach them the basics.
Don't swear.

2651
01:41:48,541 --> 01:41:50,820
If you can have,
the problem is they're going to,

2652
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,590
it seems so attractive to do because 
they're not supposed to do it.

2653
01:41:55,591 --> 01:41:56,550
And when no one's around,
like,

2654
01:41:56,551 --> 01:41:57,384
you know what I heard,
I remember I found a new word starts 

2655
01:41:58,801 --> 01:41:59,670
with a C.
Yeah.

2656
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,310
Oh yeah,
no,

2657
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,830
they're doing it.
Yeah.

2658
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,823
That one

2659
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,170
we learned everything we learned from 
older brothers.

2660
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,004
Right.
Or from friends who had older brothers 

2661
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:11,230
then talking.
But it was a,

2662
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:12,600
it was a slower process.
Right.

2663
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:14,710
Partly because we didn't have the 
internet and all that crap.

2664
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,593
Right.
And so I think of what you learned a 

2665
01:42:16,811 --> 01:42:18,460
lot.
It took a little bit longer,

2666
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,510
you know,
to learn.

2667
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:20,373
Like,
I don't think I've really rolled out 

2668
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:23,350
douchebag till I was probably 12,
maybe 13.

2669
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,070
Well,
we were talking yesterday,

2670
01:42:25,071 --> 01:42:25,220
right,

2671
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,180
about,
um,

2672
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:31,240
access to the Internet where kids see so
much more and hear so much more today.

2673
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:32,623
Like there especially like violent 
images and their access to terrible 

2674
01:42:36,441 --> 01:42:37,274
things.
And there's just so much that if you 

2675
01:42:39,471 --> 01:42:42,470
leave a kid alone with a computer or a 
phone that's online,

2676
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,333
oh yeah.
They're just going to find out 

2677
01:42:44,481 --> 01:42:47,380
everything about the world way before 
their little brains are ready.

2678
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:48,261
No,
you can't do it.

2679
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:49,280
You've got it.
You've gotta be,

2680
01:42:49,281 --> 01:42:50,540
you gotta lock it down.
Right.

2681
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,433
I mean,
it's a good thing they got to learn the 

2682
01:42:52,191 --> 01:42:53,024
technology,
unlike what I apparently what I 

2683
01:42:54,771 --> 01:42:55,880
apparently did.
I'm gonna leave my,

2684
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,600
my,
uh,

2685
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,850
my watch here for you since I don't know
how to use it,

2686
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:01,460
but a year are you gonna let them get 
online?

2687
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:02,541
Uh,
well,

2688
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:04,130
they can do that.
They can do school research,

2689
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,000
right?
They need to,

2690
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,510
um,
they can like,

2691
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:08,140
Eh,
the,

2692
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:11,150
the middle one loves basketball.
He loves basketball so he can look up,

2693
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:12,770
you know,
a steph curry videos,

2694
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:14,420
things like that.
As long as they've got supervision.

2695
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:14,930
Right,
right.

2696
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:17,180
They have to have supervision.
You have to know what they're doing.

2697
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:22,520
But if you're right,
cause if you let them have free rein at,

2698
01:43:22,521 --> 01:43:26,600
it's a freak zone out there and they'll 
find it just by accident.

2699
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:28,880
And you're right.
I think their minds,

2700
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:29,933
I mean you can't ask kids to process all
the crap that's out there on the 

2701
01:43:34,011 --> 01:43:36,110
internet at that,
at that early age.

2702
01:43:36,111 --> 01:43:37,760
It's not fair.
It's not right.

2703
01:43:37,761 --> 01:43:42,410
And you can't tell me that there's not 
some correlation between,

2704
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:43,343
uh,
access to all that imaging and violent 

2705
01:43:45,411 --> 01:43:47,750
images and everything else.
And some of the problems that we have in

2706
01:43:47,751 --> 01:43:50,090
the world today when we ask,
how does that kid,

2707
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,070
how does he go so far off rails of the 
stills

2708
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,830
are gone or it takes gun out of the 
house and shoots up a place.

2709
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,300
How does that happen?
And I can't,

2710
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:57,163
I don't know.
I mean you,

2711
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,281
I,
what do I,

2712
01:43:58,281 --> 01:43:59,120
again,
I'm not a,

2713
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,670
I'm not a psychiatrist,
so people don't listen to me.

2714
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:04,880
And take that as says medical advice,
but I know what you're saying.

2715
01:44:04,881 --> 01:44:05,714
I mean there's,
there's a reality of the world that we 

2716
01:44:06,591 --> 01:44:07,990
live in and,
uh,

2717
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,250
these,
these images,

2718
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,713
the,
I mean,

2719
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:14,060
you're,
you're not going to stop,

2720
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:14,923
you're not going to change the world 
that we live in by limiting the access 

2721
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:18,104
to these kids have to these things.
But it is strange how much access we 

2722
01:44:21,831 --> 01:44:23,570
have to disturb me.
Gay images,

2723
01:44:23,571 --> 01:44:26,330
violence,
violent videos,

2724
01:44:26,331 --> 01:44:27,164
and there's just so your brain knows 
that that's out there and that there's 

2725
01:44:29,811 --> 01:44:30,644
just so many more examples of it to 
watch if you were 12 years old or 

2726
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:35,030
whatever,
and,

2727
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:36,290
and you know,
in the old days,

2728
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,990
and maybe you found out where your dad 
stored the playboys.

2729
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,010
Yeah.
That was it.

2730
01:44:40,011 --> 01:44:40,671
Yeah.
In this case,

2731
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:43,130
a cardboard box in the back,
a hall closet.

2732
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:44,660
Uh,
then that was,

2733
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:45,291
you know,
that was it.

2734
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:47,030
But that was how,
I mean,

2735
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:48,030
that's how you learned,
right.

2736
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:49,430
I never saw,
I mean,

2737
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,240
I saw a few altercations in my 
neighborhood when I was growing up,

2738
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,680
but like a,
like a,

2739
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:57,170
a real violent encounter.
I never saw anything.

2740
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:57,621
No,
no.

2741
01:44:57,621 --> 01:44:59,610
Shoot 'em up games now that we've got.
Um,

2742
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,090
so we use that,
that xbox and I talked about it.

2743
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:04,580
It's all sports games.
You can't,

2744
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:05,414
uh,
the whole gears of war and call of duty 

2745
01:45:07,071 --> 01:45:08,770
and all the rest of it.
No,

2746
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:09,980
he can't.
He can't do that.

2747
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:11,600
But then again,
you know,

2748
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:12,483
your,
your kid will go out to his friends 

2749
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:14,540
house.
Yup.

2750
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:19,540
The next thing you know,
have had exploded and I don't know.

2751
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,490
So,
you know,

2752
01:45:22,491 --> 01:45:23,190
what are you doing?

2753
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:24,250
You're right.
You can't protect him,

2754
01:45:24,251 --> 01:45:26,180
but you gotta you gotta do your best.
Um,

2755
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:30,350
but the world's changing,
but it's changing faster than we realize

2756
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:31,873
the impact they're more aware of in 
regard to the impact that it has on 

2757
01:45:34,971 --> 01:45:35,804
kids.
I just think it's changing for the 

2758
01:45:37,311 --> 01:45:38,330
people that are adults.
Like,

2759
01:45:38,331 --> 01:45:39,530
wow,
the world's changing.

2760
01:45:39,531 --> 01:45:40,364
Yeah.
It's changing for that four year old 

2761
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:44,090
that's growing up in that world right 
now.

2762
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:47,210
And they're going to have,
the moment they get online,

2763
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,800
they're going to,
it's going to go from,

2764
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:51,050
I'm just a little kid,
live in my little kid.

2765
01:45:51,051 --> 01:45:51,884
That's what Mommy,
that's my daddy to whoop the big world 

2766
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:55,903
all in one big smash.
And I don't think anybody's a little 

2767
01:45:59,591 --> 01:46:00,424
bit,
I don't think an adult's brain is 

2768
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:04,670
designed to handle most of the shit that
we have access to online.

2769
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:05,331
No,
no,

2770
01:46:05,331 --> 01:46:06,830
forget about a growing mind.

2771
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:10,490
And what influence that has on society 
is really yet to be determined.

2772
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:12,320
What are they doing to that donkey and 
why?

2773
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:13,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

2774
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:14,663
And I'm actually get paid for that.
I know that was a career you could 

2775
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:19,910
engage in.
Uh,

2776
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:20,211
no.
I,

2777
01:46:20,211 --> 01:46:22,130
it's,
it is.

2778
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:23,150
I,
I,

2779
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,440
I've got,
like I said,

2780
01:46:24,441 --> 01:46:25,161
I've got,
I've got a daughter.

2781
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:26,780
I,
there's an interesting age difference.

2782
01:46:26,781 --> 01:46:27,614
Right?
So what is it that's about 1213 years 

2783
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,440
age difference.
Right.

2784
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:34,130
And so I feel like I've,
there's a social thing there is,

2785
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:36,020
you can study,
this is a case study.

2786
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:39,440
W w what my daughter went through 
growing up and access to information,

2787
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:43,170
which was uniquely different than now,
even though you know,

2788
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,023
she started,
there was really no internet or 

2789
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:46,124
anything,
but then it,

2790
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:48,860
it exploded by the time she was 
essentially a,

2791
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:50,030
okay,
well the difference

2792
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,670
between you and I who grew up with 
nothing,

2793
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:54,290
right?
No Internet.

2794
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:55,124
And then it became the Internet when 
we're fully formed and as an adult and 

2795
01:46:58,911 --> 01:46:59,744
then you've got a chance to see it and 
even then screwed it up and made 

2796
01:47:02,901 --> 01:47:03,734
mistakes and got online within God 
viruses on your computer and saw some 

2797
01:47:06,981 --> 01:47:10,070
stuff he really didn't want to see.
Had that dial tone.

2798
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:12,200
Remember yet,
dial in when you were gay

2799
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,630
and then the picture would kind of come 
in and little,

2800
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:18,980
little blips.
Oh yeah.

2801
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,040
You did really want to see it anymore.
Oh,

2802
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,900
when was it?
When did you get first get a cell phone?

2803
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:29,250
I got one real early.
I got a cell phone in the 80s wow.

2804
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,113
Yeah.
Well it was a comedian and like 89 I 

2805
01:47:34,111 --> 01:47:35,490
think.
I had a cell phone.

2806
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,833
I had a cell phone in my car.
It was like permanently bolted down to 

2807
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:40,494
my car.
Yeah.

2808
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:41,653
Yeah,
I got it.

2809
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:42,523
Those so I could get,
the thing about it was I could get gigs 

2810
01:47:44,911 --> 01:47:46,950
with it.
So like,

2811
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:48,270
uh,
some people get ahold of you.

2812
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,790
Yeah.
Like Bill Bloomin',

2813
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:51,481
right.
Uh,

2814
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:52,920
who was the owner of,
um,

2815
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:54,083
the Wilbur Theater in Boston?
It was owner of the comedy connection 

2816
01:47:56,041 --> 01:47:58,020
back then.
Always jokes around about it.

2817
01:47:58,021 --> 01:47:58,854
He was like,
you got a lot of words because you were 

2818
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:01,950
the only comedian with a cell phone.
Like,

2819
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,380
so he could call me up and say,
hey,

2820
01:48:04,381 --> 01:48:06,570
you know,
this guy just got a flat tire on his way

2821
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:07,140
to New Hampshire.

2822
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,220
Can you do the Gig?
And I'm like,

2823
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:09,240
fuck yeah,
I'm in.

2824
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,081
I'm,
I'm there.

2825
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:12,360
I'm know I'm already at my car cause 
that's where my phone is.

2826
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,213
Yeah.
How much did you have to pay for that 

2827
01:48:13,801 --> 01:48:14,970
phone?
I don't remember.

2828
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:17,400
I couldn't afford it.
No,

2829
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:18,263
I couldn't afford it.
I remember not being able to pay for it 

2830
01:48:20,731 --> 01:48:22,140
after a while.
Yeah.

2831
01:48:22,141 --> 01:48:23,100
It was just,
it was a dummy.

2832
01:48:23,101 --> 01:48:25,570
I always spent more money than I had.
I mean it's,

2833
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,710
yeah.
I've never been good with finances.

2834
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:29,544
I've never been frugal,
but he's just one of those things where 

2835
01:48:31,441 --> 01:48:33,030
I realized that I could get it.
So I got it.

2836
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,000
But you remember that status you'd have 
to drive around if you,

2837
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:36,290
before that,
before you had that,

2838
01:48:36,291 --> 01:48:37,450
that phone in your car,

2839
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:41,090
you'd have to drive around.
I'm looking for a public payphone.

2840
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:43,210
Oh yeah.
And you're getting your quarters right.

2841
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:45,650
Or you had to have a calling card.
You remember those things?

2842
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:48,050
He'd have a car did,
I would get,

2843
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:51,080
I would get fake cards too.
He could buy them off people.

2844
01:48:51,081 --> 01:48:51,914
They were like,
like counterfeit cards and they were 

2845
01:48:53,631 --> 01:48:55,460
good for a couple of days and they'd go 
under,

2846
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:56,953
I think you'd buy other ones.
And then there was other things you 

2847
01:48:58,221 --> 01:49:01,490
could do.
You could take a sound device and put it

2848
01:49:01,491 --> 01:49:06,110
up to the phone and you could get a,
get a call with that.

2849
01:49:06,111 --> 01:49:06,944
Like you would put up this thing to the 
voice box area and it would make noises 

2850
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:11,970
like,
yeah.

2851
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:13,570
And it would somehow or another,

2852
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,800
it should open up the,
uh,

2853
01:49:14,801 --> 01:49:15,670
yeah,
the line.

2854
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,860
I remember that we are,
we used to before the,

2855
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:20,350
yeah,
before the cell phone technology hit.

2856
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:24,580
And this is early days of being with the
agency and when you were overseas,

2857
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:25,803
if you were in an urban setting,
you spent half your time looking for 

2858
01:49:28,181 --> 01:49:29,650
operating payphones.
Right.

2859
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,240
You know what,
at some 34th world country,

2860
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:33,400
you're trying to find a payphone that 
actually works.

2861
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:34,570
Cause you got to make some sort of,
you know,

2862
01:49:34,571 --> 01:49:37,630
call related to whatever operation 
you're engaged in.

2863
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,300
And you know,
the kids,

2864
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:41,173
the kids,
the kids today and the agency don't 

2865
01:49:42,311 --> 01:49:43,300
understand that,
you know,

2866
01:49:43,301 --> 01:49:46,900
cause they've all got great technology 
and mobile communications.

2867
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,400
Uh,
yeah.

2868
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:49,540
In the old days it was,
it didn't,

2869
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,080
it didn't work that way.
Uh,

2870
01:49:51,190 --> 01:49:53,260
those are people that we know what a 
phone booth is.

2871
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,401
No,
I,

2872
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:55,060
yeah,
exactly.

2873
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:56,980
Exactly.
Look about fights.

2874
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:57,873
That's like a common expression.
These two could have fought in a phone 

2875
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:00,484
booth that could have fought fight,
can't even say it could have a fight in 

2876
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:06,010
a phone booth.
But today you say fight in a phone booth

2877
01:50:06,011 --> 01:50:06,844
and people go,
why don't just say they got a fight on 

2878
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:10,540
her fucking,
you know,

2879
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:12,220
something else that doesn't exist 
anymore.

2880
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:15,220
A wine barrel.
This London,

2881
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,690
you're London now and there's,
you know,

2882
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:19,450
there's those iconic red phone booth.
You haven't met a phone in it.

2883
01:50:19,451 --> 01:50:20,890
There's a num work.
What are they now?

2884
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,180
Just keep getting them up.
Yeah.

2885
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,043
I think they kept him at,
you could probably find one 

2886
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:25,390
occasionally.
It's got a phone in it,

2887
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:28,480
but it wasn't that long ago.
I remember they actually had functioning

2888
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,333
phones.
You would go outside any seven 11 or 

2889
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:35,050
whatever.
And they were doing a bank of payphones.

2890
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:36,460
I actually stopped and took a picture.

2891
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,550
I was,
I forget where the hell are.

2892
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,820
I said nowhere pulled into a gas 
station.

2893
01:50:39,821 --> 01:50:41,020
It was,
I was pulling out after,

2894
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:43,470
oddly enough,
getting gas and uh,

2895
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,050
I looked over to the side and there was 
a pay phone against the wall.

2896
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:49,870
And then now that the receiver was just 
dangling on the ground,

2897
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:50,704
but I literally stopped,
got out and took a picture of it so I 

2898
01:50:52,301 --> 01:50:53,600
could show my kids,
you know,

2899
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:56,440
we used to make calls on these things.
This is how it worked.

2900
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,110
I remember when there was no answering 
machines.

2901
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:00,010
You remember that?
Yeah.

2902
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,600
Yeah.
And the first answer and machine,

2903
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:04,480
whoever your buddy was a got the 
answering machine first.

2904
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:05,410
You thought,
man,

2905
01:51:05,411 --> 01:51:07,690
that's the deal.
That's so plush.

2906
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:11,500
And I remember we got an answering 
machine where you could call it,

2907
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:12,663
and then when the dial tone went on,
you would punch in like a code and you 

2908
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:18,580
could listen to your messages and you 
weren't even home.

2909
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:19,443
You could retrieve those messages crazy.
You could call it the car to your 

2910
01:51:23,771 --> 01:51:26,530
answering machine.
There's a funny,

2911
01:51:26,531 --> 01:51:27,221
uh,
yeah.

2912
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:28,170
Okay.
Maybe you shouldn't.

2913
01:51:28,171 --> 01:51:29,110
I guess I,
what do I know?

2914
01:51:29,111 --> 01:51:31,240
But you should never start a story out 
by saying there's a funny story.

2915
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:36,380
There's a story that when Lyndon Johnson
was a,

2916
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:39,340
was a president,
not president,

2917
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:40,203
I take that back.
He was in the Senate and it was another 

2918
01:51:42,581 --> 01:51:43,270
guy,
Dirksen.

2919
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:47,200
It was a famous senator.
And so Johnson was,

2920
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:48,820
uh,
uh,

2921
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,830
one day he was,
he was driving,

2922
01:51:50,831 --> 01:51:52,660
Dirksen gets this call,
I think I got their guy,

2923
01:51:52,661 --> 01:51:53,494
right?
It gets a call from Johnson and they're 

2924
01:51:55,451 --> 01:51:57,310
talking and Johnson say,
wow,

2925
01:51:57,311 --> 01:51:58,820
I got to talk to you about this thing.
He said,

2926
01:51:58,830 --> 01:51:59,041
Whoa,
Whoa,

2927
01:51:59,041 --> 01:51:59,731
hold on.
Oh,

2928
01:51:59,731 --> 01:52:00,760
hold on a second.
He says,

2929
01:52:00,761 --> 01:52:01,740
I gotta,
you know,

2930
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:03,130
we're just pulling up outside the 
building.

2931
01:52:03,131 --> 01:52:03,700
I got to get out.

2932
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,620
I'll call you when I get to my office.
Dirksen says,

2933
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:06,550
what are you,
where are you calling me now?

2934
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:07,121
And he goes,
oh,

2935
01:52:07,121 --> 01:52:11,850
I got a phone in my car and Dirksen 
hangs up and meet is this,

2936
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:13,850
I gotta get one of those.
So this,

2937
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:15,310
as the story goes,
uh,

2938
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:18,700
pulled some strings there in the Senate,
got somebody to put a phone in his car,

2939
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,290
right?
And so then he calls,

2940
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:22,510
uh,
Johnson and he says,

2941
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:23,430
Eh,
Linden,

2942
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:25,990
I'm just calling you from,
from my car.

2943
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:28,240
And Johnson says,
ah,

2944
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:28,871
that's,
that's,

2945
01:52:28,871 --> 01:52:29,830
that's great.
Hold on a second.

2946
01:52:29,831 --> 01:52:31,660
I got a call coming in on the other 
line.

2947
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,020
Thanks up on him.
So,

2948
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:35,930
Eh,
yeah.

2949
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:38,440
Whether it's true or not,
it's an apocryphal story.

2950
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:40,900
Phones in their car back then.
Well,

2951
01:52:40,901 --> 01:52:41,800
you know,
if you're a senator,

2952
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:45,090
what year did they invent carphone's?
Uh,

2953
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,093
uh,

2954
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:48,380
Eh,
probably the year you got one.

2955
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:48,840
No,
I don't,

2956
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,590
I have no idea when they invited carf 
ones.

2957
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,960
But you know,
uh,

2958
01:52:52,010 --> 01:52:55,490
Jamie,
we should look in 1946 1946 what,

2959
01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:58,850
what?
Wait a minute.

2960
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:00,313
1940 600 will come up.
Pimp you had to be in 1969 to pull up 

2961
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:05,534
and like a 69 corvette.
The fucking phone in your car or a 

2962
01:53:08,591 --> 01:53:09,950
Lincoln town car.
Whoa.

2963
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:10,784
This is what that's like.
[inaudible] is a mobile phone device 

2964
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:16,100
specifically designed to be fitting in 
automobile.

2965
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,330
That's what we should call him back 
then.

2966
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:18,164
Car phones.
Remember service originated with the 

2967
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:22,760
bell system and was first used in Saint 
Louis.

2968
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:25,790
June 17th,
1946.

2969
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,980
Wow.
Before the fucking end of the war,

2970
01:53:27,981 --> 01:53:28,850
right?
Yeah.

2971
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:29,501
No,
no,

2972
01:53:29,501 --> 01:53:31,040
no.
That was after the end of the war.

2973
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:32,660
End.
45 okay.

2974
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:35,600
Yeah.
So a year after the World War II,

2975
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:38,180
that's an incredible phone in their car.
And more importantly,

2976
01:53:38,410 --> 01:53:39,243
why St Louis?
What was what that was going on in St 

2977
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:41,690
Louis?

2978
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,400
It,
that's the site of the first car phone.

2979
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:44,503
Wow.
It was a radio enthusiasts who had the 

2980
01:53:46,251 --> 01:53:49,700
foresight to invent the annoying habit 
of talking on the phone in the car.

2981
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:50,963
So that basically worked on the radio 
and it would somehow or another connect 

2982
01:53:54,531 --> 01:53:56,270
to a regular phone line.
Is that what it worked?

2983
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:58,400
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

2984
01:53:58,430 --> 01:53:59,263
Yeah.
This is way beyond my apple had this 

2985
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:03,383
look,
Johnson had it when he was in the 

2986
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,040
Senate.
Yep.

2987
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:06,320
Yeah.
So and that would have been,

2988
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:06,861
yeah.
What's that?

2989
01:54:06,861 --> 01:54:08,720
That's,
that would have been like 15 years after

2990
01:54:08,721 --> 01:54:12,040
this happened to her,
or 14 years after.

2991
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:14,180
After they invented it in Saint Louis.
But,

2992
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:15,560
but yeah,
I remember when they,

2993
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:16,394
you know,
the mobile phone then was that big case 

2994
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:18,793
that we carry around and you had to get 
out of your car is set out out on your 

2995
01:54:20,721 --> 01:54:21,930
car and then it started getting it.

2996
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:24,630
Yeah.
That'll be a big fucking thing.

2997
01:54:24,631 --> 01:54:26,600
You throw over your shoulder.
A big handle.

2998
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,613
I got a big box at home full of all the 
old phones that I've had over the years 

2999
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:33,920
and it's like if I could ever get myself
organized,

3000
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:35,053
I would turn it into some sort of wall 
art installation because it's cell 

3001
01:54:38,241 --> 01:54:41,060
phones through the years,
at least covering the past few decades.

3002
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,030
It's certainly interesting.
What do you got there?

3003
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:43,883
Jamie?
First developed in 1920 mobile wireless 

3004
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:49,994
transmission device.
Send and receive messages in the 1920s 

3005
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:57,020
in 19 and 20 Jesus,
that guy behind him as the boss,

3006
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,430
you can tell he's,
he's listening.

3007
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:01,360
He's the guy in charge.
Man did it.

3008
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:02,240
Did,
did.

3009
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,580
Wow.
Yeah.

3010
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:05,414
I think that would be a great idea to 
show kids today that I'm that old brick 

3011
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:13,130
phone from Wall Street.
Fantastic to the member.

3012
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:16,460
The,
was it called the Star Tech Startac.

3013
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,370
I saw somebody's still using one of 
those the other day.

3014
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,600
Yeah,
the little flip flops.

3015
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:23,090
A little flip phone with the little,
it was of would come out.

3016
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:24,680
Yeah.
To be fair,

3017
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:25,514
he did.
He had a Dork knob and then other 

3018
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,780
STARTAC.
There was a sweet phone.

3019
01:55:29,781 --> 01:55:30,860
I had one of those.
I was like,

3020
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:31,723
oh baby.
It was like you want to use terms like 

3021
01:55:33,111 --> 01:55:34,040
star trek,
right.

3022
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:35,600
You were like Captain Kirk with that 
thing.

3023
01:55:35,601 --> 01:55:37,060
He had flipped it open and you're 
talking,

3024
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:39,830
maybe you can get an extra fat battery 
for it.

3025
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,770
Although that didn't set so well in your
suit coat.

3026
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,010
No,
it's terrible.

3027
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:47,100
Those fat batteries,
but if you didn't have a fat battery you

3028
01:55:47,101 --> 01:55:47,934
can make a call for four minutes.
Battery Technology was terrible back 

3029
01:55:52,831 --> 01:55:54,800
there.
That waterway fun by the way,

3030
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:55,653
has an excellent battery.
It's got a great battery amp battery 

3031
01:55:58,940 --> 01:55:59,773
that battery is doing.
It's sucking all the information out of 

3032
01:56:01,381 --> 01:56:02,430
your system as you got it.

3033
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:03,870
Yeah,
but sweet,

3034
01:56:03,871 --> 01:56:06,690
sweet signal that you get so long while 
it does that.

3035
01:56:06,691 --> 01:56:08,160
It is true.
It is true.

3036
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,710
Go out there kids,
get yourself a quiet way back.

3037
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:12,420
A phone.
Amazing cameras.

3038
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:16,410
They have a 40 megapixel camera in one.
They make all sorts of white goods too,

3039
01:56:16,411 --> 01:56:19,650
you know like washers and dryers and 
refrigerators.

3040
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:21,093
So way does.
They're putting all that stuff in our 

3041
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:24,060
homes.
Yes it is.

3042
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:25,440
Yeah.
I wouldn't,

3043
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:27,630
I wouldn't engage in any shenanigans in 
my kitchen.

3044
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:29,850
Not One of my fridges watching,
but I don't have a,

3045
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:32,400
I don't have a hallway fridge.
I got a don't,

3046
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:35,700
I have no idea what I have.
I have no idea what I've got.

3047
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:37,500
We'll go,
we're about ready to start a,

3048
01:56:37,501 --> 01:56:39,810
and this is what actually,
what the viewers or the viewers,

3049
01:56:39,811 --> 01:56:42,290
the listeners have been waiting for is,
uh,

3050
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:44,010
is to hear about my kitchen renovation.

3051
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,180
What are you going to do?
Oh,

3052
01:56:45,181 --> 01:56:47,470
we're gonna renovate the kitchen,
put a pizza oven in.

3053
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,770
Crazy.
We're going to put a big wine cooler.

3054
01:56:49,771 --> 01:56:50,604
I know that that was,
that was the only thing I was actually 

3055
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:53,730
concerned about with this.
The kitchen renovation,

3056
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,130
boozing it up.
Yeah.

3057
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:56,791
Well,
you know,

3058
01:56:56,791 --> 01:56:59,950
every now and then it mostly Martinis,
but I,

3059
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:05,060
nice glass of wine is nice like,
or glass of wine and so we'll get to,

3060
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:07,623
we do this thing and I don't know,
they came over the other day and my 

3061
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:13,830
wife,
who's definitely outputted my coverage,

3062
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:17,910
she has a lot smarter than I am and much
more organized and efficient,

3063
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,940
but she wasn't there.
So the guys with the plans,

3064
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:22,620
whatever they call them,
the planners,

3065
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:27,090
they came over to show me the drawings 
as if I care.

3066
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:28,313
Right.
Or as if I could actually read these 

3067
01:57:29,401 --> 01:57:31,680
drawings right there,
the blueprints for what they're going to

3068
01:57:31,681 --> 01:57:32,514
do,
the kitchen.

3069
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:38,390
So I dutifully kind of page through them
and made a little notation on one.

3070
01:57:40,501 --> 01:57:41,820
I actually really did.
I just said,

3071
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,680
look,
I at know star wars.

3072
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:44,970
And so the guy says,
what are you thinking?

3073
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:45,804
I said,
yeah,

3074
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:47,370
let's go for it.
Let's do it.

3075
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:48,223
I saw,
I approved it just by have no idea what 

3076
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:51,983
I've engaged in at this point,
but it's going to take about three 

3077
01:57:53,251 --> 01:57:54,084
months and we're going to have ourselves
one hell of a kitchen so it won't be 

3078
01:57:57,541 --> 01:58:00,180
done by the time you show up.
But uh,

3079
01:58:00,610 --> 01:58:02,700
so then you'd be eating off of one of 
those fucking,

3080
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:06,620
we're going to get,
we did the call while we had a,

3081
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:07,454
we,
our kitchen get renovated and we had a 

3082
01:58:09,601 --> 01:58:11,800
hot plate.
We're cooking off a hot plate,

3083
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:15,450
but it was back in college,
lasted a while,

3084
01:58:15,451 --> 01:58:17,670
but it didn't let us appreciate the 
kitchen.

3085
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:19,370
And did you have kids at the time or,
yeah.

3086
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:20,080
Okay.
Yeah.

3087
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:21,540
Yeah.
Well it's kind of funny.

3088
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:23,070
We were laughing about it.
We thought it was funny.

3089
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:26,200
We get with our three,
uh,

3090
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:27,720
yeah.
We'll probably just going to go up.

3091
01:58:27,721 --> 01:58:30,210
We've got this little place,
little cabin up in the up in that,

3092
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:31,044
a great town of Mccall.
We'll just go cold 10 hang out for the 

3093
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,320
summer.
You've got a cabin up there too,

3094
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:36,181
so we'll just,
uh,

3095
01:58:36,181 --> 01:58:37,014
we'll,
we'll stay up there and let them spend 

3096
01:58:38,641 --> 01:58:40,710
their days fishing and swimming man's 
dreams,

3097
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:44,040
but somewhere get away.
Just spread it.

3098
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:47,680
Every man of works too hard.
Just give me a cabin somewhere and work.

3099
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:49,440
Just go,
ah,

3100
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:50,650
I'm just getting into the car.
No one,

3101
01:58:50,651 --> 01:58:51,484
you're pointing the car towards the cab.
You could be sitting in traffic for two 

3102
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:54,784
hours,
but I'm going to the cabin and we get 

3103
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:58,510
to,
especially at cabin by the lake.

3104
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:02,200
That's a dream.
It's a beautiful lake.

3105
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:04,450
And have friends who have a house on 
Coeur d'alene.

3106
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,980
Oh yeah.
They took me,

3107
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:06,873
they took a picture and a,
they're in a boat and you could see the 

3108
01:59:10,061 --> 01:59:14,880
ground like 80 foot deep with a 
photograph of the,

3109
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:17,050
the,
the could see the bottom of the lake.

3110
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:18,120
It's crazy.
It's like,

3111
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:19,930
how is that possible?
That water's clear.

3112
01:59:19,931 --> 01:59:20,764
Then that's like Fiji water.
You've got a whole lake full of Fiji 

3113
01:59:23,411 --> 01:59:24,420
water.
You should go off.

3114
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:26,380
Well,
that's what we do.

3115
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:27,311
Get an Idaho,
you know,

3116
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:29,500
we've got money to burn a fucking crazy 
though.

3117
01:59:29,501 --> 01:59:31,390
I mean it was so beautiful.
It's a,

3118
01:59:31,391 --> 01:59:32,201
it's a,
that is a,

3119
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:35,050
that quarter lane area up.
It's northern part of the country.

3120
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:38,140
Kootney county and it's a great people 
up there.

3121
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,680
Right?
Tiger Woods has a place up there.

3122
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,850
I bet he does.
Yeah.

3123
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:43,740
Banks,
chicks up there.

3124
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:45,160
Crazy.
Yeah.

3125
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:46,410
Some men.
Not Anymore.

3126
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:48,510
He's focused on golf now.
Ah,

3127
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,570
I think so.
I think he's,

3128
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:51,190
I think he's given us everything except 
golf.

3129
01:59:51,191 --> 01:59:54,220
I think that's why swimming,
that's how you have to do tiger.

3130
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:55,083
Yeah.
I remember back when you were young and 

3131
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:57,430
ugly.
Well,

3132
01:59:57,431 --> 01:59:59,530
now you're Richard.
I believe back when you were,

3133
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:03,290
you weren't wealthy,
you weren't doing as much of that.

3134
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:05,183
Pictures are amazing.
That might be one of the most beautiful 

3135
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:08,620
spots in the country.
Yeah,

3136
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:09,730
they've got a,
and it's,

3137
02:00:09,731 --> 02:00:10,660
and it's,
it's just a great,

3138
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:12,550
it's a great spot.
It takes about a,

3139
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:14,463
well,
it's a hell of a drive to get up there 

3140
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:16,720
from Boise,
but you can fly to spokane,

3141
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,190
Washington,
great town.

3142
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:19,113
And uh,
it's only about a 30 minute drive from 

3143
02:00:20,111 --> 02:00:21,010
spokane.
Is it really?

3144
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,150
Yeah.
Wow.

3145
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:23,950
Yeah.
Are you going up to spokane to do a show

3146
02:00:23,951 --> 02:00:24,540
or no?

3147
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:25,390
Uh,
you should.

3148
02:00:25,490 --> 02:00:26,323
That's the move,
Huh?

3149
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:27,310
Yeah.
What else are you going?

3150
02:00:27,311 --> 02:00:28,144
Are you going,
is this a one and done or you're in 

3151
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:29,973
trial?
I just did a Netflix special that I 

3152
02:00:32,141 --> 02:00:32,974
film,
but it's not going to come out until 

3153
02:00:33,611 --> 02:00:34,444
September.
And so now I'm just going to do a bunch 

3154
02:00:36,281 --> 02:00:40,240
of gigs and get ready to put together 
another hour.

3155
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,100
Okay.
How long does that take?

3156
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,053
It takes a while.
I might have to do some illegal 

3157
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:46,020
substances.
Don't tell,

3158
02:00:46,021 --> 02:00:47,980
don't tell anybody.
Now it's my ideas.

3159
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:49,360
I won't say,
hold on a second.

3160
02:00:49,361 --> 02:00:50,194
I won't say anything to end yet.
This director designate trying to tell 

3161
02:00:54,971 --> 02:00:55,804
all these folks to make mushrooms legal.
It's not hurting anybody and it's given 

3162
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:02,050
a lot of folks from real good ideas.
Oh,

3163
02:01:02,051 --> 02:01:03,400
hey,
before I forget,

3164
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,440
and I probably should've told you this 
offline,

3165
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:07,250
but,
uh,

3166
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:09,760
Newt Gingrich,
uh,

3167
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:12,670
thinks it would be excellent to sit down
and talk to get the fuck Outta here.

3168
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,770
Hits the truth.
Newt Gingrich Gingrich,

3169
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:16,460
and I'll tell you how I know this.
How do you know this?

3170
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:19,670
I know the person who runs his,
uh,

3171
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:23,890
admin and operations is media stuff and 
the things that he does,

3172
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:25,360
and he does a lot.
Uh,

3173
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:27,610
and she's a great person.
And she told me,

3174
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,610
you know,
that's what he'd like.

3175
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:31,590
She brought it up.
Then she brought it up to me,

3176
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:32,710
the podcast.
Right.

3177
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,690
That's what I know.
I fucked up and I got too big.

3178
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:36,190
It's time to quit,
Jamie.

3179
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:39,950
We've got to move to quarter lane.
Go Pike fishing.

3180
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,930
They got some awesome pike fishing out 
there.

3181
02:01:42,230 --> 02:01:42,750
Yeah.
Dot.

3182
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:43,470
Yeah,
they do.

3183
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:45,020
And good hunting up there too.
Um,

3184
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:46,453
but it's,
uh,

3185
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:49,150
so that's a great part of the country.
They look at it,

3186
02:01:49,151 --> 02:01:49,960
look,
oh yeah.

3187
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:54,140
See Houses on our,
that's a precarious situation.

3188
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:56,820
That's,
yeah.

3189
02:01:56,830 --> 02:01:59,360
You got to assume that just the tank 
situation as well.

3190
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:02,960
They're not hooked up to city water.
What a fucking weird spot in the house.

3191
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,033
He greedy bitch.
Can you find the right to tell him the 

3192
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:07,660
rock?
Pay It like mccall.

3193
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:08,720
I mean,
not since we're,

3194
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:13,100
since today's travel log,
we're taking you to Idaho today.

3195
02:02:13,101 --> 02:02:15,020
How do you say it yet?
Pay Yet.

3196
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:17,510
P.
A.

3197
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,510
Y.
E.

3198
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,510
T.
T.

3199
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:18,650
E.
That's where you got a cabin.

3200
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:20,930
I know,
right?

3201
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,580
Oh.
How many people out there?

3202
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:23,720
Uh,
not many.

3203
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,520
It's a small town.
It's much smaller than catch him.

3204
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,570
Like,
give me a number.

3205
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:27,411
Uh,
Geez.

3206
02:02:27,411 --> 02:02:32,411
I don't already 17 white nationalists.
All right.

3207
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:36,770
There's a lot of thinking about one of 
the other states.

3208
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:38,030
You not thinking it like,
oh no.

3209
02:02:38,031 --> 02:02:39,610
I know.
Some white nationalists.

3210
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:41,520
What they say?
I've never met one,

3211
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:42,850
but uh,
well they wouldn't,

3212
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:46,280
I know they'd keep that from me as well.
This guy knows too many people.

3213
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:51,670
That's really that Lake Shit I'm telling
you that makes me,

3214
02:02:51,801 --> 02:02:53,180
right now I'm getting anxiety.

3215
02:02:53,180 --> 02:02:55,460
I want to push the boat out there and 
start fishing.

3216
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:58,310
I can see the water,
like look how flat it is.

3217
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,500
I could see like the,
the,

3218
02:02:59,950 --> 02:03:02,810
the trout breaking the surface during 
the summer.

3219
02:03:02,811 --> 02:03:04,820
You just go out there and you know,
in the high season you don't,

3220
02:03:04,821 --> 02:03:06,930
when you're not fishing you just float 
around.

3221
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,870
You know,
the little water skiing if you want to,

3222
02:03:08,871 --> 02:03:12,320
but mostly just kinda hang out.
That looks fucking amazing.

3223
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:15,530
And 10 minutes from there is a,
is the ski area at a ski resort.

3224
02:03:15,531 --> 02:03:17,300
It's a great little ski place,
man.

3225
02:03:17,301 --> 02:03:20,330
I think I'm done with skiing every time 
I ski,

3226
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:21,770
this is what I'm doing.
Don't get hurt.

3227
02:03:21,771 --> 02:03:22,970
Don't get hurt.
Don't get hurt.

3228
02:03:22,971 --> 02:03:24,890
Don't get hurt.
Didn't get hurt.

3229
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,753
Right.
Yeah.

3230
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:28,880
I know another one of my friends just 
blew out her acl.

3231
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:32,060
I know three friends that blew out their
acl in a year.

3232
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:33,890
All skiing,
all skiing.

3233
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:35,780
Three in a year.
Yeah.

3234
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:37,333
You gotta you gotta with just right.
It's like everything else you've got to 

3235
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:39,830
you,
but you're right.

3236
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:42,350
Once you have that thought and I know 
exactly what you're thinking,

3237
02:03:42,351 --> 02:03:43,970
I'm doing the same thing.
I'm heading down to stop thinking.

3238
02:03:43,971 --> 02:03:46,250
I can not afford to hurt myself.
I got too much work to do.

3239
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:47,450
Don't get hurt,
don't get hurt,

3240
02:03:47,451 --> 02:03:49,490
don't get hurt,
didn't get hurt.

3241
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:53,090
I was snowboarding one time and I just,
I just completely lost it.

3242
02:03:53,470 --> 02:03:54,303
A cracked some ribs,
couldn't catch my breath when I was 

3243
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:57,254
laying on my back and it was towards the
end of the day in which always that's 

3244
02:04:00,021 --> 02:04:00,651
when it happens,
right?

3245
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:01,484
You're exhausted but you think I'm going
to do one more run because it sounds 

3246
02:04:04,161 --> 02:04:05,610
like a good idea.
And so anyway,

3247
02:04:05,611 --> 02:04:07,670
I'm laying down there and there was 
nobody else out.

3248
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,533
I mean it was,
it was getting twilight and I'm looking 

3249
02:04:09,591 --> 02:04:11,550
up at the sky,
is this here?

3250
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:12,413
This is this sound good at that.
And I hear this noise behind me and 

3251
02:04:14,091 --> 02:04:15,320
these two guys,
it couldn't have been.

3252
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:17,720
Both of them are probably like 19 maybe 
they come,

3253
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:18,583
they come screeching to a stop and I'm 
looking up and I'm trying to catch my 

3254
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:25,640
breath and I can't really move.
And so all I can see is when their faces

3255
02:04:25,641 --> 02:04:29,630
come into the frame above my head and 
they both looked down at me and they go,

3256
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:30,890
ah,
dude.

3257
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:35,210
And then they take off,
left you then left me there.

3258
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,950
They didn't do it I guess,
cause I didn't say,

3259
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,460
ah,
maybe,

3260
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:38,070
maybe we'll paint it.
I

3261
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,903
just,
I didn't say anything because I was 

3262
02:04:39,361 --> 02:04:41,670
trying to catch my breath and they just 
take off and I'm thinking,

3263
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:45,120
well that's sucks a small window.
Say help.

3264
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:46,770
Yeah.
Pride.

3265
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:48,373
Ego.
Right.

3266
02:04:48,410 --> 02:04:49,290
Right.
You're like,

3267
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:50,970
I don't want to tell these little fucks 
that I'm hurt.

3268
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:52,090
No,
exactly.

3269
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:53,820
Little punks.
I dropped into a tree,

3270
02:04:53,821 --> 02:04:57,210
well a couple of seasons ago and um,
I was,

3271
02:04:57,330 --> 02:04:59,440
we were out on the well a tree.
Well and I was saying,

3272
02:04:59,441 --> 02:05:01,530
what's that country?
Well you know how you have a tree,

3273
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:02,940
lots of snow falling,
you know,

3274
02:05:02,941 --> 02:05:05,400
you got powder.
And so what will happen sometimes is you

3275
02:05:05,401 --> 02:05:08,310
get the appearance of solid snow,
but around the tree,

3276
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:09,630
the base of the tree,
you'll get these,

3277
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:13,650
these little caves almost like it.
There's nothing around the bottom of the

3278
02:05:13,651 --> 02:05:15,980
tree.
So the tendency is for the snow.

3279
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:17,400
If you get too close to the tree,
well,

3280
02:05:17,401 --> 02:05:20,100
you'll collapse into it and then you're 
the bottom of this hole,

3281
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:20,740
right?

3282
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:22,530
And you're trying to get out.
And usually it happens,

3283
02:05:22,531 --> 02:05:23,900
you know,
when there's beautiful snow,

3284
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:25,830
it's all powder and you can't get out.
So anyway,

3285
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:26,793
uh,
my wife and I were on the backside of 

3286
02:05:28,561 --> 02:05:30,170
this mountain,
and so there's nobody around.

3287
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:32,220
She got out ahead of me.
Um,

3288
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:33,173
and uh,
I fell into this thing and that's the 

3289
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:38,580
time when I thought to myself,
after about 35 minutes,

3290
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:40,320
uh,
trying to haul my ass out of there,

3291
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:43,710
I thought I could actually die here.
But the snow was falling lightly,

3292
02:05:43,711 --> 02:05:44,544
you know?
And there was still a little bit of sun 

3293
02:05:45,061 --> 02:05:47,130
coming through and it was a beautiful 
thing.

3294
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:50,130
And I literally thought I had to lay 
down for a minute to catch my breath and

3295
02:05:50,131 --> 02:05:51,270
think,
I'll give this another try.

3296
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:52,553
I thought,
Eh,

3297
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:56,010
there's worse places to die.
And I know he thought that.

3298
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:56,761
I thought,
I thought,

3299
02:05:56,761 --> 02:05:57,870
you know what,
if you got to go here,

3300
02:05:57,871 --> 02:06:00,210
because I'm thinking at some point my 
heart's going to explode because I was,

3301
02:06:00,211 --> 02:06:02,020
I was working like a son of a bitch.

3302
02:06:02,650 --> 02:06:05,430
How are we trying to do it?
You just try it out first.

3303
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:06,600
At first you think,
okay,

3304
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:08,820
I get my,
get my skis back on and get out of here.

3305
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:09,920
Or maybe I won't get my skis,
I'll,

3306
02:06:09,921 --> 02:06:12,120
I'll try to just step out of here and 
get up.

3307
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:15,420
But it's just all,
it's like being in a quicksand.

3308
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:17,550
It's like being in quicksand,
I guess is a good analogy.

3309
02:06:17,551 --> 02:06:18,384
Yeah.
And so it's just that you can't get a 

3310
02:06:19,411 --> 02:06:20,244
grip on anything.
You can't get ahold of anything and 

3311
02:06:21,361 --> 02:06:22,194
you're trying to pull yourself back up.
And even if you do get a little ways 

3312
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:24,300
out,
you're on,

3313
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:25,170
you're on powder,
right.

3314
02:06:25,171 --> 02:06:26,760
And this,
and there was a beautiful powder day,

3315
02:06:26,761 --> 02:06:28,440
right?
Blue skies is this powder.

3316
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,953
Well,
you sink into it up to your thighs and 

3317
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:33,960
beyond.
And so when you're doing that,

3318
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:35,010
think about it.
You're trying to,

3319
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,293
you're trying to get,
cause then at a certain point you gotta 

3320
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,360
get your skis back on,
right,

3321
02:06:38,361 --> 02:06:38,670
right.

3322
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:39,301
And then your,
your,

3323
02:06:39,301 --> 02:06:39,931
your,
your,

3324
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:40,761
uh,
you're,

3325
02:06:40,761 --> 02:06:42,960
you're about,
you're about done.

3326
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:44,190
By the time you get out of a tree.
Well,

3327
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:46,320
and now you're trying to get your skis 
back on and you're,

3328
02:06:46,321 --> 02:06:47,790
you're in powder and you're trying to do
that.

3329
02:06:47,791 --> 02:06:48,510
And it's,
I,

3330
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:50,830
it turned into a real gogo,
but I,

3331
02:06:50,831 --> 02:06:51,664
I guess my point for you,
because it was a beautiful day and I 

3332
02:06:52,801 --> 02:06:53,634
thought,
Eh,

3333
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:54,613
Eh,
not that I was going to lay down and 

3334
02:06:55,411 --> 02:06:56,850
die,
but I thought if you had to,

3335
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:59,430
if you happen to go,
it's not a bad place.

3336
02:06:59,431 --> 02:07:00,780
It's a great attitude.
But it's also,

3337
02:07:00,781 --> 02:07:03,060
I think indicative of how much shit 
you've seen in your life.

3338
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:04,990
God says this,
these,

3339
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:06,450
I'm here.
I was worried about the wolves.

3340
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:10,110
The wolves come by.
It not my bones would do.

3341
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:12,520
They would like that guy's coyote.
Oh,

3342
02:07:12,521 --> 02:07:14,540
it was a horrible story about,
uh,

3343
02:07:14,670 --> 02:07:18,450
in Africa where a toddler got stolen by 
a leopard.

3344
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:20,760
I put it on my twitter.
Jeez.

3345
02:07:20,990 --> 02:07:23,100
I put that stuff on my twitter all the 
time.

3346
02:07:23,101 --> 02:07:24,540
People go,
why do you put this up?

3347
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:27,960
Why do you post this?
Because I want people to know.

3348
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:31,380
I want you gotta delusional sense of 
wildlife.

3349
02:07:31,381 --> 02:07:32,214
You fucks.
You dummies out there taking selfies 

3350
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:35,140
with bears.
Well,

3351
02:07:35,141 --> 02:07:35,921
I just,
I was in,

3352
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:36,430
uh,

3353
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:39,450
Connecticut just a a couple of days ago.
Um,

3354
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:41,530
and I was talking to some folks there 
that I know,

3355
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:42,453
uh,
cause we used to live out there a while 

3356
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:48,010
back before we moved to Idaho and they 
were telling me a story that they've got

3357
02:07:48,011 --> 02:07:48,844
this alert out.
This bobcat is on the loose in 

3358
02:07:51,251 --> 02:07:53,200
Connecticut right now.
It's a pretty rural state.

3359
02:07:53,201 --> 02:07:54,210
People don't realize that.
Yeah,

3360
02:07:54,211 --> 02:07:55,210
it is,
but it's a rural state.

3361
02:07:55,211 --> 02:07:56,120
But anyway,
this,

3362
02:07:56,121 --> 02:07:58,210
this lady was walking her two little 
dogs,

3363
02:07:58,510 --> 02:07:59,950
right.
I know what kind of dogs they were.

3364
02:07:59,951 --> 02:08:00,784
But this out of nowhere,
this bobcat just like swooped and 

3365
02:08:02,561 --> 02:08:04,360
grabbed one of them took off.
Right.

3366
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:07,480
And she's chasing the cat tried to save 
her dog,

3367
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:08,830
but that dog is done,
right.

3368
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:10,780
Yeah.
And so she's trying to chase so she gets

3369
02:08:10,781 --> 02:08:12,610
anyway,
so they had sightings of this thing,

3370
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:14,840
but now everybody's freaking out because
it's a danger to their,

3371
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:17,110
their shit's zoo or whatever.

3372
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:21,070
They found a mountain lion and 
Connecticut a few years back and I think

3373
02:08:21,071 --> 02:08:23,890
he got killed on the highway,
I think,

3374
02:08:23,891 --> 02:08:25,510
uh,
and they found was driving.

3375
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:27,303
Ah,
one of the things they fell out in this 

3376
02:08:29,501 --> 02:08:31,660
sort of humor he outlined,
it was edited,

3377
02:08:31,661 --> 02:08:34,570
traveled from,
I want to say North Dakota.

3378
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:39,040
It's way all the way across the country.
That's fantastic.

3379
02:08:39,050 --> 02:08:40,140
Yeah.
They can roam,

3380
02:08:40,141 --> 02:08:40,900
man.
Yeah.

3381
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:44,260
It's like we used to have coyotes come 
across our front yard and Connecticut.

3382
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:45,333
Oh yeah.
I mean they're,

3383
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:47,680
they're so adaptable.
They're in New York City now.

3384
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:48,663
Really?
Yup.

3385
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:50,320
That is not where I would go as a 
coyote.

3386
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:52,930
What does this all links in someone's 
kitchen?

3387
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:53,860
Oh,
that's not good.

3388
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:56,193
That ain't good.

3389
02:09:00,070 --> 02:09:01,030
Wow.
We hear that noise.

3390
02:09:01,031 --> 02:09:06,031
It's making like if you whoa,
how it got there.

3391
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:10,750
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3392
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:15,700
So creepy.
I'll tell you what the noise is.

3393
02:09:15,701 --> 02:09:16,534
This thing is making,
I think that's a person taking the 

3394
02:09:18,671 --> 02:09:19,271
video.
Don't,

3395
02:09:19,271 --> 02:09:23,410
you know,
I guess

3396
02:09:25,790 --> 02:09:28,250
I would punt that thing and do another 
dimension.

3397
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:30,350
Yeah,
no fucking question.

3398
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:31,760
I will get it.
The omelette pan out.

3399
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:32,813
If this is going down,
it's going down right now and I'm going 

3400
02:09:35,561 --> 02:09:36,640
to choose.
Yeah.

3401
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:40,660
That thing was crazy.
I mean,

3402
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,440
you know,
they made that noise back.

3403
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:45,400
Just one that was a lady taking the 
video.

3404
02:09:45,401 --> 02:09:47,480
Let me hear that again.
Give me some volume.

3405
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:57,070
I think that is the lady.
No,

3406
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:06,100
that's,
that's the cat.

3407
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:11,853
Fuck you cat.
That thing is there is something wrong 

3408
02:10:14,891 --> 02:10:16,300
with that cat.
That cat's got an issue.

3409
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:18,130
It's got a problem.
Yeah.

3410
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:20,070
That's on meds.
Yeah.

3411
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,390
That's uh,
that's opioids right there.

3412
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:24,690
There's something going on.
Holly's yeah.

3413
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,010
Well thank you for bringing that up.
Um,

3414
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:27,750
but you're right.
They,

3415
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:29,980
the,
the notion about what wildlife is like.

3416
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:30,680
Yeah.
You know,

3417
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,513
I mean,
if,

3418
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:35,000
you know,
it's just it and it's that difference,

3419
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:35,661
right?
It's a difference.

3420
02:10:35,661 --> 02:10:38,180
If you're living in New York City,
you've got this perspective about,

3421
02:10:38,181 --> 02:10:39,014
about it and it's all,
that's why I'm [inaudible] Kylie's have 

3422
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:42,164
made their way into New York City.
You're gonna start snatching dogs and 

3423
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:45,440
people are going to go,
hey,

3424
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:47,700
they're not our friends.
They're not,

3425
02:10:47,701 --> 02:10:48,534
uh,
they're not like,

3426
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:50,380
why Coyote?
We should.

3427
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,400
We just need to,
we need to understand why they're upset.

3428
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:55,400
Yeah.
We've encroached on their land.

3429
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:56,263
Nope.
Nope.

3430
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:58,770
This is what they do.
What was the best hunting trip yet?

3431
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:02,150
I'm curious.
My favorite to hunt his elk.

3432
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:03,080
Elk?
Yeah,

3433
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:04,063
because first of all,
because you get one elk and you get 

3434
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:07,640
hundreds of pounds of meat and I love 
that.

3435
02:11:07,641 --> 02:11:09,110
Yeah,
it's delicious.

3436
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,570
The only thing that's as delicious as 
this axis,

3437
02:11:11,571 --> 02:11:13,700
deer access deer is pretty damn 
delicious.

3438
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:15,013
The thing about axis deer too is it's 
one of the most ethical trips because 

3439
02:11:20,511 --> 02:11:23,900
you have to kill them because they don't
have any natural predators at all.

3440
02:11:23,901 --> 02:11:26,300
And there's 20,000 of 'em on Lanai 
alone.

3441
02:11:26,301 --> 02:11:27,134
Then there's the lor on Molokai.
They have them on Maui and there's no 

3442
02:11:29,991 --> 02:11:30,824
predators,
so they literally have a responsibility 

3443
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:34,093
to kill them.
Otherwise they're going to face 

3444
02:11:34,851 --> 02:11:37,490
starvation and disease and 
overpopulation,

3445
02:11:37,730 --> 02:11:40,310
decimation of,
of plant life.

3446
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:42,170
I mean,
they just eat everything in sight.

3447
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:45,100
Do you have to get a separate license 
for each island or how does that not,

3448
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:47,750
no,
I think you get a Hawaii state license,

3449
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:50,330
but the way it works in Lanai,
you can,

3450
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,620
you could shoot 12 of them.

3451
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:54,290
12,
12 that's how many they have,

3452
02:11:54,291 --> 02:11:55,890
which is crazy for deer.
Yeah.

3453
02:11:56,180 --> 02:12:00,000
I mean the most he ever hear is like two
bucks in some states and you know,

3454
02:12:00,050 --> 02:12:01,550
they're,
they're really have a lot of deers.

3455
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,960
What do you end up with once you address
it?

3456
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:04,123
Um,
I would say each one you're getting 

3457
02:12:08,031 --> 02:12:12,470
around 50 plus pounds of meat.
They're about 200 pounds on the hoof.

3458
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:13,570
Okay.
Yeah.

3459
02:12:13,690 --> 02:12:14,540
Yeah.
They look,

3460
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:17,220
they look more delicate than that.
But you know,

3461
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:19,370
now it's a fairly big animal.
They're heavy.

3462
02:12:19,850 --> 02:12:22,580
They're fast as fuck too.
And Yeah,

3463
02:12:22,581 --> 02:12:24,320
when they run and you're like,
whoa.

3464
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:26,410
They mean they run like a,
it's,

3465
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:27,590
it's like,
again,

3466
02:12:27,591 --> 02:12:29,270
it's like an African animal,
like a deer.

3467
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,223
Yeah.
It's much faster than a regular deer 

3468
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:32,473
because it's like that white tail that 
took off and that video weight quicker 

3469
02:12:35,781 --> 02:12:37,010
than that.
They would be,

3470
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:38,890
that guy was not exactly what he was 
saying.

3471
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:39,743
Both.
Yeah.

3472
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:42,980
I wouldn't use him as the bar to set 
this by.

3473
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:44,023
Yeah,
he was like a light bulb that you have 

3474
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:46,730
to slap a couple of times to get it to 
go on.

3475
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:48,890
Uh,
so,

3476
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:50,420
uh,
uh,

3477
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:53,600
I had a follow up question to the deer.
Dammit.

3478
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:54,830
This is what happens.
You get older,

3479
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:59,210
I know that holy smokes and they start 
getting up in the middle of the night to

3480
02:12:59,211 --> 02:13:00,350
go pee,
but you're,

3481
02:13:00,351 --> 02:13:01,184
you're out in this island.
This is this gorgeous island on the 

3482
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:07,250
Pacific Ocean with just beautiful views.
I mean it's just unbelievable.

3483
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:10,220
Stunning.
And it's filled with these deer.

3484
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:11,840
I mean they are everywhere on that 
island.

3485
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:13,640
That's the best thing about when it 
comes down to it,

3486
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:14,780
the hunting,
the fishing,

3487
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:18,110
it's just being out there.
Sometimes you have to remember,

3488
02:13:18,111 --> 02:13:18,944
you have to stop.
And I mean like it even went fly 

3489
02:13:20,721 --> 02:13:22,910
fishing.
Sometimes you get caught up and all of a

3490
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:23,744
sudden you have to stop and you step 
back and you kind of look around and 

3491
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:25,970
think,
oh yeah,

3492
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,220
this makes sense.
I don't do enough fishing.

3493
02:13:28,221 --> 02:13:29,630
I fucking love fishing.
I've,

3494
02:13:29,690 --> 02:13:32,130
I've done fishing a few times recently 
with my kids,

3495
02:13:32,131 --> 02:13:35,400
but it's ocean fishing where you're out 
there trolling,

3496
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:36,263
you know,
you're in a boat and you're pulling the 

3497
02:13:37,231 --> 02:13:38,064
line.
It's not as fun casting like on a lake 

3498
02:13:40,201 --> 02:13:42,750
is the best like top water bait or 
something like that.

3499
02:13:43,190 --> 02:13:44,100
Yeah,
that's great for kids.

3500
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:44,934
Kids love that

3501
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:46,690
man.
I've started taking,

3502
02:13:46,691 --> 02:13:47,524
uh,
I've been lucky enough to be a part of 

3503
02:13:49,331 --> 02:13:50,164
a,
an Alaskan fishing trip that happens 

3504
02:13:51,881 --> 02:13:55,390
every year when you guys go for a 
halibut salmon.

3505
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:59,180
And I've actually got a picture of a 
couple of the halibut to,

3506
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:00,011
uh,
my boy,

3507
02:14:00,011 --> 02:14:01,810
cause now he's old enough I can bring 
him with me.

3508
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:04,760
And um,
and,

3509
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:07,150
and so we go every year when it's a,
it's a group of guys,

3510
02:14:07,151 --> 02:14:08,860
you know,
this as maybe a 20 guys.

3511
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:10,450
Um,
and he,

3512
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:13,120
he hauls up this,
but this was his first time going,

3513
02:14:13,121 --> 02:14:14,050
right.
He's up in Alaska,

3514
02:14:14,051 --> 02:14:15,670
this beautiful place and he just,
it was just,

3515
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:17,350
you could just tell it just snapped him.
Right.

3516
02:14:17,351 --> 02:14:18,580
He was just like,
oh my God.

3517
02:14:18,581 --> 02:14:19,990
The expansive at all.
Right.

3518
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,590
It's just the size of this place.
And then you get out on the water and he

3519
02:14:23,591 --> 02:14:24,424
starts hauling up this thing and it's,
and it's this massive halibut and he 

3520
02:14:27,381 --> 02:14:28,214
just like,
I couldn't even put two words together 

3521
02:14:31,150 --> 02:14:33,910
and then you have to tell them it's got 
to go back in the water cause it's,

3522
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:35,500
it's not big enough.
Right.

3523
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:36,533
So it's getting halibut's gotta be 
either below or above a certain size 

3524
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:41,890
that the middle range has maximum for 
breeding.

3525
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:43,480
Yeah.
They get them too big.

3526
02:14:43,481 --> 02:14:44,680
They have to let them go.
Right.

3527
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:46,510
If you get,
if you get them.

3528
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:47,860
Um,
not,

3529
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:50,290
I mean,
the big enough while I'm talking,

3530
02:14:50,291 --> 02:14:50,651
I'll,
I'll,

3531
02:14:50,651 --> 02:14:52,570
I'll bring this photo up.
I don't know why I'm,

3532
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:54,610
oh my phone's dead.
Nevermind.

3533
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:57,260
Okay.

3534
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:58,880
Really,
technology fails me again.

3535
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:00,590
Um,
but uh,

3536
02:15:00,591 --> 02:15:00,941
yeah,
the,

3537
02:15:00,941 --> 02:15:01,330
the,
the,

3538
02:15:01,330 --> 02:15:04,820
the prime space in between,
I forget what the cutoff is.

3539
02:15:04,821 --> 02:15:06,800
I think they have to be over 80,
80 something inches.

3540
02:15:06,801 --> 02:15:08,480
I'm sure somebody can dial it and tell 
me,

3541
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:10,760
Oh yeah.
And if it's not,

3542
02:15:11,130 --> 02:15:13,190
if it's not over that and it's,
it's a,

3543
02:15:13,191 --> 02:15:16,340
it's a little bit over that,
then you got to toss back in.

3544
02:15:16,341 --> 02:15:19,760
Cause there's still in prime fucking 
time and they'd produced more babies for

3545
02:15:19,761 --> 02:15:20,310
that.

3546
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:21,510
Yeah.
The really big ones.

3547
02:15:21,511 --> 02:15:24,850
So a buddy of mine got a huge one and 
they cut the line on him.

3548
02:15:25,210 --> 02:15:26,590
Yeah.
They were saying it's too big.

3549
02:15:26,591 --> 02:15:27,550
We got to let it go.
And he was like,

3550
02:15:27,551 --> 02:15:28,920
what in the fuck?
Yeah,

3551
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:30,160
no.
If it's big enough,

3552
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:31,053
then they can.
But if you look at them and you think 

3553
02:15:32,771 --> 02:15:35,260
that's gotta be big enough,
80 inches.

3554
02:15:35,261 --> 02:15:35,801
Yeah.
If I,

3555
02:15:35,801 --> 02:15:36,160
if,
if,

3556
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:38,250
if this damn thing was working,
I'd show this photo of,

3557
02:15:38,251 --> 02:15:39,390
of scooter with his,
his,

3558
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:40,160
uh,
his hell,

3559
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:44,560
but we'll plug it in and charge it then 
fine.

3560
02:15:46,030 --> 02:15:47,260
I know.
It's like,

3561
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:49,150
I didn't know whether he had electricity
here.

3562
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:50,260
I need to.
We do.

3563
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:51,430
Yeah.
That's how the lights are on.

3564
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:53,110
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

3565
02:15:53,111 --> 02:15:55,090
that's right.
I don't know how things work in Idaho.

3566
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:56,590
Yeah.
It's a little different than,

3567
02:15:57,950 --> 02:16:02,260
but if 80 oh look at that size of that 
fucking thing.

3568
02:16:02,261 --> 02:16:04,110
Pounds.
That's a beautiful one.

3569
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,073
There you go.
Just pretend.

3570
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:05,950
Just pretend my,
uh,

3571
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:10,390
one of those kids is my kid pretty much 
said wow,

3572
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:12,520
they're enormous.
But if they're bigger than that,

3573
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:14,020
they probably have to let them go.
I mean,

3574
02:16:14,050 --> 02:16:16,930
if you get a fish,
like what happens is no,

3575
02:16:16,931 --> 02:16:17,890
but if you,
if you catch it,

3576
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:20,680
one that say is about a,
I dunno,

3577
02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:25,450
a s eight inches smaller than that,
then you got to toss it back in.

3578
02:16:25,690 --> 02:16:27,880
So the point being is you'll look at 
something and think,

3579
02:16:27,881 --> 02:16:29,360
wow,
this is definitely big enough catch.

3580
02:16:29,361 --> 02:16:30,160
And then you got to measure

3581
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,993
it.
And if it's not over that 80 some odd 

3582
02:16:32,531 --> 02:16:34,300
threshold,
you got to chuck it back in.

3583
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,160
But when you talk about efficiency that 
big,

3584
02:16:36,161 --> 02:16:37,750
you think there's no way I got to toss 
this back in.

3585
02:16:37,751 --> 02:16:38,680
But you do.
It's just,

3586
02:16:38,681 --> 02:16:40,290
it's state law.
That's great.

3587
02:16:40,310 --> 02:16:41,290
Yeah.
How many,

3588
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:43,270
what does 80 inches.
So that's six foot.

3589
02:16:43,290 --> 02:16:45,210
One and a half feet.
Six and a half feet.

3590
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:46,570
Yeah.
Geez.

3591
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:47,740
Yeah,
absolutely.

3592
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:48,574
Crazy fucking fishman.
And you just haul this and you can 

3593
02:16:50,261 --> 02:16:51,290
imagine what it's like wine.
Yeah,

3594
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:52,600
yeah.
400 feet down maybe.

3595
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:53,041
Right,
right.

3596
02:16:53,041 --> 02:16:55,060
Cause you're down towards the bottom and
you just kind of bang in the,

3597
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:56,193
you know,
the bait down there on the bottom and 

3598
02:16:56,951 --> 02:17:01,290
you it up a door to a castle.
It's like,

3599
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:02,740
yeah,
look at this.

3600
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:06,110
Wow.
And I mean halibut or delicious.

3601
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:06,953
It's really good.
And so we ended up with kind of like 

3602
02:17:07,901 --> 02:17:08,950
what you're talking about when you,
you know,

3603
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:09,820
you're thinking about,
well,

3604
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:10,390
what do you end up with?

3605
02:17:10,390 --> 02:17:12,280
Well I ended up with an entire freezer 
just from one,

3606
02:17:12,281 --> 02:17:14,380
this one trip while entire freezer full 
of,

3607
02:17:14,381 --> 02:17:16,330
of salmon and halibut.
It's pretty,

3608
02:17:16,331 --> 02:17:18,670
it's pretty taste.
And you get to do it in Alaska,

3609
02:17:18,671 --> 02:17:20,530
which is one of my favorite places to go
to.

3610
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:25,240
Alaska is just crazy that we stole that 
from the Russians for like 15 bucks.

3611
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:28,030
How much to we get it for cheaper than 
Manhattan,

3612
02:17:28,031 --> 02:17:28,864
I think.
Yeah,

3613
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:30,250
I think it was.
Um,

3614
02:17:30,430 --> 02:17:31,990
but uh,
yeah,

3615
02:17:31,991 --> 02:17:34,960
Alaska and yellowstone to places.
I tell people all the time,

3616
02:17:34,961 --> 02:17:38,310
you gotta go,
you gotta go the $7 million.

3617
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,360
That's it.
That was in 1867.

3618
02:17:40,361 --> 02:17:41,560
So,
so,

3619
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:42,790
okay.
In current dollars.

3620
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:47,170
So it'd be like $2 million but Manhattan
was like 15 bucks.

3621
02:17:47,171 --> 02:17:49,240
Right.
How much of the,

3622
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:51,660
they give the native Americans and then 
people,

3623
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:53,680
people were getting crazy written,
all these stolen,

3624
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:54,843
they're stolen,
but apparently we paid the Russians 

3625
02:17:57,341 --> 02:17:58,440
pretty well,
but we still,

3626
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,343
we stole it from the $24 24 yeah,
but you have to remember it was 

3627
02:18:04,310 --> 02:18:07,450
undeveloped at the time,
so I'm like Alaska,

3628
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:08,020
sorry.

3629
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:13,020
Alaska is still undeveloped years before
the Russians must be.

3630
02:18:13,721 --> 02:18:16,600
They sold that to us for 7 million.
It is so big.

3631
02:18:16,601 --> 02:18:18,700
I mean at least Manhattan,
it's a fairly small,

3632
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:20,470
but think about the Louisiana purchase,
right?

3633
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:21,353
I don't think White Jefferson getting 
that from Napoleon and I mean what that 

3634
02:18:23,831 --> 02:18:24,664
was like,
and it is crazy when you think how this 

3635
02:18:26,321 --> 02:18:27,154
nation was cobbled together in the 
foresight that talk the and the sort of 

3636
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:30,910
the just the balls of saying,
yeah,

3637
02:18:30,911 --> 02:18:31,960
we're going to take that.
Thank you.

3638
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:34,330
Okay.
15 million.

3639
02:18:35,590 --> 02:18:40,590
Approximately 4 cents an acre.
It seems like a fair price.

3640
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:45,670
Shit.
It was purchased in a purchase treaty by

3641
02:18:45,671 --> 02:18:46,504
the Senate and October 20th of 1803 
doubled the size of the United States 

3642
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:52,450
and opened up the continent to its 
westward expansion.

3643
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:54,100
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

3644
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,800
First thing they did was encourage 
people move out there.

3645
02:18:56,890 --> 02:18:58,390
You've got to populate that place.

3646
02:18:58,390 --> 02:18:59,530
Right.
That was the whole plan.

3647
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:03,160
Well one of the things that we saw when 
we were in Montana for the first time,

3648
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:04,031
uh,
on the,

3649
02:19:04,031 --> 02:19:07,960
on the Missouri was you would saw these 
homesteads where people tried to make it

3650
02:19:07,961 --> 02:19:10,600
out there and they realize you can't 
grow anything out there.

3651
02:19:10,601 --> 02:19:12,130
Cause you know that Mudd,
it's just,

3652
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:13,630
yeah,
it's not,

3653
02:19:13,631 --> 02:19:15,880
you can't til it,
you're not going to grow anything in it.

3654
02:19:15,881 --> 02:19:16,714
Whatever's growing there is what grows 
there and you're not going to grow 

3655
02:19:18,971 --> 02:19:20,920
anything extra.
You can't have a farm there.

3656
02:19:20,921 --> 02:19:23,260
And people tried forever because they 
just thought,

3657
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:24,303
let me just find some ground and all you
gotta do is live there for a certain 

3658
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:30,500
amount of time that would be yours.
But there's these really old broken down

3659
02:19:30,501 --> 02:19:32,110
houses from,
you know,

3660
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:32,953
the 1,817 hundreds whenever people were 
out there and you could still go there 

3661
02:19:36,291 --> 02:19:37,190
and touch the wood.

3662
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:38,770
It's really weird.
You can still see,

3663
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:40,660
yeah,
there's this homesteads like that out in

3664
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:41,830
Idaho and,
and uh,

3665
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:44,720
it is crazy when you think about people 
making their way across,

3666
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:45,583
right?
We talked about how people are getting 

3667
02:19:45,981 --> 02:19:46,814
softer,
right?

3668
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:48,110
Oh well that's why when people,
you know,

3669
02:19:48,111 --> 02:19:50,420
you'll see photos of people from those 
days,

3670
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:52,040
hey,
they look hard,

3671
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:52,400
right?
Yeah.

3672
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:56,000
I mean they puff life skinny faces.
Yeah.

3673
02:19:56,001 --> 02:19:57,080
And just,
you know,

3674
02:19:57,081 --> 02:19:59,120
they don't often look happy,
but it's,

3675
02:19:59,121 --> 02:19:59,660
you know,
they were,

3676
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:00,493
they were living a hard life and they're
making their way across the country and 

3677
02:20:03,050 --> 02:20:04,760
sometimes you,
you imagine they just thinking,

3678
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:05,870
ah,
fuck it,

3679
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:08,270
this is as far as I can go.
And they just put up stakes there,

3680
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:08,810
right.
They said,

3681
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:10,160
fine,
we'll just build here.

3682
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:12,500
And maybe it was good land.
Maybe it wasn't.

3683
02:20:12,890 --> 02:20:13,723
But can you imagine when you get to that
point where you suddenly staring at the 

3684
02:20:16,461 --> 02:20:18,470
rockies and you think,
really,

3685
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:21,140
I got to cross this in those days?

3686
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:21,650
I mean it,
it,

3687
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:22,750
the,
the expansion there,

3688
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:24,950
the western movement of people.
Um,

3689
02:20:25,070 --> 02:20:30,070
there was a series called a 
misogynistic,

3690
02:20:30,291 --> 02:20:32,030
but it was called the men who built 
America.

3691
02:20:32,390 --> 02:20:33,223
Right.
Or the men who the frontiers men or 

3692
02:20:34,461 --> 02:20:37,760
something like that is misogynist,
sexist.

3693
02:20:37,761 --> 02:20:40,850
I know exact women didn't build anything
you asshole.

3694
02:20:40,910 --> 02:20:42,040
I mean,
you know,

3695
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:44,990
I did some cooking and uh,
yeah,

3696
02:20:45,010 --> 02:20:46,580
mending babies,
mending.

3697
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:47,810
But no,
if,

3698
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:48,643
if that series was really good,
there was a first one was the men who 

3699
02:20:50,541 --> 02:20:52,970
built America and then they did another 
series about the frontiersman.

3700
02:20:52,971 --> 02:20:54,560
And that ones is the one I'm thinking of
is,

3701
02:20:54,561 --> 02:20:56,690
I think there's like,
I don't five or six episodes to it.

3702
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:58,840
I think it's on Netflix.
Uh,

3703
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:00,350
but it talks about,
and it goes,

3704
02:21:00,351 --> 02:21:02,210
it covers the whole thing here.
But it covers Davy,

3705
02:21:02,211 --> 02:21:02,990
Crockett,
Daniel Boone,

3706
02:21:02,990 --> 02:21:04,930
all the characters that you remember 
hearing about it.

3707
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:06,800
But it goes into real historical detail 
about it.

3708
02:21:06,801 --> 02:21:08,520
And it's,
it's fascinating when you,

3709
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:09,373
when you look at how this place was 
cobbled together and quickly and 

3710
02:21:11,751 --> 02:21:13,820
quickly,
you think about just a couple of hundred

3711
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:15,920
years time and relation to the rest of 
the world.

3712
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:18,290
A couple of hundred years,
things didn't change that much at all.

3713
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:19,341
No,
exactly.

3714
02:21:19,341 --> 02:21:22,210
It remarkable story.
But uh,

3715
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,000
but yeah,
it's,

3716
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,070
it's also you get an appreciation for 
kind of how we,

3717
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:26,650
how we might have treated the native 
Americans.

3718
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:28,460
Yeah,
sure.

3719
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:29,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

3720
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:32,990
A seven year old came home the other day
with a pail look in her face and I go,

3721
02:21:32,991 --> 02:21:34,550
what's going on?
She's like,

3722
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:35,384
I learned about the Donner Party today.
Hope fucking seven teaching kids about 

3723
02:21:40,281 --> 02:21:42,290
the Donner Party.
She's like,

3724
02:21:42,291 --> 02:21:43,250
where are they die?
I'm like,

3725
02:21:43,251 --> 02:21:44,084
the mountains.
They tried to make it across during the 

3726
02:21:46,161 --> 02:21:48,260
winter and they didn't make it and 
choose it.

3727
02:21:48,261 --> 02:21:49,670
Like,
like they ate each other,

3728
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:50,743
they ate each other.
Like they're teaching my fucking seven 

3729
02:21:52,431 --> 02:21:56,360
year old that people eat people.
You're playing Oregon trail back then,

3730
02:21:56,361 --> 02:21:57,260
which is,
I mean,

3731
02:21:57,261 --> 02:21:59,090
it's a video game.
That's the video game violence.

3732
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:02,260
But you know,
just,

3733
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:05,930
just something about learning that that 
could happen.

3734
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:07,243
I mean,
and did just a couple of hundred years 

3735
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:10,350
ago,
not that long ago.

3736
02:22:10,390 --> 02:22:11,390
Well,
you look at Lewis and Clark,

3737
02:22:11,720 --> 02:22:14,570
look at what they did and what they were
wandering out into,

3738
02:22:14,571 --> 02:22:15,404
which they had no idea what they would,
they didn't know what the fuck was out 

3739
02:22:17,301 --> 02:22:20,690
there in terms of predators,
terms of natives.

3740
02:22:20,691 --> 02:22:23,930
They didn't know what was going on.
I had to call one time from a production

3741
02:22:23,931 --> 02:22:24,764
company,
want to know whether I wanted to take 

3742
02:22:25,321 --> 02:22:28,410
part in that and they wouldn't do a 
series on it was on the Donner party.

3743
02:22:28,570 --> 02:22:29,403
They,
we're going to recreate that whole 

3744
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:31,890
expedition.
Right.

3745
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:33,540
And,
or I mean,

3746
02:22:33,541 --> 02:22:34,374
right down to the last thing,
everything was supposed to be 

3747
02:22:35,491 --> 02:22:37,860
historically accurate and everything.
And I,

3748
02:22:37,861 --> 02:22:40,980
I,
I listened to what they were doing and I

3749
02:22:40,981 --> 02:22:44,550
thought to myself,
thank you very much.

3750
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:45,600
Uh,
I just,

3751
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:47,940
I couldn't get myself excited about it,
I guess.

3752
02:22:47,941 --> 02:22:49,200
You know,
I thought it would be interesting,

3753
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:51,750
but probably only interesting for the 
first couple of days.

3754
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:53,650
And then you're thinking,
ah,

3755
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:55,320
why am I here?
Why am I here?

3756
02:22:55,350 --> 02:22:56,183
Right.
Yeah.

3757
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:58,170
I mean for the sake of a show.
But you know,

3758
02:22:58,171 --> 02:22:59,640
I think they've,
they pulled it together.

3759
02:22:59,641 --> 02:23:02,280
I said I'd have to look and see what 
they're actually faked a bunch of shit.

3760
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,193
Anyway,
those shows things don't go well like 

3761
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:07,130
Tom Defrank it.
Yeah.

3762
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:08,760
Yeah.
Because the crew is always right there.

3763
02:23:08,761 --> 02:23:13,110
Right.
It's like bear grylls will I survive why

3764
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:17,640
you might eat and hopefully your 
cameraman does do so bear grylls.

3765
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:18,833
It was a direct response to survivor man
refusing to fake things cause he did it 

3766
02:23:23,611 --> 02:23:26,710
on the same network.
Oh Les Stroud is a friend of mine and he

3767
02:23:26,711 --> 02:23:28,230
was telling me what happened.

3768
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:31,650
They were trying to get him to fake 
things and he was like,

3769
02:23:31,651 --> 02:23:32,484
no,
I'm going to go by myself with just 

3770
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:37,290
cameras and I'm going to fill myself 
actually surviving.

3771
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:41,010
And if you watch less,
he'll do a show where,

3772
02:23:41,011 --> 02:23:42,270
you know,
he's out there for five,

3773
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:43,860
six days.
By the end of those five days,

3774
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:46,410
his cheeks are sunken in.
He looks like shit.

3775
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,900
He's barely sleeping.
He's just eating.

3776
02:23:48,901 --> 02:23:51,450
Anything you can find sometimes not 
eating for days.

3777
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:52,430
Well,
you know,

3778
02:23:52,430 --> 02:23:53,720
that'd be great.
Yeah.

3779
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:56,760
Bear gcs.
He's all good in the Marietta is exactly

3780
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:59,210
what's going to say.
Well,

3781
02:23:59,211 --> 02:24:03,480
I felt bottled water.
Now I'm off to the days inn on camera.

3782
02:24:03,481 --> 02:24:04,314
He's drinking his own piss and just 
survival for roots soon as the camera's 

3783
02:24:08,791 --> 02:24:10,500
like God,
give me that twinkie.

3784
02:24:10,570 --> 02:24:13,470
I don't remember where he came out of,
I can't remember what,

3785
02:24:13,471 --> 02:24:16,620
uh,
where he was in the British military.

3786
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:18,750
Um,
I'm trying to remember.

3787
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:22,110
I don't think he was with the sps or sas
or anything like that.

3788
02:24:22,111 --> 02:24:22,944
I think I thought it was,
I thought it wasn't a cs and thought 

3789
02:24:24,481 --> 02:24:26,280
that's what they said.
Maybe it was maybe,

3790
02:24:26,281 --> 02:24:27,300
but anyway.
Yeah.

3791
02:24:27,301 --> 02:24:28,134
But yeah,
if you're doing it for real and you 

3792
02:24:29,281 --> 02:24:31,270
think about the amount of calories 
you're burning,

3793
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:35,820
what you need to replace and then you 
realize that's what it was all about.

3794
02:24:36,030 --> 02:24:39,510
People spent every waking hour,
uh,

3795
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:42,390
collecting food and water to keep 
themselves going.

3796
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:43,560
Yeah.
That was it.

3797
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:46,650
Until you know,
whenever you have thoughts that when you

3798
02:24:46,651 --> 02:24:47,484
go on hunting trips,
like if you had to just hunt for 

3799
02:24:49,561 --> 02:24:51,390
survival,
a hunting trip,

3800
02:24:51,391 --> 02:24:52,224
you could easily go five,
six days and not even see an animal if 

3801
02:24:55,351 --> 02:24:57,660
you're in the wrong spot,
you've got to try to find them.

3802
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:00,480
I mean there's many days where you go 
and you don't see anything.

3803
02:25:00,510 --> 02:25:02,460
Like what if you're hungry that day?
Well,

3804
02:25:02,490 --> 02:25:05,830
tough shit up shit.
Yeah.

3805
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,650
And those people did that with muskets 
and bows and arrows and tried to make it

3806
02:25:10,651 --> 02:25:14,040
across the country without any idea what
the fuck was in front of them.

3807
02:25:14,070 --> 02:25:14,903
I mean,
Lewis and Clark grind or Powell going 

3808
02:25:17,671 --> 02:25:18,504
down the Colorado,
the amount of food they needed to 

3809
02:25:20,521 --> 02:25:22,390
consume as an expedition.
Right.

3810
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,140
It was astounding.
And

3811
02:25:24,150 --> 02:25:26,990
that the time that you had to spend 
hunting and,

3812
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:27,843
and,
and ensuring that you would keep 

3813
02:25:28,691 --> 02:25:31,570
everybody fed and Lewis and Clark,
they ran out of food at a certain point.

3814
02:25:31,571 --> 02:25:35,890
They were reading their leftover candles
basically made out of a what?

3815
02:25:35,891 --> 02:25:36,880
Beef Tallow.
So,

3816
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,590
um,
yeah,

3817
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:39,500
that was it.
They were down.

3818
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:41,210
That was it handles.
Yeah.

3819
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:42,243
That's all they are hungry.
You have to be to eat a candle who gets 

3820
02:25:44,471 --> 02:25:47,290
the wick.
It's Julie Delicious,

3821
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:49,150
uh,
anything to fill your stomach.

3822
02:25:49,151 --> 02:25:50,110
I'm sure.
Yeah.

3823
02:25:50,170 --> 02:25:50,940
But,
eh,

3824
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:52,260
anyway.
Um,

3825
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:53,441
so that's,
I,

3826
02:25:53,441 --> 02:25:54,274
you know,
the interesting thing is if you live in 

3827
02:25:56,051 --> 02:25:58,360
a place,
like if you live out west,

3828
02:25:58,390 --> 02:26:01,840
you're surrounded by this all the time.
You think about it for some reason.

3829
02:26:01,841 --> 02:26:03,220
I have no idea why,
but,

3830
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:05,190
um,
it's,

3831
02:26:05,250 --> 02:26:06,460
it's,
I,

3832
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:07,473
I get,
I,

3833
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:09,580
I've lived all over hell and back.
I'm never moving.

3834
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:10,840
I'm never moving again.

3835
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:14,110
It's obviously a gorgeous place where 
you live.

3836
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:16,210
I get it.
And Fuck Connecticut.

3837
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:19,420
You went from Connecticut to there.
I did.

3838
02:26:19,421 --> 02:26:20,254
Yeah.
You went from one of the places that I 

3839
02:26:21,161 --> 02:26:23,710
would never live to one of the places 
that I would definitely live,

3840
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:24,613
one of the world's,
one of the country's worst managed 

3841
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:27,280
states.
You know,

3842
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:29,650
it's just incredible that New Jersey 
obviously,

3843
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:31,280
uh,
you know,

3844
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:32,550
they just,
uh,

3845
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:33,543
underfunded pensions are unfunded 
pensions and a shitload of lyme disease 

3846
02:26:37,031 --> 02:26:38,170
too.
Oh yeah.

3847
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:40,220
Have you ever had lyme disease?
No.

3848
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:41,530
It's not good,
John.

3849
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:43,780
It.
Some people get it and they keep it.

3850
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:44,161
Yeah.
That,

3851
02:26:44,161 --> 02:26:45,090
hold on it.
Yeah.

3852
02:26:45,150 --> 02:26:48,010
It's like dysentery or malaria.
It's just kind of sits within.

3853
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:49,300
Yeah.
I uh,

3854
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,380
I came down with this,
uh,

3855
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:52,930
it was like flu,
like conditions.

3856
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,943
People are fascinating.
I hope Mike tells us about his lyme 

3857
02:26:55,361 --> 02:26:59,050
disease story and you just feel like 
absolute shit.

3858
02:26:59,050 --> 02:26:59,883
It feels like a bad flu.
And so I would go and I talked to a 

3859
02:27:02,351 --> 02:27:05,530
couple of doctors there in Connecticut 
and they were like,

3860
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:07,300
ah,
I think it's a flow.

3861
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:08,621
Right.
And they couldn't,

3862
02:27:08,621 --> 02:27:11,050
they didn't diagnose it.
So then we go out,

3863
02:27:11,051 --> 02:27:13,450
we're out in Idaho.
We hadn't moved out there yet,

3864
02:27:13,451 --> 02:27:17,860
but we went skiing and we were in 
Ketchum and I go into a clinic because I

3865
02:27:17,861 --> 02:27:18,694
said it just not feeling any better,
it just gives this thing as this 

3866
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:24,250
lingering.
So I go into a clinic there and I talked

3867
02:27:24,251 --> 02:27:25,084
to the guy and it's a young,
a doctor not too long out of medical 

3868
02:27:28,661 --> 02:27:30,500
school and he says,
where,

3869
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:31,510
you know,
where do you live?

3870
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:32,793
I said,
Connecticut.

3871
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,120
And he goes,
you got lyme disease.

3872
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:37,510
I mean,
I know it diagnose lyme disease.

3873
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:38,373
Turns out he went to this medical school
and Yale in Connecticut and he figured 

3874
02:27:42,401 --> 02:27:44,500
out and so yeah,
it's pretty bad to go to,

3875
02:27:44,501 --> 02:27:46,190
I know to get a good doctor.
That's what your,

3876
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:47,320
that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

3877
02:27:47,321 --> 02:27:49,540
We're 43rd and education,
but we are tops in healthcare.

3878
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:52,590
So there ya go.
Uh,

3879
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:54,070
yeah.
It's uh,

3880
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:54,560
yeah,
but,

3881
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:55,393
but ticks sees it.
It's gonna be a bad tick season at west 

3882
02:27:56,891 --> 02:27:57,724
too,
because we didn't get really a big 

3883
02:27:58,031 --> 02:27:59,730
freeze in parts of it.
Not,

3884
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:01,720
not all over are creepy little animals.

3885
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:03,443
They carry such debilitating diseases.
If you're heard about the lone star 

3886
02:28:06,151 --> 02:28:09,270
tick,
the lone star tick that turns people,

3887
02:28:09,271 --> 02:28:09,960
uh,
they,

3888
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:10,793
there's a certain derivative of a,
one of those diseases that comes with 

3889
02:28:14,401 --> 02:28:16,680
this lone star tick that,
uh,

3890
02:28:17,310 --> 02:28:20,520
it attack something called the Alpha 
Gow,

3891
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:23,090
uh,
which is short for something else.

3892
02:28:23,091 --> 02:28:26,060
But it essentially makes you allergic to
red meat.

3893
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:27,890
No,
yes.

3894
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:31,490
Yeah.
There's a tick that if it bites you,

3895
02:28:31,930 --> 02:28:35,900
if it give you a disease,
it will make you allergic to red meat.

3896
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:37,453
And it's spreading all throughout Texas.
Texas has a great a bunch of cases of 

3897
02:28:42,801 --> 02:28:43,634
it.
There it is.

3898
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:44,503
Texting me the size of a poppy seed.
Can you spot all five ticks in this 

3899
02:28:47,001 --> 02:28:47,834
photo?
And then they are they well equipped 

3900
02:28:48,561 --> 02:28:49,730
right there in the center?
Yeah.

3901
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,300
Oh fuck.
What kind of nonsense is that?

3902
02:28:53,301 --> 02:28:53,840
That's the seat

3903
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:55,410
he seen.
They just tweeted this out.

3904
02:28:55,890 --> 02:28:58,600
Why did you learn how to prevent tick 
bites to go?

3905
02:28:58,601 --> 02:28:59,450
Got Grossed out?
Yeah.

3906
02:28:59,451 --> 02:29:00,710
Like don't eat them offline.
Yeah.

3907
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:03,840
If you avoid muffins,
you won't get tick ticks on the muffins.

3908
02:29:03,841 --> 02:29:04,674
You asshole.
You did it on purpose for a picture you 

3909
02:29:05,791 --> 02:29:07,350
ruined in food.
Yeah.

3910
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:08,250
Um,

3911
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:10,440
they scare the shit out of me.
Those little creepy bugs.

3912
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,490
Okay.

3913
02:29:11,490 --> 02:29:11,880
Yeah,
we,

3914
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:12,280
uh,
you know,

3915
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:12,661
we,
we,

3916
02:29:12,661 --> 02:29:14,880
we got a big old,
a English golden retriever,

3917
02:29:14,881 --> 02:29:15,714
so we're always,
you know,

3918
02:29:15,750 --> 02:29:16,583
during this time of year we're always 
pulling ticks off him or he'll come 

3919
02:29:18,451 --> 02:29:19,800
inside and sit down.
Next thing you know,

3920
02:29:19,801 --> 02:29:22,260
once crawling off of him and I,
yeah.

3921
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:23,200
Yeah.
It's not,

3922
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,060
it's not good.
But,

3923
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:25,250
uh,
where'd you get you,

3924
02:29:25,251 --> 02:29:26,960
so you got lyme in Connecticut,
right?

3925
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:27,943
Yeah.
A lot of people in the east coast to 

3926
02:29:28,771 --> 02:29:29,640
getting it.
Yeah,

3927
02:29:29,810 --> 02:29:30,643
super common.
It's all but Connecticut is covered in 

3928
02:29:32,231 --> 02:29:32,731
ticks.
I mean,

3929
02:29:32,731 --> 02:29:34,320
I had no idea when we moved there,
but we had a,

3930
02:29:34,321 --> 02:29:35,154
we had a nice sell property and we 
haven't big pond out there and a little 

3931
02:29:37,471 --> 02:29:39,150
stream running through.
It was very picturesque,

3932
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:42,840
but it was also just covered in ticks 
that we can do about that.

3933
02:29:42,870 --> 02:29:43,620
Nothing.
Right.

3934
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:44,070
Yeah.
You know,

3935
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:45,640
they'll go through and spray.
Uh,

3936
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:47,070
but then you've got a part we can't let 
the kids out.

3937
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,233
Yeah.
Right.

3938
02:29:48,350 --> 02:29:50,420
What the fuck is the spray killing 
besides the tech?

3939
02:29:50,421 --> 02:29:51,140
Right,
exactly.

3940
02:29:51,140 --> 02:29:52,260
Yeah.
So we don't,

3941
02:29:52,290 --> 02:29:53,123
we don't,
we don't do anything like that out 

3942
02:29:53,701 --> 02:29:54,534
there.
Um,

3943
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:56,760
and it's not,
it's not so bad out west,

3944
02:29:56,761 --> 02:29:58,470
but they still have it and they don't 
have,

3945
02:29:58,500 --> 02:29:59,550
they don't have the,
the,

3946
02:29:59,551 --> 02:30:01,280
uh,
the same type.

3947
02:30:01,281 --> 02:30:03,030
So they certainly don't have this red 
meat tick.

3948
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:04,920
I had never heard.
That's a new one at Stetson.

3949
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,060
That's a creep show right there.

3950
02:30:06,910 --> 02:30:09,030
The discovered it within the last five 
years.

3951
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:10,980
Yeah.
That wouldn't be good.

3952
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:12,510
I mean,
I've given up a lot of red meat,

3953
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:13,840
but now I'm not going to give up.
Right.

3954
02:30:13,850 --> 02:30:15,540
Don't threaten me.
You know what I mean?

3955
02:30:15,541 --> 02:30:19,800
I eat less than I used to eat it all.
He did all the talking monsters.

3956
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:22,920
I try to,
I try to cut back to some degree.

3957
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:24,510
Wow.
Eh,

3958
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:25,610
you know,
just for,

3959
02:30:25,650 --> 02:30:27,420
you know,
you get a little bit older and a,

3960
02:30:27,421 --> 02:30:30,150
I'm trying to watch,
I got a family history of heart disease,

3961
02:30:30,151 --> 02:30:33,540
massive problem with heart disease.
My parents went um,

3962
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:34,870
uh,
both uh,

3963
02:30:34,871 --> 02:30:38,340
that way one of my brothers has a 
defibrillator and others got uh,

3964
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:40,590
uh,
several stents.

3965
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:43,230
The others on heart medication.
I mean it's just like,

3966
02:30:43,231 --> 02:30:44,880
it's part,
so it's a family thing so you can try to

3967
02:30:44,881 --> 02:30:45,714
do what you can,
but I'm not giving it up just like I'm 

3968
02:30:47,131 --> 02:30:48,840
not giving up my Martini.
Are you kidding me?

3969
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,570
I really don't believe that red meat has
any effect on that.

3970
02:30:52,571 --> 02:30:54,880
I think it's processed carbohydrates and
sugar.

3971
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:55,893
I think that's what it's all about.
And this comes from conversations with 

3972
02:30:58,120 --> 02:30:58,953
real scientists and nutritionists and 
people understand the actual studies 

3973
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,503
data there.
There is an issue combining 

3974
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:09,840
carbohydrates and simple refined 
carbohydrates with red meat,

3975
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:12,850
saturated fats by themselves,
not an issue.

3976
02:31:12,851 --> 02:31:15,970
Saturated fats with high levels of 
carbohydrates.

3977
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,370
Definitely an issue.
Why?

3978
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:18,303
I just say interaction.
See the interaction between the two of 

3979
02:31:20,911 --> 02:31:22,560
them.
The Way Doctor Rhonda,

3980
02:31:22,561 --> 02:31:23,394
Patrick talked about it.
I could get ahold of her and tried to 

3981
02:31:24,801 --> 02:31:27,000
get her to do it again and explain it to
me,

3982
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:31,440
but it's the interaction between 
saturated fats and carbohydrates.

3983
02:31:31,441 --> 02:31:32,274
It's not saturated fats on themselves on
their own saturated fat like red meat 

3984
02:31:36,890 --> 02:31:40,980
and and Oregon meat in particular,
extremely healthy for you,

3985
02:31:41,140 --> 02:31:45,300
very good for you,
but we're so it's so you.

3986
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:46,163
People are so used to consuming sugar 
and simple carbohydrates and processed 

3987
02:31:51,571 --> 02:31:55,710
foods for fuel that your,
your body just gets accustomed to it.

3988
02:31:55,711 --> 02:31:59,550
When you add saturated fat to process 
carbohydrates and sugar,

3989
02:31:59,551 --> 02:32:01,350
that's when you become desperate when 
get issues.

3990
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:03,870
That's why a lot of these studies that 
show that you know,

3991
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:08,871
red meat increases heart disease.
If people eat red meat over four or five

3992
02:32:09,151 --> 02:32:11,760
times a week,
have higher instances of heart disease,

3993
02:32:12,150 --> 02:32:15,930
but they're not asking what are they 
eating with the rich or the eating it in

3994
02:32:15,931 --> 02:32:16,764
a burger or they're eating it with fries
and shakes and because that's different 

3995
02:32:20,401 --> 02:32:25,401
than eating a grass fed steak with 
avocado and maybe a salad that's not bad

3996
02:32:25,741 --> 02:32:26,790
for you at all.
Yeah,

3997
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:27,833
it's an look if cancer,
if red meat really gave people heart 

3998
02:32:31,801 --> 02:32:34,890
disease and cancer and all these things 
that people say there'd be no people.

3999
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:36,570
Okay.
Because people have been eating red meat

4000
02:32:36,571 --> 02:32:41,520
from the beginning of time and literally
97% of the population eats me.

4001
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:43,380
But people process this stuff 
differently.

4002
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:44,243
Exactly.
Yeah.

4003
02:32:44,410 --> 02:32:45,243
I try.
It's processing all the different 

4004
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:51,960
preservatives that people put on in in 
red meat and processed foods.

4005
02:32:51,961 --> 02:32:52,794
That's what's fucking people up.
That and refined sugars and 

4006
02:32:55,471 --> 02:32:58,080
carbohydrates do pay attention to 
cholesterol issues.

4007
02:32:58,081 --> 02:33:00,510
I mean like is that something,
not dietary cholesterol,

4008
02:33:00,511 --> 02:33:02,460
but neither does American heart 
association.

4009
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:03,593
You know they even weightwatchers now 
says that dietary cholesterol has no 

4010
02:33:07,801 --> 02:33:12,240
impact on your actual,
like your actual blood cholesterol.

4011
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,730
Weight watchers lets you eat as many 
eggs as you want.

4012
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,260
Eggs have a zero point system in 
weightwatchers now.

4013
02:33:19,370 --> 02:33:20,970
Exos zero points.
Yeah,

4014
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:23,283
I've been doing that egg white thing.
Everybody their whole life whites are 

4015
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:27,970
not good.
But the good part is the oak.

4016
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:30,150
You want the egg and the yolk together.

4017
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:31,140
Proteins in the white,
right?

4018
02:33:31,141 --> 02:33:34,890
I mean no protein in the yolk too.
They both have protein.

4019
02:33:34,891 --> 02:33:36,790
This is nonsense.
But the cholesterol is in the,

4020
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:39,810
in the Yolk in the yellow.
But it's not bad for your cholesterol is

4021
02:33:39,811 --> 02:33:41,940
the building block for hormones?
Yeah,

4022
02:33:42,300 --> 02:33:46,500
I mean it's just we get lied to from the
beginning of time when it comes to,

4023
02:33:46,530 --> 02:33:47,363
well first of all there's a lack of 
understanding and then there's also the 

4024
02:33:50,311 --> 02:33:53,880
studies that come out that are fucking 
funded by the sugar industry,

4025
02:33:54,090 --> 02:33:54,923
you know,
about that or the sugar industry paid 

4026
02:33:56,761 --> 02:34:01,710
scientists to take the blame off of 
sugar and put it on to saturated fat.

4027
02:34:01,950 --> 02:34:03,870
There was a whole New York Times article
about it.

4028
02:34:04,170 --> 02:34:09,170
The sugar industry bribed scientist to 
lie about the dangers of sugar is,

4029
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:11,700
uh,
what's the difference between,

4030
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:13,380
uh,
uh,

4031
02:34:13,410 --> 02:34:14,250
I didn't even know what you'd call it.

4032
02:34:14,250 --> 02:34:17,210
Refined sugar and beet sugar is there,
Sarah,

4033
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:18,213
there's difference in,
there's different sugars have a 

4034
02:34:20,981 --> 02:34:21,814
different effect on like they have a 
lower glycemic index and and really 

4035
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:27,430
usually is dependent upon whether or not
they're connected to fiber.

4036
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:30,640
Like sugar in the form of fruit is not 
bad for you.

4037
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:34,470
Like if you eat an apple,
it's connected to fiber that the,

4038
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:36,010
you know,
you're eating the whole fruit.

4039
02:34:36,011 --> 02:34:38,920
That's what it's supposed to be.
That's how it's supposed to be consumed.

4040
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:42,400
The real issue comes when you take that 
sugar out of that fruit,

4041
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:45,250
you know,
whether it's high fructose corn syrup or

4042
02:34:45,251 --> 02:34:47,320
whatever the fuck y'all else you're 
getting sugar from,

4043
02:34:47,470 --> 02:34:48,303
and then consume that sugar because then
it's sugar free of all the natural 

4044
02:34:52,271 --> 02:34:54,210
things that contain it.
Yeah.

4045
02:34:54,430 --> 02:34:56,890
Fiber and the actual,
you know,

4046
02:34:56,910 --> 02:34:57,910
the tissue,
the,

4047
02:34:57,911 --> 02:34:58,600
the,
you know,

4048
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:00,650
the actual fruit itself,
the,

4049
02:35:00,651 --> 02:35:01,750
the tissue of the fruit.

4050
02:35:02,060 --> 02:35:02,970
Well was the thing I said,
well,

4051
02:35:02,971 --> 02:35:05,340
we tried to keep processed foods out of 
the house for the most part,

4052
02:35:05,341 --> 02:35:06,174
right?
So we try to keep the kids eating 

4053
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:10,680
healthy and all the things we're 
supposed to do.

4054
02:35:11,910 --> 02:35:14,100
But it is interesting the sense that,
you know,

4055
02:35:14,101 --> 02:35:16,140
from an economic standpoint,
right.

4056
02:35:16,170 --> 02:35:18,340
Eating healthy,
um,

4057
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:19,733
there's,
uh,

4058
02:35:20,730 --> 02:35:21,563
you know,
you were advantaged if you're middle 

4059
02:35:23,731 --> 02:35:25,530
class or upper class,
right?

4060
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:27,010
If you're,
uh,

4061
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,760
if you don't have the financial 
wherewithal,

4062
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:31,830
I think that's,
I don't know,

4063
02:35:31,831 --> 02:35:32,664
maybe I'm just blowing smoke up my ass,
but I think that there is something to 

4064
02:35:35,101 --> 02:35:35,970
be said for that.
I mean,

4065
02:35:35,971 --> 02:35:36,804
cause if you're going and you're 
thinking I'm going to eat organic and 

4066
02:35:37,981 --> 02:35:39,900
I'm gonna eat all these expensive,
it's expensive.

4067
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:41,160
Yeah.
And so,

4068
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:42,241
okay,
well,

4069
02:35:42,241 --> 02:35:43,074
so you've got a group of people that are
disadvantaged in the nutrition side of 

4070
02:35:46,441 --> 02:35:50,670
things because they ended up defaulting 
to the process foods or the fast foods.

4071
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,280
But I'm happy to hear about the red 
meat.

4072
02:35:53,310 --> 02:35:53,611
Now,
you know,

4073
02:35:53,611 --> 02:35:54,444
I'm going to walk out of here.
I'm going to say I can eat a steak 

4074
02:35:56,221 --> 02:35:58,440
whenever I want and then I'm going to 
get bit by this tick.

4075
02:35:58,600 --> 02:35:59,830
I'm like,
I want to stay.

4076
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,160
Well,
salmon is fantastic for that.

4077
02:36:03,270 --> 02:36:04,650
It's 100% true.
Yeah.

4078
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:07,380
And the,
the essential fatty acids and salmon,

4079
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:08,273
a mega fatty acids.
Salmon is just one of the best things 

4080
02:36:10,531 --> 02:36:11,900
you can eat.
Wild Salmon.

4081
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:13,630
Oh my God.
Phenomenal for ya'll.

4082
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:17,100
And then we've got a freezer full u haul
in some king salmon and a beautiful,

4083
02:36:17,150 --> 02:36:18,760
fantastic.
It's so good.

4084
02:36:18,761 --> 02:36:19,480
And then,
yeah,

4085
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:20,450
and that's the best meal,
you know,

4086
02:36:20,451 --> 02:36:21,041
is,
is that,

4087
02:36:21,041 --> 02:36:24,700
and some,
some basic vegetables and boom,

4088
02:36:24,701 --> 02:36:26,250
and you're done.
And Luckily I,

4089
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:27,910
you know,
we're lucky our kids like fish,

4090
02:36:27,911 --> 02:36:29,170
they really like fishing.
You know,

4091
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:31,560
there are a lot of their friends,
they'll come over for dinner.

4092
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:34,010
I don't want fish was a little fucks.
Yeah.

4093
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:35,250
I'm not gonna have that,
you know,

4094
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:36,730
and they want a burger.
Okay,

4095
02:36:36,731 --> 02:36:38,200
fine.
But uh,

4096
02:36:38,201 --> 02:36:38,970
yeah,
we,

4097
02:36:38,970 --> 02:36:39,520
we,
uh,

4098
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:41,530
we had a ton of fish because you catch a
lot of fish.

4099
02:36:41,810 --> 02:36:43,170
So yeah,
it's really good.

4100
02:36:43,530 --> 02:36:44,363
Kids get really addicted to bread to get
really addicted to hamburgers and 

4101
02:36:48,061 --> 02:36:50,590
sandwiches and things with the carbs.
It's,

4102
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:51,433
it's about carbs with kids and you know,
you need a certain amount of carbs for 

4103
02:36:54,181 --> 02:36:56,190
sure.
But we way too much.

4104
02:36:56,310 --> 02:36:56,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

4105
02:36:56,850 --> 02:36:57,683
In general.
And that is most likely what's 

4106
02:36:59,581 --> 02:37:00,414
responsible for heart disease.
Most likely was responsible for the 

4107
02:37:02,641 --> 02:37:05,190
overweight epidemic in America.
It's carbs.

4108
02:37:05,870 --> 02:37:06,720
Yeah.
I can believe that.

4109
02:37:06,721 --> 02:37:08,780
I,
I do think that the people,

4110
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:12,110
people react differently.
So I should look at two people.

4111
02:37:12,111 --> 02:37:12,944
We've got the same diet.
I'm going to process it one way and I'm 

4112
02:37:14,251 --> 02:37:17,180
going to end up with very high problem.
But,

4113
02:37:17,181 --> 02:37:18,260
uh,
yeah.

4114
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:20,000
So anyway,
but bottom line is,

4115
02:37:20,001 --> 02:37:21,350
you know,
you get to a certain point and you start

4116
02:37:21,351 --> 02:37:22,184
thinking,
now I'm going to pay a little more 

4117
02:37:22,281 --> 02:37:23,660
attention.
So that's where I am in life.

4118
02:37:23,661 --> 02:37:25,340
I'm paying a little more attention to 
what I'm eating.

4119
02:37:25,350 --> 02:37:28,220
I'll pay a little more attention to my 
regimen as far as you want to do for,

4120
02:37:28,250 --> 02:37:29,083
you know,
I'm going to send you some podcasts to 

4121
02:37:29,871 --> 02:37:30,930
listen to.
That would be good.

4122
02:37:31,050 --> 02:37:31,883
Give you a real understanding of the 
actual science behind food versus the 

4123
02:37:36,811 --> 02:37:37,644
misconceptions and versus the 
misinformation because there's so much 

4124
02:37:39,841 --> 02:37:42,030
of it out there.
And then there's so much,

4125
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:42,631
uh,
you know,

4126
02:37:42,631 --> 02:37:43,464
we've talked about this before.
This is probably a good thing to talk 

4127
02:37:45,631 --> 02:37:48,480
about this now and I need to know what's
true and what's not true.

4128
02:37:48,650 --> 02:37:50,820
You remember when we talked about how,
uh,

4129
02:37:50,850 --> 02:37:55,850
the guy who started the atkins diet died
and he was 258 pounds and all that?

4130
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:57,233
Well,
apparently when he fell and hit his 

4131
02:37:59,071 --> 02:38:01,620
head,
he had,

4132
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:02,513
he had serious problems in the hospital 
and gained somewhere around 50 pounds 

4133
02:38:08,041 --> 02:38:10,830
while he was in the hospital.
Even more than 50 pounds.

4134
02:38:11,010 --> 02:38:11,843
I believe he has 195 pounds.
They're saying when he was checked into 

4135
02:38:14,041 --> 02:38:18,060
the hospital and his heart disease had 
nothing to do with his diet,

4136
02:38:18,061 --> 02:38:21,610
it was a viral illness that caused his 
heart to,

4137
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:22,633
to fail.

4138
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:25,620
And this was all related to organ 
failure.

4139
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:29,310
He had massive organ failure and a 
massive,

4140
02:38:29,311 --> 02:38:31,230
a water retention.
What,

4141
02:38:31,231 --> 02:38:34,470
because of his body was falling apart 
while he was in the hospital.

4142
02:38:34,950 --> 02:38:36,180
So what's,
what's the,

4143
02:38:36,181 --> 02:38:37,350
I mean,
most people think he died.

4144
02:38:37,351 --> 02:38:40,530
How well most people think he died 
falling and hitting his head,

4145
02:38:40,531 --> 02:38:41,364
which is true,
but the Vegan propaganda was that he 

4146
02:38:44,611 --> 02:38:48,030
actually died of a heart attack and that
he had,

4147
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:51,180
uh,
he had was 258 pounds when he died.

4148
02:38:51,181 --> 02:38:53,280
So his,
his diet didn't work.

4149
02:38:53,281 --> 02:38:54,750
And,
but they're saying that no one,

4150
02:38:54,751 --> 02:38:56,700
he was checked into the hospital after 
he hit his head.

4151
02:38:56,701 --> 02:38:58,560
He was only 195 pounds.
Okay.

4152
02:38:58,830 --> 02:39:02,280
So all of this weight gain that they're 
attributing to his diet,

4153
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:03,173
they're,
they're being disingenuous and 

4154
02:39:04,890 --> 02:39:05,723
untruthful.

4155
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:07,370
Yeah.
First thing you do when you check into a

4156
02:39:07,371 --> 02:39:10,040
hospital because you got to check 
yourself out as quickly as possible.

4157
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:11,313
Well,
this guy,

4158
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,110
you mean when you checked into the 
hospital,

4159
02:39:13,111 --> 02:39:13,944
he was fucked.
Apparently mean he fell and cracked his 

4160
02:39:15,721 --> 02:39:19,830
head open on the ice and you know,
he wasn't a good scene.

4161
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:21,720
And he was an older gentleman when it 
happened.

4162
02:39:21,721 --> 02:39:24,020
I believe he was in his seventies okay.
And,

4163
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:28,410
but he died.
He had massive organ failure and it was,

4164
02:39:29,130 --> 02:39:29,963
so somebody sent me something yesterday 
about it so that whatever is heart 

4165
02:39:33,331 --> 02:39:34,164
disease was,
it was not from like hardening of the 

4166
02:39:36,871 --> 02:39:38,790
arteries,
from cholesterol,

4167
02:39:38,791 --> 02:39:41,730
from eating all that food.
Yes.

4168
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:42,733
It's so hard to understand what's right 
and what's wrong too because people get 

4169
02:39:44,911 --> 02:39:47,730
so ideological about it,
especially vegans,

4170
02:39:48,110 --> 02:39:49,140
you know,
and you know,

4171
02:39:49,141 --> 02:39:49,974
and the,
and even some meat eaters get 

4172
02:39:50,820 --> 02:39:51,653
ideological about it and they just,
people aren't looking at the real 

4173
02:39:54,271 --> 02:39:56,370
relationship between food and health.

4174
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:58,170
Well,
we got a few people in my family who are

4175
02:39:59,850 --> 02:40:01,470
Vegan and yeah,
it's a,

4176
02:40:01,471 --> 02:40:02,730
it's a little religion,
right?

4177
02:40:02,731 --> 02:40:03,720
I mean,
they're wonderful people.

4178
02:40:03,721 --> 02:40:04,620
They're great people.
But,

4179
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:06,090
but I,
when it comes to this,

4180
02:40:06,091 --> 02:40:08,130
it's a little bit of a religious thing 
for them.

4181
02:40:08,190 --> 02:40:10,770
And I'm staff like ideological.
Yeah.

4182
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:11,873
They,
they want to think there's only one way 

4183
02:40:12,941 --> 02:40:14,160
and that's to be plant based.

4184
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,510
It cures all diseases.
It,

4185
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:16,171
right.
Fix it.

4186
02:40:16,171 --> 02:40:17,004
Well,
I know I've had people that have gone 

4187
02:40:17,641 --> 02:40:18,474
Vegan and they got sick and they had bad
blood work and Sam Harris is one of 

4188
02:40:22,231 --> 02:40:23,310
them.
He tried it for a little while.

4189
02:40:23,311 --> 02:40:25,680
I tried to for quite a while and he did 
it the right way and he just,

4190
02:40:25,740 --> 02:40:27,120
he got ill from it.
Yeah.

4191
02:40:27,121 --> 02:40:27,661
I,
you know,

4192
02:40:27,661 --> 02:40:30,360
I'm a big fan of moderation,
moderation and everything.

4193
02:40:30,390 --> 02:40:31,200
Right.
I mean just,

4194
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:31,491
yeah.
That,

4195
02:40:31,491 --> 02:40:32,324
that seems to be a reasonable attitude I
think in terms of when it comes to your 

4196
02:40:35,551 --> 02:40:36,270
diet.
Right.

4197
02:40:36,270 --> 02:40:37,950
And just,
or a,

4198
02:40:38,070 --> 02:40:38,903
yeah.
You know,

4199
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:42,390
it's,
I try not to overthink anything in,

4200
02:40:42,391 --> 02:40:43,720
uh,
in life and we,

4201
02:40:43,750 --> 02:40:45,360
we just,
you know,

4202
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:48,960
we're in that point in society where 
maybe because it is,

4203
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:49,823
things are easy and we have made it easy
because of technology and everything 

4204
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:56,150
else that we were able to just analyze 
everything to fucking fair.

4205
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:56,880
They will.
Right.

4206
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,550
So I'm just thinking maybe it's not that
complicated.

4207
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:00,331
You know,
just,

4208
02:41:00,331 --> 02:41:01,530
just,
you know,

4209
02:41:01,531 --> 02:41:03,420
you work out,
you burn more than you take in,

4210
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:04,980
you know,
you try to eat healthy,

4211
02:41:04,981 --> 02:41:06,270
you stick to the basics,
you know,

4212
02:41:06,271 --> 02:41:07,104
grains and fruits and vegetables and 
meeting granted a fucking terrible for 

4213
02:41:10,021 --> 02:41:10,500
you.
Really?

4214
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:11,310
See,
I didn't know that.

4215
02:41:11,310 --> 02:41:13,140
I always say grains.
Somebody told me grains.

4216
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:16,710
Grains are not good for you.
Most grains are bullshit.

4217
02:41:16,740 --> 02:41:18,540
You're just,
it's just carbohydrates.

4218
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,950
High nuts and seeds.
How about nuts?

4219
02:41:19,960 --> 02:41:21,720
Vegetables?
Not so great.

4220
02:41:21,870 --> 02:41:24,060
All right.
Seeds are great vegetables.

4221
02:41:24,330 --> 02:41:26,340
Almonds,
almonds are fantastic.

4222
02:41:26,341 --> 02:41:28,230
See I eat a ton of almonds.
Yeah,

4223
02:41:28,231 --> 02:41:30,510
look at that stuff.
I know I need calories to,

4224
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:31,741
yeah,
there you go.

4225
02:41:31,741 --> 02:41:34,390
They are good calories.
Healthy fats are,

4226
02:41:34,391 --> 02:41:35,930
we used to,
there were times when if you,

4227
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:36,793
if we're traveling or whatever and you 
were sitting in some safe out somewhere 

4228
02:41:39,390 --> 02:41:40,223
and uh,
it just waiting for something to happen 

4229
02:41:41,611 --> 02:41:43,860
or just happened to be holed up for 
whatever reason.

4230
02:41:44,490 --> 02:41:46,530
And there was like nothing in there.
Right.

4231
02:41:46,531 --> 02:41:47,364
I mean,
I remember times when I would eat 

4232
02:41:48,211 --> 02:41:50,640
oatmeal,
that was all I would eat.

4233
02:41:50,641 --> 02:41:51,474
Cause that's all it was available.
And you'd eat oatmeal for like three 

4234
02:41:53,161 --> 02:41:54,120
weeks in a row,
just,

4235
02:41:54,121 --> 02:41:54,954
you know,
because you were waiting to get on the 

4236
02:41:55,891 --> 02:41:58,500
road and move and you'd had an access to
other foods,

4237
02:41:58,750 --> 02:41:59,201
you know,
think of,

4238
02:41:59,201 --> 02:42:01,080
wow,
that's a lot of oatmeal or something.

4239
02:42:01,081 --> 02:42:02,100
Right.
And so I developed,

4240
02:42:02,101 --> 02:42:03,710
when I was younger,
I'd developed sort of this attitude.

4241
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:04,890
It's just fuel,
just,

4242
02:42:04,891 --> 02:42:06,540
you know,
keep moving forward so you've got to eat

4243
02:42:06,541 --> 02:42:07,374
something.
And so for a long time I didn't really 

4244
02:42:09,661 --> 02:42:11,760
put much stock in a,
it tastes great or it's,

4245
02:42:11,761 --> 02:42:12,301
you know,
it's,

4246
02:42:12,301 --> 02:42:14,650
it's really good.
It was just more,

4247
02:42:14,730 --> 02:42:15,563
you know,
got to consume something to keep moving 

4248
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:18,240
and,
you know,

4249
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:19,710
and so it's only,
it hasn't been,

4250
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:20,710
it's been recent one.

4251
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:22,590
I've really got to get focused on it.
You know,

4252
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:25,290
what do you have to do to you when 
you've got little kids?

4253
02:42:25,291 --> 02:42:26,640
You know what it's like,
you want to stick around,

4254
02:42:26,670 --> 02:42:27,940
right.
So,

4255
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:30,390
um,
I'm going to send you some podcasts.

4256
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:31,260
Yeah.
Do you cook?

4257
02:42:32,190 --> 02:42:33,023
I do.
I,

4258
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:34,340
oddly enough,
I like to cook now.

4259
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:36,630
I live well,
you know,

4260
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,903
most people would assume if I can't 
operate my watch that I can't turn the 

4261
02:42:41,131 --> 02:42:42,580
stove on.
Uh,

4262
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:43,780
but I can do that.
And,

4263
02:42:43,781 --> 02:42:45,840
and I find it actually a lot of fun.
You know,

4264
02:42:45,841 --> 02:42:47,310
it is,
and it's stress relieving.

4265
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:50,790
It's very satisfying to sit down to a 
meal that you prepared yourself,

4266
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:51,873
especially if you grow your own 
vegetables and pull them out of the 

4267
02:42:53,641 --> 02:42:54,570
garden,
which we do.

4268
02:42:54,571 --> 02:42:56,880
My wife has a great little vegetable 
garden and,

4269
02:42:56,881 --> 02:42:57,750
uh,
so we do that.

4270
02:42:57,751 --> 02:43:00,360
We have a few fruit trees and so that's 
nice.

4271
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:00,871
Yeah,
it's good.

4272
02:43:00,871 --> 02:43:01,704
It's good.
But it's,

4273
02:43:01,720 --> 02:43:03,450
the whole process is nice.
And I'm very,

4274
02:43:03,451 --> 02:43:04,590
uh,
I'm one of those people,

4275
02:43:04,770 --> 02:43:06,210
I think as two types of people,
you're cooking,

4276
02:43:06,211 --> 02:43:07,870
you've got a big mess all around you or 
your cooking,

4277
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:09,240
you clean up as you're cooking.
Right.

4278
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:11,610
And so we were casting,
I'm the one that guy,

4279
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:13,690
I like things to be the way they're 
supposed to be.

4280
02:43:13,691 --> 02:43:15,730
I like to clean up or while I'm doing 
things right.

4281
02:43:16,090 --> 02:43:16,781
So,
yeah.

4282
02:43:16,781 --> 02:43:18,070
So it's,
it's um,

4283
02:43:18,071 --> 02:43:19,150
that the rest,
uh,

4284
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:20,583
yeah,
my and my kid said actually the two 

4285
02:43:21,581 --> 02:43:23,020
older boys state they'd taken part in 
it.

4286
02:43:23,021 --> 02:43:24,280
Now they'd like to grill,
you know,

4287
02:43:24,281 --> 02:43:26,990
and what's grilling is grilling bad for 
you or good for grilling is good.

4288
02:43:27,050 --> 02:43:27,883
Okay.
I was afraid you were gonna tell me you 

4289
02:43:28,940 --> 02:43:30,560
shouldn't grill meat grilling.
Okay.

4290
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:31,630
Right.
Okay,

4291
02:43:31,810 --> 02:43:32,643
good.
Cause that's what we do basically with 

4292
02:43:34,950 --> 02:43:35,230
that.

4293
02:43:35,230 --> 02:43:38,350
We got a big hundred thousand btus 
outside and we just fire that up.

4294
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:40,180
Um,
but yeah,

4295
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:41,570
it's,
you know,

4296
02:43:42,070 --> 02:43:43,150
I,
there's nothing more,

4297
02:43:43,151 --> 02:43:46,420
so when you pull a fish out,
whether it's the ocean or the river,

4298
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:47,313
you know,
and then that's what you're eating at 

4299
02:43:48,251 --> 02:43:51,100
night.
It's the best it is.

4300
02:43:51,101 --> 02:43:54,160
Especially if you could do it that day 
at camp fire.

4301
02:43:54,190 --> 02:43:56,710
Like if you get it right by the,
bring a skillet,

4302
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:59,470
cook a trout right there on the beach.
Oh,

4303
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:01,750
trout for breakfast.
It's amazing of legs,

4304
02:44:01,751 --> 02:44:02,584
you know?
Yeah,

4305
02:44:03,050 --> 02:44:04,500
yeah,
yeah.

4306
02:44:04,510 --> 02:44:05,380
I know.
Well it's,

4307
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:06,740
but that,
there's something about it.

4308
02:44:08,110 --> 02:44:08,990
People always say,
Oh really?

4309
02:44:08,991 --> 02:44:10,870
You got to fish in the morning?
That sounds odd,

4310
02:44:11,050 --> 02:44:13,090
but you're up there early.
You know the sun's coming up.

4311
02:44:13,091 --> 02:44:17,350
You catch Califia Yankee out.
People still go with what you eat in the

4312
02:44:17,350 --> 02:44:18,183
morning.
Yeah.

4313
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:19,353
Just like what?
You should always have cereal in the 

4314
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:21,330
morning.

4315
02:44:21,330 --> 02:44:22,870
What does that mean?
Well,

4316
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:24,460
shit,
food.

4317
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:25,323
It's food.
You should have food whenever you want 

4318
02:44:26,201 --> 02:44:27,034
the food.
If you want to have a stake in the 

4319
02:44:28,260 --> 02:44:29,093
morning.
There's nothing wrong with that.

4320
02:44:29,560 --> 02:44:30,910
I remember when I was,
when I was a kid,

4321
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:31,773
that was,
I was back in the days when you know 

4322
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:35,420
boxed cereals,
you know that's what you ate.

4323
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:38,050
The sugar pops.
They didn't even make it.

4324
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:39,070
They didn't hide it.
Right.

4325
02:44:39,071 --> 02:44:41,870
It was like [inaudible] name,
sugar pops,

4326
02:44:41,871 --> 02:44:44,650
super super sugar crisp sugar smacks.
Yeah.

4327
02:44:44,651 --> 02:44:46,510
That the current time of air.
Yeah,

4328
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:48,940
that's fantastic.
And as a kid,

4329
02:44:48,941 --> 02:44:49,774
you could go go through an entire box in
one morning before you went out and 

4330
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:54,220
played baseball.
Listen to me,

4331
02:44:54,221 --> 02:44:57,590
I saw you wrote a cracked up on sugars,
one around the eyes,

4332
02:44:57,591 --> 02:45:01,390
bugging out your pupils.
Dilated Mike Baker.

4333
02:45:01,620 --> 02:45:02,740
He's a pledge or talk.
Hey man,

4334
02:45:02,741 --> 02:45:03,880
listen.
Thank you very much.

4335
02:45:04,390 --> 02:45:06,780
Just flew by.
Good Dad.

4336
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:09,880
That's why your phone's dead.
I'll see what boise man sounds good,

4337
02:45:09,881 --> 02:45:10,660
brother.
Thank you.

4338
02:45:10,660 --> 02:45:15,660
Thank you.
Thanks.

4339
02:45:15,941 --> 02:45:16,774
What happened.
