1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,170
This is what I want to say.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,750
I want to see Nick Diaz
versus Conor Mcgregor.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,710
That's what I want to say.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,810
I want to see that more than I
want to see anything in life.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,531
I wish I had,

7
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:14,760
so I want to say it more than I want to
see the Aurora borealis more than I want

8
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:19,230
to go to the Keck observatory in Hawaii
and revisit the Milky Way more than I

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,190
want to see any of those things.

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,720
I want to see Nick Diaz
versus Conor Mcgregor.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:25,980
Yeah,

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,030
Nick Diaz Kinda regretted how to cool
his little walk around and wearing as he

13
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:30,600
got in.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,433
It was awesome.

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,991
He was awesome.

16
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,600
He's a bad mother fucker.

17
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,930
Did with the way he walked around
it would he got in the ring?

18
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:39,660
I didn't think he was going to get punched
in the face as much as he did and we

19
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,470
still won,

20
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,580
but that was a cocky interest.

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:41,820
I was like,

22
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:41,941
oh,

23
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,960
he bought the first round,

24
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,100
knock out this mother fucker.

25
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,240
The way he just came in here.

26
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:45,901
Well,

27
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:46,260
I mean,

28
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,660
what he's trying to do is
just like shake it off,

29
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,800
put an air out there.

30
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,930
But at the end of the day
he's fighting Nate Diaz.

31
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,650
He's no one's getting know
first round knock out.

32
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:54,870
This is getting crazy war.

33
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,260
He knew it and that he had to
be conservative in that fight.

34
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,570
Energy was so crazy.

35
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,021
Oh my God.

36
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:01,830
It was insane.

37
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,461
It was so,

38
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:02,920
it was,

39
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,330
it was,

40
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,740
I was so nothing ever right.

41
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,670
It was so,

42
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,140
I'm so glad I went to see your lab.

43
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,120
Oh Man.

44
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,860
So he,

45
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,390
me too.

46
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,560
So I'm a as,

47
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,121
as I say,

48
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:16,121
I'm a casual fan so he's a couple of
times where a kind of knocked him to the

49
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,834
ground,

50
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,620
kind of doesn't want to do ground
game with him cause he was,

51
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,820
he was not into the ground.

52
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,151
Right.

53
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,360
He was,

54
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,660
he was,

55
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,051
he was,

56
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:29,520
he was telling me to come up where I
would think normally for my lack net that

57
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:29,851
much,

58
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:30,110
you know,

59
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:30,901
intimate knowledge,

60
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,760
I would think once you knock
somebody to the ground,

61
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,850
you try to go in with those hammer fists.

62
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,860
However,

63
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,160
if you do that with a guy like Nate Diaz,

64
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,520
he might not be hurt at all,

65
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,700
especially when you
consider the fact that,

66
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:44,430
uh,

67
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,960
he Connor through a bunch of like really
powerful left leg kicks and he had

68
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:52,770
fucked up Nate's right leg cause because
of the fact they're both south paw,

69
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,370
what happens is like that back
leg becomes the front leg,

70
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,570
the right leg is in front,

71
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:58,090
right?

72
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,280
And he just getting chewed up.

73
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,620
But this left power leg kicked
up right from the beginning,

74
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,050
like over and over and
over and over again.

75
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:04,900
When you,

76
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,520
when you get hit with a bunch of like
really powerful leg kicks like that,

77
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,860
it makes it super
difficult for you to move.

78
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,550
Right.

79
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,000
You know,

80
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,130
and then Conor just fought a smooth,

81
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,570
smart game plan.

82
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,501
You know,

83
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:16,861
he,

84
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:17,310
um,

85
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,801
he,

86
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,720
it engaged from the outside where he,

87
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:24,721
his speed was an advantage and did some
damage but didn't unload himself like he

88
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:26,910
did in the first fight.

89
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,631
In the first fight.

90
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:28,470
He did that too,

91
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,530
but any unloaded himself
and Nate survived.

92
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,371
And when he survived,

93
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,630
Connor's gas tank was empty.

94
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:33,880
Right.

95
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,940
So this time Connor was
way more conservative.

96
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,340
Let's see.

97
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,600
He would run away,

98
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,770
but he would run away.

99
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,110
No,

100
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,370
you could.

101
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,950
You could say it.

102
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,783
He would run away.

103
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,720
He ran away.

104
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
But when he was on a cane,

105
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,470
when get close to the KT over,

106
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:48,230
run it and make it more
into the center it,

107
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,421
man,

108
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,080
it's okay.

109
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,351
You don't,

110
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,580
people are mad that he ran away

111
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,040
because it sucks.

112
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,900
Sometimes you take a break,

113
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,130
sometimes you take a break.

114
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,550
He knows the three moments
in the round he's got,

115
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,540
he knows there's,

116
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,161
I mean,

117
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,360
I don't know when it was.

118
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:01,721
There was,

119
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,750
there was a couple moments in time
where he totally turned away from him,

120
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,030
but then he engaged.

121
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,691
Yeah,

122
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,001
he did.

123
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,430
It wasn't like he was running the whole,

124
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,323
he was just,

125
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,450
when he found himself in
a compromising position,

126
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,080
he would,

127
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
he would get out of it.

128
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,270
It's interesting.

129
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,330
It's an interesting thing to do
it guys trying to kick your ass.

130
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,590
Like I'm going to go
over here for a minute.

131
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,693
Yeah.

132
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,830
It's something funny about it.

133
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,281
You know,

134
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,600
seemed like a good move.

135
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,070
It's the right move.

136
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,811
When you,

137
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:29,620
when you don't feel like
you can fight right now,

138
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,640
what do you want to do?

139
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,990
Stand in New Logo,

140
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,020
moon and don't get on the gin.

141
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,893
Bush,

142
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,261
John,

143
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,094
mom,

144
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,543
Jenny.

145
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,210
If you don't feel like you can breathe,

146
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,100
maybe you should move away and breathe.

147
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,091
Otherwise,

148
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,370
some dude could punch you in
the body and you can go down.

149
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,210
It's like it's not a smart move to
stand in there if you feel tired.

150
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:57,830
Yeah.
