1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,670
Hello

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,840
Freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,280
I'm minding my business.

4
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:05,360
I ain't bothering nobody.

5
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm watching the baby.

6
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:08,120
It's 4:30 that day about this.

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,750
No,

8
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,770
I heard a knock on the door.

9
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,090
Never opened my door.

10
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,980
You getting knocked on my door.

11
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:13,340
You want.

12
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,091
If you don't follow me,

13
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:14,924
I don't know.

14
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,240
I just sit there and watch TV.

15
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,460
I'm one of those motherfuckers.

16
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,533
Unless you call me

17
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,653
coming over.

18
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,040
I don't open the door for anybody.

19
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,650
You can and that's.

20
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,870
I've been doing that for 30 years,

21
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,231
right?

22
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,064
Or nothing,

23
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,041
but the baby.

24
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:27,700
It was like Daddy,

25
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,340
somebody.

26
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,070
Oh my God.

27
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,903
Damn it.

28
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,011
I opened the door.

29
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,000
Three women at my door,

30
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,050
two of them are cockeyed.

31
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,071
I swear to God.

32
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm not even gonna be funny there from
the Cert Church of Latter Day saints.

33
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,661
Okay,

34
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,201
how you doing?

35
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:40,381
I go,

36
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:40,681
listen,

37
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:41,580
I'm not into this stuff,

38
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,510
but my wife is.

39
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,800
My wife is ended up more as I just
said that so I could get off the hook.

40
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,850
I'm feeling the baby.

41
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,120
If you want to come back in 30 minutes
ago because I'm really thirsty.

42
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:53,370
Can I get a glass of
water or a water bottle?

43
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,090
You don't want man,

44
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,290
that's how they get you in.

45
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,671
That's a tactic.

46
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:00,960
I close the fucking door,

47
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:01,940
man.

48
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,701
I don't give a fuck.

49
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,534
Hold on one second.

50
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,373
I close the door.

51
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,600
My wife is from Tennessee.

52
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,110
She saves those fucking bottles and fills
up with water and takes them through

53
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,441
yoga.

54
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,274
I throw them away.

55
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,731
What are we?

56
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,331
White trash.

57
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:13,200
I throw these things away.

58
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:13,831
Once that done,

59
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,664
that done,

60
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,580
my wife says him and puts them in
the freezer for headaches and shit,

61
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,340
so I wanted to get one of
those and there was no bottles,

62
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,440
so I give her a glass of water.

63
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,670
She takes off.

64
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,170
Now I'm running against the clock.

65
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,090
These three little more than
bitches are going to come back.

66
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:29,950
My wife walks in and let
me go outside and get an,

67
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,140
you know they stole my pipe.

68
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,180
When they asked me to get the water,

69
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,910
they stole my pot pipe from the balcony.

70
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,120
Nobody else was on that balcony.

71
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,940
The water got comes on that
balcony and he sees the pipe.

72
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,290
I don't leave without that.

73
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,011
I'm not that stupid.

74
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,430
I just lead the pipe cleaner.

75
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,763
The pipe,

76
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,821
the fucking.

77
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,770
My wife was there and one came,

78
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,210
the lady who takes care of mercy,

79
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,590
they didn't steal a fucking.

80
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,360
The Mormons stole my pipe.

81
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,441
Let me tell you something.

82
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:55,680
I got in that car and hunted those three
little cock eyed bitches down all over.

83
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,431
I couldn't find them.

84
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,270
They never came back.

85
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,220
They stole my pot pipe.

86
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,360
Do you think they stole it because they
were just stealing things or do you

87
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,320
think they stole it because they didn't
want you to be engaging in such horrible

88
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,154
behavior?

89
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,830
Smoking marijuana when you're
taking care of your child.

90
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,480
I wasn't smoking when I was
taking care of the child.

91
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,710
I just always leave it out there.

92
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,340
It's always.

93
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,870
That's how I mean.

94
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,080
I mean like you have one,

95
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:16,914
you have a child,

96
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,390
but he's still smoking marijuana.

97
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,290
Like how dare you?

98
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,750
What are you doing with a pot pipe out.

99
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:21,990
We need to take this from him.

100
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,191
Maybe they took it,

101
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,400
but if they smoked and cocked,

102
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,460
know that two bitches ain't shit that
had holes in her feet and the shoes on

103
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,540
what religion.

104
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,610
Since people are knocking on doors,

105
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:37,430
I'm memorial day that's guaranteed.

106
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,030
Slammed the door to the face.

107
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,280
Then you have another one that you kept.

108
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,910
He kept coming back.

109
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,100
Yeah,

110
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,110
I had a job or witness.

111
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,944
I was stringing him out.

112
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,320
Made a bad time to come back in an
hour and see him lurking in front of my

113
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:50,621
house.

114
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:51,880
I couldn't even go home.

115
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,810
I couldn't even go behind him and
strung out for like four months though.

116
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,970
Every time he'd come over,

117
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,250
you know what I really
want to talk to you.

118
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,130
Give me those pamphlets.

119
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,760
I called the number you would think
maybe starting from your basic know your

120
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,020
zero set point of just,

121
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:05,201
you know,

122
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,420
now we're going to reboot civilization.

123
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,663
Um,

124
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,180
you would think that if you
had this kind of process,

125
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,910
each candidate would be more
impressive than the next man.

126
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,560
You'd be like,

127
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,180
I can't believe each.

128
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,830
Each person who came to the podium,

129
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,343
like,

130
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,383
yeah,

131
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,921
it'd be like,

132
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,240
it'd be like the dunk contest,

133
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:25,450
you know,

134
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:25,931
for the NBA.

135
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,260
I'd be like,

136
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,093
oh my God,

137
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,110
I could just.

138
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,940
When you thought you saw
the best dunk in your life,

139
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,181
you know,

140
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,230
the next guy comes along.

141
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,270
And it would be that.

142
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,130
It would be that on every topic,

143
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,750
right?

144
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,240
It'd be like you'd be talking about
the science of climate change.

145
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:44,400
You'd be talking about the actual
dynamics of the war on terror,

146
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,540
so topics that seem to have no
relationship where you would have to be.

147
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,600
You'd be amazed that anyone could
be an expert in all of them.

148
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,520
You would find someone who is an expert,

149
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,440
a functional expert in all of them.

150
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,250
Pretty winter,

151
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,640
dude.

152
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:57,851
Yeah.

153
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,150
Yeah.

154
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,460
But,

155
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,810
and,

156
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,900
but someone who is also ethically
wise who does wasn't just,

157
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,490
wasn't obviously an asshole.

158
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,883
Um,

159
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,600
and who,

160
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,660
who,

161
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:08,980
who,

162
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,813
who had a,

163
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,330
a mature relationship to
change in his or her mind.

164
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,481
Right?

165
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,120
So like this whole bit
about flip flopping and,

166
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,260
and not,

167
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,093
um,

168
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,550
you know,

169
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,010
being someone who could honestly
represent changes of mind in,

170
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,710
in,

171
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,450
across a political career.

172
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,970
Right?

173
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,030
You know,

174
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,791
it's nowhere written.

175
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,400
That is a good thing to believe today,

176
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,720
what you believe 20 years ago.

177
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,141
In fact,

178
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,400
if you do that on every topic,

179
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,920
it means basically you haven't
been in dialogue with the world.

180
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:39,970
Um,

181
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,440
but there's something,

182
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,970
it's so taboo to change your mind that
either you have to lie about it or you

183
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:46,920
have to pretend it was a,

184
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,340
it was always that way,

185
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,720
or um,

186
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,941
it's just a,

187
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:51,710
a,

188
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,310
I'm an assistant,

189
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,450
yet the system is,

190
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,920
is broken in that respect,

191
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,420
but given the choices,

192
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,111
you know,

193
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:03,190
and when you have a choice between
someone who is for all her flaws,

194
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,570
been in the game for long enough to
be really well informed and capable of

195
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,710
compromise and capable of,

196
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,461
uh,

197
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,540
not just,

198
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,030
uh,

199
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,863
just

200
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,833
breaking

201
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,050
the entire machine and you
have someone who's just,

202
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,080
he could just kinda stepped off the set
of his reality TV show and then a lied

203
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,470
about everything and,

204
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,660
uh,

205
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,660
and elbowed his way onto your
television set and never left because,

206
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,580
you know,

207
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,920
CNN couldn't figure out how to
give the mic to someone else.

208
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,203
Um,

209
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,440
it's a,

210
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,370
it's amazing.

211
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:42,761
Well,

212
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:47,170
he's a product of attention because they
realized that there's a heated race,

213
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,621
right?

214
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:48,321
The heated race.

215
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,920
This guy was really famous
and in a heated race,

216
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,860
this guy would say some crazy stuff
and so they would tune into um,

217
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,270
so everybody had to do an intro.

218
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,100
So because of him saying crazy stuff,

219
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,510
he accelerated the amount
they were talking about them.

220
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,930
So they're constantly talking about him
and barely talking about other people

221
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,793
and,

222
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,090
but he's created a worm hole
in our political process
now where there's nothing

223
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:12,020
so crazy that could disqualify him
among the people who like him to.

224
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:17,021
So he can just keep it just like nuclear
bombs of craziness that the press can't

225
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,080
ignore that the,

226
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,080
every time they think,

227
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,471
okay,

228
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,500
this is the crazy thing he said
that's going to harm his candidacy,

229
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,760
so let's shine a light on it.

230
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,043
It just helps him,

231
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,071
you know,

232
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,610
he could just,

233
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,330
he could,

234
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:29,660
he could.

235
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,860
He didn't get on twitter
right now and say,

236
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:31,880
you know who I'd like to fuck.

237
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:32,900
I'd like to Nicki Minaj

238
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,103
and,

239
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
and it would work for him.

240
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,701
It would work for them.

241
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:43,420
You would see a use a tweet storm
of a billion people who say,

242
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,640
I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get her

243
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,440
and it's insanity.

244
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,430
That's where we are.

245
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,330
Did you ever do a program thing?

246
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,780
Did you go to an alcoholics
anonymous meeting or just stop now?

247
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:00,170
I had a son so I had,

248
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,760
there were a couple of times I was like,

249
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,060
alright,

250
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,510
I need to,

251
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,850
I need to quit and quit
and that never works.

252
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,860
And then there was one night where,

253
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,723
so it's,

254
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,170
it's the first real time on the road.

255
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:13,790
I was terrible with women in high school
and college and then suddenly I hit the

256
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,240
road as a comic and they're everywhere
and they're interested and life is

257
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,074
different.

258
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,490
And so there was a show.

259
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:23,870
I was doing a show first already and
usually the sororities that sponsor comedy

260
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:27,320
shows or like the philanthropy
sorority and they're all terrible.

261
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,100
Uh,

262
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,550
no,

263
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,780
these girls were all hot.

264
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,670
Just just dimes.

265
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,950
The whole chapter just full.

266
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,510
They had like one ugly
friend is as the charity,

267
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,730
but they had just gorgeous girls and my
opener goes up and bombs and then I go

268
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:45,200
up to a standing room only crowd and
crush and so now it's afterward we're

269
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:45,710
hanging out.

270
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,730
There's like this after party thing that
they put together for just them and the

271
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,271
two of us,

272
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,930
one of which they hated
because he bombed and the like,

273
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,640
there are just these eight
hot girls surrounding me.

274
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,421
One shoulder,

275
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,920
another one out of the
way to sit next to me.

276
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,250
I was like,

277
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,050
this is,

278
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,340
this is like nothing
I've ever experienced.

279
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,560
And then they took us to another party
and I'm pretty sure someone put something

280
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,041
in my drink.

281
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,910
Not In the way of like I want to
fuck this guy in the way of like,

282
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,500
this is a guy getting all the
attention away from the other guys.

283
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,960
And I think one of the other
guys fucked with my drink.

284
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,771
Real.

285
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:16,310
Yeah.

286
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,890
Because I got super
violently ill very quickly,

287
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,791
like very,

288
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,230
very quickly and I spent the whole night
I was supposed to stay at the sorority

289
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,010
house.

290
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,460
Like I,

291
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,040
the plan was I was going to stay in the
guest room so I didn't even have to do

292
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,910
the whole excuse of like,

293
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,091
Hey,

294
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,260
can I use your bathroom?

295
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,230
Can I come in for like,

296
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,760
I just,

297
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,420
I was supposed to go back there with
them and I spent the entire night just,

298
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,680
just vomiting.

299
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,610
It was terrible.

300
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,510
Wow.

301
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,470
Somebody spiked your drink and then I
lost a Gig the next day and at the time

302
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,490
it's my first year on the road.

303
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,820
I lost a $1,500 gig the next
day because you were so sick.

304
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,661
I couldn't do it.

305
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,494
I was,

306
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,281
we were driving,

307
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,180
it was the middle of winter,

308
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,010
but I was wearing two pairs of pants,

309
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,010
two sweatshirts and in a sleeping bag in
the car with the heat on full blast and

310
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,950
I was shivering the whole way.

311
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,880
Like I was fucked up

312
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,600
so that you didn't have
the flu or something.

313
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,660
That sounds like the flu.

314
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,900
It went away like six hours later.

315
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,580
So it could've been,

316
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,470
it could've been a very temporary.

317
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,330
Flew a well timed flu.

318
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:09,721
I don't know,

319
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,460
but that was the night
where I was just like,

320
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,660
I can't keep doing this.

321
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,400
Have you ever heard of
a drug that does that?

322
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:14,970
Like a drug.
