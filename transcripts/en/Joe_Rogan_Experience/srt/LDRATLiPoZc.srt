00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,300
Hello Freak bitches were,

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,140
I don't know if you've
heard of these guys.

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,980
Astrophysicist John mattise and Daniel
Whitmore from the University of Louisiana

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,790
came up with a theory that said that
something smaller than a Jovian mass would

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,740
not be strong enough to perform this task.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,660
They believe that there's
something up to 25% of them.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,650
Okay?

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,650
It's four times as big as Jupiter could
be responsible for sending these objects

9
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,094
and art direction.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,190
This is just a random theory
that these guys put together.

11
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:30,870
It wasn't completely
accepted what they're doing.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,501
No,

13
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:31,651
no,

14
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:31,770
no.

15
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,340
There's no,

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,370
there's no known such object what you,

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,370
what people are doing,

18
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:36,390
and I don't fault them for it.

19
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:37,224
It's creative.

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,730
It would make awesome science fiction.

21
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,990
Storytelling is,

22
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,270
there's something you need
to explain here on earth.

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,920
Somebody went extinct.

24
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,540
There were some wave of comets.

25
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,500
There's some observation
that was never repeated.

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,410
There's some thing you got to
come up with and so you say,

27
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:52,531
well,

28
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,240
we know the Oort cloud exists.

29
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,530
We know you can perturb those orbits and,

30
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:01,950
and send them careening down towards
the inner solar system and those,

31
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,560
that Jupiter doesn't bat
away like batting practice,

32
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,630
those that get through Jupiter's
gravitational shield could wreak havoc on

33
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,200
earth.

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,033
Yeah.

35
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,281
Yeah.

36
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:11,910
But that's,

37
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,570
it's,

38
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,050
it's,

39
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,350
it's,

40
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,860
it's inventing a lot to explain
something you don't know.

41
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,230
And so it's inventing more
of what you don't know.

42
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,190
That could be true to
explain what you don't

43
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,270
that which you don't have any
other evidence to support.

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,740
So it's fun,

45
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,574
speculation,

46
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,413
fun speculation.

47
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,830
Exactly.

48
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,860
Beyond that to say,

49
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,011
oh,

50
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:32,551
it's real,

51
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,331
it must be happening.

52
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:33,780
No,

53
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,081
no.

54
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:37,050
It's just let someone write
a good Scifi story on it.

55
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,360
Here's what's fun about it
and this is why I bring it up.

56
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,840
Um,

57
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
most people I've talked to this
about this subject to many,

58
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:44,940
many people and,

59
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:45,061
uh,

60
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:45,301
I,

61
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,200
myself personally,

62
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,011
I'm not immune to this.

63
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,180
I find it very fascinating.

64
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,781
However,

65
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,580
how much have I looked into the actual
planets that we absolutely know are real?

66
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,803
Not that much,

67
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,960
but I'm worried about this fucking
fake planet that may or may not exist.

68
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,640
Do they might've found another planet.

69
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,790
It's this idea of something
hidden and mysterious,

70
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,040
which is so compelling and attractive.

71
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,510
Eczema,

72
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,800
fascinating psychological observation.

73
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,700
It's a weird thing.

74
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,730
We want to believe there's something
mysterious that we don't understand and

75
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,271
could be there,

76
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,480
but we don't know anything about yet
where there's plenty of things we do know

77
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,320
something about,

78
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,490
but we want to know more.

79
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,353
Why don't you help?

80
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:21,870
Yes.

81
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,320
All right.

82
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,760
And by the way,

83
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,790
the universe is far more wondrous
than anything we can imagine.

84
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,140
And so,

85
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,630
so to say,

86
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,630
I need your creativity and you know,

87
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,560
uh,

88
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:37,870
to,

89
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,330
to keep your life interesting.

90
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,661
No,

91
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,661
we got black holes that are
flaying stars layer by layer.

92
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,480
We've got,

93
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,640
do you realize that if you
fall into a black hole,

94
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,180
you will see the entire future of the
universe unfold in front of you in a

95
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,080
matter of moments.

96
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,580
And you will emerge into another space
time created by the singularity of the

97
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,140
black hole you just fell into.

98
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,230
Just broke the internet,

99
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,533
broke the Hogan.

100
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,640
So,

101
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,540
so let's talk about that.

102
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,590
All right.

103
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:05,711
Yeah.

104
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:05,951
You know,

105
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,860
why are we wasting time talking
about whether the Saturn five rocket,

106
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,580
I mean,

107
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,890
cause we're fascinating to
buy shit that's unproven,

108
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,150
mysterious shit.

109
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,601
Look,

110
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,590
I got a broken brain.

111
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:14,831
Okay.

112
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:15,910
There's a reason for me.

113
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:25,900
Yeah.
