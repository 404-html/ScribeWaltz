1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Don't right.
Yeah,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,790
and we're alive.
You got to put dive,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,100
put that thing down.
I want you to focus.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,440
I want you to fuck cause I gotta get
into your head band.

5
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,500
I got to find out what you're about.
Your instagrams just at Joe Rogan,

6
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:14,334
right?
Yes.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,540
Okay.
Did you post it

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,233
posted?

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,180
Go,
go.

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,560
Okay.
Turn that oversee.

11
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:25,280
Can't look at it as the key sign that I
wouldn't think that a guy like you'll be

12
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,600
easily distracted.
You can't be.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,690
I'm like,
I'm just like on different things.

14
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:33,200
If I get on something I'm on it and then
it's like something else and my brain is

15
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,330
doing so many different things that at
one time,

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,130
how did you get to be the guy that makes
people shit their pants when they watch

17
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:42,170
your videos?
Because if you haven't seen any of his

18
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,220
videos,
stop,

19
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:47,570
pause podcasts for perspective.
Go look up James Kingston.

20
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:50,090
What is your youtube?
I just put James Kingston,

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,720
James Kingston will pop up and all forms
of social media,

22
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,860
right?
You got Instagram,

23
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:59,570
all that jazz,
and there's just ridiculous photos and

24
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:03,830
videos of you doing shit that people
watch with their friends and everybody

25
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,800
goes,
John Chase of Christ and they cringe.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,720
And your asshole puckers out like this
one.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,600
Where are you out here?
Uh,

28
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,140
climbing in the Ukraine with Mustang
wanted.

29
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,300
Is that the guy's name yet?
So as you,

30
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,680
you hooked up with the Russians,
you out rushing to Russians?

31
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,930
Yeah,
I didn't,

32
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,330
I wouldn't say out rushing to them,
but,

33
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,620
but that's what they do,
right?

34
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,540
That's the whole thing.
And he said,

35
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,460
I think only Russians can out Russian
Russians.

36
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,010
So he's climbing.
First of all,

37
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:34,250
how hard is it to get to this tower?
We're looking at this video and I am

38
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,920
fucking freaking out.
How high are you up here?

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,220
This one,
I think it was like just over 200

40
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,054
meters.

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,180
This is my staying.
Oh my God.

42
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:48,380
He's hanging by one hand.
This one is the second tallest building

43
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,214
in new crane.
Right?

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,530
Oh my God.
How do you go in the bottom and it's

45
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:55,250
like a shopping center.
And then they took me like through all

46
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:58,220
these little doors and then we took a
lift down into like the basement and

47
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,180
then we walked through the basement and
fight another lift.

48
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,030
And Oh my God,
he's standing on the edge here.

49
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:03,830
Who standing yet?
You must thing again.

50
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,390
Oh my keys out of his fucking mind.
Holy Fuck.

51
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,520
This video is hard to watch,
man.

52
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,350
So in these mosques and what your hair,
what,

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,530
what led you to this and how long have
you been doing this?

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,740
So I've done Porco for nine years.
You know what Parkour is?

55
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,820
Sure.
Jumping around,

56
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,730
all that fun stuff.
That classes for little kids now they

57
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:26,780
do.
Kids have pretty cool.

58
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,670
Yeah.
Break their arms at about four years

59
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:31,850
ago,
I got to a point where I was like

60
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,340
satisfied with what I was able to do.
Right.

61
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,500
But I was still like super scared of
heights,

62
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,693
so I was like,
okay,

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,190
I know that if I want to get over this
fear of fights,

64
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,720
I need to do it face my fear.
So is this your stuff?

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,170
Yeah.
So this is you running on trees and

66
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:53,171
stuff and the whole idea behind
[inaudible] is to use the world around

67
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:57,920
you.
Steps and fences and all kinds of crazy

68
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,980
shit and uh,
you know,

69
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,700
you're essentially performing acrobatics
with all this stuff.

70
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,870
Yeah,
just jumping around.

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,270
Yeah.
I think the now how do you do this and

72
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,150
not get hurt?
He's just practice a lot.

73
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,730
Like the whole idea isn't to go out and
just do crazy stuff and,

74
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:14,690
and risk your life.

75
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,700
You start slow,
you start with small jumps and then you

76
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,320
progress steadily and sensibly.
And then eventually you'll get to a

77
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,770
point where you can do things that make
most people feel a bit sick.

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,690
Well,
what did you start doing?

79
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,700
Did you take gymnastics and snowed or
something?

80
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,520
I was like a little fat kid when I was
younger.

81
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,230
Not Super Fat,
but unhealthy.

82
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,850
Just played computer games.
That was it.

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,750
How were you able to jump so far too?
That's another thing that freaks me out.

84
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,820
There's growing legs.
You know what?

85
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,090
I'm six foot three.
I can jump.

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,640
I know,
but there's a lot of people that are six

87
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,590
foot three.
They can't jump from one building to a

88
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,720
next.
Like I've seen some of the ridiculous

89
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,350
ones where you jump from the top of a
building to another building,

90
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,740
like on a very small ledge that you
landing on.

91
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,390
Yeah.
This practice,

92
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,580
you start with like the fuck do you
practice that?

93
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,740
You stopped with the jumping.
That's like four foot wide.

94
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,060
Right.
And then as you get,

95
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,030
but you do that hundreds and hundreds of
times until that becomes like nothing.

96
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,670
Right.
And then you'll realize that you can now

97
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:11,560
jump five feet and then blah blah blah
blah blah.

98
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:14,050
And I,
my peaks like 1111 and a half foot

99
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,290
standing jump and a half foot.
Yeah.

100
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,750
Wow.
Duty should be in the Olympics.

101
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,790
They are on another level.
How far can like a long jumper jump?

102
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,970
Eight feet,
20 feet,

103
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,600
something like that.
I think the record's probably 2122 with

104
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:35,601
the whole shit,
but still 11 feet in between buildings.

105
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,870
Now when you're jumping in one buildings
taller,

106
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,190
another building smaller,
it gives you more time to,

107
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,520
to travel,
right?

108
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,980
Yeah.
So like,

109
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,740
like when you're jumping,
I saw this one video of you were on,

110
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,860
you were on the ledge and you leapt
across from one building to another and

111
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm like,
this has gotta be Photoshop.

112
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,080
This can't even be real.
The one that you post are,

113
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,570
That one's in Cambridge.
That one's actually a small jump because

115
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,340
it's quite big height difference.
Massive impact because of the height.

116
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,320
Yeah.
And you've got alleged that's maybe like

117
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:09,490
a foot deep to land on and then there's
a scaffolding pole right in front of it,

118
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,680
dude,
that you kind of slam into.

119
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,750
You can see it in the video.
I slam into that pole,

120
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,980
Jesus.
But that,

121
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,500
that's all part of taking the impact to
you use your arms as well.

122
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,290
Yeah.
But that's,

123
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,250
it doesn't seem like something could
practice a lot.

124
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,500
Right.
Slamming into something that hard.

125
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,920
Those ones you can't practice a lot,
but no.

126
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,610
Yeah,
you figure it out.

127
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,210
You figure out how to take impact and
yeah.

128
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,880
So you started doing this about four
years ago,

129
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,110
right?
You started doing the height stuff,

130
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,900
started doing the climbing kind of scary
stuff.

131
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,140
And when did you start releasing videos
right away?

132
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,400
Um,
no I don't really,

133
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,150
I mean I'd,
I'd released one though.

134
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:49,420
This one.
Oh this one makes me shit my pants.

135
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,000
This is it.
That seems so far.

136
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,390
That seems so far.
How far it's not that fun.

137
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,800
Like you could jump to the lower bit
there quite easily.

138
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,420
That's what other people have done
right.

139
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,760
Into a pole arc.

140
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,030
Yeah.
That is bananas,

141
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:03,890
Dude.
Yeah.

142
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,720
So how many,
how,

143
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,900
how much is the distance between those
two buildings?

144
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,950
Between those?
Probably like 10 foot,

145
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,240
12 foot maybe.
It does not seem like it,

146
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,230
but didn't do it.
Cause it's because there's a big drop as

147
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:20,340
well.
It's more about judging it correctly and

148
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,380
not jumping too far and not jumping too
little.

149
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,420
Right?
Yeah,

150
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,410
I see it like 12 foot,
I think.

151
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,500
Run that one more time Jeremy.
I just want to see this one more time

152
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,510
cause this freaks me out every time I
see it.

153
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,670
Every time I see it I'm like,
he's gonna die for sure.

154
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:36,540
There's no way you can make it.
So you kind of like lean forward and

155
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:40,080
then swing your arms and then push off
of it.

156
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:41,520
So you're,
you're like a standard.

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,150
Yeah.
Jump cause you're already committing to

158
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,380
the jump as you like.

159
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah.
You could see it in your momentum like

160
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:52,470
your head,
cause you have a Gopro on his above.

161
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,820
It's past the center line of like that,
that beam that you're standing on and

162
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,260
you're going out there,
what's it called?

163
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,030
And that's it.
Oh that's the idea.

164
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,440
Like you train,
you train enough so that when you're

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,930
stood on the edge looking at something
like you have no doubt,

166
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:10,410
you can't afford to have any doubt.
If I doubted myself there and I commit

167
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,600
to it and Eileen and then I back out,
I'm dead.

168
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,750
I had him go crazy dream last night man.
That I'm just remembering.

169
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,880
Yeah.
I had a crazy dream that I was climbing

170
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,380
with Alex honnold.
Yeah,

171
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,190
no Alex.
Alex has been on the podcast before and

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,440
uh,
every now and then I'll think about how

173
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,990
crazy he is about how crazy what he does
is,

174
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,680
but how like mellow and she is about it,
you know,

175
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,600
like,
you know when he's describing climbing,

176
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,340
he's like,
it's really actually kind of mellow.

177
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,700
It's like if anything is like,
if you're really scared,

178
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,650
so he's gone horribly wrong and it's
really,

179
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:42,210
really bad.
It's exactly the same.

180
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,920
Yeah.
People think I'm like,

181
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,960
hello and Adrenalin jumping.
Yeah.

182
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,210
Yeah.
It says he fell,

183
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:51,240
but unless you just fine.
She pulls it out right there then.

184
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,560
There it is,
dude.

185
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:55,440
Fuck all that.
Is this Alex?

186
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,970
That's not hidden.
Don't think so.

187
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,140
No.
It looks like,

188
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,300
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

189
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm not into that.
Crazy.

190
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,650
That's too much trust in the backpack.
Everything I do is like interesting

191
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,723
that,
yeah,

192
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,450
not into that.
My friend Andy,

193
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,790
Andy Stump,
he does that wingsuit shit.

194
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,190
He's got with a world record and
wingsuit flying.

195
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,470
Yeah.
He's out of his fucking mind.

196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,920
He just loves to do that.
He gets to the top cliffs of the world

197
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:23,670
and just throws his fucking body Hoff.
And it has like a squirrel suit,

198
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,420
like the close proximity stuff where
like we watched one the other day where

199
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,120
a guy slammed into a bridge.
Yeah.

200
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,160
He missed in it.
Yeah.

201
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
I've seen that.
Yeah.

202
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,530
The sound as Rod.
I don't know why.

203
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,230
Rough and expect it to be so loud.

204
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,750
Yeah.

205
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,120
The meat and those people on the bridge.
Oh yeah.

206
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,770
And his family were there.
Oh yeah.

207
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,510
That's not good.
That's not good.

208
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,400
Yeah.
Um,

209
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,840
do you worry about that when you're
doing these crazy jumps?

210
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,950
I don't know.
So I mean it's,

211
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,800
it's in my mind like if I make a
mistake,

212
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,740
that's it,
but I don't make mistakes.

213
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,640
That's,
that's what you got to be confident and

214
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,460
you've got to have confidence in what
you're doing.

215
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,690
Otherwise.
Like if you're,

216
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,730
if you're up there and you're scared,
right.

217
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,680
The chances of failing are so much
higher,

218
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,700
I think.
Yeah.

219
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,050
I think with anything,
I mean,

220
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,880
you have to be in the moment,
right.

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
Well prepared in the moment.
Yeah.

222
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,250
Um,
how much of what you're doing or is it

223
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:18,780
really you taking a chance and how much
of it is just you having a better

224
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:22,050
understanding of what your body is
capable of and the average person than

225
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,920
most people I should say,
not taking chances.

226
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,700
Maybe like 10%.
Wow.

227
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,300
That's interesting.
And that's,

228
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:33,301
that's only on me taking shots and
trusting structures.

229
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,710
Like maybe jumping to something that I,
I'm not able to check first.

230
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,150
Right.
But it doesn't happen often.

231
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,030
Every time I do it I'm like probably
shouldn't have done that.

232
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,040
It's really interesting.
Also the,

233
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,050
that you picking this up four years ago
is sort of like we are social media.

234
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,900
It's around the time where social media
really started to take off.

235
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,640
Yeah.
Maybe a couple of years before that it

236
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,010
did,
but like youtube videos of people doing

237
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:59,310
crazy shit really between like six and
seven years ago.

238
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:00,420
That's when it really,
is that right?

239
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,610
Am I saying that right?
Yeah.

240
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,140
Yeah.
Like 2000 tennis is a really started to

241
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:04,974
take off.
Yeah.

242
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,580
So you kind of caught,
you caught that wave and I didn't,

243
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,390
you know,
I didn't really get anywhere any kind of

244
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,970
good,
decent like following on youtube until

245
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,590
three,
four years ago.

246
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,550
That was it.
I released my first like crane climb

247
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,420
video that that blew up and went super
viral and that was,

248
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,560
that kicked everything off.
And then because of that video and now

249
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:31,050
the a TV show in the,
in the UK on channel full and then that

250
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,290
was everything just took off then.
Wow.

251
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,650
Now these Russian cats that you were
hanging out with in the Ukraine and we

252
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,920
climbed up on that tower,
there's a lot of those guys.

253
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,560
Like you seen a lot of videos?
Yeah.

254
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,650
Like what is it about Russians and
climbing on the,

255
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,100
what is it about these crazy kids and
why they're so nutty?

256
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,280
I don't know.
That's something I've been trying to

257
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:55,030
figure out.
Like I've,

258
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,850
I've only been to Ukraine,
I haven't been to Russia,

259
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,780
but there's not much,
like there's not much going on there,

260
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:03,750
you know,
there's not much to live for in Russia

261
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:04,584
or Ukraine.

262
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,480
I don't want to sound mean,
but I know what you're saying.

263
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,343
Yeah.
Yeah.

264
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,580
And that's so much cut.
Uh,

265
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,320
they're just familiar with death and
violence and stuff like that.

266
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,780
Like Mustang,
he goes out,

267
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,040
I don't know,
every week.

268
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,580
And it goes like organized fights,
just like street fights and just beats

269
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,120
the hell out of brandon people.
But that to me is like,

270
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,940
so he does those English boy,
those organized treat fights where they

271
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,230
like five guys take on five guys,
big groups.

272
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,400
I've seen those.
Yeah,

273
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,540
he's,
he does that.

274
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,010
And I was like,
what?

275
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,410
So he just does everything crazy.
Yeah.

276
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,840
Wow.
Yeah.

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,620
Whoa.
And he just,

278
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,510
does it offer the thrill?
Yeah,

279
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,250
I think so.
Damn.

280
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,840
What a weird way to live.
I know it's weird way to have your brain

281
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,670
wired.
It was such an interesting kind of

282
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:54,070
insight when I was there to people like
that.

283
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,260
So how do you make contact with these
guys?

284
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,660
Do you speak or Ukraine or whatever?
The speaker.

285
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,270
They're Russian.
What are they both usually,

286
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,160
what does it,
both Ukrainian.

287
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,473
Russian?
Yeah.

288
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,920
So it was organized for me to go meet
him for the TV show I did in the UK.

289
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:13,570
And that was a part of that show was me
going to Ukraine to meet somebody else

290
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:16,030
that did similar things.
And that was where I met him.

291
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,970
So they somehow or another got in
contact with him through his youtube

292
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,850
videos or something along those lines.
Wow.

293
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,750
In a strange world we live in now,
you know?

294
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,940
Yeah.
You can go to that place and risk your

295
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,340
life with a bunch of other crazy people.
Yes.

296
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,690
No,
that's cool,

297
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,220
I guess.
Yeah.

298
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,750
Now what has it been like for you to
become famous for being like this crazy

299
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,584
risk taker?

300
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,990
Um,
I wouldn't say I'm like super famous.

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,210
Already famous.
I know who you are.

302
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,320
I told my friends,
they're like,

303
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,801
oh,
that too.

304
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:45,520
It's crazy.
How many millions of hits to your videos

305
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:48,460
have fucking millions.
Bunch of million.

306
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,430
That's famous man.
That's what's called famous.

307
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,220
Right.
Unless it's one dude is watching it over

308
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,810
and over again.
That's just my mum,

309
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,660
my boy,
he's alive.

310
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,520
Oh,
that's cool.

311
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,280
I Dunno.
That's a bit weird.

312
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,620
Yeah.
You'll famous.

313
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,160
Yeah,
I guess it's the same as that,

314
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,530
but on a much smaller scale.
Yeah,

315
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:10,780
but you're famous for doing like risk
take.

316
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:13,030
I'm just framing payments for talking
shit.

317
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,620
Yeah.
It's easy to talk shit.

318
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,090
You just have to say funny things or be
ridiculous.

319
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,440
But you're famous for like literally
doing something that makes people shit

320
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,850
their pants when they look at a video of
it.

321
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,400
I look at videos of the stuff you do,
and I started Jamie,

322
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,050
I'll tell ya,
I started squeezing.

323
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,050
I'm like,
fuck.

324
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,240
And I go,
oh,

325
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,270
what the fuck is he doing?
I don't,

326
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,730
you know,
I don't have any desire to do what

327
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,860
you're doing.
That's why my dream about Alex,

328
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,360
about climbing with Alex,
like here's one.

329
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,770
Yeah,
this is the first one.

330
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:44,110
So this was the first big one I ever
released.

331
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,750
This video literally changed my life.
This is what we announced two,

332
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,630
2016 it's three years climbing over some
water.

333
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,850
It was this the first time you had done
something like this?

334
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,680
No.
So I'd done a couple other ones,

335
00:13:56,681 --> 00:14:00,280
but this was the biggest and this was
like the first big one that I'd hung

336
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,350
off.
God Damn Dude.

337
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,170
No,
you,

338
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,680
you're in it.
It's funny cause I live like just next

339
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,270
to that,
which is really cool.

340
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,290
Oh Wow.
Dude,

341
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,980
if you fell that would not be good.
Not even into water.

342
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,120
It's just the water.

343
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,100
He'd survived.
Oops.

344
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,320
Oh you fuck,
you're out of your fucking mind man.

345
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,740
Well you dealing dude.
What were you thinking right now when

346
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:24,010
you're hanging above that water?
First of all your hand sweaty.

347
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,510
Not Hands.
My hands.

348
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,220
Never already.
My hands sweat when I'm not doing

349
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:27,971
anything,
but what?

350
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,610
I'm doing this stuff quite,
it's like who's stopping you right now?

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,480
Send my friend Simon is up there with me
and another friend Doug was there too.

352
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,400
What do you think Simon and Doug would
do if you fell?

353
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,110
Well,
they just hurry up real down and oh

354
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,280
Jesus,
you go in one handed

355
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,830
mother fucker dude.
Like what are you thinking?

356
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,690
Why you're doing this?
You know what?

357
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,340
Just like Alec Arnold said,
there's not much going on.

358
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,890
It's just me in that moment.
But there is,

359
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,030
you get a first time to eat breakfast,
right?

360
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,090
Yeah.
But thinking about what you're going to

361
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,500
eat for breakfast,
you know,

362
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,690
most of the time when you get to a
situation where you're about to do

363
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,990
something that you've never done before
and you kind of naturally,

364
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,870
your brain kind of hyped it up and makes
it seem a lot worse than what it

365
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:06,320
actually is.

366
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,810
And then you do it and you're like,
why the fuck was I scared of that?

367
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,410
That was exactly the same.
So it's like just scared of that because

368
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,900
if you fell you're fucking dead.
Yeah.

369
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I mean that's not rocket science.
That's a thick pole you're hanging on

370
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:20,120
to.
I sound like a small poles,

371
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,040
like super easy.
Can you do a one arm chin up?

372
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,090
No,
I'm not.

373
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,710
I'm not like particular stone fatigue at
all.

374
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,270
Please work on that.
You should be able to do it when I'm

375
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,400
channel.
But if your like what?

376
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,630
Active limbs,
man,

377
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,080
it's not,
it's not easy to do one.

378
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,420
I'm Chins when you have this big,
but there's gotta be some crossfit guys

379
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,410
that can do it.
Yeah.

380
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,580
I feel like strength isn't in my jeans.
No.

381
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,423
Started out of it.
And that

382
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,200
you were hanging from your fucking,
how long did you hang for a,

383
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,490
I saw him three times.

384
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,970
Probably like 30 seconds each time.
It's hard to hang 30 seconds.

385
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,790
30 seconds is tough.
It's not when you like,

386
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,880
when you do that all the time we'll
stuff is swinging around and all that

387
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:56,870
stuff.
It's quite easy.

388
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,570
But most people overestimate the amount
of time that they can hang.

389
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,220
Yeah.
I uh,

390
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,080
we had this thing on fear factor where
people had to hold onto a bar that

391
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,420
hangover like a river and a girls beat
the guys.

392
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,560
Really?
Yeah.

393
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,540
Interesting.
Because girls don't weigh as much thing.

394
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,060
Yeah.
So the girls would be like 110 pounds

395
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:15,560
and they'd be able to hang on for a
couple of minutes.

396
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,210
Where's the guys at?
About a minute and a half.

397
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,610
There were all tromping off.
Yeah.

398
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,220
Yeah.
I weighed 200 pounds.

399
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,410
That's a lot of weight to carry around
in your hands.

400
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,610
Flat at the moment so that I don't know
how you could possibly allow yourself to

401
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,800
get fat when you're not jumping across
every,

402
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,480
I think every ounce is important.

403
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,880
Yeah.
Like backpackers lose weight so they

404
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,410
don't,
they don't have as much body weight

405
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,210
around.
I need to lose it.

406
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,340
I need to sort my life out and start
your life.

407
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,370
You're doing crazy shit.
So you,

408
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,680
um,
this is like what you do professionally

409
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,514
now,
right?

410
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,750
How does that work?
I'm like,

411
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:53,600
what is a normal,
a normal day.

412
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.
Did you go out,

413
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,370
jump up and say,
you know,

414
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
the normal day I do a lot of work behind
the scenes.

415
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,940
Just like editing and emails and just
like boring stuff that people don't see

416
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,620
this trait of duties.
Exactly.

417
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,371
Yeah.
It has to be done,

418
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:10,670
but it just works the same as any other
online influence.

419
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,260
They're like,
you got a big following,

420
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,560
opportunities come your way.
And if you do something like that,

421
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:19,160
that's a bit different and a bit,
I guess crazy to most people.

422
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,650
Even cooler opportunities come in when
it that's,

423
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,640
that's it,
right?

424
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,040
You got Youtube money,
you've got like merchandise on my

425
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,500
website.
You've got sponsored videos and

426
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,790
sponsors.
That's it.

427
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,580
Really.
So you work directly with sponsors.

428
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:35,390
You have like an agent or a manager.
That's hilarious.

429
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,790
It's kid.
You're going places.

430
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,860
Yeah,
I smoking a big cigar.

431
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,220
Listen,
we're gonna have to take it to next

432
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,240
level.
Can you walk into your hands?

433
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,580
Can you walk in your hands on top of the
Russians?

434
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:46,490
The Russians are walking on their hands.
I can't beat the Russians,

435
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:48,470
man.
You can't go too crazy.

436
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,460
How many of them die a lot?
I think there's,

437
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,220
there's a few videos floating around of
people falling off cranes and shit,

438
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,280
but it's super like,
oh,

439
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,060
that's not nice to look at it.
Yeah.

440
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,550
Have you seen those videos?
I haven't seen any of these.

441
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,200
I want to see him.
Well,

442
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:06,750
the wingsuit guy flying to the bridge
the other day,

443
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,920
I thought I didn't want to see it,
but then I watched it six times in a row

444
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:11,340
and blacks out before he hits,
right?

445
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,380
Oh No.
Have you found that?

446
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,180
Oh yes.
Oh,

447
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,290
you see him bounce off the bridge and it
sounds like a car accident.

448
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,150
It's a bang sound like
the bang.

449
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,850
But it sounds like a car accident.
Yeah,

450
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,080
it's fucked up.
It's the screams afterwards that get me.

451
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,370
Yeah,
it's all bad.

452
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,230
Yeah.
All of it's bad that people going,

453
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,083
oh,
bone line.

454
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,190
But that is half of the reason why these
people were watching is the possibility

455
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:43,110
that that could happen.
Even though they don't want it to

456
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:45,120
happen.
That accentuates thrill.

457
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,170
It's a strange thing,
isn't it?

458
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,460
Because I hate watching and stuff like
that,

459
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,700
but there's something in me that's like,
I can't not click it.

460
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,610
How could you say you hate watching
stuff like that?

461
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,790
Because you do dare devil videos.
I mean,

462
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,530
I hate watching people die.
Yes.

463
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,393
Oh,
I understand that.

464
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,410
But do you like watching people live?
Do you like watching people take risks

465
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,090
and live or do you go,
oh Jesus,

466
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,970
I don't,
I don't really watch that much stuff.

467
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,430
So you just do it.
I just do stuff.

468
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,780
Yeah.
Interesting.

469
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,850
So do you look at like the competitors?
Like is there like a,

470
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,540
a bunch of you that are like pushing the
boundaries and you're like,

471
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,374
Huh,
Nah,

472
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,180
I literally have no interest in beating
other people or making something better

473
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,210
or more dangerous than other people.
I have no interest in that.

474
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm doing it because I love it and I
love making videos and you just see

475
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,930
those guys that were walking on their
hands and they were doing flips and then

476
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:37,020
they were doing hoverboards on the edge
of this building.

477
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,720
Yeah.
That when I have a real problem as rough

478
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,260
because I've been on hover boards before
and sometimes you fall off,

479
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,990
sometimes they fuck up,
sometimes they stop working,

480
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:50,310
sometimes she goes wrong,
like you're trusting and some cheaply

481
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:53,160
made Chinese hunk of Shit.
Jesus.

482
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,870
Oh you fucks,
I can't.

483
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,180
Oh he's spinning around in circles.
Spinning bothers me so much.

484
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,190
And he's like literally like getting to
the edge and spinning around.

485
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,870
I mean inches from fucking certain death
and moving quite quickly by the way.

486
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,450
I mean,
I don't think it's that bad.

487
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:14,390
Like shut the fuck up.
Of course it's,

488
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,050
I've been in one of those and it's quite
easy.

489
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,100
Shut it off,
Jamie.

490
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,930
He's got his hands,
his hands,

491
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:20,940
dude,
he's standing on his hands on a fucking

492
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,160
hoverboard on a building on the top of
the world.

493
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,680
Fuck you.
He's crazy.

494
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:26,514
These people are crazy.

495
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,910
Look,
my hands are Russian.

496
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,280
Russian.
Yeah,

497
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,620
they're different folk,
right?

498
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,454
Yeah.
Yeah.

499
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,570
They're their own species.
There are definitely wild folk.

500
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,640
It's just the ability to do that,
and then,

501
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,420
and this new thing that we have now,
we can take videos of it and just upload

502
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:46,070
it instantly.
You don't have to have any sort of a

503
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,410
network or anything that approves it.
You put up your own thing and then boom,

504
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,970
all of a sudden you're like,
yeah,

505
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,300
you're a one man show.
That's like the most amazing thing about

506
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:59,380
youtube is it's like everybody has a job
on youtube.

507
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,450
Anybody can go on Youtube,
upload stuff,

508
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,410
get paid for it.
Right.

509
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,790
That's just,
it's just so cool.

510
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,190
And then if you make good stuff that's
inspiring people or people enjoy

511
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,430
[inaudible].
Yeah,

512
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,750
it's crazy.
So cool.

513
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,190
It's very strange,
right?

514
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,580
It's a completely new world that I don't
think that anybody anticipated that they

515
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,740
were going to have individual content
providers.

516
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,570
We're essentially going to be like their
own network.

517
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,550
Yeah.
Now how,

518
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,450
what kind of an obligation do you have
to the people that are,

519
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,350
that are watching your show?
Like how often do you post stuff?

520
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,040
Um,
I have no like set schedule.

521
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,130
I probably should,
I feel like I grow a lot more if I had

522
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,690
set that.
Like the more I upload,

523
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:36,850
the more I grow and that's just how it
works.

524
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,580
But like how often can you do that?
Common ground climb stuff every day,

525
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:40,414
you know,
it's not that.

526
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,320
Right.
So how,

527
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:46,321
how many days a week a good month in
terms of like video uploads would be

528
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,890
like three,
three or four videos.

529
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,770
One I was like good for me.
That's interesting.

530
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,160
Yeah,
because some people try to up hit,

531
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:58,570
I'm trying to do better but,
but it's hard though,

532
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:00,250
right?
It's just given the nature of what you

533
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,084
do.

534
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,480
And I live in the UK most of the time.
And the,

535
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,510
the weather there is just like,
yeah,

536
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,970
you can't be hanging when it's raining
out and it's always,

537
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,370
oh fuck that.
Oh,

538
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,590
you get up there and just do,
but your friends are there with the

539
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:15,191
camera.
You're like,

540
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:15,611
let's,
what was,

541
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:17,670
tell what off,
tell it off.

542
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,920
I've had a few Jewy situations.
Oh fuck.

543
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,151
Climate.
It's normal.

544
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:24,210
And then when you get to the top,
that's what it was like,

545
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,440
fuck.
Where did this witness come from?

546
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,690
Oh my God.
Why don't you put that sticky shit on

547
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:30,760
your hands?
Like football players use football,

548
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,500
American football.
Sticky Shit.

549
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,560
Like chalk or,
no,

550
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,030
it was like for cars like glue,
they spray glue in their hand,

551
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,160
stick them,
stick on his own.

552
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:38,810
What's called,
yeah,

553
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,480
yeah.
Spray some shit in your hands.

554
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,220
Make some sticky.
I'm like,

555
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,113
hmm.

556
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,990
Thinking to taking it to the next level
with the sticky.

557
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,220
Imagine if you're like hanging in,
you just kind of get off.

558
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,630
Stripper's use it to allegedly,
um,

559
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,820
some stuff that you could buy that uh,
you would,

560
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,560
uh,
put on.

561
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,370
I think they spray on their legs so they
could cling onto bars better and their

562
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,310
hololens.
Yeah.

563
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,303
Yeah,
it makes sense.

564
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,440
They also helps not getting like
calluses and stuff.

565
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,610
Ah,
that makes sense.

566
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,660
No,
that doesn't make sense.

567
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,360
Because you think like it would you want
it to be lubricated then?

568
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:11,340
I mean like,
um,

569
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,280
when they start to like get sore
blister,

570
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,000
if I use chalk,
I don't get that because they either rip

571
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,700
shock.
Oh yeah.

572
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,720
I use chalk.
I use truck for weightlifting and stuff

573
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:23,800
like that.
I sweat a lot though.

574
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,530
I'm really sweaty hands for whatever
reason.

575
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm just a sweaty fuck.

576
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,440
So when I watch your videos,
I start sweating,

577
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,450
man.
I started freaking out to change your

578
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,410
clothes.
Yeah.

579
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,100
Like when I used to play pool,
I've always found it really hard to use

580
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,320
a pool cue that doesn't have a wrap on
it,

581
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,690
you know what I mean?
And like if it's just a,

582
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,120
um,
a piece of wood that had like a Polish

583
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:43,760
or a,
um,

584
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,640
a finish on it.
So what I would do is I would get that

585
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:48,530
stripper stuff and I'd put it on my
hands.

586
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:51,580
And then that way it allows you to like
gently hold onto the pool cue.

587
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:53,870
That sounds so dorky.
But uh,

588
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,990
this stuff unfortunately though gets on
your hands and then you could transfer

589
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:59,150
it to the balls and it makes the ball
stick to each other.

590
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,440
It's not good.
Not Good.

591
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,170
So that's my knowledge of a stripper.

592
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,600
Gooky stuff that you can have it on with
whatever it is,

593
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,910
but it's not stick them though.
It's probably something similar,

594
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,500
but there's also a product that I've
used called dry hands that it's like any

595
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,140
per sprint for your hands.
Yeah.

596
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,850
Yeah.
I found out about this cause I tried to

597
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,040
choke.
You seen that stuff?

598
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,940
No,
it's that,

599
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,060
it's just like,
it comes out like a Suntan lotion.

600
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,400
Ah.
And then it just rubs in and kind of

601
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:27,470
dries out and make some pretty sticky.
Ooh,

602
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,760
I haven't heard of that.
Liquid Chalk.

603
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,750
I bet.
At the same thing.

604
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,471
Yeah.
Yeah.

605
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:30,940
It's,
uh,

606
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,340
essentially somehow or another they've
figured out a way to stop you from

607
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,200
sweating if they spray some stuff on
you.

608
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,561
Like,
well,

609
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:39,470
that's what antiperspirant is.
That's a big thing that people like.

610
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:40,670
Right.
And they like to not sweat and their

611
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,504
underarms.

612
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,710
Disgusting.
Yeah.

613
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,160
Fuck man,
this,

614
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,370
I,
I really have a hard time just watching

615
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:49,430
these videos.
I can't imagine if this is like the

616
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,250
world that you've,
you know,

617
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,720
I mean this is the path you've chosen.
Your on your,

618
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,910
you know,
you're in one of the top guys in this

619
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,390
madness,
I guess.

620
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,150
Yeah.
You are not for me to say no,

621
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,130
but I'm,
I don't mean in terms of ranking,

622
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,950
I'm just saying that it's,
it's a crazy path to take with your

623
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,140
life.
What digital.

624
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

625
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:10,940
It's unusual.
Um,

626
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,870
but I've never been kind of,
I've never fit into like just the normal

627
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:16,460
world.
I hated school.

628
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,650
I ended up quitting school,
like fairly early.

629
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,350
No qualifications,
nothing.

630
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:21,770
And how old were you when you quit
school?

631
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,960
Uh,
I can't remember the ages,

632
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,620
but it was like,
what's,

633
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,150
what do you have hit you up high school
and then you have college.

634
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,983
College?
Yeah.

635
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,020
Um,
so high school I quit like two years

636
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:34,970
before the end.
I think I was like 13,

637
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:36,140
14.
Wow.

638
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,900
You'll like done.
So done.

639
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,640
Really.
Did your parents get mad?

640
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,721
Yeah.
He's like,

641
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,730
don't worry mom.
I I climbed trees and shit.

642
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah.
I put my mom through a lot of shit when

643
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:48,890
I was a kid.
I will do you now 26.

644
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,740
So you started off this stuff really
early.

645
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:56,741
So at 22 you're out there filming these
fucking crazy adventures.

646
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,480
Yeah.
What'd your parents think then?

647
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,080
Well,
when I started like I started a little

648
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,720
bit of filming,
just the park or stuff.

649
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,050
Maybe in like 2001,
it won't be in now what I was 17,

650
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:13,130
18 was what I think I first I first made
a video and it was me just jumping

651
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:16,490
between railings and,
and like small stuff,

652
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,240
you know,
safe stuff.

653
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,410
Moms like,
Oh that's nice.

654
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,420
And now I remember what I felt shut out,
that she was just like not the fuck.

655
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,820
I think she hit me by the back of the
head.

656
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,670
How old were you when you showed her the
video of you hanging from the crane?

657
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,370
What?
I released it three is it goes right

658
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:32,720
away.
Like when you look,

659
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,420
check this out mom.
I never show her.

660
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,820
She doesn't really know about things
until I,

661
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,040
until the,
the video is done and it's uploaded.

662
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,010
That's a good,
yeah.

663
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,220
So what did she say to you when she saw
that besides hitting,

664
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,280
you did have to sit down was he never
hits me.

665
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,050
It's usually just like,
I think she was just freaked out and

666
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:49,980
blown away.
Yeah.

667
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,050
But I don't know.
I can't remember.

668
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,800
It wasn't like encouraging words.
It was like,

669
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,950
what are you doing right while you're
doing this and do you remember what you

670
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,890
said?
Not really.

671
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,110
I,
I usually just say the same thing.

672
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:05,400
I enjoy it.
Just enjoy it.

673
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,753
That's it.

674
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,090
Now was there any legal repercussions to
doing something like that?

675
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,310
Have any,
has anybody ever gotten mad at you?

676
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,780
Uh,
yeah.

677
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,520
In the UK,
there's not really,

678
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:18,900
because it's trespass.
Right?

679
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,060
And there's no like criminal damage or
anything.

680
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,000
And Trespass in the UK isn't a criminal
offense.

681
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:27,900
It's a civil offense.
So I can only get in trouble for it if

682
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:31,950
the owner of the property for some
reason wants to take me to court,

683
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,450
I sweating like a pig over here thinking
of you hanging from that bar over that

684
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:37,860
water.
I'm fucking sweating.

685
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,600
My hands are sweating,
my feet are sweating.

686
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,710
I'm sorry I interrupted you.
But so it's just a civil offense.

687
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,410
Yeah.
And Uk,

688
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,140
it's just a civil offense.
And if they catch you,

689
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,760
what does that mean?
Like you have to pay a fine or

690
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:51,594
something.
Uh,

691
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,360
the people that catch me,
it's usually just the police.

692
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,130
Somebody sees me,
calls the police,

693
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,440
the police come and they say,
what you doing?

694
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,430
Try to kind of tell me off and then sent
me on my way.

695
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,600
Cause there's,
there's nothing they can do,

696
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,010
which is,
which is good for me.

697
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,890
What is this?
Jamie makes climbing a tower guard.

698
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:08,850
There's a guy up there,
right?

699
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,283
Yeah.
So this,

700
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,480
this is the tallest thing I've ever
climbed,

701
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,280
right.
We're in the middle of get up there and

702
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:15,810
there's a dude up there.
Yeah.

703
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,630
So I went up and then about 10 minutes
after I got to the top,

704
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,290
the crane starts powering up like,
like spinning and shit.

705
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,000
And I'm like,
what the Hell is going on?

706
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,640
Like somebody like got a remote for this
crane.

707
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:29,220
So I climbed back down from the,
it's like it's one of these,

708
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:30,930
right?
So there's a little kind of thing here.

709
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,910
And then that's the main arm.
Okay.

710
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,910
So I climbed down from the backside and
then he's in his little room doing this

711
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,950
crazy stuff.
And so you're still climbing even though

712
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:43,320
you know this thing's gonna move all.
I spoke to him and he said,

713
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,060
hey brother,
I had a little conversation and I was

714
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,230
like,
can I climb this crane?

715
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,170
And then I was like,
can you,

716
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,230
can you just like leave the crane still
lock it off for like 10 minutes while I

717
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:55,770
do it,
cause I've come all this way.

718
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,330
And what'd he say?
And he was like,

719
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,170
yes.
Okay.

720
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,280
Wow.
What a nice guy.

721
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,210
Yeah,
I know.

722
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,760
And this has been moved down.
The bottom does in Dubai.

723
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,960
This is in Dubai.
At the Marina.

724
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:05,520
Yeah.
It was really cool.

725
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,800
I love what happened.
Now when you're doing this and you're

726
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:09,870
climbing,
when you're worried about being

727
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,520
arrested,
cause if you get arrested in Dubai,

728
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:13,290
that's no joke.
Yeah.

729
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,300
So they say I don't,
I don't know.

730
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,680
Dubai.
Dubai's a funny one.

731
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,410
I felt like they've got,
I feel like they've got bigger fish to

732
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,690
fry and they're kind of dealing with
actual serious stuff.

733
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,480
This what,
what,

734
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,910
what happened when I got down,
I had to like sit with all the site

735
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:30,960
managers and everything for a few hours.
And the main guy,

736
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,290
like the site manager,
the main site manager said if they

737
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,390
phoned the police,
they'll all lose their jobs.

738
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,390
Okay.
So that's kind of how it works.

739
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,290
Oh,
okay.

740
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,880
So usually they beat the fuck out of you
and tell you don't come back.

741
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,510
They don't know and never,
no,

742
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,870
but I mean,
I'm joking,

743
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:50,050
but they can't be happy that you're
doing this right.

744
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,630
And it wasn't,
but they also work because it just blew

745
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:53,540
their minds.
Oh,

746
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,880
I see.
Every time it's the same.

747
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,200
They're like,
you shouldn't be doing this.

748
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:58,750
They tried to tell me off and then when,
when,

749
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,310
uh,
when it comes to me leaving they're

750
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,910
like,
can we take a picture with you every

751
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:06,060
time you're so high up here man.
How,

752
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,130
how high are up?
Your right,

753
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:11,430
it is 450 meters.
What in the fuck is,

754
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,770
yeah,
I'm just thinking of 450 feets

755
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,120
ridiculous.
450 meters.

756
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,160
That's,
that's insanity one over the water was

757
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:22,000
only 300 feet.
So this is like full times,

758
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,383
full time.

759
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,470
It would take you a long time to hit the
ground.

760
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,570
Yeah it would.
So while you're climbing up here,

761
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,720
what is going through your mind?
You're just being careful and watching

762
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:38,590
your stuff.
This one was like really greasy cause

763
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,070
I've been for that for two years.
I think the driver's head and it was

764
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:47,480
just coated in like grease and dust the
air and fuck.

765
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,020
It was like climbing,
climbing yet like somebody had just

766
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,930
smothered it in moderation.
Oh my God.

767
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:56,480
Just while I'm gone slow and I'm getting
my feet in the right place.

768
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:00,260
And so the feet part of slippery too.
Everything is like butter.

769
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:01,700
Yeah.
Christ,

770
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,550
James,
James,

771
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:05,420
James,
James,

772
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:06,740
James.
So you get up to the top.

773
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:09,150
Please tell me,
don't hang from the top of this too,

774
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,420
but it was just too slippery.
Yeah.

775
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,020
Oh fuck you made a judgment call while
you're there.

776
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,480
Yeah.
This is such a mind.

777
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,770
Fuck.
Good Lord.

778
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:21,770
You're up by the way.
How awesome is Dubai credits?

779
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,540
I love it.
What a crazy.

780
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:26,840
A city that didn't exist just a few
decades ago.

781
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,230
So cool man.
It's one of my favorite places mainly

782
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:33,380
because you can do stuff like this.
Where do you do when you get up to the

783
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:34,240
top?
Do you just like put,

784
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,560
throw your hands up like I'm the king of
the world or do you have a jerk off up

785
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,240
there?
That'd be a feat.

786
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,200
It's a light up there in case a fucking
plane hits it.

787
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,710
It's how high you are.
The Oh,

788
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,990
trump.
It's hard to watch.

789
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,830
So,
um,

790
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,190
how many hours did it take you to do to
get up there or how long did it take

791
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,540
you?
Two hours.

792
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,600
But it was like,
so the beginning was I got there at like

793
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:06,020
three 30 in the morning and in Dubai
they start work at like three 30 or four

794
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:10,910
o'clock because it's cooler and that's
just like hundreds and hundreds of these

795
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:14,450
dudes stood outside the,
like the entrance to the site.

796
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,130
So I'm like,
how the hell am I going to get into this

797
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:18,260
place dark when this is all going on?
It was pitch black.

798
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:20,840
Yeah.
And I managed to find like a little

799
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,900
corner that I could sneak in and then
sneak over the fence and there's people

800
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,830
everywhere and I don't know how I
managed to get in without them seeing

801
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,200
me.
And then as soon as I dropped down,

802
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:33,240
I just dropped to the floor and they
crawled across the floor between like

803
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,450
these scaffolding bars and stuff like
that.

804
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,070
And then Tom Cruise mission impossible.
I've had some cool situations,

805
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,930
man,
some really fun stuff.

806
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,970
And then I get to the bottom of the
crane.

807
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,280
So the idea is I get to the crane,
I climb up like a bit of the crane and

808
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,560
then I get into the building.
That's the easiest way.

809
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:56,561
And usually because to climb the crane
for 450 meters is just like insane.

810
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,400
Especially in that heat is a killer.
And I had like just one of these one

811
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:04,490
bottle of wineries.
So you are your,

812
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,170
um,
so it takes you a couple of hours and

813
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,140
you're going through the building first.
So it took me a while to get up the

814
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:12,170
crane and then in,
cause I've got backpack and it's hot and

815
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:15,170
it's like dry and it's hard to breathe
and wow.

816
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,510
Yeah,
it was the wrong time of the year to do

817
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:20,870
it really.
And then I get in and then it's just

818
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,920
stares and stares and stares.
That's crazy.

819
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,580
You get here at three 30 and everybody's
just showing up for work too.

820
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,970
So they work three 30 until like early
morning and then they quit.

821
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,000
They seem to work nonstop.
Those guys,

822
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,770
I don't know how they do it.
It's not good.

823
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:36,500
And that probably paid like two bucks a
day or something.

824
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:36,860
Yeah.

825
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,640
There was a whole a vice special on it
about,

826
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:42,260
uh,
some of the more unscrupulous builders

827
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,850
out there.
But they do is they go to third world

828
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:47,120
countries.
They promise these people a certain

829
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:49,610
amount of money and then they bring them
over to the life.

830
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,590
Yeah.
Then they going to be able to send money

831
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,290
home and change their family's lives.
So they go there and take these jobs and

832
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,940
they take their passports away.
Yeah.

833
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,060
We give them a fraction of what they
were offered and then they live in

834
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,670
squalor through,
I think I've seen it.

835
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:04,070
They live like out in the middle of
nowhere and they will have these shared

836
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,980
showers and toilets and toilet.
It's like a hole in the ground.

837
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,940
It was awful.
Yeah.

838
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,990
Yeah,
yeah.

839
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:12,770
I mean that's a,
that's how you get up city built that

840
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:14,630
quick,
cheap.

841
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,840
Yeah.
It's scary is so,

842
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:19,250
uh,
but as uh,

843
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,540
as a completed entity as a thing,
it's pretty impressive.

844
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,240
Yeah.
Cause his truck,

845
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,150
you know,
as a city,

846
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,200
it's amazing.
Yeah.

847
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,300
This is one of the coolest cities I've
ever been.

848
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,610
They're just pushing it,
just pushing,

849
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,590
you know,
they just living it up all the time.

850
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,230
Have you seen the new big,
um,

851
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,630
what's it called?
Big,

852
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:40,820
but like the London eye,
that building a London eye in Dubai,

853
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,420
in the marina,
and it's like so much bigger.

854
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,580
What does the London eye,
you know that,

855
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,190
have you been to London?
Yes.

856
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,670
Big.
Oh,

857
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,070
the ferris wheel.
That's what it's called.

858
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,320
The London eye.
Yeah.

859
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,320
But the building a bigger one,
that voting not times,

860
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,080
like five or something ridiculous.
Yeah.

861
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,490
Yeah.
I've been on,

862
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,530
I've looked at it by that.
I haven't been on it.

863
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,570
Yeah.
The one in Seattle,

864
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,330
I want to go there.
I want to go that around Christmas when

865
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:12,680
it's cooler and see if I can get 690
foot high Dubai.

866
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,680
I will be the low world's largest ferris
wheel upon completion in 2015 it says

867
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,300
it's not finished,
those motherfuckers union.

868
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,100
So last time I saw it was just the do
need to get more and to kidnap more

869
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:25,934
people.
Yeah.

870
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,020
Get them to work.
Yeah.

871
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,353
That's,
uh,

872
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,250
that's when you get on a ferris wheel
now.

873
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,630
Like do you go to Disneyland and be
like,

874
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,150
what kind of bullshit is though?
Something like the last time I went to

875
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:39,150
Disney land was here and I went I two
years ago and yeah,

876
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:40,140
I was like,
you be like,

877
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,990
Ooh,
space mountain tower of terror on space

878
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,880
mountain was the best one.
It's pretty bad ass.

879
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,800
Yeah.
It's even better now cause there's,

880
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,740
it's like star wars themed.
Is it?

881
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,690
Yeah.
I don't know if it's permanently star

882
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,520
wars themed and be guardians of the
galaxy.

883
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,150
Oh,
they just closed it or about to Oh yeah,

884
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:57,984
they can net.

885
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,390
Yeah,
the ad graphics and stuff like that.

886
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,560
Yeah.
Spice it up a bit.

887
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,510
Yeah.
I liked dlt cups.

888
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:04,860
Yeah,
those are fun.

889
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,610
That fun.
Yeah.

890
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:10,610
But for a guy like you who experienced
is real life and death fears like that.

891
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,020
Disneyland.
Shit's gotta be boring as hell,

892
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:13,511
man.
Yeah.

893
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:15,270
It was pretty boring.
Pretty Boring.

894
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,100
But it's like something you've got to do
once in your life,

895
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,840
right?
I bawled like a little Mickey Mickey

896
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:21,540
Mouse and there's an adult version out
here.

897
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,280
You've got to go to six flags.
Six flags.

898
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,170
Yeah.
What's the one that's opposite?

899
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,140
California is something that's right
next to Disneyland.

900
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,050
Oh,
California adventure.

901
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,133
Yeah,
that's true.

902
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,281
Yeah.
That's really good.

903
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,050
I felt like the rides were better.
Well,

904
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:35,760
it's more,
they're more adult oriented,

905
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,470
but they have a bunch of kids rides
there too.

906
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,940
Yeah.
But um,

907
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,540
six flags.
Six flags is way more like the sum of

908
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:43,400
their roller coasters.

909
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,990
Just fucking ridiculous on their way.
Crazier.

910
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,100
Yeah.
Way crazier.

911
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,200
But it's a different thing.
You know,

912
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:51,480
it's not,
it's more like older people.

913
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,950
It's more like,
like high school age and up versus

914
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,760
Disneyland's is really fun for little
kids.

915
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,930
Yeah.
Six flags.

916
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,780
I got like a lot of shit.
It's not even designed for little kids.

917
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,090
Yeah.
I think that some of those ones where

918
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:06,300
you go upside down some of the roller
coaster once and same one,

919
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,280
what is it,
an x factor or something like that?

920
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:10,680
X something out there.
I should go while I'm here.

921
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:12,510
I should check it out if it's a good
one.

922
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,530
Yeah.
It's exciting,

923
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,360
but it's just,
we're just thinking like,

924
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,940
do a guy like you,
like that kind of excitement is probably

925
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,410
really bland.
Yeah.

926
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:22,170
But like I said before,
because it's not in my control,

927
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:23,940
it's still kind of gets me a bit.
Oh,

928
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,900
right.
Of course.

929
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:25,820
It's good.
Yeah,

930
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,020
it's good.
Scares me a bit.

931
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,390
Do you think long term

932
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:30,980
okay.

933
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,320
Little bit.
Yeah,

934
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,910
a little bit.
But like,

935
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:37,310
I mean,
do you think long term is as far as like

936
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:40,370
how long you can do this stuff?
Not really.

937
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,090
No.
No.

938
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,150
That's,
that seems to be the thing that people

939
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
tell me the most.
They're like,

940
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,730
well,
if this is your job now,

941
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,210
surely you've got like a,
a limited kind of time to it.

942
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,520
And like I'm 26 I would say I've still
got another 10 years of good strength,

943
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,420
good health in me.

944
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,940
Yeah.

945
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,130
I don't know.
I think in that time I can build

946
00:38:00,131 --> 00:38:03,940
something else up so I don't need to
worry about what happens after.

947
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,100
So do you want to stay in some form of
entertainment?

948
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,930
Like,
you know,

949
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,580
I'd like to have a good entertainer.
Right?

950
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,900
Consider yourself,
I'm sorry.

951
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:18,790
I hit you with all those career goals.
I'm just a dude,

952
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:21,920
but what people call me.
Right.

953
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,210
You're a professional dude.
There's a little data.

954
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:24,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

955
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,270
It's a new disk distinction nation.
I'd like.

956
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,010
So after I did the TV thing,
I really enjoyed it and I've shot like a

957
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:36,280
couple of pilots since then for things
and I think I'd just like to,

958
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,530
to have my own TV show.
Hmm.

959
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,840
Well doing what?
Like what would you do?

960
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,220
Do Crazy Shit.
Wow.

961
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,180
The idea in the moment that I shot the
pilot for is I travel the world and

962
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:51,181
meeting other extreme athletes and I try
out what they do and that's,

963
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,200
yeah,
good luck getting insurance for that

964
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:54,034
show.

965
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,470
That's going to be a problem.
You might have to shoot it on your own

966
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:57,780
and sell it somebody.
Yeah.

967
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,470
Device.
So like if,

968
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,630
yeah.
So if you do something like that and

969
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,000
somebody falls,
yeah.

970
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Then when you do the show it
like if I was there and I filmed it,

971
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,150
yeah.
I wouldn't know.

972
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,520
No.
What if you show them falling and at the

973
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:15,220
end you just put a smiley face.
I put an Emoji,

974
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,050
rest in peace,
lol,

975
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,220
lol,
lol.

976
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,650
I couldn't do it.
You don't see the actual impact.

977
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:26,920
You just see a smiley face.
Maybe a bouncing smiley pace where they

978
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:28,630
were going,
going,

979
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,210
going,
and then year dip,

980
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,700
dip.
That's all folks cut to commercial.

981
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,650
By the time you come back,
people are thinking about other things

982
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:37,180
are ready,
their phone's buzzing and people are

983
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:39,100
texting them.
They're trying to get laid.

984
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,170
Yeah.
Pizza got delivered or over it.

985
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,503
I wonder,
man,

986
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,343
what,
what,

987
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
what would they tell you?
Like if you were doing something for a

988
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,930
production company,
do you think they would want to include

989
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,270
all that stuff?
Like,

990
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,270
yeah.
I surely they're not allowed,

991
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:56,300
right?
I don't know.

992
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,880
I mean,
what are they allowed to do and not to

993
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,280
do if people died in reality shows
before,

994
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:05,281
I got to think they must've done that.
Reality shows have been around for quite

995
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:09,850
a long time,
but it's the kind of thing that would

996
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:12,790
happen and then they'd
cut it out.

997
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,750
It's not live though,
was it?

998
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:14,950
So you can cut it.
Yeah,

999
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:17,020
you would cut it out,
but everybody would find out.

1000
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,110
Hmm.
There was a show footage always leaks as

1001
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:20,621
well.
Yeah,

1002
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:24,790
there's always something.
But there was a show in the early two

1003
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:29,791
thousands where these people were doing
some sort of a wilderness adventure type

1004
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:32,220
show,
like a race through the wilderness.

1005
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:37,250
They were on rafts or kayaks or
something along those lines on rapids

1006
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,520
and a woman got trapped.
Um,

1007
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,230
we've got wedge and a rock,
her boat,

1008
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,150
capsize weights,
and I think she died.

1009
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,210
And that was the first one that I had
heard of and I was like in the early two

1010
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,980
thousands but there's gotta be a bunch
of them

1011
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,180
because there's so many shitty reality
shows now too.

1012
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,280
There's so many production companies
that are just,

1013
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,600
yeah,
people are going to die.

1014
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,820
Yeah.
People up must be dying already.

1015
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,190
But that's,
is that something that you think about

1016
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:07,960
when you're doing this show?
Like if you're hanging out with these

1017
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:10,780
crazy Russian cats and they're,
they're doing these things,

1018
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,390
it is a possibility.
If you do it a thousand times,

1019
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,530
there is a possibility that one of those
times,

1020
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:17,590
so I'm just going to fall.
Yeah,

1021
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,573
I dunno.

1022
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,100
I've,
I've been in situations,

1023
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,830
it was one building in Ukraine where I'm
sad.

1024
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,200
It's like,
I think you shared this clip where I'm

1025
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,530
walking across the white beams and it's
like nothing underneath it.

1026
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,440
Um,
and we both walk out to the edge and

1027
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:37,610
then Mustang climbs down and hangs off
it and I'm looking down at him and I'm

1028
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:40,580
thinking like I can,
I can create the image in my head of him

1029
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,820
slipping and just disappearing.
Yeah.

1030
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,350
I've,
I've had a few moments like that where

1031
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,350
I've just kind of tried to imagine what
it would look like,

1032
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:51,740
but it's not a nice thought.
No,

1033
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,510
it's definitely not a nice thought.
But that's the whole reason why it's

1034
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:01,280
interesting is because it's possible.
But if I was doing a video in here of me

1035
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,460
hanging from a chin up bar,
that's the only a foot off the ground,

1036
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,150
nobody would give a shit if I'm there
looking everybody one arm.

1037
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,800
Yeah.
I'm just like James Kingston and do

1038
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,703
well,
fuck,

1039
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,490
I'm crazy.
No,

1040
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:16,100
there's a floor below me.
Even if I perform the exact same

1041
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,170
movements that you do,
if I'm not,

1042
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:20,390
my life isn't in danger.
It's not even interesting at all.

1043
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:23,450
The only reason why it's interesting
it's because your life is in danger.

1044
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,411
Yeah,
but that's,

1045
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,140
that's like one of the funny things
about it because it is a simple as

1046
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:28,460
handing off a bar.
Yeah.

1047
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,620
But people are just like,
what?

1048
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,200
Yeah.
Like if there's a small ledge.

1049
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,640
Oh Jesus.
There you go.

1050
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,563
Barefoot.
Huh?

1051
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,460
How come you decided to go barefoot?
You get bad grip barefoot.

1052
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,630
Jesus son.
This is that moment.

1053
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,180
Yeah.
So you're standing up there looking at

1054
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:46,100
him.
I'm just looking down on him and he's

1055
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:51,101
hanging and then he'd like,
does this stuff always go on one handed?

1056
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,840
Oh Jesus Christ.
The only goes one handed for a little

1057
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,340
bit and then he goes back to one handed.

1058
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,470
Oh you fucker,
Yo,

1059
00:42:57,471 --> 00:42:59,010
fuck.
Are you freaking mound?

1060
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,680
You're freaking me out.
And he's just hanging there too,

1061
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,270
by the way.
He's hanging in there.

1062
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,050
He's still hanging in there.
He's one arming it the entire time while

1063
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,100
this security like patrolling around the
button.

1064
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,590
No idea that were there.
Yeah,

1065
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,600
the clang of his body weight hits that
ground,

1066
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,550
that fuck.
And he's laughing and smiling.

1067
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,650
What is he saying?
His hands are slippery.

1068
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,510
It was,
it was a strange color.

1069
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:22,460
Like you'd end up with like chalky
hands,

1070
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,800
but it was like a purple.
He kind of color from the paint.

1071
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,170
Yeah.
Wow Dude.

1072
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,940
You guys ready?
And he's wearing sneakers.

1073
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,170
That's the security down there.
Let,

1074
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,450
oh Jesus dog as well.
Jump on that dog right from there dude.

1075
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,810
Um,
do you have this,

1076
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:42,920
a desire to like keep upping the ante?
Is that an issue?

1077
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,310
Um,
not really.

1078
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,480
No.
I just like,

1079
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,340
ultimately I just like creating stuff
and I liked making videos and I liked

1080
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,940
exploring places.
I like heights,

1081
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,970
I like jumping between stuff.
Like the natural progression for me is

1082
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:00,320
to,
is to get higher and things get bigger.

1083
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,360
That's just how it is.
So it just happens.

1084
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:05,070
But bright but not thinking about it.
I'm not thinking like,

1085
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,040
okay,
I've just released this so now I need to

1086
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,650
do something bigger.
Like it's just there.

1087
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:12,560
It's just not true.
So how do you go about making a video?

1088
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:14,480
If you decide I'm going to make a new
video,

1089
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,220
like what?
Do you have a thought in your head like,

1090
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,840
I need to get on the Eiffel Tower?
Like what?

1091
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,850
Do you know what?
The Eiffel Tower was?

1092
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:21,380
Never,
never a plan.

1093
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:24,350
I never thought,
let's go to Paris and do the Eiffel

1094
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,380
Tower.
Did you do the Eiffel Tower?

1095
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,120
So how'd you do it?
If it's not a plan,

1096
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:31,160
how'd you do it?
So I was in Denmark just traveling

1097
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,920
around with a bunch of friends and
instead of getting in the minivan and

1098
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:37,020
driving all the way back to London,
I was like,

1099
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:39,060
no,
I don't want to sit in a van for 15

1100
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:41,580
hours.
Let's just fly somewhere and continue

1101
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:45,120
this adventure.
So me and my friend flew to Paris and

1102
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:48,300
then the next day we ended up climbing.
Now for tower.

1103
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,840
Do you think this kind of stuff was
being done before people were

1104
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:54,150
videotaping it?
Like was this must've been,

1105
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,600
it must have been.
I feel like for certain people it's just

1106
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,730
a,
it's just in them to kind of explore

1107
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:02,820
places you shouldn't really explore.
And I think he's,

1108
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,510
yeah.
Well,

1109
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,820
for you it seems like something that was
fostered though,

1110
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:07,650
right?
Because you started off just doing the

1111
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:10,380
par course tough.
And this became of it.

1112
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,030
But you know what?
When I was a kid,

1113
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:13,650
I was like,
I was annoying little kid.

1114
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,360
I was always do things that I shouldn't
know.

1115
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1116
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:21,720
And I mean now I'm just a big,
just a big version of what I was then.

1117
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,763
Wow,

1118
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,380
okay.

1119
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,860
Ooh,
there's some pretty cool videos.

1120
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:28,880
If you look up on youtube of like urban
exploration and people were finding

1121
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,110
weird pathways and like,
oh shit.

1122
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:33,810
Looked on 60 feet underground,
we made it and there's this shit that's

1123
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:37,140
been buried under here.
Wonder why it's buried and look old

1124
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:40,860
electronics fifties and stuff like that.
Like under like uncovering the hatch and

1125
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:42,750
lost.
So it was sort of like that.

1126
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

1127
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,640
Well that's,
that's very interesting to me.

1128
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:49,150
But what I'm,
what I'm really most fascinated by is

1129
00:45:49,151 --> 00:45:52,390
this willingness to put your life in
mortal danger.

1130
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,180
Okay.

1131
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,340
And that,
how exciting this is for people to

1132
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:58,170
watch.
Like what's the most viewed video that

1133
00:45:58,171 --> 00:45:59,520
you have?
How many hits does it have?

1134
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,250
A,
I think just over 4 million

1135
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,660
people.
Yeah,

1136
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,080
this one's got a few million I think.
Oh,

1137
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,730
this is you.
You get,

1138
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,480
so we climbed it.
We went,

1139
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,870
we just pushed it too far.
Like we went up to the very top

1140
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,160
platform.
If you've been to Paris,

1141
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,780
no,
it didn't say off the tower.

1142
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,150
So you can take the lift up,
right?

1143
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,270
You can,
you can walk.

1144
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:24,120
Can you take the stairs to the second
platform?

1145
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,650
That's the highest you can take the
stairs too.

1146
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,290
There is stairs to the top,
but they don't allow it because they're

1147
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:32,490
like weird and narrow.
And so you take the lift to the top and

1148
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:36,510
then there's like a door that's always
manned by a security guard that is the

1149
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:37,470
door to that staircase.

1150
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,240
And that's what we came up from the
backside.

1151
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,680
So we,
we went up,

1152
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,170
I'm,
for some reason we just had the urge to

1153
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:46,260
just go inside even though it's lit up,
even though there's cameras everywhere.

1154
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,210
Uh,
we opened that door,

1155
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:52,200
I step in to the top platform and then I
just hear this,

1156
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:54,300
this walkie talkie just go like,
ah,

1157
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,480
like you go crazy and French.
And I was like,

1158
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,520
Shit,
we've definitely been seen.

1159
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,710
Let's disappear.
So then we ran down,

1160
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:05,250
we climbed out of the staircase and then
on each,

1161
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,970
on opposite corners of the tower in the
main beams,

1162
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:13,530
there's like kind of like a little
pocket inside the beam that you can jump

1163
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,140
into.
It must be like two by two.

1164
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:18,940
Like size.
I barely for intimate,

1165
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,830
right?
Cause I'm huge.

1166
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,160
My friend is small.
So you just like Brooke disappeared into

1167
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:28,161
this hole and then we sat on opposite
ends of the tower and hid and the lifts,

1168
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:30,880
you start hitting lifts coming up,
you start hitting people running up and

1169
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,030
down.

1170
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,900
The stairs you see taught is
everything's kicking off and we're

1171
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:38,920
hitting these little holes
and they're searching for us.

1172
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,830
And I'm just like hiding in this hole.
And I'm like,

1173
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,960
I've got one shoe off because it
wouldn't fit in.

1174
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,920
I've got my knee wrestling on my shoe,
I've lost all feeling in my leg because

1175
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:51,330
the blood circulation has gone.
My head's sticking out the top and I've

1176
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:56,260
got like my tee shirt of my head,
like a little Ninja and this people with

1177
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,060
torches going up and down looking for
us.

1178
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,050
So do you have video on that little
pocket that you were in?

1179
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,530
Uh,
it's not in this,

1180
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:06,364
no.
I do have,

1181
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,000
it's only on two sides of the tower,
which is strange,

1182
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,920
but it's kind of similar to this gap
here.

1183
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:12,430
Oh,
I see.

1184
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,680
It's there.
It's in the right in that corner there.

1185
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:15,514
So yeah.

1186
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,710
And it's like a foot and a half by a
foot and a half.

1187
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:21,250
I think I barely fit in.
So how long did they wait?

1188
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,130
So we're in the room in,
this was coming up right now.

1189
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,260
Yeah.
This is what it was starting to open up.

1190
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,000
This was like as we,
so this is like right where as here,

1191
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,000
just before we go.
Cool.

1192
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,270
Yeah.
So He'd tucked in.

1193
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,720
It was just before he got caught.
So how'd you get caught?

1194
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,430
Because the lifts started coming up
because of that.

1195
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:42,100
The staff start coming up to work or to
clean or something and they just saw us.

1196
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,160
We're just like running around these
beams and there's lifts everywhere.

1197
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,490
So what happens then?
So it like,

1198
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,240
so we're still in this hole and we sit
in this whole for like two hours,

1199
00:48:52,241 --> 00:48:54,640
at least two hours where they're going
up and down.

1200
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,010
It goes quiet.
So I jumped out of the hole.

1201
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,980
I have a look around,
I go and see stevie.

1202
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:02,770
Stevie's like half asleep,
just chilling in the hole and then

1203
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,890
come back to the whole.
I'm like,

1204
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:07,960
yeah,
that seems like pretty clear now.

1205
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,920
I think they must have thought that we
jumped off with parachutes and we would

1206
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,890
go because they couldn't find us.
And then I was like,

1207
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:16,270
yeah,
this seems pretty clear.

1208
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:19,750
And then every single light on the tower
goes,

1209
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:24,190
the whole thing lights up.
And this isn't like the twinkly lights

1210
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:28,180
that they have on every hour at night.
This is like internal lights that are

1211
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:33,181
like this big,
like the whole fucking tower up.

1212
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,320
So I jumped straight back in the hole.
I'm like,

1213
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,530
what's going on?
And then lifts again,

1214
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:41,200
people up and down the stairs again
looking for us.

1215
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,230
So when we sat in these holes again for
ages

1216
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,280
and then,
and then it finally goes quiet,

1217
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,700
the lights are still on for a little
while and then the whole thing just

1218
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,040
shuts down.
And I think that was it.

1219
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,260
So I jumped out,
I had a look around to went and got

1220
00:49:56,261 --> 00:50:00,790
stevie and then it was ours again.
And then we were up there until like

1221
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,160
9:00 AM I think it was.
How long was that?

1222
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,650
How many hours?
A 1:00 AM til 9:00 AM.

1223
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,440
Wow.
So you were climbing around I think for

1224
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:10,600
eight fucking hours.
That's nuts.

1225
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,790
Yeah.
Running some.

1226
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,740
That French chocolate barb.
She was really good.

1227
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:15,941
Oh,
that's all you eat.

1228
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:16,780
It's all we had.
Yeah.

1229
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:20,830
So he came down because you were hungry
and we came down because we got caught

1230
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:21,610
now.

1231
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,370
And so you would have stayed there for
the rest of the day.

1232
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,310
Um,
the idea was to like wait till it opened

1233
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,640
and then get into a,
a place where you could hide like near

1234
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:34,850
the second platform and then just drop
into the second platform and just merge

1235
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:37,970
in was like the tourists.
But we didn't get that far.

1236
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,560
That would have been car.
So the plan was to wait for it to open

1237
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:45,980
and sneak out with the crowd.
Just jumped out of the beam into the

1238
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,750
crowd.
Disappearance or lift done.

1239
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,300
So when you get caught then what
happens?

1240
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,690
So we've got seen by like a big group of
people in,

1241
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:57,590
in one of the lifts and we just like
waving and they're like,

1242
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:00,800
ah,
like angry looking people but like angry

1243
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:02,300
people and happy people.
They're like,

1244
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:04,160
what the heck's going on?
And then,

1245
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,450
uh,
we were like above slightly above and

1246
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:10,490
maintenance platform where they have
like lifts that take workers up.

1247
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,650
And then,
so we had to climb down and we met

1248
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:16,280
people on the maintenance platform
getting the left.

1249
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,010
There's like five of us,
like to me and Stevie and they're like

1250
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,570
few other people.
Security,

1251
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:22,520
just like private security for the
tower.

1252
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,100
And then we come down to like the
basement lifts open.

1253
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:31,101
There's just like a room full of
policemen and we're like go scene in the

1254
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,500
movie.
And when they do that bit,

1255
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,050
I had to hide every single way,
sd card and everything that I had on me.

1256
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,610
How'd you do that?
Three counters?

1257
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,170
No,
no.

1258
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,180
It was an option.
That is the only option.

1259
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,480
Yeah.
I haven't had to do that yet.

1260
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,780
But he had a condom.
You tied in a knot?

1261
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,500
Yeah.
Put them in the condom.

1262
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:52,720
Put your finger up,
move on.

1263
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,470
Yeah,
that's right.

1264
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,010
All right.
So how do you um,

1265
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,000
hide the SD cards?

1266
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,520
I mean they must have went through your
stuff for the flight.

1267
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,620
I thought they would,
but they didn't.

1268
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,390
I don't know.
Paris,

1269
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,580
they don't give a fuck.
The attorney delayed drink wine

1270
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,370
chocolate had like a big five d like a
big DSLR.

1271
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:12,371
And then I had I think two gopros and so
to mike arrestees and one like cf card

1272
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:13,910
from the,
from the big one.

1273
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,800
And I had like this bag that I had,
like little tiny pen pockets,

1274
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,050
like really thin pockets.
Right.

1275
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,640
And I just stuffed the Mike cresty cars
down there and it had like a,

1276
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,770
a little rip in the back padding of the
bag.

1277
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:32,630
So I just threw the CF card in the back
of the bag and it just fell down and I

1278
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:35,870
just hoped.
And then when like we got to the police

1279
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:37,640
station,
they were like,

1280
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,330
you have so many cameras on you,
clearly you've been filming.

1281
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,410
And I was like,
no,

1282
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,050
I forgot the SD cards.
Cameras died.

1283
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,280
And they,
they believed that I had to surrender

1284
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:51,800
everything on my phone.
I um,

1285
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,510
you had to surrender everything on your
phone.

1286
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:53,950
Yeah.
So,

1287
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,400
so I had three cameras,
right.

1288
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:57,440
So it was like I had three cameras and
my phone.

1289
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,020
So I was like,
I'm going to have to give something up

1290
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,650
to try and save the most valuable,
the most valuable footage.

1291
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,960
So I was like,
they were like,

1292
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:07,910
did you feel most,
I only filmed in my phone because my

1293
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:11,330
camera's died and I forgot my SD cards.
And then they went through like the

1294
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:13,330
footage on the phone just made me delete
it or,

1295
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,810
oh,
that's cool.

1296
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:16,550
So the,
the footage and the phone was like a

1297
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:20,030
ruse.
The footage on the phone was like me in

1298
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:22,340
the,
in the little hole filming,

1299
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:25,710
talking to the camera and like filming
the people looking cause was like this

1300
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:26,760
and I put my phone down.

1301
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,830
Great.
That you had something to give them.

1302
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

1303
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,610
So now then what happens?
How long did they detain you?

1304
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,200
Uh,
we were there for like eight hours.

1305
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,830
So that another eight hours.
So when you're eight hours up there

1306
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,130
climbing around,
how do you pee?

1307
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,510
You pee off the edge of the town.
Oh my God.

1308
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,960
That's probably where he got arrested.
The person on these French people as if

1309
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,360
life wasn't clicked on them enough.
Yeah.

1310
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:49,800
I think by the time it gets to the
ground,

1311
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:51,630
it's kind of all spread out and we're
not,

1312
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,660
or it's a fucking raging river of pis,
right.

1313
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:56,700
On some little Old Lady's head.
Yeah.

1314
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:59,820
It seems like if you were,
why don't you just pee on the tower that

1315
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:02,850
way it dribbles down slowly.
It doesn't hit anybody in the head.

1316
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,340
I mean if you were sitting on the Eiffel
Tower and you needed to pay,

1317
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,240
there was no one below you because it's
like 4:00 AM okay.

1318
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,610
You'd pay off the edge.
Maybe that's even ruder.

1319
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,270
I'm sorry enough person.
If I did pay on them,

1320
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,520
maybe it was a romantic couple going for
a walk,

1321
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:20,460
maybe it would have really worked out.
All of a sudden the girl goes to lighter

1322
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:25,170
cigarette and you piss running her head
and she gets mad and the fucking evening

1323
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:27,480
and poorly and they could have,
it could have been a perfect

1324
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:28,680
relationship,
but you ruined it.

1325
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,830
I killed it.
Yeah.

1326
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,540
So you come down and then another eight
hours of detention.

1327
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,100
Yeah.
And what do they do to you?

1328
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,220
Handcuffed us to a chair.
We just sat in the middle of the,

1329
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:42,330
of this police station.
There's like sales behind us with people

1330
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:47,331
going crazy and like people bleeding
from the eyeballs and we just sat there

1331
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,000
like people bleeding from the rivals,
from other crimes,

1332
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,430
nighttime fights and stuff like that and
just drunk people.

1333
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:58,110
And we just sat there for ages and then
we finally got taken into separate rooms

1334
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,240
where we were questioned by some high
up,

1335
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,780
I had a woman,
he had a dude and we were both

1336
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:07,740
questioned for a couple hours and then
we were back out handcuffed to the

1337
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:10,440
chairs again.
And then they took all of our stuff and

1338
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,140
they searched it and I was like,
well,

1339
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,880
if they find it,
they're going to be like,

1340
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,890
okay,
you just told us that you feel nothing.

1341
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,320
And we've just found hours and hours of
footage,

1342
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,440
like what's the deal?
So I was like,

1343
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,590
oh please.
Cods.

1344
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,130
Yeah.
And then,

1345
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:27,510
um,
they finally brought the,

1346
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,460
brought the bags back.
Like it must've been an hour.

1347
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:32,280
They had them full and I thought they
were going to go through everything,

1348
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:34,800
but they brought it back.
I checked it and I was like,

1349
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,930
[inaudible] the gods are still here.
Then we just like,

1350
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,690
we just lost it.
We were so happy.

1351
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:41,210
But the,
the policemen,

1352
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,330
I had no idea what we were doing.
So did they kick you out of the country?

1353
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,641
No.
Record.

1354
00:55:46,641 --> 00:55:49,680
And I said nothing at all.
So I had to go back to that room.

1355
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:54,690
I had to sign an agreement that said,
I promise I will not climb the Eiffel

1356
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,670
Tower for three years.
For three years.

1357
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,720
That's it.
That was it.

1358
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,800
Yeah.
Wait a bad them.

1359
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:00,930
Right.
How come they only give you,

1360
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,730
how can we,
I'll take forever.

1361
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,840
They must like it.
Yeah.

1362
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,440
You know what?
Interviewing me,

1363
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,930
he loved it.
She did.

1364
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,480
She was like,
you really shouldn't be doing this,

1365
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:15,180
but how did you do this?
It's incredible.

1366
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,940
Like she loved it.
Why Oak?

1367
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,760
He loved it.
Yeah.

1368
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,410
Well,
I think once they realize that you're

1369
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:20,730
polite,
you're a gentlemen,

1370
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:23,120
you're a very nice guy.
You're just a thrill seeker.

1371
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:23,640
They're like,
okay,

1372
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,570
this is not a threat to society.
Yeah.

1373
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,470
Sky's in a terrorist.
Yeah.

1374
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,580
So the second question she asked me was,
did you leave a bomb up there?

1375
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,230
Oh God.
And I just laughed.

1376
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,064
I was like,
what?

1377
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,930
Come on.
Oh Wow.

1378
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,520
Well,
that's something they have to take any

1379
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,080
consideration.
They have to actually trust you.

1380
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:40,300
Right?
If they let you go and turns out you did

1381
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:43,060
leave a bottom up down [inaudible] then
they have to like,

1382
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,950
they would have to comb over the
building with a fine tooth comb and you

1383
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:47,500
just say he's going to be like,
yeah,

1384
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,930
you know what I did?
I left the bulb up there.

1385
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,210
No,
no one would write.

1386
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,730
So they really have to trust you.
Yeah.

1387
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,560
Fucking Europeans.
Ridiculous,

1388
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,470
ridiculous people.
Three years.

1389
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,480
Fuck you.
You throw me in jail forever.

1390
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,940
His America,
they put you right in Guantanamo Bay.

1391
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,030
They throw dogs in there with you.
Cool.

1392
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,150
It just seems like um,
they're a little bit looser over there.

1393
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,000
A little more relaxed about things.
Yeah.

1394
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:20,820
I was under,
I was driving from La to San Fran a

1395
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,240
couple of weeks ago up the one is it the
one amazing drive and I find like a

1396
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,450
couple of cranes.
I went and saw like some elephants,

1397
00:57:27,451 --> 00:57:31,960
the elephant seals and then shortly
after that I just found like a building

1398
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:33,340
site on the site,
like near the beach,

1399
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,290
like a hundred meters back from the
beach.

1400
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,700
I was like,
of course I need to stop.

1401
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,470
And just do this because it's dead.
It was,

1402
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:39,670
um,
what we can,

1403
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:41,800
was it a holiday weekend?
Right.

1404
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,550
So I did it and I stopped and I climbed
it and then I'm at the top and I looked

1405
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:48,100
down.
So I had like a rental Mustang and I

1406
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:51,010
popped the Mustang in the site,
like on the top of this peak,

1407
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:53,620
it looked really cool,
but you could see it from the road.

1408
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,450
So a cop,
cops driving past,

1409
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,590
he sees the Mustang.
He was like,

1410
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:59,260
what's going on?
So he pulls in and he's walking around

1411
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,260
looking,
and then you looked up and he sees me at

1412
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:06,040
the top of this crane and he's like,
you get your ass down here right now.

1413
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,210
And I was like,
fuck,

1414
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,780
this is the first time I got caught in
the U S I was like,

1415
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:10,840
shit,
what's going to happen?

1416
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,790
Well,
you in California,

1417
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:14,410
it's better than getting caught in like
Arizona.

1418
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1419
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,890
This is Texas.
The shoot.

1420
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:19,060
You just shoot me.
Yeah.

1421
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,410
Okay.
I'll bear that in mind.

1422
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,850
That's what I'm scared of.
That's what I'm scared of him when the

1423
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:25,481
UK,
what?

1424
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,260
We know that the cops over here to be
like this,

1425
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:29,500
they just shoot people.
That's like what we're told,

1426
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:31,660
you know,
that's what they feed us.

1427
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,800
You're white.
You gonna be okay.

1428
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,000
Um,
so the guy gets you down the woods.

1429
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,220
She was telling me,
get out of there.

1430
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,001
He shouts at me.
Yeah,

1431
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,960
I've got this all on video as well.
He shouts at me,

1432
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:44,800
I come down and then he just lays into
me.

1433
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,530
Yeah.
Asking me from England,

1434
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,030
you don't know any better.
Exactly.

1435
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:49,540
Yeah.
It was like,

1436
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,810
oh,
in England it's nicely.

1437
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,650
Well,
you're not an,

1438
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,940
you're in the United States of America,
boy,

1439
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,900
and you need to do what you should do.
So yeah.

1440
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,060
So he doesn't want to fill out the
paperwork.

1441
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,670
It took my driver's license.
He checked all my stuff and then he,

1442
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,491
he was like,
okay.

1443
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:08,170
He came back after like 10 minutes.
He was like,

1444
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,570
okay.
So I made a decision and I'm going to

1445
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:13,120
leave this in the hands of the site
manager.

1446
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,640
So he goes and he tries to find a site
manager,

1447
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:16,600
but it's a holiday weekend.

1448
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,760
Nobody's there.
So he goes to the office,

1449
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:22,700
he phones up some number on the,
on the door and he speaks to the site

1450
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:26,390
manager and the site managers just got
back to La from,

1451
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,120
from where he's working.
And he was like,

1452
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,410
you know what?
I've just got back home.

1453
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:33,010
I cannot be bothered to deal with this.
So just,

1454
00:59:33,011 --> 00:59:35,330
just let him go and then we just go.
And that was it.

1455
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,330
What is the worst you've ever gotten in
trouble?

1456
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,920
Uh,
there's nothing,

1457
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:43,940
you know,
nothing.

1458
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,820
There's nothing like bad.
Are you worried now though there with

1459
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:50,000
your Internet fame that now you're
getting millions of hits in these videos

1460
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,490
that people are gonna,
they're gonna recognize you and maybe

1461
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:56,180
even like a target you yeah.
Set an example.

1462
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,490
Yeah.
I don't know.

1463
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,200
I've thought about it,
but it doesn't seem to happen.

1464
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,800
Happen.
It seems to be getting easier because

1465
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:06,150
that all shit Yo,
this guy like can I take a picture of

1466
01:00:06,151 --> 01:00:06,270
that?

1467
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,010
That's just how it works.
Do you worry that you're encouraging

1468
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:13,580
people that are not as competent or
thoughtful as you?

1469
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,050
Um,
I'm worried that somebody that is a bit

1470
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:19,940
silly,
you might see it and think,

1471
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:20,920
oh,
I need to do this to,

1472
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,480
to be cool or to look cool in front of
my mates.

1473
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,830
Like young kids.
Right?

1474
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,330
The allegory about that.
Yeah,

1475
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,860
but there's not much I can do.
Like there's,

1476
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,690
there's so many more things out there
that are so easily available on the

1477
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:35,720
Internet that kids could watch and be
inspired by.

1478
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,660
And like I'd just,
I always make it clear that what I'm

1479
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:40,220
doing is just,
well,

1480
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:44,030
I want people to get from this is like
I'm just going out exploring the world,

1481
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:47,990
live in my life in a way that I enjoy
doing things that make me happy,

1482
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,090
pushing myself,
developing myself,

1483
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:51,980
becoming a better person,
a stronger person.

1484
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,880
And that's it.
And climbing and jumping around.

1485
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,020
It's just my way of doing it.
Like we all have our own little

1486
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:57,854
passions,
right?

1487
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,740
That's just mine.
Yours might be badminton or like

1488
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,190
something Ping Pong.
That's another thing that's interesting

1489
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:09,191
that's happening now with the larger
number of content providers,

1490
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,180
like so many people like yourself that
are doing things like this.

1491
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:14,960
The idea that one person is responsible
for their influence becomes less and

1492
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:17,600
less plausible.
It just comes more like,

1493
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:18,920
well,
what is he representing?

1494
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:20,840
Well,
he's representing a 26 year old guy who

1495
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:23,000
absolutely knows how to do that.
You know?

1496
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:25,550
It's not,
you don't have to do what he's doing,

1497
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:29,060
but he can do what he's doing.
So are you supposed to stop doing what

1498
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,960
you're doing?
Which you obviously very case actually,

1499
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:35,720
because you're not a good example with,
they're the perfect example of someone

1500
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:36,680
doing it correctly.

1501
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:37,700
Yeah,
exactly.

1502
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,430
But that people just don't just don't
get that well.

1503
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,830
The idea that you're influencing people
is always,

1504
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,410
it's always very tricky because we'll
please supposed to do,

1505
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:48,680
he's supposed to live your life in a
cushion room so no one gets injured

1506
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,620
because that's the only way to influence
people positively.

1507
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,360
You know?
In terms of like if you're going to do

1508
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:57,650
risky things,
you could always be an example or be an

1509
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,020
inspiration to someone who's not as
competent as you.

1510
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:00,741
Yeah.
I'm naked.

1511
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:01,790
Risk,
death or injury.

1512
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,500
Yeah.
I don't think,

1513
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:08,060
honestly I don't think anybody is stupid
enough to see it go out and try it.

1514
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,520
Like most people on Earth.
Right.

1515
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,280
Can put them up a crane and they'll shit
themselves.

1516
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:15,350
Yeah.
I didn't think any 12 year old,

1517
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:17,270
14 year old kid is going to say it and
be like,

1518
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,550
oh dude to the,
to the climate.

1519
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,351
Right.
And off it.

1520
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:20,730
I just don't see that happening.
Oh,

1521
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:22,770
they're definitely gonna do it.
I disagree.

1522
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,600
There's going to be a bunch of them.
Yeah.

1523
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,730
There's a lot of crazy fucks out there.
Just like you pal.

1524
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,253
Yeah.

1525
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:31,860
It's be on me.
Like I can't,

1526
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,680
Russians have been doing it longer than
I have flat.

1527
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,550
Did they start this stuff?
Yeah.

1528
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,753
As far as I know.
Yeah.

1529
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,840
He went up there with big ass heavy
cameras and stuff.

1530
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:43,710
I saw was Russians big ass fucking boom
box cameras.

1531
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,700
Yeah.
I wonder who the first guy was to climb

1532
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:51,200
up on top of some beam.
Cause I saw one where there was a a

1533
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:55,140
steel girder that it was extended out
into the forest by rusty,

1534
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:55,530
right?
Yeah.

1535
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,950
And it's trees everywhere.
Asked for the first one I saw it was,

1536
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,580
it might've been the first one.
Yeah.

1537
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,430
That one's doing push ups and all that.
Yes.

1538
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,990
That fuck yeah.
Russia.

1539
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:06,840
That's right.
I want to go.

1540
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,760
Then I really want to go there because
it's still there.

1541
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,740
Oh No,
don't do it.

1542
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,900
And he's not that picture where he's
like,

1543
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:13,990
this is epic.

1544
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,413
Yeah,
here it is.

1545
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,860
Do you these hanging upside down and
he's extending his lens.

1546
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:24,861
This guy's out of his fucking mind.
He's doing like flips and he's doing

1547
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:28,140
chin ups and he's letting go of his
hands.

1548
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,970
He's doing chin ups and he gets to the
top.

1549
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:32,130
He lets go of his hands and he's doing
several of them.

1550
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:37,130
He's doing one leg with one leg crossed
over the other one kind of winded.

1551
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,740
Oh my God.
They're balancing on their hands over

1552
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:44,940
these beans.
That's the one fucking Jesus Christ.

1553
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,070
This is driving me nuts.
But you see like there's a bunch of

1554
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:49,780
videos of dudes in this place.
I know.

1555
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:51,390
Well how many people have died from this
place?

1556
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,850
It must be a few.
Oh my God.

1557
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:59,120
Look at this guy gripping.
Ooh,

1558
01:03:59,121 --> 01:04:03,320
this is so scary.
Good Lord.

1559
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:04,780
This is so sad,

1560
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,070
Gary.
As a watch.

1561
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,400
This video isn't that old.
Do you think this may be started once

1562
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:10,330
the,
sorry,

1563
01:04:10,331 --> 01:04:12,850
once cameras became the portable enough
to get up there,

1564
01:04:12,851 --> 01:04:15,090
like the small little flip cams and
blogging cam.

1565
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,330
Yeah.
Maybe it wasn't,

1566
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,680
you weren't capable of taking a big ass
vcr camera like you got a drone in one

1567
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:22,870
of yours.
I saw them and drones are being able to

1568
01:04:22,871 --> 01:04:24,820
do live video now.
Look at my hands.

1569
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:25,810
He could,
I could.

1570
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:28,350
I could like ring the out in a glass

1571
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,410
right now.
I'm watching this video and I'm freaking

1572
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:33,390
out and these guys are doing it and
they're laughing.

1573
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,970
You know,
they're so high up.

1574
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,950
Look at that forest below them.
Yeah,

1575
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,160
I think,
I think you're right that people have

1576
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:42,600
always probably done this.

1577
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:43,823
Yeah.

1578
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,260
Amazing feats of athleticism too.
If you look at this guy bouncing in his

1579
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:48,560
hands,
his feet up boxes,

1580
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,030
full plank hanging off.
Look at this guy.

1581
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:54,850
I mean that is,
that's some serious fucking strength.

1582
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:56,920
Yeah.

1583
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,690
I mean it's just,
it's such a crazy endeavor.

1584
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,410
Where are you doing some of this before
you could film it like before you even

1585
01:05:05,411 --> 01:05:08,170
had a camera.
So it's not just about showing people.

1586
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:10,510
Okay.
Do you know anybody who's fallen and

1587
01:05:10,511 --> 01:05:11,290
died?

1588
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:14,410
Um,
no.

1589
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,420
None personally.
You know,

1590
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:17,620
there was a,
it was a park old guy that fell off a

1591
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,880
rooftop.
He was doing a back.

1592
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,800
Some are still on the edge of a rooftop
from you,

1593
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:24,370
like a wool like this,
which is like an easy thing to do,

1594
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,360
but something must've got to him and he
fell off and he died.

1595
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah.
16 stories,

1596
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:31,840
I think.
Woo.

1597
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,560
This is recent.
Couple of years ago,

1598
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,640
I think.
Where do you fall?

1599
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,250
What place?
Uh,

1600
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,990
I think it was Russia.
That's pretty sure it was rush.

1601
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,130
You Google it,
you'll find it.

1602
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:45,070
So it's surprisingly few deaths.
Yeah.

1603
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,170
That we know about the,
a publicized,

1604
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,790
I don't see that many.

1605
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:52,970
Yeah.
Which is good.

1606
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,870
I guess.
Yeah,

1607
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,390
for sure.
So you're planning a lot of leads me to

1608
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:59,990
believe that people aren't stupid enough
to go out and mess up.

1609
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,470
Well,
it's such a scary thing to do that it

1610
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:05,990
just takes a very small percentage of
people.

1611
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,010
Yeah.
And,

1612
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,320
and it grabs a hold of them and says,
you got to do this too.

1613
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,750
Yeah.
There's a video that's actually on

1614
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,820
youtube that probably shouldn't be on
youtube.

1615
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:19,450
Have somebody fill me from the ground up
at a crane and a guy like walks across

1616
01:06:19,731 --> 01:06:22,520
the top beam of the crane and falls and
you'd just see his body just,

1617
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,550
Oh God.
Yeah.

1618
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:26,360
It's disappears behind some of the
building.

1619
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,640
Well,
I think as long as it doesn't hit the

1620
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:30,260
bottom,
they'll that you show it.

1621
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,260
Yeah.
And then we have rules like that.

1622
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,590
Like you'd know the guy had died.
Yeah.

1623
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,583
Which you can't see it.

1624
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,613
Yeah.

1625
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,730
Strange.
So 10 more years of this.

1626
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,640
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1627
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:45,710
You're not thinking about the future.
You're just a wild man.

1628
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,910
I was just the wild man.
Yeah.

1629
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,560
Living on the edge.
Yeah.

1630
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:51,210
Just see what it's all like.
Yeah.

1631
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:54,860
Wow.
It's like pointing to thinking that far

1632
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:55,220
ahead.
You know,

1633
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,900
I could die tomorrow,
we could all die tomorrow.

1634
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:59,330
It could all get hit by a bus or we
could live and then you go,

1635
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:00,890
fuck,
why didn't I think about tomorrow?

1636
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,730
Yeah.
It's not a bad idea.

1637
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,300
A plan,
assuming you will live.

1638
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,290
Police released horrell video of school
by falling a hundred feet to his death

1639
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,680
as warning to daredevils.
Police in Russia.

1640
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,050
I've released the horrifying video at
Russia.

1641
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,730
Yeah,
we don't need to see this Jamie.

1642
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,160
This kid is going to fall and I'm going
to freak out even farther.

1643
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,750
Like I've seen this.
Yeah.

1644
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:25,480
What other interests do you have to
train side's doing this kind of crazy

1645
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:29,200
shit I do or not?
No other sports really.

1646
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:31,720
I just love filmmaking.
I just love making videos.

1647
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,610
I love filming stuff.
I love taking pictures.

1648
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:36,970
I love creating these little films and
it's like both of my passions just work

1649
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:38,930
hand in hand.
I've got the Parker and the climbing

1650
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:43,931
stuff and I've got the filmmaking.
Do you ever film stuff that's not scary

1651
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:47,770
and Dario and stuff and do people need
to do more of that?

1652
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,690
Do People respond to that?
Yeah,

1653
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,900
I um,
so I put out a video a couple of months

1654
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,930
ago of my new car,
like at my new car video.

1655
01:07:54,931 --> 01:07:56,590
So it's basically like a car review.
Right.

1656
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,330
And people love it.
Oh,

1657
01:07:58,331 --> 01:07:59,380
I think I might've seen that.

1658
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,510
Do you have an m three and four for a
new one?

1659
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,800
Yeah.
I think I did see that.

1660
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:05,290
People like it.
It's like 200 normal guys.

1661
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1662
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,600
It's a great car.
It's an amazing Chi.

1663
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:13,840
And you got that car from money that you
made from risking your life?

1664
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,070
Yeah.
Wow.

1665
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,570
Yeah.
From like Youtube ads and stuff.

1666
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:18,710
Is that what it is?
Cheated money.

1667
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:20,150
Sponsorships,
everything.

1668
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:23,030
There's a beautiful car.
They're so well engineered.

1669
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,290
Yeah.
Look at it,

1670
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,230
man.
It's a piece of law.

1671
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,350
It is.
I had an m three.

1672
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:28,460
The last one.
Yeah.

1673
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,690
I had the old one.
The Old v eight.

1674
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1675
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:32,870
This is interesting that the v six
turbo,

1676
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:33,860
right?
You like it

1677
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:39,230
like it's a completely different sound.
But I like it.

1678
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:43,220
I used to have like a turbo charged car
before the va m three and I missed all

1679
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:45,740
the,
the little hisses and the wobbles and I

1680
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:47,120
missed it,
so now I've got it back.

1681
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,720
That's stuff much faster.
A lot of people like the roar of the v

1682
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:53,360
eight yeah,
it's the big complaint about the m three

1683
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,690
m four rather.
He doesn't have that roar and it

1684
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:57,740
doesn't,
it's completely different,

1685
01:08:57,741 --> 01:08:59,240
but I wouldn't,
I wouldn't compare them.

1686
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:00,620
I wouldn't say all the m three is
better.

1687
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:02,090
It's just a different,
it's a different breed,

1688
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:02,840
you know?
It's like,

1689
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,310
well we're getting used to cars that you
make.

1690
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,030
Those electric cars are becoming more
and more prevalent.

1691
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,250
I saw that the Tesla numbers the other
day,

1692
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:12,410
Jamie,
it's 2.5 seconds,

1693
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,810
so let,
it's so less than three it's 2.5 they

1694
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,530
like the model x,
like the big one as well as the other.

1695
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:20,360
Really.
I think the big ones a little silly.

1696
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:23,060
It's sub three I'm just say this week
too.

1697
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:26,450
I wonder if they updated the speed,
like the software update,

1698
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,440
like a foam or update at speed to your
car.

1699
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,590
Yeah,
it's nuts.

1700
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,360
It's crazy.
Elon Musk,

1701
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:33,050
man,
he's,

1702
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,090
he's killing it.
He's on the spectrum for sure.

1703
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,910
Right.
Gotta be super wizard.

1704
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,320
Yeah.
He's an alien.

1705
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,850
He's probably,
yeah.

1706
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:42,320
This,
uh,

1707
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,870
those people,
those like people that pushed things

1708
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:47,450
like that.
What does this zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds

1709
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:52,250
has 315 miles of range.
Not if you'd go that fast.

1710
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:59,150
It's 289 miles.
What does that stop lying?

1711
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,410
What does it say?
Is it a different one

1712
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,370
and model two?
They make that sweet one,

1713
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,380
that little tiny one.
Do they still,

1714
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,900
there's Tesla's still make that little
sports car one.

1715
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,913
Nah,
they don't,

1716
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,960
they,
they released them in limited numbers.

1717
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:18,010
The little tiny one.
The little little lotus look at him.

1718
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:18,761
Yeah.
Yeah.

1719
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:22,490
That Lotus looking one was beautiful
that first wasn't it?

1720
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,850
Yeah.
But it is on skinny tires and apparently

1721
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:28,640
the weights all fucked up.
It's like Porsche nine 11,

1722
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,560
but way to the extreme cause all the
weights in the back.

1723
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:31,670
Yeah.
Just like a Porsche,

1724
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:33,080
but way more weight.
Yeah.

1725
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,960
So it's like if you go around a corner
and the asset and kicks out on you,

1726
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:38,420
you just won't know.
Or if you're going around a corner and

1727
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:40,850
you're hitting the gas and you let off
the gas,

1728
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,900
you know,
you get that,

1729
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,490
that tail end Sorta pendulums out on
you.

1730
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:50,060
But the beauty cause man to you cause it
fun.

1731
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:50,894
Yeah,
me too.

1732
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,650
I'm a big fan.
Big Fan of engineering drive.

1733
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,480
Um,
my favorite car,

1734
01:10:56,481 --> 01:11:01,100
I have a Porsche nine 11 gt three r s
dude.

1735
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,420
Yeah.
I have an older one,

1736
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:04,280
a 2007 when there were still manually.
Yeah.

1737
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:08,060
They don't make manuals anymore.
Now they're all up those paddle shifts,

1738
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,910
which is a,
they're really fun but it's just not as

1739
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:11,651
fun.
Yeah,

1740
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:12,920
it's different.
Yeah.

1741
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:16,320
I'm a big fan of a clutch.
Not just one thing I like about the m

1742
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:18,930
four.
It's one of the few high end sports cars

1743
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:22,650
where you could still get it,
that clutch all the American cars do it.

1744
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:23,850
Like corvettes.
Yeah.

1745
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:26,550
You still get with a clutch,
but like a Porsche Porsche's,

1746
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:30,960
the Gt three and the gt three Rs.
Now you gotta get automatic Ferrari only

1747
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:32,400
automatic.
Yeah,

1748
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,473
that's my car.

1749
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,100
That was before I took the painting off
the,

1750
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,220
the wheels are off the side,
the gt three Rs logo.

1751
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:43,230
I'm like,
that's a little school boy racer.

1752
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,630
Now it's just white.
But those are uh,

1753
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,620
what I like about those cars is not even
really growing that fast as the

1754
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:51,870
connection.
Like when you're going around corners,

1755
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:54,420
it literally is like a ride.
It feels like a Disneyland ride cause

1756
01:11:54,421 --> 01:11:55,560
it's so hard.
Yeah.

1757
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,430
And it's also the engineering,
like you can appreciate the amount of

1758
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,200
thought and trial and error in
calculation that's involved and creating

1759
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,900
something that's so capable.
You know,

1760
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:08,430
when you drive a regular car,
you know,

1761
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:10,230
it's just a car.
You drive and around and you drive one

1762
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:11,730
of those things around and you're on a
ride,

1763
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,290
you know?
Yeah.

1764
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,990
So Siphon,
yeah,

1765
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,370
me too.
I'm a big fan.

1766
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,660
So do you,
this is like all your life.

1767
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:26,810
You just enjoy making videos,
taking photos and doing these crazy

1768
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:32,031
stunts and filming them and he just
living day by day and keep on keeping on

1769
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,190
living the dream.
Yeah,

1770
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:36,210
you are.
And a lot of ways,

1771
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:38,280
man.
I mean there's a lot of kids that are

1772
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:39,150
going,
wait a minute,

1773
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,740
you could just do chin ups on a crane.
You can get a fucking BMW.

1774
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,310
Yeah.
You'd be surprised how many people are

1775
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:49,110
like,
you don't deserve this.

1776
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,130
Oh fuck those people.
Because you're risking your goddamn.

1777
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,860
What you do is what you do is climb
ladders and listen.

1778
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:57,500
People watch the videos.
Jealousy.

1779
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,300
Does this tell us you're always going to
have that?

1780
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,530
Yeah.
Here's going to have haters.

1781
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,290
Do they motivate you?
Nah,

1782
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:06,240
that just let me laugh.
Haters do.

1783
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:08,520
Yeah.
Do you have a place that you want to go?

1784
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,300
Hong Kong.
Oh Chinese don't fuck around dog,

1785
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,300
but she looked at some videos from Hong
Kong.

1786
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,580
Man,
it's the place to be,

1787
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:20,460
but if you get caught over there they
might throw you in a hole.

1788
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,590
I don't know.
I don't know.

1789
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:27,591
I think a few people who have been
banned from Hong Kong for like some

1790
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,240
years or forever.
I've not,

1791
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,110
I've not heard anything bad.
I think I would imagined that anytime

1792
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,340
you get arrested in a foreign country,
he was this Hong Kong.

1793
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,870
Oh High Rise Hong Kong.
It's guys walking around with a selfie

1794
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:42,510
stick sponsors.
Oh my God.

1795
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:45,600
He's shown his sponsors.
Who the fuck would have been at backup.

1796
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,000
Backup is sponsors.
Yeah.

1797
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,980
Backup.
Click pause.

1798
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,800
What is this?
Jet Flight search engine.

1799
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,530
Jet Radar flight search engine.
Hotel.

1800
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,210
Look.
Hotel search engine.

1801
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:00,930
So what's that was her sponsors.
What's happened here is he's been like,

1802
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,420
okay,
I need to get to Hong Kong but I have

1803
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,170
money.
I need to get a hotel in Hong Kong by

1804
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:05,880
die of money.

1805
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,230
I'm going to contact a flight company
and a hotel company and see if I can get

1806
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:14,830
them to give me both for video.
But how insane are those companies that

1807
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,180
they like?
What are you going to do some illegal

1808
01:14:16,181 --> 01:14:17,320
shit in China?
Yeah,

1809
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:18,340
man.
Yeah man.

1810
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:19,630
Put My name up there.
I want to,

1811
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:24,010
I want people to know 1 million,
100,359 views.

1812
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,420
That's why I like fuck it.
Have a lot of those people are going to

1813
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,250
use our service.
A couple of those buildings I guess if

1814
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:32,980
the guy lived,
it's not negative,

1815
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:33,900
right?
Yeah.

1816
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,010
If you made it through.
Yeah,

1817
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:37,150
exactly.
It's like,

1818
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,170
yeah,
that's the deal.

1819
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:42,430
If you uh Oh my God,
this is so bananas gloves.

1820
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,910
Oh He's got clubs on you.
You think he's a pussy for wearing

1821
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,150
gloves.
I mean,

1822
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,800
but that's like,
that's like a pole background,

1823
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,890
but the idea is to not have to rely on
anything.

1824
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:57,490
Like you build your hands up so that you
can do shit like this and not have to

1825
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:00,060
worry about cutting your finger.
Now when you were doing park horse

1826
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:02,080
stuff,
we do in like back flips off buildings

1827
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,240
and stuff.
Have you ever seen that video where this

1828
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:07,240
kid in the ghetto,
he's on a second floor roof and he does

1829
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:09,730
a back flip and lands on the ground?
Yeah,

1830
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:10,610
probably.
It's,

1831
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,120
I've seen some seriously high.
One fucking crazy.

1832
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:15,850
Like,
how does a guy live from that far away?

1833
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,160
You did.
You just learn how to land.

1834
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,700
How does he learn how to land land in
landing away,

1835
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:23,380
right?
Your legs take as much of the impact as

1836
01:15:23,381 --> 01:15:26,530
they physically can.
And then you smash your bum until the

1837
01:15:26,531 --> 01:15:27,910
ground and then you just do it
backwards.

1838
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:28,690
Roll.
That's it.

1839
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,520
Watch this guy.
And if you bumped back,

1840
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:35,890
flip off the 40 foot roof.
I think this smashes his head.

1841
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,290
Yeah,
for sure.

1842
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,300
But what's crazy is he actually did
this.

1843
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:43,300
He did a back flip.
Like somebody gave him something like a

1844
01:15:43,301 --> 01:15:44,890
dollar or something crazy,
right?

1845
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:48,370
Wasn't it like 20 bucks or something
ridiculous with this dude?

1846
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,510
Like he's standing there.

1847
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,480
Okay.

1848
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,680
And this is no one had to
please don't hurt yourself.

1849
01:15:55,681 --> 01:16:00,681
Please look at this.
I'm going gonna say a prayer.

1850
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,800
You hear that?
I'm ready.

1851
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,610
I don't even want to look at that.
What?

1852
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:08,120
You're not going to turn away either
though,

1853
01:16:08,121 --> 01:16:11,900
are you?
You want to be there.

1854
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:14,390
So this guy is standing there with his
back.

1855
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,670
He's building height right now.
Here it goes.

1856
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,050
Smash.
And he made it.

1857
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,600
I'm good bro.
I'm good.

1858
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,480
Holy Shit.
He's got strong bones would be snapped.

1859
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,740
Yeah,
that is.

1860
01:16:37,741 --> 01:16:39,650
And that was a hard surface he fell
onto.

1861
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,490
Yeah.
You would just think that if someone

1862
01:16:41,491 --> 01:16:42,690
just jumped,
like,

1863
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:46,410
is the flip helping at all?
Does how's that?

1864
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,440
Just because of the momentum is it's
going this way instead of just going to

1865
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,790
slam straight down.

1866
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,290
I think it makes sense some of that into
that,

1867
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:55,250
which is like,
you know,

1868
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:58,070
when you see people jumping massive roof
gaps and they laugh and they roll,

1869
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:02,390
that's converting all this downwards
momentum into a forward and to Ford.

1870
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:04,490
And that,
that means you can jump a lot further

1871
01:17:04,491 --> 01:17:05,360
than you think.
Oh,

1872
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:06,590
that's interesting.
So,

1873
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,080
but how do you,
if you have to drop straight,

1874
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,180
what do you do?
A,

1875
01:17:11,181 --> 01:17:14,060
you lied and you just slam your hands
until the ground as well.

1876
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:16,130
Spread out.
The impact is as best you can.

1877
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,290
Yeah.
It rolls are any good,

1878
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,730
really a feel going forward.
Quite a lot.

1879
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:22,880
So running.
So if you had to jump off of that 40

1880
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:24,830
foot high wall,
that guy was on,

1881
01:17:24,831 --> 01:17:26,070
how would you jump?
Uh,

1882
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,770
I'd probably hang off the edge and just
straight drop.

1883
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,870
Um,
yeah.

1884
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:32,270
It's not one that,
that's not that high at the fuck.

1885
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:36,590
Are you saying you don't think you'd
have a problem making that jump?

1886
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,270
No.
Really?

1887
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,790
Yeah,
I've done big drops.

1888
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,170
It helps.
I'm big as well.

1889
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:45,080
So does it,
but makes it your heavy too,

1890
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:46,130
right?
Yeah,

1891
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:47,430
but I,
my legs a lot.

1892
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:48,620
I've got good legs,
man.

1893
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,640
My legs like my strongest thing.
Do you exercise or do you just do a lot

1894
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:54,590
of that?
Just the exercise comes from doing it

1895
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:56,870
and that's it.
And how often do you do it now?

1896
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:58,400
Not so much.
I used to do a lot,

1897
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:01,400
like I used to go out every day and
train all day and just repeat jumps and

1898
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,770
everything.
Now it's kind of like bill in me,

1899
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,600
but it doesn't have,
it's not a problem.

1900
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:08,750
Like as the more famous you get,
the more obligations you get,

1901
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:12,500
the less time you have to practice and
the more people expect of you do crazier

1902
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:13,334
shit.

1903
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,301
It's a problem.
Yeah.

1904
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:16,340
But fuck,
yeah,

1905
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,860
don't die dude.
You seem like a nice guy.

1906
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,540
No it die.
Please don't.

1907
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,520
That'd be,
it'd be a wonderful story if you made it

1908
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:23,400
through this thing.
Yeah,

1909
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,180
no problems at all.
And you know,

1910
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,080
people be like,
look,

1911
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,910
you just,
the only thing you have to fear is fear

1912
01:18:28,911 --> 01:18:30,860
itself.
Yeah.

1913
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,140
That's true.
Anything else to add to the people

1914
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:34,910
before we get the fuck out of here?
No,

1915
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:36,560
not really.
Thanks for watching.

1916
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,930
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for having me on please.

1917
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:40,070
My boss room.
We made it happen.

1918
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,530
I'm glad we did and I'm glad.
I'm glad I got to meet you.

1919
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,750
They're normal guys.
It's you.

1920
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:48,920
I looked in your eyes.
He looked totally normal looking in your

1921
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:50,570
eyes.
There's nothing crazy going on in there.

1922
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:51,740
Right?
You would just assume,

1923
01:18:51,741 --> 01:18:53,420
I mean,
you look at some of these Russians and

1924
01:18:53,421 --> 01:18:58,360
you look in their eyes and you just see
death and learning different for an

1925
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,450
yeah.
Yeah.

1926
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:02,690
Whoa.
So they're the kings of this shit that I

1927
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:04,460
guess.
Yeah man,

1928
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:10,960
it's a weird thing to do.
It's a weird thing to do.

1929
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:14,140
What do you have planned a that people
can look forward to?

1930
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,560
Um,
I've got quite a lot going on at city.

1931
01:19:17,561 --> 01:19:19,930
I've got some,
a couple of huge videos to release from

1932
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:22,900
Dubai.
I'm doing something here next week.

1933
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,570
Involving your helicopter in America.

What part of America should we say at a

1935
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:30,490
Oh,

1936
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:32,390
The people know about it.

1937
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,090

People just saying helicopter,

1938
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,350

the people are going to get mad at me

1942
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,550
