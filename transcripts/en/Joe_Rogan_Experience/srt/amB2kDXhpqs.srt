1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,110
What a perfect time to have Lewis from
unbox therapy on when our tri castors

2
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:12,111
taking a big fat shit because we updated
the software and then red band decides

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,720
right before the show he's going to
update his phone and it's going to take

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,721
about 17 fucking hours right in the
middle of someone from the DMV supposed to

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,804
call him.

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,730
And that's never going to happen.

7
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,880
Now I think you guys planned it this way.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,360
You heard I was coming
down and slept less.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,500
Causes many technical difficulties
as possible and then put him on it.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,280
Let's see how much this guy really knows.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,533
Exactly.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,020
Unfortunately the tricaster is a little
outside the realm of my day to day.

13
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:40,854
But um,

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,340
well,

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,810
which Jamie said,

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,021
oh,

17
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,430
we've got to update the software.

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,001
So I go,

19
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,710
okay.

20
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,220
And then I thought that
I don't update shit.

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,990
That's right.

22
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,990
I will wait several versions
before update my phone or you know,

23
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,210
it always annoys me.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,800
Apple's always asking me to update.

25
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,011
Yeah,

26
00:00:59,011 --> 00:00:59,610
no that's,

27
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,320
that's certainly the move,

28
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,720
if especially if it's like
a mission critical thing,

29
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:04,710
like your phone,

30
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,000
your,

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
your main device when you're waiting
for a phone call or your try castor for

32
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:10,591
example.

33
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:10,711
Yeah.

34
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,491
This fucking thing.

35
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,090
Jamie.

36
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,230
Jesus Christ boy.

37
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,701
Oh yeah,

38
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:14,911
yeah,

39
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:15,690
yeah.

40
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,430
He was off post.

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,920
We have no video right now.

42
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,210
Well,

43
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,043
it doesn't matter.

44
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,390
The video's not unused stream.

45
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,390
It's not even going live,

46
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,160
so you fucked it twice.

47
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,030
It's double fuck.

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,460
Terrific.

49
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,811
Terrific.

50
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,231
Folks,

51
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:31,540
if you,

52
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,850
if you're doing this right now,

53
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,770
enjoy the blackness.

54
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Yup.

55
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,020
That's what all black lives matter,

56
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,320
including the black lives coming
out of the fucking screens.

57
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,740
How dare you.

58
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,140
Jamie didn't even test this shit out.

59
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,920
How dare you anyway,

60
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:52,320
for everybody looking at
a blank screen right now,

61
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,071
like me,

62
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm looking at the blank screen,

63
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,363
uh,

64
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,340
most of the people unfortunately
for you or audio only anyway,

65
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,263
so.

66
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:00,541
Oh,

67
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,021
that's true.

68
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,330
Yeah.

69
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:01,681
Listen,

70
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:02,514
after the fact.

71
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,110
Unbox therapy though,

72
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,280
100 percent video.

73
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:05,850
Yeah,

74
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,900
very important to me.

75
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,580
So I can get by with audio on its own.

76
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:10,780
Yeah.

77
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,440
We're supposed to be showing this Jamie,

78
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,470
like a periscope.

79
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,370
It no

80
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,240
little side periscope angle.

81
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,563
Um,

82
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,581
well okay.

83
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:21,910
But what are we gonna do about the video?

84
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,940
The video's still recording on here,

85
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,231
right?

86
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,850
But it's not showing a record on here
and we'll be able to put it on youtube.

87
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:34,450
And you think maybe allegedly recording.

88
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,371
Okay.

89
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,204
Allegedly.

90
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,300
Alright.

91
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,340
Nobody hears you talk.

92
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,850
I will.

93
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,170
I will draw the whole episode
just in case the court reporter

94
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,793
trends

95
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,790
school tech.

96
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,290
So what is it you got here,

97
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,133
man?

98
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,300
Virtual realities with this is
fascinating for people who can't see this.

99
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
It's virtual reality.

100
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,500
It's like a goggle set up with a.

101
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,220
on the front of it is a galaxy

102
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,970
s six?

103
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,361
Correct.

104
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,470
So a Samsung galaxy phone
is strapped to this headset.

105
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,320
So the screen is your field of view.

106
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,011
That's right,

107
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,221
yeah.

108
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,300
And there's two lenses there,

109
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,710
so I'll just open it up real quick.

110
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,930
So the phone sits in and clips out.

111
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,200
Obviously you still want to use it as a
regular phone and those are the lenses

112
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,700
that will allow you to focus,

113
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,510
focus in on the display at
an incredibly close range.

114
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,170
Now the nerds out there that they talk
a lot about the resolution of phones and

115
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,580
some say,

116
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,630
oh well there's no need to have a
phone with a display beyond 10 80 p,

117
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,081
let's say,

118
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,490
because at this range here,

119
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,140
you would never notice those pixels,

120
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,560
but the minute you stick them
in an environment like this,

121
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,870
just an inch away from your eyeball,

122
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,770
all of a sudden you can discern those
pixels that you couldn't add phone usage

123
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,604
range.

124
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,160
What happens with people who wear glasses,

125
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,260
your glasses can fit in there.

126
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,860
Okay.

127
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,031
Yeah.

128
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:55,390
You can go with glasses in there.

129
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,720
Um,

130
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,770
there's a focus on the top here
so you can actually focus them in,

131
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,340
you know,

132
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,950
depending on what vision correction,

133
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,150
whatever you have going on.

134
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,290
I've used it with glasses,

135
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,190
contact lenses,

136
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,560
so you can adjust it like
a pair of binoculars.

137
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,453
Exactly.

138
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,980
Yeah.

139
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,150
Be.

140
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,450
Yeah,

141
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:10,931
exactly.

142
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,291
So,

143
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:11,950
um,

144
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,100
the cool thing in this particular case
compared to like some of the other stuff

145
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,690
that I've shown off before,

146
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:20,830
like Google cardboard and the really
inexpensive ones is that since this is

147
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:23,110
designed specifically for this device,

148
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,320
you get a touch interface touchpad for
controlling taps and stuff and this size

149
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,231
here.

150
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:29,740
Yeah.

151
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,780
So that's just like the
bottom of your laptop,

152
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,090
sort of like a leg,

153
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,150
a little little click pad,

154
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,830
track pad kind of situation.

155
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,780
So you have a little bit
of interactivity there.

156
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,380
Um,

157
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,951
other than that,

158
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,300
I mean it,

159
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,470
it,

160
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,270
it sort of,

161
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,850
it sort of does what
it looks like it does.

162
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,540
Um,

163
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,740
do you think we should try it out or what?

164
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:44,921
Yeah,

165
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:45,281
definitely.

166
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:45,810
Okay.

167
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:45,931
It's,

168
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:49,210
it's cool at this stuff was finally coming
to light now because this was always

169
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,080
when we were kids,

170
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,580
we thought this was the future.

171
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,260
I think it's still is.

172
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,501
Oh,

173
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:53,690
it,

174
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,520
it just took a while for the
technology to catch up to,

175
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,870
you know,

176
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,140
what we expected from it.

177
00:04:59,141 --> 00:04:59,830
So I'm going to get it.

178
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm going to get it set up here.

179
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,330
Okay.

180
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:01,960
Let me just,

181
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,800
I got a call from Duncan trussell once
he came back from some conference that

182
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,720
they had on virtual reality and uh,

183
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,930
I'll never forget this because I'll
stand in front of the Improv and he's

184
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:10,360
screaming,

185
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,050
dude,

186
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,580
this is bigger than the fucking wheel.

187
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,380
Bigger than the Internet.

188
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,400
It's bigger than everything,

189
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:15,940
man.

190
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,500
This is a fucking game changer,

191
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:17,831
dude.

192
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,210
It's a fucking game changer.

193
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,040
It's the virtual reality.

194
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,360
It's what the future is.

195
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,220
He had just gotten

196
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,530
back from la checking out
the newest oculus rift.

197
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,550
The one that you were talking about,

198
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,870
the piano demonstration.

199
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,350
Yeah.

200
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,340
So that one.

201
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:30,031
Is the mic here.

202
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:30,271
Sorry,

203
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:31,770
I can't see anything anymore.

204
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,813
Um,

205
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,640
so,

206
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,000
uh,

207
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,600
this one was built sort of
in conjunction with Oculus.

208
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,660
So there is an oculus store and library
app that you boot into when you put the

209
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,380
phone into the,

210
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,250
into the headset.

211
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,230
So a lot of the demos that are available
on Oculus are also available here.

212
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,753
So I'm going to bring up.

213
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,170
I'll bring up that one with the piano
and then I'll let you check that out.

214
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,351
Oh,

215
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,910
you can do it right from that.

216
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,240
Yeah.

217
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,670
So that's as good as oculus rift.

218
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,260
While I wouldn't go that far,

219
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I would say it's more convenient than
oculus rift and probably arguably more of

220
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,340
a game changer in the sense that people
don't have to go out and buy these

221
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,350
standalone expensive headset and
then have a dedicated pc to use it.

222
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,250
Everyone has a phone.

223
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:16,581
Right?

224
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,710
So you're already halfway there.

225
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,050
This fear doesn't have a phone anymore.

226
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,440
Oh,

227
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,273
I heard about that.

228
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,970
I heard about that.

229
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,870
Do you feel about that when
someone fucking completely bales,

230
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,720
since you're such a technical job?

231
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,510
I have,

232
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,343
um,

233
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,700
for folks who don't know where you're
talking about already should fear,

234
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,920
gave up on smartphones,

235
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,970
just uses a flip phone.

236
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,490
I kind of get it because I
feel like I'm so immersed in,

237
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,340
in tech sometimes that I would love
to take a step away for a minute.

238
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,551
Like,

239
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,630
you just booted that phone up.

240
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,030
You said you hadn't booted it in a while.

241
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,670
Texts were coming in and.

242
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah,

243
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,953
exactly.

244
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,863
It's a,

245
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,980
I mean it would be really a
really interesting experiment
to see like how many

246
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,810
times that thing interrupts my day.

247
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,730
Like a smartphone because it's probably,

248
00:06:58,731 --> 00:06:59,151
I don't know,

249
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,120
a thousand times maybe like it's,

250
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,000
it really has,

251
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,010
it really trains you like a,

252
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,891
like a,

253
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,250
a buzz collar on an animal
or something like that.

254
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,031
So anyway,

255
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,320
you want to stick this
on and check it out?

256
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:10,154
Sure.

257
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,250
So it looks cool for people who
would just listen to at home.

258
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,210
It looks like something storm
troopers would wear plastic and uh,

259
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,330
you can strap so you can tighten it.

260
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,430
I don't know if you feel

261
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,170
it's a good look on you.

262
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,900
I think something came off.

263
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,170
Yeah,

264
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,650
it just goes,

265
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,900
it just slips through
note right there yet.

266
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,793
Just like a pair of.

267
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,380
Yeah,

268
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,360
just like a pair of.

269
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,410
Yeah.

270
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,010
Oh I see.

271
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah.

272
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,950
It's like a pair of ski
goggles pretty much.

273
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,920
Now you said this also has bluetooth
so you can hook up like headphones

274
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:41,120
wirelessly also.

275
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,541
Right.

276
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,980
So every capability that the phone
has is still theoretically active,

277
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,180
you know,

278
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,420
so are you focusing in yet?

279
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,810
So try and find the spot where the
text is a text on screen right now.

280
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,280
Touch the touch pad to resume.

281
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,233
There you go.

282
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,130
Are you in that space right now?

283
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,531
That's better.

284
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,790
It's better with sound,

285
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,200
but it's still pretty good.

286
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,610
And if you,

287
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,550
if you kind of watch this guy play the.

288
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,850
See if you can find the dog.

289
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,743
Yeah.

290
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,010
Yeah man.

291
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,343
I

292
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,290
chose people who are just.

293
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,670
They don't know what I'm doing here.

294
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm looking around the room.

295
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,970
At first I'm just looking at this guy
played piano and it's kind of cool.

296
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,800
Although he is a little annoying.

297
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,460
I don't like to waste things.

298
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,390
Do you see the smoke?

299
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,760
Do you see the smoke coming off
his cigarette in the ashtray?

300
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,170
No,

301
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,150
it's beside the piano there.

302
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Yeah,

303
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,300
it's slightly pixelated.

304
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,770
I wouldn't say it's perfect.

305
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,640
Yeah,

306
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,040
it's,

307
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,530
it's not high resolution,

308
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,970
but I heard that the Oculus
version is when you pitch,

309
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,360
it looks at you every now and then.

310
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,050
This is so fucking strange.

311
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,830
I'm looking around this guy studio.

312
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,641
He has this,

313
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:56,821
uh,

314
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:58,350
recording studio here.

315
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,311
I'm just kidding about him.

316
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,150
Annoying me by the way.

317
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,013
I'm just trying to be funny.

318
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,840
And then he puts his phone in his ashtray.

319
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,670
Let's throw in shit on the ground.

320
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,050
I guess he's acting.

321
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,571
He's acting.

322
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:07,820
Yeah.

323
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:07,941
Yeah,

324
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:08,090
yeah,

325
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,340
no,

326
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,151
he knows what he's doing.

327
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,740
He has a three 60 camera there,

328
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,050
but he's got a fake tree in his room
and as you look around his studio,

329
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,780
like everywhere you
look you can see stuff.

330
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,680
This is the real.

331
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,860
What's really a game changer about
this technology is that it's really 360

332
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,250
degrees.

333
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:26,610
Yes.

334
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,450
Like as you,

335
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,651
as you look,

336
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,461
everywhere you look,

337
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:33,630
there's something to look at [inaudible]
and that is fucking strange man.

338
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,590
Yeah.

339
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,390
If they do this with movies,

340
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,910
to watch movies over and
over again because you'll,

341
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,190
you'll be able to look
at it from different.

342
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,471
Okay.

343
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:42,630
Now I see the smoke a cigarette.

344
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,553
There you go.

345
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,320
I have a feeling he
makes really whiny music.

346
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,670
While you're probably right,

347
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,181
to be honest,

348
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,350
I really wasn't listening.

349
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,090
It was more about the visual.

350
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:51,931
Yeah.

351
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,550
I'm kind of glad I can hear him saying.

352
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,590
But uh,

353
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,100
there's another one in there,

354
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,090
another demo,

355
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,320
which is you sitting inside a
movie theater and so you see the,

356
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,720
the,

357
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,040
the,

358
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,040
the seats around you as the trailer
plays on the make believe movie screen,

359
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,660
the colors coming off of it are reflecting
off the seats and it gives you an

360
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:19,020
incredible feeling of the exact
vibe of being inside of a theater.

361
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,070
I have the original oculus left
and that was one of my biggest,

362
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,950
what I say lift that uh,

363
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,470
it was really pixelated.

364
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,020
I get the idea how cool it was.

365
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,261
Now,

366
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,880
is that comparable to that or
is this more many levels better?

367
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,783
Better than that one.

368
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,840
Put it on it's many levels better than
the pixelated one that Duncan had.

369
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,980
Duncan has a series of
one which was like A.

370
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,460
Wow.

371
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,641
Yeah.

372
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,530
I think they were like
vga screens for some.

373
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,970
I might be wrong about that,

374
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:48,804
but yeah,

375
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,370
playing doom.

376
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:50,910
Yeah,

377
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,960
the old school day.

378
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,171
Yeah,

379
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:52,351
yeah,

380
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:52,710
yeah.

381
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,400
But you kind of got a sense
that this was a game changer.

382
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:56,890
Yeah.

383
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,930
Because even though it
was so pixilated like,

384
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,340
well though,

385
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,420
they're going to work that out.

386
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,550
They're going to try and walk around.

387
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,780
This is dangerous right now.

388
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,051
Yeah.

389
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,250
Don't walk into the TV.

390
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,480
Just stand still.

391
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,570
Yeah,

392
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,570
the dog looks cool.

393
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:10,201
Yeah.

394
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,670
Don't talk off mike either.

395
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,110
Ready to touch your dog.

396
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:14,730
Yeah.

397
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,300
It's.

398
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,260
And the thing and you know,

399
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,630
part of the conversation
here is about content too.

400
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,260
It's like,

401
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,501
well,

402
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,370
how does stuff,

403
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,430
how do you go from having a piece of
video and turning it into 360 degree video

404
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:29,970
like he's watching right there
and we're seeing more and more.

405
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,680
Three 60 cameras come out now.

406
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,650
There's a one from Google called jump,

407
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,780
which is this crazy gopro
contraption you may have seen.

408
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:41,030
It's a six or more a Gopro hero fours,

409
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,660
which have an incredible field of view.

410
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,560
And then softwares.

411
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:44,850
What stitches it all together,

412
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,890
which is the experience
you're seeing in there.

413
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,750
So theoretically it's not just a,

414
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,370
um,

415
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,930
games and digital things,

416
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:52,680
but uh,

417
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,230
in the people will shoot video in
three 60 and enjoy it in place.

418
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,001
Yeah,

419
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:58,570
that's what I was saying.

420
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,020
Like they can do that with movies like
and you could see the same movie over and

421
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,780
over again and you'll
decide to go outside.

422
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,880
You'll decide to go on the porch,

423
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,430
you know,

424
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,680
you'll decide there'll be seen.

425
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,340
It's like you go on the porch and the
wife and her sister are going to be

426
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,450
fighting like that.

427
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm fucking leaving him.

428
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,320
I can't take it anymore.

429
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,440
And the guys in the bathroom shooting
heroin will peak in the bathroom.

430
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,300
We're shooting heroin,

431
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:19,720
you know?

432
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:19,941
Yeah.

433
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,500
Like why I chose that scene.

434
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,900
Sounds pretty intense.

435
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,860
But yeah,

436
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,850
let you choose your own adventure type
scenario mysteries where you're like

437
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,760
opening up cupboards to look for like
little pieces of if you like watching it

438
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:34,331
at home.

439
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:37,510
Especially if you can actually move
around like on a unit directional.

440
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,220
If you get one of the unit directional
treadmills that operate based on union

441
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,063
your movement.

442
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,640
Yes.

443
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,140
They're getting better
and better with those.

444
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,131
They used to be.

445
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,450
You got strapped in.

446
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,840
Yeah.

447
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,430
I've tried one.

448
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,700
Kind of hold onto the thing,

449
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,290
but they're getting better.

450
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,760
Yeah.

451
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,700
And now I think they're developing ones
that are detecting which way you're

452
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,020
standing and walking,

453
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,730
so they will move accordingly with you
and then eventually they'll get to a

454
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:04,780
point where it's going
to be indistinguishable
between walking outside and

455
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,591
walking on this unit.

456
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,040
Directional Readville yeah.

457
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,740
As long as everything's flat.

458
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,120
Once you start going uphill
and then rugged terrain,

459
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,380
things are going to be.

460
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,213
That's not going to work.

461
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,450
Kind of adjustment.

462
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,020
Yeah.

463
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,400
Like hiking.

464
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,911
Like you'll,

465
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,010
you're never really going to be like,

466
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,853
you know,

467
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,620
the grounds off a little bit.

468
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,100
Part of the thing though about it is
like I think a lot of people who are into

469
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:31,900
this for consumption are lean
back type situations anyways.

470
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,470
Right?

471
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,340
Like it will be like having an
exercise show on television.

472
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:36,551
I mean,

473
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:40,330
how many people actually participate
compared to just want to sit there like

474
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,390
prevention of those that Denise Austin.

475
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,301
You remember her?

476
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:44,640
Yeah.

477
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:44,910
Yeah.

478
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,560
They used to have all these
like you'd work out along,

479
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,040
like get up there on xbox now.

480
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,340
Do you remember the Israeli guy on
the beach was always really ripped.

481
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,600
No handsome guy.

482
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,390
Black hair.

483
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,690
He's to have this workout
and get everybody pumped up.

484
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,440
You don't remember.

485
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,750
I don't think I've ever
watched Jane Fonda,

486
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,123
Jane Fonda,

487
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,380
she had videotapes.

488
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,330
Imagine if you got into the videotape
business like couple days ago,

489
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,210
like I'm a fucking set the world on DVD.

490
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,340
I watched the DVD last night and I forgot
the resolution on those are shit when

491
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,690
you're watching on a big screen.

492
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:17,930
I've never realized regular,

493
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,510
regular duty for 80.

494
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,190
I got an email from a company that was
offering to transcode all of my youtube

495
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,660
videos into dvds.

496
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,400
So like,

497
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,710
yeah,

498
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,670
I'm probably good.

499
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,210
We'll get it.

500
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,400
Set him off smoke.

501
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,243
So

502
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,790
it was like this huge spiel about
how the DVD market is not dead yet.

503
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,390
And he could,

504
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,631
you know,

505
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,530
you could serve as people who don't
have connectivity or something.

506
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,300
It looks like it's working,

507
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,940
Jimmy.

508
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,773
Yeah.

509
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah.

510
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,810
Look,

511
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,643
Hooray.

512
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,331
You figured it out.

513
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:47,164
You fuck.

514
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,593
Go Jog.

515
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,863
Yay.

516
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,690
We're here.

517
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,020
Yeah.

518
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,380
So we're alive allegedly
for now who knows?

519
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,480
He might not be working.

520
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,960
So this is like maybe one step in this
ultimate 3d reality reality where yeah,

521
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,460
where consumption for us turns into this.

522
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,210
Um,

523
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,460
this three dimensional thing
instead of two dimensional,

524
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,410
we dealt with two
dimensional now for what?

525
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
A eight 70 years or however
long a black and white long man.

526
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,580
I really stop and think about it.

527
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:22,360
I mean it's probably been more than
that because what was silent movies?

528
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,810
There was the 19 tens.

529
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,290
Yeah.

530
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Okay.

531
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,160
Yeah,

532
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,791
maybe tens.

533
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:29,510
I don't know.

534
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,550
I honestly don't know.

535
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,130
But think about the amount of
time it wasn't that like 19.

536
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:34,251
Oh,

537
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,570
four or some crazy shit.

538
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,070
That would be amazing if that's true.

539
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,020
The earliest silent movie.

540
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:39,651
I mean,

541
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,950
but before that they had still images.

542
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:43,311
Right?

543
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,400
So you had photographs and
they went from photographs

544
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,611
one.

545
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:48,610
Whoa.

546
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,660
Jesus Christ.

547
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:50,494
Where we off?

548
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,270
Holy Fuck Man.

549
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:52,930
Wow.

550
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,310
That was um.

551
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:56,480
Oh,

552
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,640
that's just the first one.

553
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,260
Well the first one,

554
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,213
um,

555
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,140
the first talkie was
the jazz singer in 1927.

556
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,510
He imagined like in Nineteen,

557
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:11,710
27 people sat down like jogging
because they had audio now.

558
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:12,850
Wow.

559
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,620
And they probably had a sync it up.

560
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,251
Oh,

561
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:15,671
you remember?

562
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:20,671
That was like always the big thing with
a right movies that were sinked up bad.

563
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:24,940
The sound was linked up
to the lips didn't match.

564
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,500
The still happens now is go to
youtube and there's a video.

565
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,220
We can't show it.

566
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,210
Can we show it on this?

567
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,501
Oh,

568
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:33,370
it's still fucking up.

569
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,263
Okay.

570
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,760
Not when is Nosferatu when?

571
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,670
I want to say Nosferatu was like early,

572
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,560
early 19 hundreds,

573
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:44,480
but it might've been yet 20 to 22,

574
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:44,921
19,

575
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:49,120
22 fucking dope movies still to this day.

576
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,270
Like that vampire was a good vampires
for back then it was like they did it and

577
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:58,120
they couldn't show much back then
because it was obviously it was black and

578
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:58,451
white,

579
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,880
but it's also if you look
real close you'd be like,

580
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:01,490
what the fuck?

581
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,323
The makeup,

582
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,560
that long creepy fingers.

583
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:08,870
And he was like some prominent
actor of the time if I'm really.

584
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,843
I think so.

585
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,990
I don't know.

586
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,790
Maybe I'm no expert,

587
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,241
but yeah,

588
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:13,931
I bet he was.

589
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:14,764
I mean,

590
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,370
but look how fucking they
really did a good job.

591
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,440
I'll pull this up here.

592
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,410
That was,

593
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,243
that's a creepy,

594
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,580
very creepy.

595
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,750
Very creepy.

596
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,370
I mean when you think about 19,

597
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,180
2010,

598
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,361
what?

599
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,940
Limited technology they had in some ways.

600
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:32,181
I mean,

601
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:34,550
you really have to appreciate
what it used to take.

602
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,210
Oh yeah.

603
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,290
I was on the set of independence
day to which they filming.

604
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,543
Is that a thing?

605
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,210
Yeah.

606
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,980
I don't know if I was supposed to talk.

607
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,053
Yeah.

608
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,320
Independence Day to just
heard about this famous,

609
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:48,900
right?

610
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,520
Yeah,

611
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,230
I'm Hemsworth.

612
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
Uh,

613
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,310
there's two Hemsworth,

614
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:53,760
right?

615
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,180
Thor?

616
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,013
Who was thor?

617
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,320
Liam.

618
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,050
There's Liam and there's another.

619
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,760
Chris is a brother.

620
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,620
They're brothers and they're both.

621
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:01,861
Both.

622
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,611
Hansen was fuck.

623
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:02,920
Yeah.

624
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,753
Unbelievable.

625
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,650
Unbelievable.

626
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,483
I like that guy.

627
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,533
No,

628
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,470
no.

629
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,580
See I would splurge for him to be the
leading men and independent states as

630
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:11,750
well.

631
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,220
We must save the world just like Florida.

632
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,233
Basically.

633
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,260
It was beautiful hair,

634
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,250
but anyhow,

635
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:22,251
I went there and I mean we shot like we
shop for 13 hours for about 20 seconds

636
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,690
of what it'll actually be in the
film and everything is blue screen.

637
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,760
There's nothing around you anywhere.

638
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,770
They spend a say a year shooting it and
then another year in post production

639
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,800
just painting everything in artificially.

640
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:38,700
So it's,

641
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,450
it's,

642
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,160
you have to kind of appreciate that.

643
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,140
Back then if they wanted something,

644
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:43,920
it had to happen.

645
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,740
Then we had to do it
right there in the art,

646
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,930
you know?

647
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,111
Oh,

648
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:49,910
like makeup.

649
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,743
Yeah.

650
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,720
Patrick Mcgee.

651
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,260
He's the guy who made that American
Werewolf in London out in the lobby that

652
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,020
that guy was like when I had them on
the show he was talking about like,

653
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,960
those days are kind of going and it
sucks because when you look at like fake

654
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,070
monsters in movies,

655
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:06,390
like perfect examples,

656
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,680
like hose underworld hawks,

657
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,650
a good example to the underworld.

658
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,760
Werewolf's yeah,

659
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,280
like they look so vague but kind of cool.

660
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,800
It's cool,

661
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,480
but it's video game.

662
00:19:16,481 --> 00:19:17,640
It's like in a different.

663
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,390
Yeah,

664
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,230
it's cool,

665
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,190
but you don't think you're looking at
a real thing like the twilight werewolf

666
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:25,380
guys when they turn to
the wolves and twilight.

667
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,090
You like get the fuck Outta here.

668
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,950
That does not look real.

669
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,550
You know?

670
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,383
It just doesn't look.

671
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,010
Even if it's bad,

672
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,590
as long as you're looking at a real thing,

673
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,790
it's not as offensive.

674
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,440
Like the creature from the black lagoon.

675
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,270
It's Kinda bad.

676
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,600
But you're looking at a real,

677
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,850
like a lighting thing where you can.

678
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,260
With the CG you can tell it.

679
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:50,160
It's almost like the shadows
and reflections are kind
of off a little bit and

680
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,850
even if you're dealing
with poor costume or um,

681
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,020
well I mean that thing
out there is perfect.

682
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,570
That's better than any CGI.

683
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,610
You're going to possibly
bad around it though.

684
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,720
The getting better at it and like the
wolves and game of thrones or like the

685
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:06,070
closest to a real animal and they still,

686
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,840
they still,

687
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,350
yeah,

688
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,190
they still suck,

689
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,960
but there's the kind of get a real
wolf wolf or they don't listen,

690
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,750
not listen.

691
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,340
It's a great friend who
has wolves and they're,

692
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:23,100
they're cool animals but you are not
telling them what to do because it's not

693
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:23,511
happening.

694
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:27,210
And maybe they'll sit for a
second if you give them meat,

695
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,100
but they're on their own little trip.

696
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,053
There's no,

697
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,530
there's no evidence ever.

698
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,840
If somebody's having trained
one will you train them?

699
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,570
But you don't train them like a dog.

700
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,803
Like they're fucking.

701
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,250
Like when I went to his house it was like,

702
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:38,691
Whoa,

703
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:41,520
these are not dogs like
they did looking at you,

704
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,900
they're checking you out.

705
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,411
And when you,

706
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,011
how the,

707
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:44,844
how with you.

708
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,110
Like I will go into his living room.

709
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,610
They just can't help it.

710
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,391
They can't help it.

711
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,390
They just have to fucking
house shits do that.

712
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,370
Shits is.

713
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:55,690
Yeah,

714
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,320
because they're like wolf reeling
from the Wolfe family are hilarious.

715
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Dogs to dogs are more closer to the
wolf I guess if that's true or not.

716
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,230
Huskies look like a fucking
wolf and they're weird band.

717
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,280
There's a weird animal.

718
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,090
You can't.

719
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,950
They like this guy that had them.

720
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,690
I saw a guy walk into the other day,

721
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:24,040
some old dude and he had a,

722
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,910
they had those face things on them to
protect their josh shot where they call

723
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,980
those things must a muzzle muzzle.

724
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,280
They were muzzled to keep their,

725
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:33,550
uh,

726
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,170
their face from biting people.

727
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,450
What's funny is they have this
new thing if we had the internet,

728
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:38,090
which show you,

729
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,970
they have these new muscles that
look like rabid angry werewolf faces.

730
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,640
So like when they put
the muzzle on the dog,

731
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:47,360
that dog looks like it's
about to attack you.

732
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,370
That's not a good move.

733
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,293
That's not.

734
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,140
Couldn't move at all because then
you have the dog in the park people.

735
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,200
Yeah.

736
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,420
It was just an asshole if you see it,

737
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,400
if you got

738
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,940
dogs hardcore.

739
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,410
That's really funny.

740
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:03,310
If you said it would be funny,

741
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,360
it was a smiley face.

742
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,973
Smiley.

743
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:06,910
Yeah.

744
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,743
Um,

745
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,710
but uh,

746
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,850
this dude who had the wolves,

747
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,340
I always felt it was like super
irresponsible to have them.

748
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:12,941
He,

749
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:15,670
his wolves got out and they killed
a bunch of the neighbors sheep.

750
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,190
He lived in Texas to spread in Texas.

751
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,520
Like his family had a ranch
and he'd go out to the ranch,

752
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,060
brings dogs,

753
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,490
sometimes dogs in quotes.

754
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,301
There are seven eights,

755
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:25,661
wolf,

756
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:29,050
one eighth dog because you can't
own 100 percent wolf I guess,

757
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,590
but you know,

758
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,020
and like,

759
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,030
like really,

760
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,230
really high bizarre.

761
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,870
As you get those people with
cheetahs on their couch.

762
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,970
I'm sure you could own them
as you went to those places.

763
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,280
There's some states like Texas has some
crazy laws in Texas as you could fucking

764
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:42,701
seat.

765
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:43,840
There's everything in Texas.

766
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:47,410
They have all these African animals on
these high fence hunting operations.

767
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,270
You can go and hunt just
like you're in Africa.

768
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:53,890
You can hunt like oryx and linens and
all these giant fucking African Savanna.

769
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:55,570
Animals landed the free.

770
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,140
Yeah.

771
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,540
They have a bunch of different muscles.

772
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,520
I guess it's a little tiny dog.

773
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:00,970
Yeah.

774
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,320
It's Kinda cute if it's a plug.

775
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,041
And then there's like,

776
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,330
here's the one I was talking about,

777
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,020
like there's,

778
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,410
they have like crazy looking ones where
some are more realistic than you find

779
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,060
out about something like this
because there's a little dog.

780
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,420
Yeah.

781
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,691
Oh,

782
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:10,961
okay.

783
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,340
I was thinking if you went from,

784
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,780
does your dog bite?

785
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,520
No.

786
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,981
If it did,

787
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:18,010
you wouldn't even know
what's going on down there.

788
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,750
I'm getting bit by a dog.

789
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,733
What the fuck?

790
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,710
I'm so anyway.

791
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,810
I don't know how the fuck we
got onto the subject of wolves.

792
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,010
I think it was all CGI.

793
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,291
Cgi.

794
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:27,760
Yeah.

795
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,080
There is that with the,

796
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,920
what do they call it?

797
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,550
The um,

798
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,600
something valley,

799
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,690
the uncanny valley with people like
when they show people a Nvidia had a

800
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,470
demonstration and we went to it and uh,

801
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,860
one of the cool things about the demo was
you could see what they can't get yet.

802
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,990
They can get high balls,

803
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:46,791
they can get skin,

804
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,331
they're really good at,

805
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,590
but they can't do eyelashes,

806
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,850
hair and they can't do it.

807
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:50,061
Yeah,

808
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:50,691
heres bad.

809
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:53,690
The guy that and the thing was
bald and they can't do tongues.

810
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,840
Tongues look fake too.

811
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:58,070
So while the guy was talking,

812
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,000
there was no,

813
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,810
no tongue,

814
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,800
like you didn't see his tongue.

815
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,630
So fucking weird.

816
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
It was like a few things,

817
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,750
a computational thing when you're dealing
with something so refined like strands

818
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,390
of hair for example,

819
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,910
in each one behaving independently,

820
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,780
like long here,

821
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,550
thrashing around is like
incredibly complex piece moves.

822
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,500
So you would need some incredible
hardware to be able to replicate that.

823
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:25,760
But that said,

824
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,040
it's never stopped the
progression in the past.

825
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:28,670
I mean,

826
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,540
I got this a retro console the
other day that plays Nintendo Games,

827
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,470
so I could be like a hipster and
play the original Mario and whatnot.

828
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,933
And uh,

829
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,710
it's just amazing that in my lifetime
we've already gone from a little guy who's

830
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:46,630
like eight pixels total as
your character in the game to,

831
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,080
to what we're working with now.

832
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,880
There's some clips on youtube of people
who have taken a grand theft auto clips

833
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,850
and applied intense
shaders and things to them.

834
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,360
Have you seen?

835
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,781
Yeah.

836
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:58,070
It's pretty amazing what they're doing.

837
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,990
Did that they.

838
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,830
They used a goddammit.

839
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,530
I just glanced at the
article real quickly,

840
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,800
but they used like the final scene in
the show and imported it into a video

841
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:09,830
game.

842
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,663
Oh Wow.

843
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,780
Yeah.

844
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,381
God Damn it.

845
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:12,921
I haven't seen that.

846
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,790
It's probably grand theft auto,

847
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,690
grand theft auto maker or whatever
that they released is pretty intense.

848
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:20,870
You can build your own levels and things,

849
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:22,100
movies and stuff,

850
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,800
so maybe that's what it may be.

851
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,230
Mods and you're talking about
how that some the modern one.

852
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:27,471
Yeah,

853
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:31,420
where they've taken like Pixar textures
and just took it to the next level so

854
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,221
you're looking at it.

855
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:34,970
It's a very slow frame rate because again,

856
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:38,240
coming back to resource intensive tasks,

857
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:43,241
but you can get a sense for what that
will be like and so like bringing it full

858
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,280
circle back to back to this thing here.

859
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,820
I think that the more accessible
this stuff becomes so the.

860
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,880
The cheaper that vr gets and the
less that it's tied down to anything,

861
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:56,750
the smaller that it gets,

862
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,830
the greater the likelihood that there'll
be a enough demand that people will

863
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:02,810
then go and produce cool content for it.

864
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,040
But um,

865
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,821
which phone is that?

866
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:05,720
That's the Esx,

867
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:07,600
this Samsung the six.

868
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,990
You can also get this headset
for the note for right now.

869
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,580
For some reason,

870
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:14,420
those two.

871
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,970
This is the newest one that they make.

872
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
There are also a generic branded ones
that you can slip any phone into.

873
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:25,850
The only issue that arises
from that is how do you,

874
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,020
how to interact with it.

875
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,030
Like you have these weird
switches or buttons.

876
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:31,190
Sometimes you don't have a
nice touch pad like this one.

877
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,740
So that's the only thing to consider.

878
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,700
An htc also make one that's pretty,

879
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:36,410
like the vive.

880
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:36,711
Yeah,

881
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,100
that's,

882
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,720
that's a standalone headset.

883
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,600
Yet people are saying
great things about that.

884
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,560
I haven't tried it yet.

885
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,290
Uh,

886
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,200
but every manufacturer is
apparently interested in it.

887
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,500
And I've been noticing more
and more uploads on Youtube.

888
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:53,640
It's amazing how Youtube has
pushed not not just this,

889
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:57,270
but like also four k I upload my
videos and in four k for example,

890
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,050
they are there for you.

891
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:03,050
You have these giant productions for
television shows and you can't get that

892
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:04,400
content in four k.

893
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,250
it's bizarre.

894
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,890
It's like they spent $100,

895
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:07,651
million dollars.

896
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:07,980
Well,

897
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,090
in the case of house of cards,

898
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,080
you could get it in full Rez,

899
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:10,770
but anyway,

900
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,210
you've been able to do that
on youtube for a while.

901
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,010
Now you're getting three
60 video on youtube.

902
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't know if you've
checked any of it out.

903
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,770
I haven't checked that out,

904
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,260
but the Fort K's interesting
because like the new apple box,

905
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,990
they're saying the new apple TV
that was announced last week,

906
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,400
supposedly it doesn't run fourK ,

907
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,020
which I thought was interesting because
is it just that they're not pushing the

908
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,720
four k to the masses yet?

909
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,790
Because I,

910
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,881
I honestly,

911
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,920
I think it comes is a bandwidth issue.

912
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,600
You can,

913
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,900
a connection issue.

914
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:41,901
Everybody is sort of held
up by the terrible telcos
situation that exists here.

915
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,530
Uh,

916
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,400
I did some research recently on like
Internet connections around the world and

917
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,690
like North America,

918
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:50,010
he's insanely bad.

919
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,800
Oh yeah.

920
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,660
Yeah.

921
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,091
It's,

922
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:53,370
it's,

923
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,260
it's quite surprising
comparatively like country Korea,

924
00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:56,970
Korea's insane,

925
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,241
south.

926
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:57,470
Crazy,

927
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:57,751
insane.

928
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:02,751
But even countries you wouldn't
expect like Romania or Latvia,

929
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,620
like some of these countries that I
sort of often converse with my audience

930
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,090
members and they're sending me,

931
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:12,450
they send me their speed tests and then
tell me what they're paying for it.

932
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,190
And you get,

933
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,950
and I'm sure there's plenty of people
listening here that are going to start

934
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,030
tweeting out their speeds.

935
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,250
Let us know how fast your Internet
is and what you pay for it.

936
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:21,540
But in Korea for example,

937
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:25,170
I think like $10 gets you
a 100 by 100 up and down.

938
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,771
And why is it,

939
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,200
why is it up so restricted?

940
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:32,070
In the United States we have like I have
three and that's the fastest you can

941
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:32,641
read up.

942
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:35,100
Three up I think has been
the fastest that I can get.

943
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,510
T and t uverse,

944
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,650
it's something to do,

945
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:38,850
and I'm not an expert on this,

946
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:39,141
but it's,

947
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:44,141
it's something to do with the
cable and Dsl structure that,

948
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,000
uh,

949
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,230
there's some sort of signal loss I think
associated with that where for some

950
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:50,640
reason the upload is more,

951
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,290
is more labor intensive,

952
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,680
but when you're talking about
a fiber is always one by one,

953
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,280
right.

954
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,001
If it's not,

955
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:02,001
then usually it's not real fiber and
in places small places with smaller

956
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,180
geographic areas,

957
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:08,181
it's easier to run fiber fiber from the
CEO point right to the actual customers

958
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:10,950
because of the dense,

959
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,400
the density of people makes
it worthwhile to do so.

960
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,580
And North America for the most
part is still pretty spread out,

961
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,610
but google fiber is emerging in more
and more cities and it's completely

962
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,150
overhaul and going over the top on
the incumbent sort of providers,

963
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,260
comcast at and t,

964
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,373
whoever.

965
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,750
And the scary thing was they
were trying to merge recently.

966
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,770
Who Was it?

967
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,603
Was it.

968
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,920
They did merge a DIRECTV.

969
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,551
Oh,

970
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:38,980
did they?

971
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,450
Yeah.

972
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,320
Maybe there's another one,

973
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,154
but I don't think that's.

974
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:41,801
Yeah,

975
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,450
it was time Warner and something else.

976
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:43,720
Right.

977
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,340
I think it was time Warner and comcast.

978
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,890
Yeah,

979
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,610
we're attempting to merge
and then the FCC or whoever,

980
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,200
whatever party was got involved.

981
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,070
Well when they find out they're throttling
data and fucking with people that use

982
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:57,520
Netflix and then they made a deal that
they had to make a deal with Netflix and

983
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:01,210
that they could get more
data because Netflix was.

984
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:01,580
There were,

985
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,010
there were consistently slower when people
using Netflix and anything else they

986
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:06,790
fuck with people.

987
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,620
Oh they hate netflix.

988
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,580
They hate the Internet.

989
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:09,920
You know,

990
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,920
traditional media is always taking shots
wherever they can to to sort of slow

991
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:18,700
down this thing that's happening online
because they don't control enough of it.

992
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,760
But isn't it also because
the infrastructure is just
not really that good yet.

993
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,750
I mean they didn't really prepare for the,

994
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,830
the jumps in the internet
usage over the last date,

995
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,551
decade or so.

996
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:27,910
That's,

997
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,481
that's true.

998
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:28,900
But there,

999
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,350
there are.

1000
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:34,350
There are things they could have done
to sort of limit the effect of that.

1001
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,790
Like a wireless for example,

1002
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,500
like if you're on Lte,

1003
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,690
all of a sudden you've got 20 megabits up.

1004
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,930
Like how is it that the
wireless connections on your,

1005
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,311
for a lot of people,

1006
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:49,060
their cell phone data connection is
faster than what they have at home.

1007
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:49,680
Right?

1008
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,290
Right.

1009
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,390
But it costs you a lot of
money because it's not,

1010
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,560
it's not unlimited.

1011
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,890
So like you could imagine that if you
had put up more towers or limb or or

1012
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,810
taking down the cost of
wireless data for example,

1013
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,590
like a lot of countries
have had to skip over the.

1014
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm wired connections completely.

1015
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,880
So if you're in India for example,

1016
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:15,030
they completely skipped like laptops and
that whole period of time there were.

1017
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,970
Everybody was buying a cable
connection or a DSL connection.

1018
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,470
They're getting cell phones now and their
primary data connection is going to be

1019
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,990
on that mobile device and it's,

1020
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,730
it's the same and a lot of
emerging markets around the world.

1021
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:32,731
So they're like investing specifically
in wireless as opposed to like going

1022
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:36,400
backwards and trying to make
the wired thing work at all.

1023
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,410
So that's.

1024
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,980
So did they have like
data caps on wireless?

1025
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,521
Oh,

1026
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,840
it's incredibly expensive.

1027
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,201
Yeah,

1028
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:45,034
that's it.

1029
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,910
They have a,

1030
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,300
they have data caps and they also
limit things like text messages.

1031
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,300
This is why a instant messaging apps
like whatsapp are so popular elsewhere in

1032
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:55,091
the world.

1033
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:56,650
People trying to scoot around,

1034
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,491
uh,

1035
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:58,450
the Telcos,

1036
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,800
it's not expensive.

1037
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,251
It wouldn't,

1038
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,800
it's expensive relative
to what people earn their.

1039
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,160
So what's APP,

1040
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,030
what does that do?

1041
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,221
It,

1042
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:10,221
it lets you use the data on your phone
instead of using like text message

1043
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:11,920
minutes and.

1044
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,461
Exactly,

1045
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:12,671
yeah.

1046
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:17,440
It lets you avoid whatever the Telcos
gonna impose for the cost of a text

1047
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:17,591
message.

1048
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:20,170
Like a text message is
incredibly small amount of data,

1049
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,710
yet you could be traveling and your Telco
could charge you twenty five cents for

1050
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,490
each one.

1051
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:27,701
Well,

1052
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:28,660
unless you're on t mobile,

1053
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,820
t mobile and it,

1054
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,041
it's,

1055
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:31,661
it's really bizarre.

1056
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,291
Even me.

1057
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:32,561
Okay.

1058
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:34,690
So I'm from Toronto and uh,

1059
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,340
and I'm on,

1060
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm on Roger's not a huge fan or anything,

1061
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,760
but I'm saying comparatively speaking,

1062
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,230
like when I traveled down here,

1063
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,470
the maximum that I can pay over
top of my regular bill is $5 a day,

1064
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:50,720
maximum data calls,

1065
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,210
whatever.

1066
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:51,620
That's,

1067
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,280
that's where it,

1068
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,111
it's capped out at.

1069
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:54,650
So you're basically using your regular,

1070
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,730
your regular plan,

1071
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:59,720
even though you're on 18 t or t
mobile or whoever it is out here now.

1072
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:00,010
That's,

1073
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,460
that's relatively recent,

1074
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,520
but t mobile came out with something
that allows for you to cross the Canadian

1075
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:12,010
border and the Mexican
border and essentially have
your exact same plan almost

1076
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,071
in most countries.

1077
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:15,590
And most of my friends
just got back from Vietnam,

1078
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:17,540
I think it was or or something like that.

1079
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,070
And he said there was no difference.

1080
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:19,401
He's like,

1081
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:20,930
my phone worked like it was back home.

1082
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,280
I didn't get charged a penny more.

1083
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,660
You have to do data roaming.

1084
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,680
Do you have to do roaming?

1085
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,730
Do you have to turn on your technic?

1086
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:26,960
Technically you are roaming.

1087
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:27,261
Yeah,

1088
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:27,511
but,

1089
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:29,520
but do you have to call
them and let them know?

1090
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:29,841
No,

1091
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,161
no,

1092
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:30,311
no,

1093
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:30,430
no.

1094
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,600
That has always been
annoying about verizon.

1095
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,240
T mobile is the way to go in.

1096
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,140
I did a speed test last night,

1097
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:41,430
a 61 down 23 up from my
house where my house,

1098
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,680
the Max is unbelievable.

1099
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,070
Yeah.

1100
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,490
Mobile faster than my max is three.

1101
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,383
Three on my home.

1102
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,590
I got three or four.

1103
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,310
It's a DSL or cable a and t uverse,

1104
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,303
uh,

1105
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,720
I guess fiber supposed to
be really good if the fiber.

1106
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,530
It's not.

1107
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,000
What's the wire that's coming in?

1108
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,901
What are you plugging in?

1109
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,640
Is it a phone line or a cable connection?

1110
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:02,370
Cable connection.

1111
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:02,960
Okay.

1112
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,500
Yeah,

1113
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,340
but I don't know.

1114
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,670
I mean I thought it was fire.

1115
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:08,840
I get like supposedly
50 down and you know,

1116
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,750
for us there's no,

1117
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,670
there's tons of marketing confusion around
the word fiber because it started to

1118
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,240
get,

1119
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,460
like kind of become a hot term.

1120
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,050
So everyone wanted to use it.

1121
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,340
They wanted in their diet.

1122
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,853
That's true.

1123
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,963
That was too easy.

1124
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,771
But yeah.

1125
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:28,101
So,

1126
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:28,340
so,

1127
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,520
so everyone started throwing it around
even though it's not the real deal,

1128
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,750
it's not real fiber.

1129
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:35,780
It's like it'll be fiber for
this portion of the trip.

1130
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:36,140
Right.

1131
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,520
And then it'll go to copper somewhere in
there and you have signal loss and you

1132
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:43,130
end up with what you
end up with right now.

1133
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,930
What is the difference between
what Google is trying to do?

1134
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,530
Google gives zero fucks about,

1135
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,970
about any of these players.

1136
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,000
They know they're not trying
to even coordinate with them.

1137
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,470
They're going into marketplace is going
to the the locals at least this is how

1138
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:02,030
fiber worked in the early stages and
saying would you be interested personally

1139
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,080
in an insanely fast Internet connection
and here's the price we could give it to

1140
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:06,680
you for.

1141
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,290
And so people within a community
would sign a petition saying,

1142
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:09,531
yes,

1143
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:10,670
I'm interested in that.

1144
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,760
And once they could evaluate the demand,

1145
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,860
they're building the
infrastructure themselves.

1146
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,640
Whoa.

1147
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,840
They have that kind of cash.

1148
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,300
Oh yes they do.

1149
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,163
They're skynet.

1150
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,320
I mean think about the
different shit they have now.

1151
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,880
Oh my goodness.

1152
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:26,660
So weird.

1153
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,021
Yeah,

1154
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,030
and it drives me how
many people have their,

1155
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:31,490
their info up on the cloud with Google.

1156
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,530
Everything is there and how come
that hasn't been hacked yet?

1157
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,783
Great question.

1158
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,651
Totally has.

1159
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,880
Well I not yet.

1160
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,700
Not yet.

1161
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,200
Yeah.

1162
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,660
Not In any big sort of immediate way.

1163
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,950
I'm sure.

1164
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,371
Listen,

1165
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:44,940
if I had,

1166
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,450
if you had to put your trust in
somebody on the web right now,

1167
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:48,950
like there,

1168
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:53,950
there aren't too many parties that have
been at it for this long and and sort of

1169
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,570
had a history of success the way that
Google has even apple sort of scrambling

1170
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:03,630
to have web services way later
than than than Google did.

1171
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,463
I mean g mail,

1172
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,910
people don't even think about it.

1173
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,650
You don't even think about your email.

1174
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:08,190
You're just like,

1175
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,401
yeah,

1176
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:08,911
what do you mean?

1177
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:09,870
Of course it's on GMA,

1178
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,021
like,

1179
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:10,201
yeah,

1180
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,034
it's easy.

1181
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,390
The vast majority of people use it,

1182
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,880
but before g mail it was like,

1183
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,140
it was a confusing setup for email.

1184
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,590
People used to have those little
needs to have things down.

1185
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,424
Like outlook.

1186
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:20,920
Yes.

1187
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,110
Your email from outlet,

1188
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,910
you've got mail and you'd
have to configure it every
time to pop settings and

1189
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:28,410
whatnot.

1190
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:28,700
God,

1191
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,533
I remember that

1192
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,940
you'd have to put in the server.

1193
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:33,774
Yes,

1194
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,651
that's right.

1195
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,520
I forgot about all that.

1196
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:35,670
Yeah,

1197
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,031
it was.

1198
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,020
It was not cool.

1199
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:38,640
So I think,

1200
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,560
and we may have talked about this before,

1201
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,240
I think their model,

1202
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:46,920
the sort of ad subsidy model has driven
these amazing innovations online.

1203
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:47,790
Uh,

1204
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,520
but uh,

1205
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:48,750
we,

1206
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,750
we were talking earlier when I got here
about how ad blocking is like the next

1207
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,370
big conversation for the web.

1208
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,060
It's a big conversation with people
that are youtube subscribers,

1209
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,090
huge because youtube obviously guys like
you guys like me in this show put you

1210
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:07,860
put ads in the beginning and
get revenue from those ads.

1211
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:08,280
That's right.

1212
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,510
If you put up an ad blocker,

1213
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:13,470
those ads don't show up and then people
don't get those clicks and so they don't

1214
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:14,400
get as much revenue.

1215
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,660
And so folks,

1216
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,240
like conscientious people will tell you,

1217
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:18,571
hey,

1218
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:21,180
I'm turning off my ad
blocker to watch your show.

1219
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,850
And it's right just to
make sure that you get,

1220
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,120
get your proper pay off.

1221
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,660
That's right.

1222
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:24,901
Yeah.

1223
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:26,820
So listen up audience,

1224
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,230
turn it off.

1225
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:28,950
Okay.

1226
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,600
Turn it back on when you're done with us.

1227
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,430
Yeah,

1228
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,000
it's a,

1229
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,820
it's a significant amount of money
and that's what's fascinating now.

1230
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,151
I mean,

1231
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,670
obviously you guys get
a shitload of downloads.

1232
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:42,390
You could speak on this even better
than we could because for us,

1233
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,920
the 90 percent of the people that
get this show get an audio form only.

1234
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,010
Youtube is a fraction.

1235
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,000
There's Vimeo,

1236
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,650
there's ustream and there's youtube and
you know those are those all together

1237
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,120
constitute about 10 percent,

1238
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,430
but your whole thing is on like when you
do an iphone video of like the big one

1239
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:06,870
was when you expose the iphones
were like ridiculously easy to bend.

1240
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,310
Like that was fucking
millions and millions of hits,

1241
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,263
right?

1242
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,481
Yeah.

1243
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:13,420
Almost $70.

1244
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:13,980
Billion.

1245
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,813
Wow.

1246
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,660
How much does a man makeup,

1247
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,371
something like that.

1248
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:18,210
How dare you

1249
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,610
this round of about the new iphone?

1250
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,630
Has We talk talking cars or was this a
car mount or a nice watch or something?

1251
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:29,971
Nice.

1252
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:30,600
Something good?

1253
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,433
Something Nice.

1254
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,783
Nice dinner,

1255
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,790
a nice place.

1256
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,560
Bag of tricks.

1257
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,810
A little fucking video will
come up with this fucking thing.

1258
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,670
The new iphone has a new material,

1259
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:39,881
right?

1260
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:41,290
That's not as bendable.

1261
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,620
Have you been watching on bucks therapies?

1262
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,040
I guess.

1263
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,100
Yeah.

1264
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,360
I guess I get to play with the new iphone
the other day and this guy that works

1265
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,170
for apple got.

1266
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,810
Let me play with it and I,

1267
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,640
I,

1268
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,460
I would like to know
what you think about it.

1269
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:55,630
I think it's like the first iphone.

1270
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,680
I'm not going to buy.

1271
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,460
I think half the shit they showed were
just software updates that this iphone

1272
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,270
six,

1273
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,980
normal six could do easily.

1274
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,710
Like what?

1275
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,880
I'm like the,

1276
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,660
the silly thing that the touch thing.

1277
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,260
I don't want that.

1278
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,950
You can just push.

1279
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,430
You could,

1280
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,330
you could program your phone if you
hold down something for two seconds.

1281
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,620
A second menu will pop up.

1282
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,000
Why is this like a big deal?

1283
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,351
You know,

1284
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:18,184
they made it.

1285
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,210
What is the second?

1286
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,780
The new one?

1287
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,410
The new one is [inaudible] touch meaning
like you push the screen like that old

1288
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:26,100
blackberry that you used to
have with the blackberry touch.

1289
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,070
That was a piece of shit,

1290
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,000
piece of shit.

1291
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,833
The um,

1292
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,070
what was that torch?

1293
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,300
No,

1294
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,530
no,

1295
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,850
there's the one was their first
screen and the whole screen push down.

1296
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,661
It was like you would click,

1297
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:34,900
click,

1298
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,141
click,

1299
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:35,350
click,

1300
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:35,591
click,

1301
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:35,810
click.

1302
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,010
When you make a text message,

1303
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,260
push this thunder.

1304
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,300
Thunder vendor is not like that shit.

1305
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,370
Storm Storm.

1306
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,233
That's what it was.

1307
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,120
I hated that fucking phone.

1308
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,590
There's a storm brewing,

1309
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,420
but one of the biggest things
was like now you don't have.

1310
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,070
You're like,

1311
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,610
Eh,

1312
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,930
like if you push it down,

1313
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,290
it recognizes that you're applying
pressure on the screen so it can pop up a

1314
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,640
second menu based on that,

1315
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,800
but you could also just
program your phone.

1316
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,720
If you hold something
down for two seconds,

1317
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,010
they will pop up as second [inaudible].

1318
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,450
We already have that kind of,

1319
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:07,841
you know,

1320
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,980
I don't see the big.

1321
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,120
The phone actually physically
it has a little teeny,

1322
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:13,961
teeny,

1323
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:17,470
teeny thing and it also has a little
vibrate that's a little bit more powerful.

1324
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,360
How often is that going
to go off in your pocket?

1325
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,230
Yeah,

1326
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,910
like move some shit.

1327
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:22,390
Your keys,

1328
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,920
touch it,

1329
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,560
clicks.

1330
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,110
The other thing was that they
made a big deal about how like,

1331
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:26,381
hey,

1332
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:30,190
we wanted to take the technology of the
flash that that's on the new iphone and

1333
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,060
put it in the front,

1334
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,500
but then they didn't do that.

1335
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,830
They just make the screen flash three
times brighter and I used it and it did

1336
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:36,880
work very well,

1337
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,080
but for selfies,

1338
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,831
for selfies,

1339
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:39,421
but it won't,

1340
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:42,730
wouldn't like get Jamie from way over
there when I work for a video either,

1341
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,593
like if you want to,

1342
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,490
it wouldn't work for a video.

1343
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:48,250
So it's kind of like they're
kind of side talking like,

1344
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:48,491
Hey,

1345
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:49,660
we want to put this flash,

1346
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:50,494
but now we found no,

1347
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,700
well it's whenever they have an s they
don't go too far off the original.

1348
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,480
Sometimes some people make the argument
though that with the s version,

1349
00:40:58,481 --> 00:40:59,590
you're getting them more.

1350
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,710
You're getting a refinement
on the first gen device,

1351
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,740
which could theoretically have problems.

1352
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,933
Uh,

1353
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,570
now,

1354
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,490
not to toot my own horn here,

1355
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,120
but get ready for the toot.

1356
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,870
Getting too comfortable right now.

1357
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,793
Um,

1358
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,970
but the video I made that
got a lot of traction,

1359
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,040
the bend test video,

1360
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,373
um,

1361
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,470
it sort of,

1362
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,680
it sort of exposed a
weak point in the device,

1363
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,960
which was incredible by the way,

1364
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,670
uh,

1365
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,340
which was around the volume buttons.

1366
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:39,950
And I managed to get my hands on a leaked
component recently for the upcoming

1367
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:44,951
iphone and run some tests on it and it
turns out that the next generation of the

1368
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:50,501
phone is going to be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 60 to 70 percent stronger

1369
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,440
because they've added zinc to the aluminum
structure with the aluminum alloy,

1370
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,310
which turns it into something
they call a 7,000 series aluminum.

1371
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,740
And that's the stuff
they use an aerospace,

1372
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:04,251
Nassau,

1373
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,270
so on and so forth.

1374
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,410
And it,

1375
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,760
it's essentially the just way stronger
without adding any kind of weight.

1376
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,151
In fact,

1377
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:12,140
the shell itself is,

1378
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:12,450
was,

1379
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,730
was a little bit lighter.

1380
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,750
So I did this test with this crazy
contraption I took just the back shell.

1381
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,600
So just the aluminum part
from the regular six.

1382
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:25,601
And then from the upcoming six s and
the old one bent at 30 pounds of force.

1383
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,490
And the new one was around 80 [inaudible].

1384
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,690
And the reason I know about the existence
of zinc and I dropped that information

1385
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:37,691
before apple's keynote because I went
to a place called elemental controls,

1386
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,930
which is like this super crazy scientific
joint where they have this gun that

1387
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:49,151
shoots x-rays into any alloy and we'll
tell you exactly down to like two decimal

1388
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:50,720
points,

1389
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,210
what the elemental makeup is.

1390
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,940
That's pretty fucking bad ass.

1391
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,210
Yeah,

1392
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,571
it was.

1393
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:57,470
Where's that place?

1394
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,130
It was a,

1395
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,720
it was near the airport in Toronto,

1396
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,051
like,

1397
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:03,860
shout out elemental controls
because these guys were so bad ass.

1398
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,521
I'm like,

1399
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:04,671
Hey,

1400
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:07,820
I got this leaked iphone component and uh,

1401
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,660
I might need your help.

1402
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:08,901
They're like,

1403
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:09,734
come down right now.

1404
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,021
I was like,

1405
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:12,411
really?

1406
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:13,850
They probably wanted to know too.

1407
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,470
They were just as pumped as I was.

1408
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,460
They were just as mean,

1409
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:17,840
you know,

1410
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,920
a couple of old guys.

1411
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:20,780
I don't their businesses normally like,

1412
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,610
uh,

1413
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:21,940
when,

1414
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,350
when someone's doing a
big order of aluminum,

1415
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,510
like buying a boat load from China,

1416
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,080
literally they'll tell,

1417
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,570
sometimes scam you and say that you're
getting this alloy when it might look

1418
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:35,150
exactly the same as one
that's Chintzy on the zinc,

1419
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:36,230
let's say for example,

1420
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,250
and so they can just go through sheets
of this stuff with this gun and make sure

1421
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:43,010
they're buying what they
think they're buying.

1422
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,270
What about the news glass?

1423
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,440
They're not using the new
gorilla glass on there.

1424
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,970
It's a double,

1425
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,210
some kind of double version
of their ion x coding.

1426
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,210
I have the glass as well at my studio,

1427
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,220
so when I get back I'm going to be doing
a preemptive scratch test to see how

1428
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:01,830
much better it is.

1429
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,190
Let's put that bitch on a target.

1430
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,813
I'm interested.

1431
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm interested in that because the iphone
six and the six plus I are the first

1432
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,850
two phones that I've had,

1433
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,150
like every single phone that I've
actually cracked and I thought it was

1434
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,540
interesting that both that also coincides
with some heavy fucking drinking.

1435
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,170
You have to think about that now.

1436
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,130
You've been on a bender,

1437
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:24,190
you talked about it on their phones.

1438
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,540
I've been breaking like as an example,

1439
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,870
my iphone six plus when I
was getting out of my car,

1440
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,250
it slid out of my pocket,

1441
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,050
which was only like three feet
when I'm getting out of my car.

1442
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,930
I mean not even three feet,

1443
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,730
two feet.

1444
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,810
And it cracked it.

1445
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,210
It was,

1446
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,700
it was barely a fall.

1447
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,690
And that seems weird.

1448
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,141
Well,

1449
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:40,920
there is a,

1450
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,450
there's a bit of a theory on that,

1451
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,020
uh,

1452
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,400
about sort of the rigidity of the chassis
or lack thereof that might contribute

1453
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:52,230
to the glass having to bear the brunt of
the impact even if you hit not directly

1454
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:52,930
on it,

1455
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,340
right?

1456
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,170
That there might be enough flex in that,

1457
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,310
in that aluminum will.

1458
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,270
Speaking about like,

1459
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:57,660
uh,

1460
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,160
cases like is there any,

1461
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,080
did they have any really good cases
that have power that gives you power?

1462
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,331
Like,

1463
00:45:04,331 --> 00:45:04,511
you know,

1464
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:07,860
they have that aren't
gigantic or they have,

1465
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:11,310
they shrunk those fuckers down yet
they're all pretty fucking bad listening.

1466
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:11,611
If you're,

1467
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:13,440
if you're already on a six plus,

1468
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,840
that's a big phone to diet to begin with.

1469
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,090
You throw a bad tastes on there
and you're carrying a brick around.

1470
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,433
Here's the thing,

1471
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:27,770
this is my biggest criticism of what's
happening happening in cell phone tech is

1472
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:29,230
that they want to,

1473
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,790
they want to make an impression on you
when you come into the store and play

1474
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:33,480
with the device.

1475
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,570
So they're going to make it
as thin as they possibly can.

1476
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,590
So he come in there and you're like,

1477
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:37,771
oh,

1478
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:38,550
that's so sexy.

1479
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,750
I'll take it until three days later
when it doesn't make it through the day

1480
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:45,240
because the batteries is so small.

1481
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,650
The next Gen,

1482
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,610
here's the crazy thing,

1483
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:48,960
the next gen iphone,

1484
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:50,670
and they didn't even
cover this in the keynote.

1485
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,800
They did not talk about this at all.

1486
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,680
The next Gen iphone will have a
smaller battery than this one.

1487
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,540
And how crazy is that?

1488
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:57,931
Wait a minute.

1489
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,320
Wait a minute.

1490
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,880
The one after the ass.

1491
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,181
No,

1492
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:02,640
the six s will have a
smaller battery than the six.

1493
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:04,350
So this is better than the success.

1494
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:09,000
They will have a slight amount
of battery life it like,

1495
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,270
it's like it's like 80 milliamp
hours or something like that.

1496
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,290
Uh,

1497
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,850
basically it means it's,

1498
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,430
it's,

1499
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,430
it's insignificant,

1500
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:22,730
but the point being is that they're not
responding to be part of the consumer

1501
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:23,161
demand,

1502
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:24,270
which is my demand,

1503
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:25,350
which has better battery life.

1504
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:25,890
I'll take.

1505
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,140
Would you take a slightly
thicker version of that?

1506
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:28,770
Yes.

1507
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,940
For double the battery life?

1508
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,361
Yes.

1509
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,180
Yes.

1510
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,120
Well also this is not that thick.

1511
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,170
This is nice.

1512
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:34,990
Yay.

1513
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,470
I like this that I have right here.

1514
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:37,831
Like,

1515
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:40,230
that is pretty Goddamn thin if
you need it sooner than that.

1516
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:40,920
No,

1517
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,880
but what I'm saying,

1518
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,900
what they need,

1519
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,980
I mean why are they making it thin?

1520
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,161
No,

1521
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,600
he's saying he made it thicker,

1522
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,080
but no,

1523
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,950
that's not what he's saying.

1524
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,640
What he's saying is that this new one
is thinner and somehow the batteries

1525
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,450
thinner.

1526
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,283
Smaller,

1527
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:52,711
small.

1528
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:56,100
I think part of it has to do with some
of the internal components taking up more

1529
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:56,934
space.

1530
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,790
Oh,

1531
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,380
this,

1532
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,640
like this chassis,

1533
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:01,990
like what you've got here will
be the exact same on the new one.

1534
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,720
It'll be actually a little bit bigger.

1535
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,570
It would be thicker a little bit because
of these new materials because they

1536
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:07,410
want it to be rigid,

1537
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,220
more rigid.

1538
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:08,490
Yeah.

1539
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,030
So it's part of the rigidity is the
adding of zinc and part of it is the fact

1540
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:13,110
that they're making it thicker.

1541
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:13,951
Yeah.

1542
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:15,480
They're reinforcing certain areas.

1543
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,170
So like I'm near the volume.

1544
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:19,740
Why would they do that and
take the battery life down?

1545
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,281
Yeah.

1546
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:20,751
Well and,

1547
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:20,990
and,

1548
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,780
but that's the thing is that they never
had an s model where they've really

1549
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:27,720
reconfigured the layout
maybe in the next version.

1550
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,890
But usually for the s model it looks,

1551
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,180
it looks exactly the same.

1552
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:31,570
Right?

1553
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,900
They don't,

1554
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,220
they don't come out with a fresh version.

1555
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:33,610
Right.

1556
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,580
There's sort of a
manufacturing setup is not,

1557
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,960
is not right for that.

1558
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,770
So it seems so silly though because
they obviously are making it slightly

1559
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,660
different because they're
making it thicker inside there.

1560
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:43,901
Yeah.

1561
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:48,190
They're doing their feeling is that it
shouldn't look to the average person if

1562
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:49,270
they pick up one or the other,

1563
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:50,530
they'll look and feel the same.

1564
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,260
But I mean,

1565
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,660
what if you had just like this size but
just a little thicker and maybe a little

1566
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:56,321
more durable.

1567
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:57,340
So you would need a case.

1568
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:57,580
Yeah.

1569
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,160
Well that.

1570
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,880
Check this out.

1571
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,820
He is that the Samsung active,

1572
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:02,230
so this is exactly what that is.

1573
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,470
So this phone here that I'm
carrying is the Essex active.

1574
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,360
This is the one that they have
that's waterproof and water.

1575
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,160
The main,

1576
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,690
the waterproof part is cool.

1577
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,800
This doesn't have a case on it?

1578
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,430
Nope.

1579
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,270
Oh yeah.

1580
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:13,920
That's built in.

1581
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,310
That's like a man's phone right there.

1582
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,030
I feel like a man.

1583
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,390
Yeah,

1584
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,201
that's a tool.

1585
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,034
That's not a toy.

1586
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,270
What do you got there?

1587
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,103
John?

1588
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:21,660
Brian.

1589
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,000
That's fine.

1590
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,480
Just a comparison of
like the thickness of it,

1591
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,240
but that means it's too thick for you.

1592
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:28,930
No,

1593
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:29,231
no,

1594
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:29,440
no.

1595
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,630
That has a 3,500 milliamp hour battery.

1596
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:33,430
That never dies on me before I go to bed.

1597
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,710
So this is the one that's waterproof.

1598
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,250
The whole deal.

1599
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,750
Shock resistant dust proof.

1600
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,260
I take.

1601
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,093
Take it in the shower.

1602
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,670
Just the fucking phone but.

1603
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,160
But Shit.

1604
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,220
Yeah,

1605
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,210
but there's a but it is an 18 t exclusive.

1606
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,470
Oh fuck.

1607
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,780
What the fuck?

1608
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,183
I know.

1609
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,731
Terrible.

1610
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:55,140
But you can do a and t t
unlocked and put onto mobile.

1611
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:55,380
Yeah,

1612
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:55,930
yeah.

1613
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,111
Yeah.

1614
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:59,890
This is really that much better than
18 and t way better while around here.

1615
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,611
Around here.

1616
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:01,600
In my experience.

1617
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,110
Yeah,

1618
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,160
and also in Vegas

1619
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,900
so you could get this unlocked
and then you bring it to t mobile.

1620
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:08,950
You've got to be getting a phone call.

1621
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:09,850
So I'm going to fuck.

1622
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:10,780
Tell him to fuck off.

1623
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,780
We're want show.

1624
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,780
How do I do that?

1625
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,550
I slide it.

1626
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:16,383
Slide that over.

1627
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,260
Well that's annoying too.

1628
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,700
One thing that I thought was weird that
they did in the keynote where they said

1629
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:24,190
the battery was not as strong as the six.

1630
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:24,611
They said,

1631
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:24,910
well,

1632
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,070
the new operating system,

1633
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:29,020
it's going to give you
an hour more battery.

1634
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,530
Well it.

1635
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,630
Well,

1636
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,201
but they.

1637
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:35,950
I just updated the operating system on
my sixth so I can an hour more battery

1638
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:37,080
life on this one also.

1639
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:37,811
So you're radically.

1640
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,110
Yeah.

1641
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:38,320
Yeah,

1642
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,390
but you don't even know just up.

1643
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,680
It's probably going to suck.

1644
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:42,280
They're going to,

1645
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,113
they're going to fuck you.

1646
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,230
Just like they always do.

1647
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,940
Always do software updates.

1648
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,301
Always.

1649
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:46,721
Fuck you.

1650
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:47,051
Yeah.

1651
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,120
I mean I'm never on the forefront of it.

1652
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,790
Not on my main device to the.

1653
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,210
I like this a lot,

1654
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:52,960
so man's phone.

1655
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,793
What's it called again?

1656
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,990
The active active,

1657
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,853
yet.

1658
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,790
I like it a lot.

1659
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,530
I've got two different time
zones on there to see you.

1660
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:00,870
Don't do them.

1661
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:01,840
You know what time it is at home.

1662
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,680
What I'm doing,

1663
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,190
dude,

1664
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,023
this is a.

1665
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,100
it's also got a programmable button on it.

1666
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,060
This one right here,

1667
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,650
which you can configure as a shortcut for
anything you want so you can make it a

1668
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:12,281
voice recorder.

1669
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:15,410
Like if cops were fucking with whatever
your favorite thing to launches.

1670
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,400
Yeah,

1671
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,280
making launch anything
instantly from there.

1672
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,430
If a girl band is trying to get arrested
and explaining how she's about to try

1673
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:26,670
to get you arrested.

1674
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,330
Red.

1675
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,163
Probably a good time.

1676
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,630
Calls nine one one.

1677
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:29,841
No,

1678
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:30,674
I called nine.

1679
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:31,760
Alright,

1680
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,593
let's get off that.

1681
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,830
I liked the topic yet.

1682
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,170
I like that phone a lot.

1683
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:36,770
Yeah,

1684
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,990
so this is kind of really frustrated.

1685
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,980
The apple thing.

1686
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,500
That's just one thing though.

1687
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,270
We're talking to a lot
of shit about apple here.

1688
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:47,180
I think that there's one thing that
remains to be seen and that's the camera.

1689
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,380
The camera on and next model
will be an improvement.

1690
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,850
I'm 100 percent positive.

1691
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,530
It's a 12 megapixel.

1692
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,130
It's going to shoot four
k and apple knows it.

1693
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,350
The camera has been the battle ground
of smart phones for the last five,

1694
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,403
six years.

1695
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,600
If you have the best camera,

1696
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:08,600
you're going to cell phones and the
prom for apple right now is they don't.

1697
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,320
There's no argument that
the s six camera is better.

1698
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:12,961
Oh,

1699
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:14,240
I guess you could make an argument.

1700
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,111
Subjectivity,

1701
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,220
color representation,

1702
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:16,491
blah,

1703
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:16,641
blah,

1704
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,300
blah.

1705
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,100
The Essex shoots better photos than the
current iphone and that's a big problem

1706
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:22,610
for them.

1707
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,590
So I fully suspect.

1708
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,870
So the galaxy s six is
what you're talking about.

1709
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,180
Yep.

1710
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,220
So people that are listening to this

1711
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:30,460
garden.

1712
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:30,651
Yeah.

1713
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:30,860
Yeah.

1714
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,000
How perfect is it?

1715
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,670
Six s and the six.

1716
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,840
Those are the competing products,

1717
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,170
the iphone and the galaxy s six.

1718
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:40,620
So when he says Esx,

1719
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,660
he's talking about this.

1720
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,020
Sorry,

1721
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,860
what about the active?

1722
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:44,960
Does it ss six active at the same camera?

1723
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,140
Yeah.

1724
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,430
So this phone,

1725
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:46,940
let's.

1726
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,260
I'm going to take this out for a second.

1727
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,630
That his phone is
essentially now hardcore.

1728
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:51,921
You know what,

1729
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:53,160
I'm glad that we did though.

1730
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:54,470
You know we got right into it.

1731
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,353
Yeah.

1732
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,500
So this is this phone
that's the same phone,

1733
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,190
right?

1734
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,140
Just the pretty version regular.

1735
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,370
This is the active version.

1736
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,020
I like the active version better at,

1737
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:05,310
but you can see like form
factor wise it's going,

1738
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,630
you're going to add a little bit but you
don't have to worry about dropping it.

1739
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:09,740
You don't have to have a case on it.

1740
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,580
That's right.

1741
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,413
And Better Bank.

1742
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,540
And you have wind.

1743
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,260
You have like 25 percent
more battery life.

1744
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,460
Twenty five percent more
than the ESX regular bases.

1745
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,910
A $3,500,

1746
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:20,930
million million amp hours.

1747
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:22,130
I think this is 2,700.

1748
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,180
So I mean I probably have my math lab
but why hasn't apple smarten up and make

1749
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:26,900
one of those?

1750
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,170
I took out my old iphone one the other
day and it was like this cute little

1751
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:31,370
pebble in with little.

1752
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:32,480
Had a little weight to it,

1753
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,680
but I was thinking what if they just
redid the idea of that making it a little

1754
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:40,220
thicker and having a battery that lasts
two days because it actually felt good.

1755
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,480
I didn't care about the iphone.

1756
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,310
I always have a case on this anyway,

1757
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,690
so it's always slightly thicker.

1758
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,020
Right.

1759
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,180
Like when I feel this right here,

1760
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:47,931
like this size.

1761
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,060
This is pretty thin
when I feel that though.

1762
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,360
Yeah.

1763
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,500
That's not like.

1764
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,700
This is like what?

1765
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,260
This would be with a case on it,

1766
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,310
but this is better.

1767
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,160
It's better to build it in like that door.

1768
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,620
Everybody drops her fucking
phone at some point.

1769
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,371
At some point.

1770
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:02,780
Why not make a phone that you can drop?

1771
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,990
I mean we're not talking
about laptops or spill on.

1772
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,200
This is the shelter.

1773
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,610
Big One.

1774
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:07,821
Yeah.

1775
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:08,250
Spills.

1776
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,081
Spill is huge.

1777
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:10,100
I've soaked that thing.

1778
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:10,550
I've done.

1779
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:11,100
I've put it.

1780
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,860
I submerged completely under glass.

1781
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:14,640
That's next.

1782
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,250
Well that's the next step.

1783
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:17,084
P test.

1784
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,950
Pee test belt to blow up youtube.

1785
00:53:18,951 --> 00:53:20,120
This is pretty dope dude.

1786
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:20,750
Yeah,

1787
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:21,560
I like it.

1788
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,630
And you can get to the
Canberra right from there.

1789
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:24,381
And the camera.

1790
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:25,770
And this is better than the iphone camera,

1791
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,701
in my opinion.

1792
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:27,534
It is.

1793
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,910
It just took a selfie
that's on your phone?

1794
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,330
Yeah.

1795
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:30,541
Oh,

1796
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:30,741
the,

1797
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:31,051
the,

1798
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:31,920
the selfie camera.

1799
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:33,100
Especially because it's,

1800
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,260
it's way wider.

1801
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,670
It's way wider.

1802
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:35,881
Yeah,

1803
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:36,631
it's way wider.

1804
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:37,470
So you could get like two,

1805
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:39,090
three people in there a lot easier.

1806
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,560
I tried the new angle.

1807
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,840
They new selfie camera on the new iphone.

1808
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:43,770
Compared it to my.

1809
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:45,300
I took two comparison shots,

1810
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:50,190
one of the six and one six s and it
almost seemed to be exactly the same.

1811
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,690
It wasn't a huge deal on the front.

1812
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,660
Facing the front facing front
facing won't be a huge change.

1813
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:54,990
It'll be.

1814
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,610
It'll be all about the rear camera.

1815
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,520
So that might be the
phone to get right now.

1816
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,420
Which one?

1817
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,500
The s six active.

1818
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,610
If the pro.

1819
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,181
Here's the problem.

1820
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,830
Most people don't buy
their phones outright.

1821
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,791
They go in,

1822
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:06,571
they get a subsidy,

1823
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:07,560
they sign a contract,

1824
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:08,070
right?

1825
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,990
So if you want an essex active,

1826
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,100
you're going to have to buy it full.

1827
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:13,410
Pop off a t and t if
you're not on a t and t,

1828
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:14,244
that's the only way.

1829
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,040
Or people from Samsung when
they don't have it already.

1830
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,710
I don't have now because I think
it's because it's an atnt exclusive.

1831
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:24,390
It's kind of like a weird phone.

1832
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:24,790
Fuck.

1833
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,090
Could they not have it if they're the.

1834
00:54:26,091 --> 00:54:26,970
They're the hookup.

1835
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,640
They offered us the white glove service,

1836
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,170
the white glove service.

1837
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,420
I do not know what's happened is nobody
stays in the white glove service.

1838
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,550
We show up at the comedy store.

1839
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,200
They show up with phones that give us a
bag and then we'll go get a little hug,

1840
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,290
a handshake,

1841
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:45,990
and it's done.

1842
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,231
Yeah.

1843
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,160
They'll send you a chip.

1844
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,250
Put a little card in there.

1845
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:50,881
Yeah.

1846
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:51,714
It's um,

1847
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,983
I,

1848
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,290
I think it's a good time for phones.

1849
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:55,930
I mean,

1850
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:00,570
it's fascinating that everyone has to
compete at this level because if you look

1851
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:03,400
at the evolution of phones
over the iphone one,

1852
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:03,511
two,

1853
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:04,680
now we're only talking about.

1854
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:05,041
What was that?

1855
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,000
Two thousand nine.

1856
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,800
Yeah.

1857
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,550
It's nothing that's fucking crazy.

1858
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:13,790
So six years ago we had this little fat
thing that lasted about an hour and that

1859
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:18,870
little tiny screen and your thumb could
cover the whole screen practically.

1860
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,820
And now we have this big
beautiful mini tablets,

1861
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,640
a fablet right.

1862
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:23,850
This,

1863
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,640
is this technically a fablet
or does it have to be bigger?

1864
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:26,760
No,

1865
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:26,860
no,

1866
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:26,970
no,

1867
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,310
no.

1868
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,560
I mean you could call it that.

1869
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,160
Although China is now pushing
phones that are gigantic,

1870
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,230
so it's hard to call it seven inches.

1871
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:34,950
What?

1872
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:35,430
Yup.

1873
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:36,263
What do they have?

1874
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:36,890
Well,

1875
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,640
they have a mega.

1876
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,860
Samsung still does have a mega in Asia.

1877
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,060
They love in Asia.

1878
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,980
Huge phones in Asia.

1879
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,090
You can't get it in America.

1880
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,261
I don't believe so.

1881
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,580
Not from any of the major carriers.

1882
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,680
Crock of Shit.

1883
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,620
There's a company,

1884
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:49,841
uh,

1885
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,050
that's emerging quickly called walway.

1886
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,360
That does not feel good to say.

1887
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:55,710
But that's the name of the company.

1888
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,790
They're number three,

1889
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,690
I believe right now.

1890
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:00,660
As far as scale for a
smartphone manufacturers,

1891
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,980
they have various devices
six inches and above,

1892
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,810
like many a selection of them.

1893
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,040
These things are.

1894
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,670
Well,

1895
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,720
I mean you can imagine.

1896
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,230
What's the,

1897
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,700
what's the seven inch one called?

1898
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:13,883
I can't remember,

1899
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,460
but it's giant.

1900
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,310
I mean had many.

1901
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,660
How big it is.

1902
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,490
It is that size.

1903
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,240
While the Bezel,

1904
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,880
it's.

1905
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,450
They've done.

1906
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,330
Had been these nine.

1907
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,190
Is it nine or was it 77?

1908
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,760
Yeah,

1909
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,780
the full size ipad is nine point seven.

1910
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,853
They new one though.

1911
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:27,680
The new ones.

1912
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,810
There's a new one that's 12.

1913
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:29,350
Right.

1914
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,360
You might want that 12 point nine.

1915
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,940
Well,

1916
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,180
[inaudible] you're into
illustrations and whatnot.

1917
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:34,480
Right?

1918
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,080
Right.

1919
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,381
Yeah.

1920
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:36,280
I mean with the pen,

1921
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,060
it's unbelievable.

1922
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,191
Yeah.

1923
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:38,350
What I like drawing on paper.

1924
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,360
You would never even consider it.

1925
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,930
Yeah.

1926
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,240
I would consider it because
what I was saying earlier,

1927
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:43,811
it's like the,

1928
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:44,644
um,

1929
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,360
the ipad pro,

1930
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:50,530
the upcoming ipad has the
highest resolution display
of anything that apple's

1931
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:51,071
ever put out.

1932
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:51,880
Actually.

1933
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,630
Maybe arguably anything commercially
available in the tablet space.

1934
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:56,350
Phone space.

1935
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:56,471
Well,

1936
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:59,110
how long before someone makes
a vr and slaps that suffering?

1937
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:01,363
That would be,

1938
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:02,500
yes.

1939
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,610
Get a nice field of view.

1940
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,391
That'd be perfect.

1941
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:05,830
And they make this touch sensitive.

1942
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,090
It almost seems like that would make
more sense to have the ipad pro be touch

1943
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:13,030
sensitive instead of using a
pin that's touched sensitive.

1944
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,500
If more people are going to draw on it.

1945
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:15,400
Like this antique.

1946
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,600
It's pressure sensitive.

1947
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:18,560
I,

1948
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,870
Syntech is a drawing pad,

1949
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:20,210
uh,

1950
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,930
and meaning it can detect the pressure.

1951
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:23,230
Yeah.

1952
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:23,830
That's what it is.

1953
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,663
That's what it is.

1954
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,760
It almost seems like they're releasing
it first on the iphone six just to,

1955
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,470
you know,

1956
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,210
so the ipad pro to would have it.

1957
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,990
Yeah.

1958
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,471
I don't know.

1959
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:33,700
I it.

1960
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,440
That's a hard one for me to figure out.

1961
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,460
I've been messing around with the note
with the pen and trying my best to make

1962
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:43,650
it a part of my day and it's,

1963
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:44,860
it's a tough kind of.

1964
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,590
It's a tough transition
on a display this size,

1965
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,420
but you can imagine like the pen is
still far more precise than your finger

1966
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:53,254
could ever be.

1967
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:53,741
Right.

1968
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:57,430
Your finger could never select a single
pixel on a high resolution screen.

1969
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,683
It's not a point.

1970
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,241
So it's,

1971
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:01,230
it's what's weird is like a.

1972
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,820
If there were a little jar of ink here,

1973
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:04,080
what I,

1974
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,060
what would I choose to
write with my finger,

1975
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:11,590
dip it in there or the end that's
decided like why did we choose in the

1976
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:16,240
traditional world this and yet it seems
so bizarre to carry that forward into

1977
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,074
the digital world.

1978
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,080
I think part of it has to do with
the fact that there's no place.

1979
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,250
There's no place for it.

1980
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,570
You're using this thing on the go.

1981
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,160
There's a lot of arguments there,

1982
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:27,010
but when it comes to a tablet
that's almost always at home,

1983
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,300
always on the couch.

1984
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,413
Um,

1985
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,600
I just feel like maybe,

1986
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:31,930
I dunno,

1987
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:35,860
maybe this could shift the paradigm
and people will look at these things as

1988
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:37,060
actual notepads.

1989
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:37,721
Finally,

1990
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:38,260
I don't know.

1991
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,950
I use the note five
for awhile or the four,

1992
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:41,320
four,

1993
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,610
four,

1994
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,750
three or whatever the fear is one of them.

1995
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:44,170
Yeah.

1996
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,520
And I enjoyed the pen.

1997
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,120
You used it.

1998
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,220
I liked it for collecting images.

1999
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:49,054
I thought it was really cool.

2000
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,730
I could directly collect an image from,

2001
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,421
from a thing,

2002
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:54,790
and it would say save it
for me and store it for me.

2003
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,770
The fact that it was so easy to cut
things and paste them and save them as

2004
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:00,520
notes,

2005
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:00,910
you know,

2006
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,850
I really liked that and I really liked
you draw dicks on people's faces.

2007
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:05,860
That's also perfectly happy with that.

2008
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:09,280
I look at my one note picture that
I have in here and it's just a dick.

2009
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,620
That was the other thing
that I really liked.

2010
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:13,960
It actually linked up with evernote,

2011
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,100
so um,

2012
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,180
when I would draw,

2013
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:16,900
um,

2014
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,800
my notes out,

2015
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,880
I would say something,

2016
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:22,040
I would write like comedy notes out
and then it would it with evernote

2017
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,220
and then I would look at it as an actual
drawing as the actual me writing the

2018
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,240
physical words.

2019
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,970
I still have it saved
up on evernote and it's,

2020
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:32,990
I like it a lot.

2021
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,580
But you don't miss,

2022
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,170
you don't miss not having it though.

2023
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,650
Depends.

2024
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,020
You're right.

2025
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,780
I don't miss it that much,

2026
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:39,550
but if I,

2027
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:41,570
it's not as much,

2028
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,680
like I don't miss it as much as I
like this phone better than that.

2029
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,210
I understand what you like to see this.

2030
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:48,470
I used to have them like that,

2031
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:49,360
so I would draw.

2032
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,193
That's cool.

2033
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:50,601
Yeah,

2034
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:51,710
I mean it saved them.

2035
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,061
Yeah,

2036
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:53,360
there is.

2037
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,193
I mean there is,

2038
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,460
there is something.

2039
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:55,991
Yeah.

2040
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:58,910
Then he gets through them so much
easier than you could have notebook.

2041
00:59:58,911 --> 00:59:59,480
Yes.

2042
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,800
And then just write it down like that.

2043
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,790
There are definitely,

2044
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:03,200
there are definitely advantages.

2045
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:05,630
It's just about getting over
this hurdle of usability.

2046
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,940
It's kind of like a smart watches as well.

2047
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,440
I don't know if you've tried any of those,

2048
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:11,030
like apple watch or anything like that.

2049
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,980
I can't get into it.

2050
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:13,380
Yeah,

2051
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,320
you get into that at all.

2052
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:15,560
If I was given one,

2053
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:16,580
I wouldn't be into it,

2054
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:17,414
but I just can't.

2055
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,590
It's too much money for me.

2056
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,311
Oh well,

2057
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,390
mine's cuts what it is.

2058
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:21,771
Yeah.

2059
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:25,820
For a lot of people become much more
days or the one I want is about $800.

2060
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:26,361
$700.

2061
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,400
Like the Middle One's stupid one.

2062
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:29,630
That's like 25 grand.

2063
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:30,480
That's like made a goal.

2064
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,570
It's around 16,000,

2065
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:32,960
I believe.

2066
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,760
What an asshole you would have to be by.

2067
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:40,930
The weird thing about that too is you're
going to sell a super luxury $16,000

2068
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,230
watch.

2069
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:47,230
Don't you want other people to know that
it's a $16,000 because it looks exactly

2070
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:48,860
like every other Apple Watch.

2071
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:49,941
You know what I mean?

2072
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:53,810
Like if so what is just the metal
it's made out of has just made a gold.

2073
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:55,780
But there's this,

2074
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,140
there's a market for that shit.

2075
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:57,651
Oh yeah.

2076
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:58,061
They sold it.

2077
01:00:58,061 --> 01:01:00,230
They sold out in China
in the first 24 hours.

2078
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,040
You know,

2079
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,850
there was an article recently that I
read about Beverly Hills that there's an

2080
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:05,870
insane amount.

2081
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,561
Something like,

2082
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:11,561
I think they were saying something will
be 25 and 29 percent of all real estate

2083
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,200
in Beverly Hills is being bought up by
people from Saudi Arabia and Beverly

2084
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,620
Hills and beverage in Beverly Hills.

2085
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:20,220
Oh,

2086
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:20,661
excuse me,

2087
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:21,620
Saudi Arabia and China.

2088
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,800
Oh,

2089
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,101
okay.

2090
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:22,610
Yeah.

2091
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:27,610
And that like literally that entire area
has been purchased by foreign companies

2092
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:30,980
or foreign countries.

2093
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:35,270
These people that have ungodly
amounts of money because of oil money.

2094
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,830
So like we went to A.

2095
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:37,730
I talked about this recently,

2096
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,420
went to the steak place Beverly Hills and
there was a guy that they're importing

2097
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:44,630
cars from Saudi Arabia for the summer.

2098
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,410
They call them,

2099
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,180
they call it Saudi summer and they come
down here because in the summer there

2100
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:50,630
it's 150 fucking degrees.

2101
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,240
They come down here and they drive.

2102
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:56,570
They're unregistered cars
around Beverly Hills.

2103
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:57,470
These million dollar,

2104
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:58,161
big Gaudy Va.

2105
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:58,910
Ron's.

2106
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,850
So they have these bugatti véRonique and
all these fucking super million dollar

2107
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:06,851
cars with saudi plates and one and I was
with my friend who's from Iran and he,

2108
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,760
he speaks a persian and farsi and he can,

2109
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,870
he can read arabic and
farsi is what they speak,

2110
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,920
whatever I think.

2111
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,830
So he can read arabic and he
said it says palace on it.

2112
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,780
It said palace in the license plate.

2113
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,890
And it said to,

2114
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:23,221
to,

2115
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:23,730
to,

2116
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:24,001
to,

2117
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:24,271
to,

2118
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:26,190
to like it was all twos.

2119
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,950
So it's like the prince probably
because they couldn't get one.

2120
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:29,091
One,

2121
01:02:29,091 --> 01:02:29,301
one,

2122
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:29,471
one,

2123
01:02:29,471 --> 01:02:29,591
one.

2124
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:30,630
One says the king.

2125
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:30,870
Yeah,

2126
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,140
yeah,

2127
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,530
yeah.

2128
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,010
Like this guy has fucking
one point $5,000,000 car.

2129
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:36,810
this isn't even registered in America.

2130
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,290
And he's driving around and valet
parking it in front of the steak place.

2131
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,070
I'm like,

2132
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:41,760
this is a,

2133
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,490
it's a strange coopting of this area,

2134
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,140
But I like this because it's such,

2135
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,780
it's such a like a name place.

2136
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:52,500
There's a high value to
that beverly hills name.

2137
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:52,980
Right.

2138
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,940
So because of that,

2139
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,420
like they said that some
ungodly percentage of all homes,

2140
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:01,530
over $10,000,000 are being purchased by
rich people from Saudi Arabia and China.

2141
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,030
Yeah.

2142
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,050
They just scooping them up
and not even living in them.

2143
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,230
I think there's a push to sort of,

2144
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,123
uh,

2145
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:13,200
evacuate some of the money from those
environments because there's an uneasiness

2146
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:16,380
about what happens in the
future and those economies.

2147
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,310
So you get yourself diversified.

2148
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,340
Yeah.

2149
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,350
But if we're getting lucrative,

2150
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,310
you get lucrative.

2151
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,383
People were tweeting,

2152
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,370
were tweeting that to me today.

2153
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,150
People were tweeting to me that this
guy tweeted to me that he works at a

2154
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,380
restaurant and then,

2155
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:31,560
uh,

2156
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,480
all the people that
work at that restaurant,

2157
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:33,991
we yelling out,

2158
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:34,824
let's get luke,

2159
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,940
luke,

2160
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,420
we begin.

2161
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:39,180
I want to know where the tee shirt
is because we need to make it.

2162
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:39,480
Yeah.

2163
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,420
I think there's a few people
that would pick that up.

2164
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:42,254
Lucrative.

2165
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,710
But yeah man,

2166
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,110
this,

2167
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:51,930
the money that would cost for that little
$25,000 watch has nothing for those

2168
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:52,501
kinds of people.

2169
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:54,480
And that would be the instant
thing they would want.

2170
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,610
They would want that high end thing.

2171
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,630
It's funny you talked about,

2172
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,160
you talked about the license plates.

2173
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,110
I can't remember where I watched this.

2174
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:04,260
I don't know if it's a documentary or
just a clip about the bidding that goes on

2175
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:09,261
in dubai for the specific specialized
license plates like exactly like you said,

2176
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:10,650
the lower than number.

2177
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,920
So having the car isn't prestigious enough
because everybody's got one that's so

2178
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:20,400
they'll fucking auctions for
like license plate number one,

2179
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,120
number two,

2180
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,960
number three,

2181
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,220
and the,

2182
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:23,581
you know,

2183
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:27,780
it's in the millions of dollars because
when you get to the like to the crazy

2184
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,060
level of status and whatnot,

2185
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,430
things get bonkers really quick,

2186
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,201
you know,

2187
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:33,821
like as far as,

2188
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:34,654
as far as what,

2189
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,030
what you need to do,

2190
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:39,480
how absurd things need to be for
you to make a statement anymore.

2191
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,063
So anyways,

2192
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,300
well in that culture,

2193
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:46,040
if that's what you're going for is only
like the most obvious form of material,

2194
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,460
like rampant materialism.

2195
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,090
Yes.

2196
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:48,320
You know,

2197
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:48,960
if you're,

2198
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,160
if that's what you're going for.

2199
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:50,461
Yeah,

2200
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:51,181
that's what you want.

2201
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,510
You want to get like the
number one license plate.

2202
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,540
Get him.

2203
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,450
He's got a boot guy.

2204
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,690
He has a $5,000,000 license plate.

2205
01:04:57,691 --> 01:04:58,500
There you go.

2206
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,370
That's so stupid.

2207
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:00,950
So.

2208
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:02,480
Well we're act.

2209
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:04,290
What if you have that much money?

2210
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,100
Is it though?

2211
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:05,933
That's the thing.

2212
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,190
You have more money than
you could ever spent,

2213
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:08,401
right?

2214
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:10,020
But why would you want that license plate?

2215
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:11,783
That's a good point.

2216
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,661
That much money.

2217
01:05:12,661 --> 01:05:14,280
And you're still trying that hard.

2218
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:16,230
What kind of an environment
are you competing in?

2219
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,530
What kind of you trying to conjure
up to bring into your life?

2220
01:05:19,531 --> 01:05:20,320
Skip point.

2221
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:20,560
Who?

2222
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:20,800
The.

2223
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,090
Who are you trying to impress?

2224
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,580
Yeah.

2225
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,110
You already have a fucking giant yacht.

2226
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,570
You have a giant fucking house.

2227
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,550
You have a one point $7,000,000 car.

2228
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,760
Does anybody look at your license
plate and go look at doula?

2229
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:31,690
That regular fucking license plate.

2230
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,970
You can even afford the license plate.

2231
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:34,780
Yeah.

2232
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,613
You're not in the club.

2233
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,011
Yeah.

2234
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:36,970
That's not allowed in.

2235
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:37,341
I.

2236
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:39,910
I think it's more a thing of like in,

2237
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,640
in order to maintain your competitiveness,

2238
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:46,000
you have to keep on
approaching these things.

2239
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:49,060
That shouldn't be attainable
like anybody working in anything.

2240
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:49,901
Right.

2241
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:50,441
But I think.

2242
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:53,500
I think that you have to put these
challenges in front of yourself,

2243
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:56,620
like I got to get the extra million
for the right license plate.

2244
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:58,000
That's just a weird,

2245
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,490
a weirdo version of that,

2246
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:01,030
isn't it?

2247
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,421
It is.

2248
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:05,590
It's all weirdo versions because
like labels are critical.

2249
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,800
Like people want labels like very,

2250
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,160
like someone was making fun
of me because I have a lexus.

2251
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,650
What are you going to drive an alexis for?

2252
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:16,570
Why don't you have a mercedes
or bmw or something like that.

2253
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:16,751
I'm like,

2254
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:17,650
this is a great car.

2255
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:19,480
What's wrong with you?

2256
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,210
It's like nobody's impressed by alexis.

2257
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:22,541
You know,

2258
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:22,990
you pull up,

2259
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,010
that's a toyota,

2260
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,213
you know,

2261
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,010
japanese car guess,

2262
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,750
but fucking so what?

2263
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:29,490
Yeah,

2264
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,970
what is wrong with people that,

2265
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:32,530
that becomes a giant issue.

2266
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:33,783
I don't know.

2267
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:35,283
Branding,

2268
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,010
branding,

2269
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:36,431
branding.

2270
01:06:36,431 --> 01:06:37,300
It's strange.

2271
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:37,960
It is.

2272
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,640
Because I was in one of those.

2273
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:40,474
Um,

2274
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,433
what are they called?

2275
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,460
The whatever.

2276
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:43,420
The fucking high end.

2277
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:45,700
Hyundai is now a genesis.

2278
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:46,660
Yeah.

2279
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,950
I was in one of those and I was like,

2280
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:50,160
this is a fucking great car.

2281
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,090
It feels like a mercedes in here,

2282
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,920
but I wouldn't drive it
because it's a hyundai.

2283
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,580
Yep,

2284
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,480
I was thinking that.

2285
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,370
I was thinking like,

2286
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,560
what would I draw?

2287
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,110
I mean I probably would,

2288
01:06:59,111 --> 01:07:00,390
but it's.

2289
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,780
Sunday is like a v,

2290
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,200
it's hard to get excited about that.

2291
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:08,230
Whereas at least lexus is
like higher end than that.

2292
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:08,570
Yeah.

2293
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:08,951
Know what I mean?

2294
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:09,131
Like,

2295
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:12,070
so I'm guilty of the thing I'm mocking.

2296
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:12,460
Really.

2297
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,480
I think everybody is.

2298
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,290
I think we,

2299
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:17,080
I think it's a way I've said this before,

2300
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,840
I think that the,

2301
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:19,060
uh,

2302
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,580
a person who has a certain,

2303
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:22,391
you know,

2304
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:26,890
certain access to a particular
way of life that the shortcut,

2305
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,710
the rich guys shortcut to buying,

2306
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,160
to buying the right thing
is to buy an expensive one.

2307
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:33,730
Right?

2308
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,840
You walk into a store,

2309
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,100
they've got a bunch of shirts.

2310
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:37,120
Which one should I have?

2311
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,320
Well,

2312
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,950
I can bypass the whole research
structure by just buying the best,

2313
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:42,661
you know,

2314
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:45,040
like the average person when
they're going to purchase a car,

2315
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,143
they spend,

2316
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,730
I think I heard this stat recently,

2317
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:53,530
it's about 52 days from when they get
the idea that they need a new car to the

2318
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:55,660
point at which they make
the purchase researching.

2319
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,280
There's various stages throughout.

2320
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,480
It's actually getting shorter though,

2321
01:07:58,481 --> 01:07:59,620
which is kind of strange.

2322
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,390
I think the internet is getting better,

2323
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,224
to be honest with you.

2324
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:06,690
I will youtube videos on
reviews of cars are awesome.

2325
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:07,960
They're so critical.

2326
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:08,261
Yeah.

2327
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:10,960
And so I think that's really
expediting the process,

2328
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:11,794
but uh,

2329
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:12,761
but anyway,

2330
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:13,061
yeah,

2331
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,190
I think that generally speaking,

2332
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,200
those who have an abundance of wealth
don't have as much time usually as usually

2333
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:21,051
the way it works.

2334
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:26,051
So you kind of try to bypass that whole
process by buying the best thing and

2335
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:27,230
that's where brands come in.

2336
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:31,880
Brands almost help you in a way have
you sort of through their prestige and

2337
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:36,380
their established symbol that I know if
I get that I'm good and I don't need to

2338
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:37,610
ask anybody about that.

2339
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:38,121
I don't need to,

2340
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:38,360
you know,

2341
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,190
I don't need to pull
my friends or whatever.

2342
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:40,970
It's like a,

2343
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:41,751
it's like a hack.

2344
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,310
It's the quickest way towards that.

2345
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:44,330
It's like a fancy,

2346
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:44,810
uh,

2347
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,220
fancy liquor or uh,

2348
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:46,940
you know,

2349
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,880
the right cigar or in,

2350
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:49,371
you know what I mean?

2351
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:53,660
It's like you can find an example of
that in almost every product category.

2352
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:57,530
It's the same reason why
samsung is samsung now.

2353
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,640
It took so much time in so much money
for that to be an acceptable brand.

2354
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:04,610
They make weapons to probably.

2355
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,720
I'm pretty sure they make weapons,

2356
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,583
I think.

2357
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,390
I think in Korea they make everything,

2358
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:11,480
but I'm pretty sure samsung
makes missiles or some shit.

2359
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,070
Let's say samsung makes weapons.

2360
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:13,904
Let's see.

2361
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,620
You know you're probably.

2362
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,700
You're probably right.

2363
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:17,480
I know,

2364
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:17,751
I know.

2365
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:20,750
They make all kinds of things in
Korea that never make it here.

2366
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:24,680
Samsung also makes weapons
checkout all they do.

2367
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:25,491
Jesus christ,

2368
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:26,630
they make fucking tanks.

2369
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:27,591
Yeah.

2370
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:28,424
Vehicles.

2371
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,110
Samsung tech,

2372
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:35,170
low tech tech when
surveillance area narcotics.

2373
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,760
This is fascinating.

2374
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,310
Op doe electronics.

2375
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:41,144
I don't know what that is.

2376
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,850
Automations and weapons
technology company.

2377
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,590
It's a subsidiary of samsung group,

2378
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:46,790
huh?

2379
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:47,031
Yeah.

2380
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:48,170
They make fucking weapons.

2381
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,750
They even make jet engines.

2382
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:51,920
They make tanks.

2383
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,560
Arv is and even jet engines.

2384
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:55,310
Yeah.

2385
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:59,630
I mean those big technology companies
got to diversify your portfolio.

2386
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,470
Oh yeah.

2387
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:01,110
Get lucrative.

2388
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:01,943
Got to get loose.

2389
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,530
That's the best way to get lucrative.

2390
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:04,101
Make weapons.

2391
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:05,110
People are always looking at clothes.

2392
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:05,970
Shit.

2393
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,500
It's always someone,

2394
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,780
some part of the world.

2395
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:11,330
It's like if I just had something that
could blow these motherfuckers up over

2396
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:11,860
there,

2397
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,260
it'd be all good that that was the
real game changer when it came to war.

2398
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:15,800
Right.

2399
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,110
Once I get to start blowing shit up
and they weren't anywhere near it.

2400
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,273
Yeah.

2401
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,630
When london started getting
bombed during the world war ii,

2402
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:27,740
even world war one when they started
launching bombs and using chemical gas and

2403
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,580
essentially killing people at a long
distance without having to see them.

2404
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:31,860
Yeah.

2405
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,360
Yeah.

2406
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,520
And now we're even further past that.

2407
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,020
Like really game controller in a.

2408
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:36,351
Yeah.

2409
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:37,310
Well that's why I wanted to bring that up.

2410
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,630
Like the drones,

2411
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,550
like now they're having drones.

2412
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:44,090
Did you see that one guy that stitched
together all those drones with some sort

2413
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:44,924
of software?

2414
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,470
Yes.

2415
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,230
I saw that.

2416
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,880
Like that guy's kind of
bypassing all the area.

2417
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:52,490
Not as rules because those rules,

2418
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:54,380
like if you want to get a helicopter,

2419
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:56,330
you have to get a helicopter license.

2420
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:57,164
You have to,

2421
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:57,501
you know,

2422
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:57,790
the.

2423
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,510
You have to tell people
where you're flying.

2424
01:10:59,570 --> 01:10:59,810
Yeah,

2425
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:00,230
we're at a,

2426
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:04,400
we're in a strange point right now
where technology is progressing at this

2427
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:08,570
insane speed and the legal system doesn't,

2428
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,370
takes way longer than that.

2429
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,340
There's not enough time to go
through all the steps necessary

2430
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,000
on that side of it to catch up with
the technology as it's happening.

2431
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:18,600
Drones,

2432
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,150
what was that story the other day where
there were all those drones up in the

2433
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:21,990
air and they couldn't,

2434
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:26,010
so the helicopters couldn't get to a scene
where someone needed to be airlifted.

2435
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:26,400
Yeah,

2436
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,151
they're here,

2437
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:27,480
right?

2438
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:27,661
Yeah.

2439
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:28,370
They were using.

2440
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:32,520
People were using video drones to take
videos of something that was going on.

2441
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,001
What was that?

2442
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:33,860
An accident or something?

2443
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:35,880
I think it was an
accident in a helicopter.

2444
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:38,790
Needed to get in there to pull the person
out and they couldn't because of the

2445
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:40,350
drums and they couldn't
because of the drunk.

2446
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:40,771
Yeah,

2447
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:42,750
well they're going to have
to have drone blockers.

2448
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:45,450
The way movie theaters should
have cell phone blocker,

2449
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,140
you know,

2450
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,810
like people are on their fucking
phones and movie theaters all the time.

2451
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,650
Yeah.

2452
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:50,880
One of the most annoying things ever.

2453
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,001
Well,

2454
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:54,300
you're going to have that those
block or know how you do it because.

2455
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:54,870
Yeah,

2456
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,010
I mean because it's a.

2457
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:57,540
It's a radio frequency,

2458
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:57,781
right?

2459
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:57,990
Yeah.

2460
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,390
It's just,

2461
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:58,570
it's,

2462
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:00,150
it's a rf from your.

2463
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:03,630
There's going to be seeking to destroy
type joint trends that you just like

2464
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:06,330
throw in the air and they just go after
these drones and somehow knock them out

2465
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:07,050
of commission,

2466
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:10,090
but you like aerial
warfare over the freeway.

2467
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:11,800
Drop on little kids' head.

2468
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:16,140
I'm a baby gets killed by a falling
drone that was taken out by a company.

2469
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:16,800
Oh yeah.

2470
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,370
I was on the beach the other day just
hanging out and it was a pretty empty

2471
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:22,820
beach in santa barbara and
I just heard this like,

2472
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,273
I was like,

2473
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,230
what is that noise?

2474
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:28,650
I look up and there's just a drone
sitting there right above me.

2475
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:29,100
Like,

2476
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:29,491
I don't know,

2477
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:30,281
super high up,

2478
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:31,560
but you can almost barely see it.

2479
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,170
And then it just flew
away and I looked around.

2480
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,090
I didn't see anybody growing up far.

2481
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:36,511
Can they go?

2482
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:37,344
No,

2483
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,251
like a mile,

2484
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:38,520
right?

2485
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,270
God,

2486
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:44,190
I mean I think it probably depends
on like a military ones or do like a

2487
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:44,610
personal,

2488
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,443
not personal,

2489
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,030
no personal one I think is still
relatively line of sight like it.

2490
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:49,670
You have to,

2491
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:52,470
I think the minute you can't make
it out is probably out of range.

2492
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,910
Just falls out of the sky.

2493
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,280
That's the craziest part of the drone.

2494
01:12:56,281 --> 01:12:58,320
People are going to get really
upset with us right now,

2495
01:12:58,321 --> 01:12:59,850
but I don't know what the
fuck we're talking about.

2496
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,200
Not just that,

2497
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:06,201
but it's a very sensitive subject matter
because these enthusiasts are super

2498
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:07,021
into it.

2499
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:10,590
Like a lot of people in guys like us come
and we talk about only the shitty part

2500
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:10,831
of it,

2501
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:14,160
like them falling out of the sky and
killing people and they think that's going

2502
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,540
to influence government,

2503
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,990
which will then take away their freedom
to do that thing just like everything

2504
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:19,290
else.

2505
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:19,640
Right?

2506
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,560
But people that love doing something
and they want to protect that freedom.

2507
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,790
Uh,

2508
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:24,980
but I,

2509
01:13:24,981 --> 01:13:25,440
I like,

2510
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,011
for example,

2511
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:28,950
I've done videos on
these little toy drones.

2512
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,120
They're there nothing to,

2513
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:30,810
you know,

2514
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:33,060
you fly them indoors or whatever.

2515
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:37,830
And if you get any of the terminology
wrong or you talk about them being

2516
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,690
dangerous in any way
or anything like that,

2517
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:44,460
you're going to have an entire script
in your comments actually in about like

2518
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:44,880
that.

2519
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,440
You're fucking it up for us.

2520
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:46,951
We,

2521
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:47,311
you know,

2522
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:47,540
uh,

2523
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:47,780
you're,

2524
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,710
you're influencing the public opinion.

2525
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:51,320
You should know what you're
talking about before,

2526
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,170
right?

2527
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:52,710
You know,

2528
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:53,220
they do.

2529
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,090
They do have a point,

2530
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:58,980
but so does the public at large and
seeing a flying thing above their head and

2531
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:03,840
wondering if the connection between the
thing controlling it and it itself is

2532
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,120
stable enough to keep it up there.

2533
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:06,391
Well,

2534
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:07,051
not only that,

2535
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:07,441
how about the,

2536
01:14:07,441 --> 01:14:08,850
just the privacy intrusion.

2537
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:11,100
If you're some person who's
sunbathing some woman,

2538
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,680
oh right,

2539
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,040
you have

2540
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,940
a fence.

2541
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:15,520
You like to sunbathe naked
because you're in a private,

2542
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:19,090
you know you're in the backyard and no
one can see in and you want to take your

2543
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:21,280
top off and then get your tits tanned.

2544
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,690
You can't do that anymore.

2545
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:26,260
Who does almost four k video
on your tits now on in there.

2546
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,370
And zoom in on it.

2547
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:32,790
And then also the oculus rift effect
because when I was on that a scifi show,

2548
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,970
we did some things where we took drones
and we strapped cameras to these drones

2549
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:42,100
and we flew over the top of these
trees in the pacific northwest.

2550
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,110
There was like looking
for bigfoot episode,

2551
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,350
were flying around looking for
bigfoot with a fucking drunk.

2552
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:49,900
Now obviously more of
a goof than anything,

2553
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,750
but the goggles were fucking crazy.

2554
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,420
So you were seeing it's
vision through vr yet?

2555
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:55,601
Right?

2556
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:56,530
So I'm watch.

2557
01:14:56,531 --> 01:15:01,360
I'm literally feels like
I'm flying because my field
of vision is just like the

2558
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:02,500
vr field division.

2559
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,550
And you're super wide angle to the
camera that's attached to this drone.

2560
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:07,330
Yeah.

2561
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:07,900
That's awesome.

2562
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,231
Yeah,

2563
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:08,651
I mean it's,

2564
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:09,970
I mean it's going to get real,

2565
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,320
real strange.

2566
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:12,160
And again,

2567
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:12,880
like you said,

2568
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,630
the regulations have not caught up to the
technology and technology's gonna move

2569
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:19,150
way faster than these dummies
that are making these,

2570
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,040
these registry,

2571
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,490
the regulations in the first place.

2572
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:22,930
They don't really know what's going on.

2573
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,350
Oh,

2574
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,183
and how do you,

2575
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:24,491
again,

2576
01:15:24,491 --> 01:15:28,360
how do you get a person to get to be
interested in getting into government to

2577
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:29,830
write these regulations?

2578
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,680
Who's actually familiar with the thing,

2579
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:35,420
like why in god's name would they
want to do this at that point?

2580
01:15:35,421 --> 01:15:36,670
And they have to get elected.

2581
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:37,460
They have to.

2582
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:41,380
It's a whole process of
getting intelligent people
into the spot they should be

2583
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:41,740
in,

2584
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,540
is too slow,

2585
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:46,630
too convoluted and the world
is changing too quickly.

2586
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,870
So the people who make the laws would
have to rely on experts like they have to

2587
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:50,800
hire people,

2588
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,270
except who are those experts?

2589
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,080
Water,

2590
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,100
their agenda,

2591
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,240
what's their credentials?

2592
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:59,650
And essentially this young
kids that haven't even
graduated from high school yet

2593
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:03,640
that know as much or more than anyone
these people going to hire in the first

2594
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:03,880
place.

2595
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,301
Exactly.

2596
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:07,000
Like these comments that you're getting
these detailed comments crittenton you

2597
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,630
think it might be from like that
14 year old kid in fucking dallas.

2598
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:12,550
They got arrested today because,

2599
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:12,850
uh,

2600
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,200
his teacher thought he was
making a bomb because he made,

2601
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,810
made a homemade clock.

2602
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,591
And.

2603
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:21,070
But he happened to be making an
inventing things while brown,

2604
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,020
and that's very dangerous,

2605
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,500
especially with an arab last name,

2606
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:26,590
and especially in Texas.

2607
01:16:26,591 --> 01:16:28,360
His name is ahmed mohammed.

2608
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,670
Almost as bad as barack obama,

2609
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:31,961
barack hussein,

2610
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:32,411
obama.

2611
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:32,621
I mean,

2612
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,320
it's like fucking for people
looking for something bad.

2613
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:35,501
Like,

2614
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:36,090
oh,

2615
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,080
who you know his fucking middle name.

2616
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:40,960
That's,

2617
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:41,360
that's a,

2618
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:41,800
that's a,

2619
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,280
that's a shitty story.

2620
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:44,350
It's a terrible story.

2621
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:47,140
The kid got arrested with
a fucking nasa shirt on.

2622
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:47,981
Dude.

2623
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:48,790
I noticed the ig,

2624
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,910
that's where my head went at the
exact same time when I saw the photo.

2625
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:52,660
I was like,

2626
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,460
he's wearing a neck that way.

2627
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:57,190
I don't know why that stood out
to me and made me especially sad.

2628
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,210
The nasa shirt,

2629
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,440
the kid's a genius.

2630
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:00,101
That's what it is.

2631
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:00,351
They say.

2632
01:17:00,351 --> 01:17:00,671
Yeah,

2633
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:01,061
I see.

2634
01:17:01,061 --> 01:17:01,391
It's like,

2635
01:17:01,391 --> 01:17:02,410
it's his own radios.

2636
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,650
It sort of implied a
passion for the thing,

2637
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,350
for the thing that he got arrested for.

2638
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:08,770
Yeah.

2639
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:10,370
Well pure racism.

2640
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,860
It's racism and its
purest form and you know,

2641
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:17,600
it's just amazing that someone wasn't
skilled enough to talk to this kid

2642
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,160
socially skilled enough to go,

2643
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,000
um,

2644
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,751
what do you got there?

2645
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:21,321
What's going on,

2646
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:21,770
man?

2647
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,120
And so he could have probably gone,

2648
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:23,300
well,

2649
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,850
I make my own computers
and I make my own this.

2650
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,240
And what I've done here is I've strung
together all these electronics and built

2651
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:31,580
a clock and I've figured
out how to do that.

2652
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,390
I mean,

2653
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:35,480
you can easily talk to
someone if you're skilled.

2654
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,340
Oh yeah.

2655
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,120
And was a smooth talker.

2656
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:38,540
Yes.

2657
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,111
And they would get.

2658
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:41,780
And then the kid who wouldn't feel bad
at all and he could probably explain how

2659
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:43,640
he did it and what he likes to do.

2660
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:44,061
And you'd be like,

2661
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:47,120
well you are an amazing
student and congratulated.

2662
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,740
Would you mind showing that
to the class and you know,

2663
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:52,070
and then you've got a positive
out of this instead of like,

2664
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:52,771
oh look at him.

2665
01:17:52,771 --> 01:17:54,980
He's a little brown kid and
he's making a fucking bomb.

2666
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,210
He's trying to kill everybody.

2667
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,440
He's 14.

2668
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:58,730
It's,

2669
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,340
how would you go look
through the database?

2670
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:01,121
Any 14 year olds,

2671
01:18:01,121 --> 01:18:01,970
suicide bombers,

2672
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:04,460
these are there any that
we've ever had in dallas?

2673
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:04,731
Oh,

2674
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:05,564
not here.

2675
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:05,810
Yeah,

2676
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:06,830
I mean in the middle east.

2677
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:07,500
In the middle east.

2678
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,080
They've the martyrs of.

2679
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,410
There was a horrible fucking documentary
that I watched where they had this

2680
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:15,490
school and they had all
these kids on the wall,

2681
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:20,300
the school that were strapped up with
these explosion vests and it said today's

2682
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:22,580
children are tomorrow's holy martyrs.

2683
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:22,741
Right,

2684
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:23,400
right.

2685
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,140
Yeah.

2686
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,400
That's some shocking shit.

2687
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:25,970
Yeah,

2688
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,340
it is shocking shit.

2689
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,310
This kid.

2690
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,890
I mean it's probably the best thing
that happened to this kid though.

2691
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,360
You see the president's tweet to them,

2692
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,640
know what the president said.

2693
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:34,131
President says,

2694
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:34,680
cool clock.

2695
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,380
I made went to bring
that to the white house.

2696
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:38,390
We should inspire more kids
like you to do science.

2697
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:39,740
It's what makes America great.

2698
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,380
We should find out who the fuck
are people are that arrested him?

2699
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,510
I don't know if that's healthy.

2700
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,620
That's healthy for them.

2701
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,060
They need to know what it feels like.

2702
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,361
I know,

2703
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:48,590
but the world say,

2704
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:49,160
hey,

2705
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,730
hey man,

2706
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:50,320
you're.

2707
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,370
You're on a global platform now.

2708
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:55,940
You're not just in Texas like you've
been doing some racial Texas shit,

2709
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:56,990
but don't you feel like.

2710
01:18:56,991 --> 01:19:01,550
But don't you feel like sometimes the
wild goose chase breeds like a weird kind

2711
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:02,930
of internet violent?

2712
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,960
Yes mentality or at least a mob like
everyone let's get like the threats that

2713
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,360
the lion killer was getting,

2714
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:12,231
you know,

2715
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:14,930
like I'm gonna what I'm
gonna do to your children.

2716
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:15,440
And it's like,

2717
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,071
how does that,

2718
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,750
where did we ask,

2719
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:18,980
how do we escalate there?

2720
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,060
And it's because when,

2721
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:22,880
when you're in this
chamber of all this noise,

2722
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:27,881
people sort of elevate their level of
how much of what they're willing to do to

2723
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,280
counteract this thing
that they disagree with.

2724
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,810
Yeah.

2725
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:32,150
You know,

2726
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,230
well this is also,

2727
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,170
there's a lot of people that
are super upset with their life.

2728
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,580
Their life is not good.

2729
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,120
Right.

2730
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:43,120
And they are looking for anything to be
mad at and point their anger towards and

2731
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:43,670
any,

2732
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:44,720
anything that's justified,

2733
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:45,830
like obviously the lion killer,

2734
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:47,510
that's a nice big green light.

2735
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:48,081
You know,

2736
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:49,550
this guy shot a fucking lion.

2737
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:53,570
It took 40 hours for the thing to die
and then they had to go in and kill it on

2738
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:54,770
some private,

2739
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,360
some public property.

2740
01:19:56,361 --> 01:19:57,090
That's not even.

2741
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,280
You're not even allowed to hunt there.

2742
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,850
He had a collar on the.

2743
01:19:59,851 --> 01:20:00,860
Cut the collar off.

2744
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,020
The guy was a poacher.

2745
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,060
He has a history of poaching.

2746
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:05,300
He poached a bear.

2747
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,190
He lied about where he shot.

2748
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,190
He shot it for like 40

2749
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,750
miles away from where he said he did.

2750
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:13,350
There was all sorts of shit about that
guy that was like easy to target on.

2751
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,020
So then the fucking hate is free.

2752
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,700
You got a green light.

2753
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:19,820
You just close your eyes
and hit the gas ball.

2754
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:22,080
Jared jared from subway.

2755
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:22,914
That's another one,

2756
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:23,880
but you know what I mean?

2757
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,430
That's not just legit.

2758
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:29,250
The being how much hate
is there towards that guy?

2759
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:33,310
I didn't see the kind of death threats
towards jared from subway that I saw at

2760
01:20:33,311 --> 01:20:34,270
towards the lion killer.

2761
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:39,480
I've never seen anything like the lion
killer thing was to meet evidence of a

2762
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:42,660
complete breakdown in
social media like that was.

2763
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,170
Have you guys ever seen
black mirror [inaudible]?

2764
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,350
The david show from the uk.

2765
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:46,801
Yeah,

2766
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:48,150
so I've only seen one episode.

2767
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:49,890
The one with the pig got
out of the first one.

2768
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:50,290
Yeah,

2769
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:50,850
so I saw.

2770
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:51,121
Yeah.

2771
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:51,690
Well that's.

2772
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:54,480
That's the kind of example I'm
talking about is it seems like,

2773
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,860
but when this is the signal to
noise ratio gets fucked up enough,

2774
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:01,980
we sort of lose our faculties
like your whole feed.

2775
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,090
How the fuck is my.

2776
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,040
I didn't sign up for a
day's worth of line tweets.

2777
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,640
You also have to deal with the numbers
of humans that are able to communicate

2778
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:12,474
freely.

2779
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:15,000
That's the signal to noise ratio.

2780
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,050
Like you talked about earlier,

2781
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,280
that the real kicker is you used to
be to be able to get on television,

2782
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:25,560
you had to be walter cronkite and
here's the news and you had to be an

2783
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:29,250
established person who had a degree in
journalism or a history as a journalist.

2784
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:34,740
Now you just have to get on an application
that anyone can download in two

2785
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:37,410
seconds on your phone and
you just start talking shit,

2786
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:37,820
you know,

2787
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:38,760
I'm going to come to your house.

2788
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:38,941
I'm gonna.

2789
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:39,990
Throw your kids into wood chipper,

2790
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:40,980
like all that shit they were saying too.

2791
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:44,340
That guy cory knowlton that shot the
rhino at radio lab episode that we're

2792
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:45,183
talking about.

2793
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,560
I mean they said some horrible,

2794
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:51,180
horrible shit to him and it's because
they felt like they could and those are

2795
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:51,961
the same people.

2796
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:53,340
They're angry already,

2797
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,960
like they're already angry.

2798
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:59,610
This is just a nice target for that anger
and it's not balanced and it doesn't

2799
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:01,140
make sense and it's not,

2800
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:02,960
it's not rational the,

2801
01:22:02,961 --> 01:22:03,151
the,

2802
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,740
the focus of this anger,

2803
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:08,640
but it doesn't have to be because you
don't get to pick who you're getting that

2804
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:09,660
data from like,

2805
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:10,200
okay,

2806
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:14,100
here's a perfect example was off
us in this room and you know,

2807
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:16,680
someone had done something fucked
up like the lion killer guy.

2808
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:17,640
We would,

2809
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,360
we could have like a detailed discussion
and how we felt about it and what are

2810
01:22:21,361 --> 01:22:21,870
the,

2811
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,180
what are the actual facts about the case?

2812
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:28,080
And did you know the 28 different
lions wearing collars were,

2813
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,100
have been killed.

2814
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,270
Like it's very common.

2815
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,240
They kill ones with the collar because
once they go outside of the protected

2816
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:33,840
area,

2817
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,260
you're allowed to kill them and lions
cover a gigantic area where they hunt,

2818
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:41,790
so we would have these kinds of nuanced
discussions because you're in a room

2819
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,860
with four rational people,

2820
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,950
but think about all the fucking
idiots that you've met in your life.

2821
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,810
Think about the millions of people.

2822
01:22:48,811 --> 01:22:51,210
If you have $350 million
people in this country,

2823
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:55,260
at least one out of
100 is a fucking idiot,

2824
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,780
so that means you got 3 million,

2825
01:22:57,781 --> 01:23:02,781
500,000 fucking idiots to just smash
and they're sloppy cheese doodle covered

2826
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:06,190
fingers on keyboards

2827
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,990
and fucking spitting on their screen
and taking time to jack off in between

2828
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:15,991
tweets and they smell like shit farting
and wafting the fart up into their nose.

2829
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:19,870
They're horrible monsters
and there's millions of them.

2830
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,100
There's millions of them,

2831
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:24,250
and they will spend
their whole day tweeting,

2832
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:27,220
facebooking anytime something
horrible goes wrong.

2833
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:28,660
Now they have a green light.

2834
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:33,990
I think though that it almost feels like
even the intellectual web contributes

2835
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:37,210
by enabling those fuck ups.

2836
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:38,950
You're talking about by.

2837
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:39,670
Yeah,

2838
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:44,670
by by providing the steam necessary by
giving them that fragment that to work

2839
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:47,320
with to go with,

2840
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:50,140
well just giving them a pathway
to communicate with everybody.

2841
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:50,621
Exactly.

2842
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:50,831
So,

2843
01:23:50,831 --> 01:23:54,400
so an example of this would
be like a media headline,

2844
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:58,630
a juicy headline to get a person to
click it even though as you mentioned

2845
01:23:58,631 --> 01:23:59,110
before,

2846
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:03,220
how it would completely lack the nuance
of a proper discussion or debate,

2847
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,540
but you,

2848
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:05,380
you know,

2849
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:08,020
you pander to the lowest
common denominator,

2850
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:12,910
you want as many clicks as possible and
you're not necessarily concerned with

2851
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:13,810
the outcome of that,

2852
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:14,590
you know,

2853
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:15,423
so it's like,

2854
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
it's like if we know that those big huge
news sources that are supposed to or

2855
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:27,150
once upon a time where it
were a new nuanced or or,

2856
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,010
or meant to,

2857
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:32,920
to sort of break down the story for
you to help you understand the story.

2858
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:33,521
No,

2859
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:34,660
it's all bites now.

2860
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,120
It's all little fast moving bites,

2861
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:41,440
hot takes and so on that
formulate your opinion.

2862
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,270
So in some ways,

2863
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:43,871
yes,

2864
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:47,740
those people should be held responsible
for the things they say online,

2865
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:52,780
but it's not like the intellectual web
or the news producing web is doing the

2866
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:54,560
greatest job in,

2867
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,350
in advertising,

2868
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:58,300
the proper content,

2869
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:58,670
the,

2870
01:24:58,670 --> 01:24:59,100
the,

2871
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,920
the nuanced longform take it.

2872
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:06,820
So it's much easier to just slam out
some knee jerk type of article and get it

2873
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:07,421
out faster,

2874
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:10,900
be first as opposed to
maybe you're a day later,

2875
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:12,910
but you've had time to
gather more information.

2876
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:13,541
Those.

2877
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:13,890
Well,

2878
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:14,340
those,

2879
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:19,340
the other problem is a lot
of those traditional media
outlets have proven to be

2880
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,920
ineffective when it comes to controversial
issues like the charlie hebdo issue,

2881
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:27,490
like when charlie hebdo happened
and all those guys were killed.

2882
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:27,911
All those,

2883
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:28,300
uh,

2884
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,560
cartoonists were killed by those muslim
extremists that came in and were mad

2885
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:33,970
they were making these
cartoons and mohammed,

2886
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,100
nobody printed those fucking cartoon.

2887
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:36,550
Nope.

2888
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:37,990
The la times didn't do it.

2889
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:40,390
The New York times didn't do
at time magazine didn't do it.

2890
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:44,410
Everybody backed off on tweeting those
or taking photos and putting them online

2891
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:44,981
or putting them in there.

2892
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:45,814
Our articles,

2893
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,140
they didn't want to do it.

2894
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:51,400
So it was up to the internet and so then
it becomes a matter of when something

2895
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:55,900
is real and some things out there like
that guy who uploaded the video of him

2896
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:56,980
killing the reporters,

2897
01:25:56,981 --> 01:26:00,100
he killed the reporters when they were
on tv and upload the video of him doing

2898
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:00,730
it.

2899
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:01,421
Oh right.

2900
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:02,254
Yeah.

2901
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:03,450
Did they ever comes?

2902
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:03,980
It comes a

2903
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,210
real weird line.

2904
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,073
Like,

2905
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:06,770
you know,

2906
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:11,510
part of that discussion too was like the
way we were kind of forced to ingest it

2907
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:12,973
through autoplay.

2908
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:15,840
This was a big part of
the story was how you'll.

2909
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,940
Facebook has recently introduced autoplay,

2910
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,250
so you're scrolling and it just plays
immediately that that's another example of

2911
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:23,150
what I'm talking about,

2912
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:23,740
about the,

2913
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,000
the,

2914
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,680
the.

2915
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,530
I don't know that you could
call facebook intellectual web,

2916
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,560
but if you're a guy like zuckerberg or
someone in that office at some point you

2917
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:38,090
know that what you're doing is you're
about to introduce millions and millions

2918
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:39,590
of people to something they
probably rather not watch.

2919
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:43,850
Well that was a big deal with isis
because isis has had some of the people in

2920
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:46,190
isis or whatever you want to call it.

2921
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,050
They have had many,

2922
01:26:48,051 --> 01:26:48,291
many,

2923
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:50,720
many accounts banned because they will,

2924
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:51,570
they'll find these,

2925
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:52,490
they'll make these accounts,

2926
01:26:52,491 --> 01:26:55,880
create these accounts and start uploading
photos of people being beheaded,

2927
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:58,010
uploading videos and
people being beheaded.

2928
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:58,370
Yeah,

2929
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:02,660
and they put these on instagram or
twitter or wherever the hell they are and

2930
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:04,850
it's up to these outlets,

2931
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:05,110
these,

2932
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:09,050
these platforms to find these
things to take them down,

2933
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:13,010
but I went to a fucking isis twitter page
that somebody has sent me to and I was

2934
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:13,161
like,

2935
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:14,510
holy shit.

2936
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:15,180
That idea.

2937
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,320
People don't even know about it.

2938
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:17,840
They hadn't even taken this down yet.

2939
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:21,680
Just be headings and then there was
youtube videos that are linked to that.

2940
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:23,150
They hadn't found those yet either.

2941
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,180
The youtube videos where they were
shooting people on the ground and cutting

2942
01:27:26,181 --> 01:27:27,410
their heads off and holding their heads.

2943
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:27,651
I mean,

2944
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:29,540
they'll fold deal on youtube.

2945
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,170
Yeah.

2946
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:30,600
Well here,

2947
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,210
here's my thing is I think that battle
is kind of impossible to completely

2948
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:37,700
control the speed at which
people can put stuff up,

2949
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,590
but the autoplay thing,

2950
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,790
like half the choice to click
the button at least at a minimum.

2951
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:43,921
Yeah.

2952
01:27:43,921 --> 01:27:45,290
I talked about that a couple of weeks ago,

2953
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,320
somebody posted are,

2954
01:27:46,321 --> 01:27:48,980
I was just like looking at puppies and
stuff and then out of nowhere it was a

2955
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:52,520
woman in a car accident with her face
missing and she was picking out her face

2956
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,880
and I,

2957
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,470
it was one of the most disturbing things
I've ever seen and I think about it all

2958
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:58,100
the time,

2959
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:58,431
you know,

2960
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:00,960
like I should have never have seen that
and now I can't stop thinking you didn't

2961
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:01,761
have the option.

2962
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:02,451
I didn't have the option.

2963
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:03,201
I mean growing.

2964
01:28:03,201 --> 01:28:05,660
How many times have you
clicked on a video and said,

2965
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:06,051
fuck,

2966
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:07,160
I wish I didn't click on that.

2967
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,040
And then you learn and you know,

2968
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,760
like I've sent you stuff
and you sent me stuff.

2969
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:10,971
I'm like,

2970
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:11,930
I don't even want to watch that.

2971
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,700
And you just,

2972
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,670
you just decide,

2973
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,000
yeah,

2974
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,140
my life is more important now.

2975
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,580
Imagine if every time those exchanges
took place it autoplayed came up on your

2976
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:20,450
phone immediately.

2977
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:21,980
What they do that at facebook,

2978
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:25,040
why would they rate as a
great fucking reason is to,

2979
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,470
to beef up their viewership figures.

2980
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:28,340
That's stupid.

2981
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:28,501
Yeah,

2982
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,110
because then they can go
to advertisers and say,

2983
01:28:30,111 --> 01:28:31,220
look how many views it got.

2984
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:32,330
Oh,

2985
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,770
that's gross.

2986
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:33,910
Oh,

2987
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:34,940
it's the most gross thing ever,

2988
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:35,774
and people.

2989
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:39,960
The reason youtube has a lot of
youtubers are especially upset with it.

2990
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:42,500
It's a lot of people are
free booting our content,

2991
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,700
not mind specifically,

2992
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:48,230
but a lot of other ones specifically in
the comedy genre because you can take

2993
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,430
this clip off youtube,

2994
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,620
upload it natively to facebook,

2995
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,790
have it autoplay,

2996
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:57,590
build this huge profile for yourself
based off of someone else's content that

2997
01:28:57,591 --> 01:28:59,190
they've made and there's an end.

2998
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:04,020
There's no way for you to go and track
it and facebook isn't being vigilant,

2999
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:05,030
vigilant about,

3000
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,690
about going and finding that stuff.

3001
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,770
In some cases,

3002
01:29:07,771 --> 01:29:08,790
youtube as I know,

3003
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,090
have have missed out on millions,

3004
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,890
tens of millions of views that happened
elsewhere and were associated with some

3005
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:21,270
other account on facebook and there was
another account they didn't may not have

3006
01:29:21,271 --> 01:29:22,104
even known about.

3007
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:22,411
No,

3008
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:22,980
they didn't.

3009
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:25,830
They wouldn't know about
it until somebody saw it.

3010
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:28,470
That was also a fan of theirs that would
then tweet it to them or whatever and

3011
01:29:28,471 --> 01:29:29,070
say,

3012
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:29,520
uh,

3013
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,400
there's this completely fake
profile of yours on facebook,

3014
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:34,750
uploading all your stuff in for today.

3015
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,720
Get advertising revenue from that.

3016
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,201
Well,

3017
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:41,370
usually what usually the way it'll
work is that they'll build up a large

3018
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:41,791
profile.

3019
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:44,500
So you take really funny 15
second videos so you should.

3020
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,720
So there you go.

3021
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:50,430
So you get a shit ton of followers and
then every so often after you've got this

3022
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:51,480
shit ton of followers,

3023
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:54,840
you insert some branded thing that you're
attempting to do and you're so you're

3024
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:58,840
utilizing someone else's profile
to build your very own it.

3025
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:01,290
You're not necessarily making
immediate money from it,

3026
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:05,340
but you're opening up the
possibility to do so after the fact.

3027
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:05,911
Like he said,

3028
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:06,560
with fat jew,

3029
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:06,680
if,

3030
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,010
if you've got five,

3031
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:08,341
six,

3032
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:11,400
10 million followers on someone
else's back at that point,

3033
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:12,001
it doesn't matter,

3034
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:12,420
why don't you?

3035
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,000
You can shut off the old
way of doing business,

3036
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,300
then start doing your original stuff at
that point once you've already got an

3037
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:19,134
audience,

3038
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:19,730
right?

3039
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:20,160
Right.

3040
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:20,341
Well,

3041
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:21,930
what fat jew did is he ca,

3042
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,850
he took advantage of this
new way of doing comedy.

3043
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,660
Yes.

3044
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:30,630
Where you could just take a
photo and put some text to it.

3045
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:32,420
And it's one of my favorite ways of calm.

3046
01:30:32,421 --> 01:30:33,740
That thing that I sent you the other day,

3047
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:36,111
the uh,

3048
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:39,740
the one of caitlyn jenner and katelyn,

3049
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,370
is that the right way?

3050
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:41,001
That's the name?

3051
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:41,240
Yeah.

3052
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,650
Caitlyn jenner in a,

3053
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:42,911
uh,

3054
01:30:42,911 --> 01:30:47,911
a porsche and it says 2011 porsche
with a rebuilt tranny hole.

3055
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,000
And I fucking,

3056
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:53,310
I laughed so hard when
somebody sent genius.

3057
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,010
I sent it to everybody I know.

3058
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:58,490
I was just how like you probably
have no idea who created exactly.

3059
01:30:58,491 --> 01:30:59,780
I felt bad in that way.

3060
01:30:59,781 --> 01:31:00,501
That I don't know.

3061
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:02,490
And that's why I didn't
post it on social media.

3062
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:02,900
Yeah.

3063
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:03,740
But I did retweet it.

3064
01:31:03,741 --> 01:31:04,574
I think.

3065
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:05,630
See,

3066
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:08,300
I mean his hands super cloudy.

3067
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,171
It is cloudy,

3068
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:13,850
but what was not cloudy about the fat
jew situation was that he was purposely

3069
01:31:13,851 --> 01:31:16,430
not attributing it to the
people that they created it.

3070
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:19,160
And even sometimes there's
some of the other ones.

3071
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:24,190
That girl that was changing words changing
like someone had originally tweeted

3072
01:31:25,761 --> 01:31:28,460
something about a cat and
she would change it to a dog,

3073
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:33,520
but the exact same exact same joke changed
and that was the other thing fat jew

3074
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:38,660
is doing is changing the text of the
image but writing the same thing.

3075
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:41,120
So it was deliberate like
there was still doing it to.

3076
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:42,010
Is he really.

3077
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:45,200
There was a nice article written the other
day how he's still doing it and he's.

3078
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:49,350
He also has like all these fake accounts
they used at giving the a credit,

3079
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:52,100
but it's like a locked
account with one post.

3080
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,390
Yeah.

3081
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:53,751
Yeah.

3082
01:31:53,751 --> 01:31:54,500
There's a,

3083
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,700
there's some fuckery of foot.

3084
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,160
It's honestly.

3085
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:00,580
And even though those
things are so enjoyable,

3086
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:04,300
I intentionally avoided those pages on
instagram just because of that reason.

3087
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,781
Really.

3088
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:05,141
Yeah.

3089
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:07,060
I mean it's like I might
get a laugh out of it,

3090
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:07,960
but it's not.

3091
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:11,220
It's not somebodies so many creative.

3092
01:32:11,221 --> 01:32:14,200
Like I'm not buying anything
from fat jew right now.

3093
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:15,821
The problem is,

3094
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:15,960
yeah,

3095
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,211
I know,

3096
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:20,950
but see the thing is that your behavior
influences what gets rebroadcast,

3097
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:24,880
especially on instagram because if it's
like previous photos you've liked and

3098
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:26,440
then in other people's discover page,

3099
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:30,190
I'm sure you have a lot of followers
now they're seeing that thing surface so

3100
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:34,000
it's hard to actually do shit on instagram
without helping the shit that you're

3101
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:35,950
looking at it and advertisers
don't give a fuck.

3102
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:39,040
They'll give him a shit load of money
just because of all this stolen work.

3103
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:39,101
Yeah,

3104
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:39,880
but hold on a second.

3105
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,230
So if you like something.

3106
01:32:41,231 --> 01:32:41,620
Yeah,

3107
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:42,670
but I don't like anything.

3108
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:47,020
Sometimes it's like if you go on the
discover page and it'll be based on stuff

3109
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:49,360
you've liked based on people you follow,

3110
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:53,320
putting a picture of you up there right
now based on people you follow and I

3111
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:56,620
think there's one other one based
on other photos you've liked,

3112
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:57,040
something like that.

3113
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,270
It,

3114
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:57,790
it's,

3115
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:01,960
it's algorithmically trying to make
suggestions for photos that you might

3116
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:02,760
actually like.

3117
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,150
That's why it's the discover page.

3118
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,010
So if.

3119
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:06,311
Yeah,

3120
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:07,420
if you don't hit the heart,

3121
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,970
I don't know if there's
a way to hit that heart.

3122
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:12,130
You never hit the heart
and fuck with by mistake.

3123
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:12,490
Nope.

3124
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:15,390
You've never hit the hard hit it

3125
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:18,860
too late.

3126
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,690
Too late.

3127
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:20,590
They got the data.

3128
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,930
I'll comment on friend's stuff,

3129
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,550
but I don't really like things.

3130
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,713
What's this about?

3131
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:26,590
Should I.

3132
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:26,921
Well,

3133
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:30,250
I just feel like you can reciprocate
a little something every so often.

3134
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,180
If I saw,

3135
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:31,660
if I,

3136
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,530
if I saw joe rogan heart,

3137
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:34,950
I might get a smile for a minute,

3138
01:33:34,951 --> 01:33:35,261
you know?

3139
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:36,070
I didn't know.

3140
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,431
Okay.

3141
01:33:36,431 --> 01:33:37,490
I'll start heart in your stuff.

3142
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:38,690
Thank you very much.

3143
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,280
All right.

3144
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:43,000
Apparently you haven't been
noticing my heart's well.

3145
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:43,751
That's a thing too,

3146
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:43,981
right?

3147
01:33:43,981 --> 01:33:46,900
Like I actually had put
something up and gets hearted.

3148
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:47,660
You know,

3149
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,750
you notice how many likes you have,

3150
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:53,890
but what you don't know is how many
views something's got on instagram.

3151
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:54,400
Yeah.

3152
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,233
On twitter you do.

3153
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,590
The analytics are pretty cool.

3154
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:58,510
They're pretty interesting
to see everything.

3155
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:58,811
Yeah.

3156
01:33:58,811 --> 01:33:59,621
I just got one,

3157
01:33:59,621 --> 01:34:04,621
like the nick diaz is one
that I put 407,942 views.

3158
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:06,340
Look at you.

3159
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,540
That's awesome everybody,

3160
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,570
everybody's looking for
you to make you know,

3161
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:11,710
to say something about
that nick diaz thing.

3162
01:34:11,711 --> 01:34:12,040
Yeah,

3163
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,220
I think that'd be stoned.

3164
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:13,631
Well,

3165
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:16,630
here's the thing there that those
people weren't even willing to take into

3166
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:17,170
consideration.

3167
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:18,850
The fact that he passed two tests.

3168
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:21,580
He passed two tests to water tests,

3169
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:26,581
world anti doping association test and
failed one from some fucking local lab

3170
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:29,950
and the local labs numbers
were off the chart,

3171
01:34:29,951 --> 01:34:32,020
so two out of three tests he passed.

3172
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:35,980
They weren't even willing to take into
consideration those other tests because

3173
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:36,970
they didn't perform them.

3174
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:37,871
Not only that,

3175
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:42,640
they're performing urine tests which are
significantly less accurate than blood

3176
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:43,474
tests,

3177
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,500
so they fucked him.

3178
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,560
They fucked out of $165,000
and five years of his career,

3179
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,351
five years,

3180
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,240
and then John Jones only
got one year for cocaine.

3181
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,830
He didn't get one year for cocaine.

3182
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:56,740
Anderson silva got one year
for the first steroids.

3183
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,130
Jon jones has

3184
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,540
not applied for a license to fight and
his court case has not been settled.

3185
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:03,710
He's not been found guilty,

3186
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:04,940
so they don't know.

3187
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:09,590
And his cocaine use was what's called
out of competition cocaine use.

3188
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,750
Like when jon jones
got caught for cocaine,

3189
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,570
he got caught for cocaine when he was not.

3190
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:17,660
It wasn't going to be affecting
him while he was fighting.

3191
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,580
The idea with these tests,

3192
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:24,440
with marijuana is that if you can catch
someone who was taking marijuana while

3193
01:35:24,441 --> 01:35:25,610
they were competing,

3194
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:30,140
then it could be a factor because
it may affect their performance.

3195
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:30,531
Yes,

3196
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:31,550
it may affect their performance.

3197
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:32,211
But here's the deal.

3198
01:35:32,211 --> 01:35:37,211
There's no scientific evidence whatsoever
that marijuana is a significant effect

3199
01:35:38,631 --> 01:35:40,370
or performance to the point
where it should be banned.

3200
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:44,410
Like caffeine significantly affects
performance and it's illegal.

3201
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:49,850
I believe you can have up to 200
milligrams of caffeine and compete under

3202
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:50,720
olympic rules.

3203
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,670
And chael sonnen,

3204
01:35:51,671 --> 01:35:55,160
he actually told me that he takes it
in pill form because he doesn't want to

3205
01:35:55,161 --> 01:36:00,040
fuck up and get an extra strong cup of
coffee and break the grid or a past break

3206
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:00,770
the test.

3207
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:02,870
But if you like go to starbucks,

3208
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:03,501
like you know,

3209
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:03,970
we've,

3210
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:05,510
we've tried to figure it out before,

3211
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:08,330
like how much caffeine is in one of
those things that brian drinks because he

3212
01:36:08,331 --> 01:36:12,260
drinks those 30 hours fucking
the jug star of death,

3213
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:13,940
you know,

3214
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:16,100
but you don't really know.

3215
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:16,701
Exactly.

3216
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:20,690
So you have to take like a pill in
order to really modulate it perfectly.

3217
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:21,560
If you're an athlete.

3218
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:22,020
When I was,

3219
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,480
there was a significant effect.

3220
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,670
Caffeine can give you more endurance.

3221
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,050
We can help hundred percent.

3222
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,180
I'll take caffeine before
I play hockey every time.

3223
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:29,391
Yeah.

3224
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:30,350
And it's legal.

3225
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,580
It's totally legal.

3226
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:35,480
So I mean the arguable effect
that marijuana does give you,

3227
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:40,730
it might give you some dilation of
your lungs and might give you a slight

3228
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:43,520
advantage in your cardio because of that.

3229
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,440
Or a focus advantage,

3230
01:36:45,441 --> 01:36:49,850
which is like for some people could
help like a guy like nick diaz,

3231
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,760
it might help him be more comfortable
because he likes being high all the time

3232
01:36:52,761 --> 01:36:53,510
anyway.

3233
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:54,890
So if you let him fight high,

3234
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:55,460
yeah,

3235
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:59,360
but it's not enough where it's gonna
allow them to hurt somebody more.

3236
01:36:59,480 --> 01:36:59,721
See,

3237
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:03,290
the idea of a performance
enhancing drug is steroids,

3238
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,190
eep,

3239
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:04,730
oh,

3240
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:08,660
all the stuff that like those cyclists
get banned for those things make you

3241
01:37:08,661 --> 01:37:09,494
stronger,

3242
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,221
faster,

3243
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:11,870
and in the case of mixed martial arts,

3244
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,940
it will allow you to hurt your opponent.

3245
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:18,980
It's arguable that marijuana does have
some performance enhancing effect,

3246
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:20,210
like with jujitsu.

3247
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,740
A lot of jujitsu guys,

3248
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:22,580
me included,

3249
01:37:22,581 --> 01:37:24,380
liked to get high before they train,

3250
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:25,131
but man,

3251
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:26,270
I'm not much better.

3252
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:26,781
I mean,

3253
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:29,840
I think it's a slight thing
where your leg a little better,

3254
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:31,580
but it's not like with pool,

3255
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:32,210
same thing.

3256
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:34,370
You'll feel a little more in tune with it,

3257
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:38,570
but it's not significant enough where
you wouldn't be able to perform at that

3258
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:39,320
level without it.

3259
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,660
Like when we see athletes
that get off steroids,

3260
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:42,680
man,

3261
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:46,050
the fucking drop off
his god damn dramatic.

3262
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:49,100
The difference between
a steroid using athlete,

3263
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:51,020
an athlete that's forced
to go off steroids,

3264
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:52,940
you see it in their body,

3265
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:54,470
they get soft,

3266
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:56,640
they see they have loose skin.

3267
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,320
You see it in their physical performance,

3268
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:59,400
they get tired quicker.

3269
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:00,390
They're not as aggressive,

3270
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:01,650
they're not as confident.

3271
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,600
They start posting shit
on their instagram.

3272
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:06,180
Praise all this motivational
shit like a suicidal stripper.

3273
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:07,860
That's what happens,

3274
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:08,001
man.

3275
01:38:08,001 --> 01:38:10,370
It starts with fuck with your
head because you realize like you,

3276
01:38:10,371 --> 01:38:14,100
you got to pump yourself up because
you're not jack to the tits on some

3277
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:15,510
artificial testosterone.

3278
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:16,290
Right?

3279
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:19,590
So that in comparison to pot,

3280
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,440
there's no fucking comparison.

3281
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:21,810
Right?

3282
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:25,110
And testosterone was legal
until like a year ago.

3283
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:29,490
There were allowing these guys to get on
testosterone replacement therapy is pot

3284
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
legal in other sports while the nba is
apparently the one sport where so many

3285
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:39,530
guys are smoking pot playing.

3286
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:40,170
That's what I.

3287
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,690
That they don't have it in the
contract where they test them,

3288
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:43,910
they don't,

3289
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:45,540
they don't allow themselves to be tested.

3290
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:49,180
So how is it that this is
even on the table to be,

3291
01:38:49,181 --> 01:38:49,650
you know,

3292
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:50,081
first of all,

3293
01:38:50,081 --> 01:38:51,750
because there's no union there.

3294
01:38:51,751 --> 01:38:53,190
If there was a fighters' union,

3295
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,890
fighters' union could go
to the athletic kind of,

3296
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:57,571
fuck you,

3297
01:38:57,571 --> 01:38:58,560
we're not coming to vegas,

3298
01:38:58,561 --> 01:38:59,394
you dummies.

3299
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:02,130
And then the other problem is
if someone's band in vegas,

3300
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:05,820
they're band in the world because of
you violated and there's all sorts of

3301
01:39:05,821 --> 01:39:06,371
fucking loss.

3302
01:39:06,371 --> 01:39:09,450
Who bullshit part that I
can't wrap my head around.

3303
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,111
Not only that,

3304
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,940
but you're being banned by idiots.

3305
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:12,720
Okay?

3306
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,090
You're being banned by people
who don't understand the sport.

3307
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,470
If they did understand a sport,

3308
01:39:16,471 --> 01:39:16,861
first of all,

3309
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:19,800
they would have fired 60
percent of their judges,

3310
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,390
60 percent of their judges,

3311
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:24,000
any judge that hasn't have
any martial arts experience,

3312
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:24,660
a judge it,

3313
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,660
you should run them through a course load.

3314
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:27,720
Is this guy in danger?

3315
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:28,590
Is he in danger?

3316
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:29,040
Now?

3317
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,150
Is this dangerous?

3318
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,770
Is this submission close?

3319
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:32,690
Is this one close?

3320
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:33,060
How?

3321
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,290
How effective is that?

3322
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:38,910
If you don't know that you can't
judge a martial arts fight on a,

3323
01:39:38,911 --> 01:39:40,140
on a professional level,

3324
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:41,250
but yet they do,

3325
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,860
so these are ineffective
commissions in the first place.

3326
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:44,843
On top of that,

3327
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,990
they're bureaucrats.

3328
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,510
These are government people
and firing these people.

3329
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:52,620
It's just like firing someone from the
dmv or firing some from the post office.

3330
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:55,970
It's fucking difficult and there's
all sorts of hoops and latin.

3331
01:39:56,010 --> 01:40:00,360
There's protections that those people
have in place that the fighters do not

3332
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:00,751
have.

3333
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:05,751
So you have an unfair playing field and
these people have this ultimate tyranny

3334
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,133
over fighters.

3335
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:10,620
So it seems pretty obvious
that Nevada is fucked,

3336
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,483
fucked.

3337
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:16,820
Is there any chance that the ufc
affiliation with Nevada ever changes?

3338
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:17,641
Well,

3339
01:40:17,641 --> 01:40:19,680
they can't have fights in Nevada.

3340
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:20,610
Nevada's the spot,

3341
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:20,941
man.

3342
01:40:20,941 --> 01:40:21,701
If you want to have fights,

3343
01:40:21,701 --> 01:40:22,500
you go to vegas.

3344
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:22,831
I know.

3345
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:23,400
Why does it have?

3346
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:23,820
Why?

3347
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,780
Because it's the shit.

3348
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,270
It's the best place to funding.

3349
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,760
But how much could they continue to
fuck up and you still continue to do it.

3350
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:31,440
They need to be overhauled.

3351
01:40:31,441 --> 01:40:32,221
Not vegas.

3352
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:33,600
Vegas is fucking awesome.

3353
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:34,530
Look if you're going to have fights,

3354
01:40:34,531 --> 01:40:36,850
but I'm saying I've been tied to the mgm.

3355
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:42,090
I've been there and fucking casinos there
until 6:00 in the morning if you want.

3356
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:42,930
I completely agree.

3357
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:45,930
But anytime you're in
any kind of negotiation,

3358
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:49,170
you have to be willing to walk away
and if they continue to fuck up,

3359
01:40:49,171 --> 01:40:50,310
what's the risk to them?

3360
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:54,670
I think the public reaction to this
and its thing is unprecedented.

3361
01:40:54,671 --> 01:40:58,250
I tweeted the phone number for the
Nevada state of audition today and say,

3362
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:01,480
please call them up and let them know
how you feel about them fucking over nick

3363
01:41:01,481 --> 01:41:01,770
diaz.

3364
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,420
I'm retweeted.

3365
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,840
You see they can't even
fucking take calls now.

3366
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:06,890
They're just swamped and um,

3367
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:07,980
I'll do it tomorrow too.

3368
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:08,320
Yeah,

3369
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,400
I'll do it until they stop.

3370
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:10,660
I'll do it for the rest of my life.

3371
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:12,010
I'll fucking wake up every morning.

3372
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:13,000
I have an alarm clock.

3373
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,110
Well,

3374
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:19,110
here's the new number for the scheduled
tweets that they stole five years from

3375
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:24,661
this guy's career and they stole $165,000
from his person and they weren't even

3376
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:29,560
willing to take into consideration
the other two tests that he failed.

3377
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:31,630
It is a goddamn dog and pony show.

3378
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:32,464
It's a tyranny.

3379
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:34,750
And what these people are doing is wrong.

3380
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:38,650
It's just wrong because it's not
a person who set out to cheat.

3381
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:40,900
This is the guy who doesn't use steroids.

3382
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:43,540
Nick diaz is notoriously anti steroids.

3383
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:45,310
This is a guy who was one of the toughest,

3384
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:47,110
most exciting guys in the sport.

3385
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:52,260
He's fun to watch and also probably has
social anxiety issues that marijuana

3386
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:53,141
helps alleviate.

3387
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:53,351
Yeah,

3388
01:41:53,351 --> 01:41:54,070
I've read that.

3389
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:58,900
I read that interview with him like
about what he said shortly after.

3390
01:41:58,901 --> 01:41:59,710
Yeah,

3391
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,281
it's awful,

3392
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:01,090
man.

3393
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:01,550
You know,

3394
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:03,370
look what they did is wrong.

3395
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,190
It's wrong.

3396
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:05,023
It gets not.

3397
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,090
You shouldn't fight high.

3398
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:07,720
Okay.

3399
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:08,291
If you fight,

3400
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:09,124
hi,

3401
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,690
there should be a penalty.

3402
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:11,860
Like 50 bucks

3403
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,740
for it.

3404
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:15,311
Listen man,

3405
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:16,570
if a guy kicks your ass high,

3406
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:17,890
he'd probably kick your ass sober.

3407
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:18,400
You know,

3408
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:18,941
I just don't.

3409
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:19,300
I don't.

3410
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,930
It's not like taking beta blockers or
something to completely eliminate your

3411
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:23,680
nervousness.

3412
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:23,861
Yeah.

3413
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:24,371
That's the thing.

3414
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:25,930
That's the one thing I heard though,

3415
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:28,480
is that maybe your pain
threshold is elevated.

3416
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:29,261
You know what,

3417
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:29,591
man,

3418
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:30,341
I don't buy that.

3419
01:42:30,341 --> 01:42:31,240
Here's why I don't buy that.

3420
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:32,800
You don't feel pain when
you're fighting anyway.

3421
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:34,900
You're so jacked up with adrenaline.

3422
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,570
There's so many times when
you fight and after it's over,

3423
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:39,790
you realize your hand is broken or
there's something wrong with you.

3424
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,691
Like jon jones,

3425
01:42:40,691 --> 01:42:41,441
perfect example.

3426
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:43,390
I'm interviewing him
while I'm interviewing.

3427
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:46,160
After you beat the shit out shell son
and he looks down and sees his toe,

3428
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,270
he had no idea.

3429
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,550
He had no idea until he looked down.

3430
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:55,840
He saw there's toe was flipped over
and the bottom of his toes facing I was

3431
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:56,231
there.

3432
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:58,870
I saw it happen and he immediately was,

3433
01:42:58,900 --> 01:42:59,890
oh my toe.

3434
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:00,730
Oh man.

3435
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,601
Oh man.

3436
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:04,180
We got him a chair and he sat down
and I continue the interview with him.

3437
01:43:04,181 --> 01:43:06,910
Go literally going into
shock over his toe.

3438
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:07,863
Why was that?

3439
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:09,400
It wasn't because he was on a drug.

3440
01:43:09,401 --> 01:43:10,234
He wasn't high.

3441
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,040
It was because it was his adrenaline.

3442
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:14,980
Would that injury have had to
have the fight stopped if a date,

3443
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,000
most likely,

3444
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,840
if it went to the end of
the round or whatever.

3445
01:43:17,841 --> 01:43:19,750
Ryan hall had a similar injury.

3446
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:20,800
It wasn't to his big toe,

3447
01:43:20,801 --> 01:43:24,640
but it's one of his other toes was a
compound fracture was broken and the bone

3448
01:43:24,641 --> 01:43:29,170
was poking out of his toe and he still
fought two more rounds with it and he

3449
01:43:29,171 --> 01:43:32,860
still threw kicks with that
fucking leg and won the fight.

3450
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,420
That's how tough uriah hall.

3451
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:35,801
But I mean,

3452
01:43:35,801 --> 01:43:36,850
he had to,

3453
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,241
you know,

3454
01:43:37,241 --> 01:43:39,070
he had to be mentally tough.

3455
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:39,341
I mean,

3456
01:43:39,341 --> 01:43:40,300
he had to go back to his corner.

3457
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,420
He realized his toe is completely
fucked and he just said,

3458
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:43,870
okay,

3459
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:44,703
whatever.

3460
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,510
And I mean limped back to his corner.

3461
01:43:46,511 --> 01:43:48,310
But once the round started,

3462
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:51,470
dude was on his feet and moving
around like nothing was wrong.

3463
01:43:51,471 --> 01:43:53,390
He just dealt with the pain and said,

3464
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:54,530
I'm going to win this fucking fight.

3465
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:55,364
Anyway.

3466
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:55,791
You know,

3467
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:58,520
and a lot of that is also
because of adrenaline.

3468
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,860
Your adrenaline shields you from a,

3469
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:01,071
you know,

3470
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:03,890
your adrenaline realizes you're
in a battle for your life.

3471
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:05,290
You don't need to worry about bruises,

3472
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:06,560
you don't need to worry about pain.

3473
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:09,710
It's not pain necessarily
that stops fighters.

3474
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,130
It's debilitating techniques
like a liver shot.

3475
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,510
When you get hit with a liver shot,

3476
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,710
it's not like,

3477
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:16,161
oh my god,

3478
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:16,911
it was so painful.

3479
01:44:16,911 --> 01:44:18,230
It fucking definitely hurts.

3480
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,940
But the real problem with the liver shot,

3481
01:44:19,941 --> 01:44:21,500
as it shuts your system down,

3482
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:23,210
your system doesn't work anymore.

3483
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:25,580
You get nailed with like
a left hook to the liver,

3484
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,001
boom,

3485
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:26,780
it hits you.

3486
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:30,260
And it's this crazy feeling like
your breath doesn't work anymore,

3487
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,940
your legs lock up and you're like,

3488
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,250
it's not a pain thing.

3489
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,870
It's a system shut down.

3490
01:44:35,871 --> 01:44:36,890
When you get knocked out,

3491
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:38,210
you get kicked in the head.

3492
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:38,850
It's not that your.

3493
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:39,800
Your head hurts,

3494
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:40,790
of course it hurts,

3495
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,530
but the real problem is not paying.

3496
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:46,040
The real problem is your
brain shuts off your brain.

3497
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:47,180
You get net kicked,

3498
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,190
he cuts off the circulation to your brain,

3499
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,970
spark the other.

3500
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:52,790
The fucking nerves get shattered.

3501
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:55,250
Everything get walked
out and your brain goes,

3502
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:55,551
okay,

3503
01:44:55,551 --> 01:44:55,791
night,

3504
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:56,270
night,

3505
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:57,103
and you shut off.

3506
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,100
It's a full system.

3507
01:44:58,330 --> 01:44:59,630
Wasn't a choice at all,

3508
01:44:59,631 --> 01:45:00,141
honestly.

3509
01:45:00,141 --> 01:45:00,410
Yeah,

3510
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:02,540
there's pain that these guys experience,

3511
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:06,110
but that's not necessarily
what stops fights.

3512
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,760
So the pain threshold thing,

3513
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:08,953
I don't buy it.

3514
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,570
I think the real pain
threshold is adrenaline.

3515
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,730
That's what really keeps
you from feeling pain.

3516
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:15,320
And we're going to have that naturally.

3517
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,820
That's the most effective thing.

3518
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:22,060
Marijuana is an effective pain reducer
after competition or after training.

3519
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:24,710
It's with one of the things
that people really like to do.

3520
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:26,450
They have a hard day of training.

3521
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:27,580
They like to sit back,

3522
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,420
smoke a joint and watch a little tv.

3523
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:29,631
Well,

3524
01:45:29,631 --> 01:45:31,400
they can't do that if
they're being tested,

3525
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,181
you know,

3526
01:45:32,181 --> 01:45:34,580
in this district and so on.

3527
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:35,060
Yeah.

3528
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:35,990
Well again,

3529
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:37,100
the marijuana thing,

3530
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:39,020
they've changed the
threshold considerably.

3531
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:39,920
And I had jeff,

3532
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:41,210
no wicki on the podcast.

3533
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,550
I listened to that episode now.

3534
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:43,220
Amazing.

3535
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,740
Really interesting guy
and very smart and very,

3536
01:45:45,741 --> 01:45:45,971
you know,

3537
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:47,240
on top of the testing thing.

3538
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:48,403
And he's like,

3539
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:51,050
it's out of competition if you're not,

3540
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:51,530
if you're.

3541
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:56,060
You would literally have to get high
the day of the fight to test positive.

3542
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,350
Now that's the way they're doing it.

3543
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:02,560
So the test that diaz got popped for was
before this alteration was made dope.

3544
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:05,900
It's by the current standards.

3545
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:11,030
So the problem is he tested twice under
the threshold of the current standards.

3546
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:15,590
The water tests had him
under the threshold which
says he was not high when he

3547
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:16,424
competed,

3548
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:18,470
but the tasks that they use from,

3549
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:20,060
I believe it was quest labs,

3550
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:21,043
sorry if I'm wrong,

3551
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:22,280
but I believe which is,

3552
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:22,890
you know,

3553
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:23,810
a very good lab,

3554
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:28,610
but it showed have completely
different test than the test that water

3555
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,473
instituted.

3556
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:30,440
On top of that,

3557
01:46:30,441 --> 01:46:31,070
again,

3558
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:32,480
we're talking about urine,

3559
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,570
we're talking about urine versus blood
and when you're testing metabolite,

3560
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,413
so why,

3561
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:39,110
why in that particular,

3562
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:40,580
in this particular case,

3563
01:46:40,581 --> 01:46:43,830
did that test take precedent
over the water there?

3564
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:44,660
Test.

3565
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,380
Who's they?

3566
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,640
Nevada state athletic commission.

3567
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:47,480
That's where it's fucked.

3568
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:47,930
It's not.

3569
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:49,010
The ufc is test.

3570
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:52,050
The ufc has no fucking place in this.

3571
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:53,310
They brought in the u.

3572
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:54,220
S ada,

3573
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,890
us anti-doping association,

3574
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:57,480
which is where it novitsky comes up.

3575
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:57,720
Right,

3576
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:57,930
right.

3577
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:58,761
Brought those guys in.

3578
01:46:58,761 --> 01:47:02,100
I guess I'm referring to them as
they use because they're high.

3579
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:03,240
They are hired by them.

3580
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:05,640
They're hired by the ufc
to clean up the sport,

3581
01:47:05,641 --> 01:47:08,760
but they have no say on how
the tests are implemented,

3582
01:47:08,761 --> 01:47:10,050
how the results are dispersed,

3583
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,650
what the idea of bringing in
the government and bringing
in a guy like novitsky

3584
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:14,011
wicki is,

3585
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:14,221
look,

3586
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:15,330
if you really want to clean up,

3587
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,253
clean up the sport,

3588
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:19,650
you hire a fucking bulldog
who's just going to go after it.

3589
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:22,830
You don't do it yourself
because if you do it yourself,

3590
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:27,540
there's always the possibility that
someone could hide the results because

3591
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:31,650
there's a financial interest like you
would know you would test conor mcgregor.

3592
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:32,060
He finally,

3593
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:32,791
he's fighting high,

3594
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:33,790
like little calm.

3595
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:35,413
Listen,

3596
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,350
you're saying some great shit.

3597
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:39,360
He can't fight high dude,

3598
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,790
but with the usa da,

3599
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:44,130
you don't have a say in how the stuff is.

3600
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:46,110
You don't have that sounds perfect.

3601
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:46,710
Exactly,

3602
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,440
and that's how they want
to do it and that's what.

3603
01:47:48,441 --> 01:47:49,650
That's what that show,

3604
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:52,800
but I don't understand what
medina understand what good it is.

3605
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:57,890
If what do you wasted all this money
for it because the Nevada state athletic

3606
01:47:58,051 --> 01:48:02,040
commission is incompetent and there they
are a tyranny and they are a bunch of

3607
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:02,710
people that haven't.

3608
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:05,460
If you watch the fucking the commission,

3609
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,350
those people are drunk with power.

3610
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:10,290
They're drunk with power and they felt
like they were making made fools of

3611
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,420
because he's tested positive before,

3612
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:14,160
but he tested positive before,

3613
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:15,720
under their different thresholds.

3614
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:19,200
The thresholds that existed before
the current established standard.

3615
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:21,421
It's all fucked.

3616
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:23,100
Who hires these people like where?

3617
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:23,791
It's a good question.

3618
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:24,700
Like where?

3619
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:25,740
Who do you,

3620
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:26,820
who do you go after?

3621
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:27,690
Is there some kind?

3622
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:30,390
Is it the governor at the highest level?

3623
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:31,590
It should be the government.

3624
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:32,431
The governor.

3625
01:48:32,431 --> 01:48:35,490
I think the governor did step in once
and there was an investigation one,

3626
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:36,580
there was a woman who was.

3627
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:37,320
She was.

3628
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:40,350
She judged the tim bradley manny pacquiao,

3629
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:43,830
fight like really poorly and she was
one of the reasons why pack y'all didn't

3630
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:46,230
win that fight and then
they went over her,

3631
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:49,200
her history of judging
fights and they're like,

3632
01:48:49,201 --> 01:48:50,310
what the fuck?

3633
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:53,950
Like she gets a lot of fights wrong and
she would get fights wrong that like

3634
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:57,990
we're a greeley bad decisions and so
they were trying to figure out like,

3635
01:48:57,991 --> 01:48:59,250
what does she know about fight?

3636
01:48:59,251 --> 01:48:59,600
Does she know?

3637
01:48:59,600 --> 01:48:59,940
Anyhow,

3638
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:00,890
she got this job,

3639
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:01,981
hired her,

3640
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:02,970
how does this work?

3641
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:07,800
And so the governor stepped in because
there was a national outcry over a couple

3642
01:49:07,801 --> 01:49:10,170
of boxing decisions and I say it,

3643
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:12,150
his office needs to be
bombarded right now.

3644
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:13,411
I hope they are.

3645
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:13,531
Well,

3646
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:14,760
there's a government petition,

3647
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:18,120
somebody put out a white house
petition to reinstate nick diaz,

3648
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,470
but what's what,

3649
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,580
what's shown up,

3650
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:21,900
this is what needed to be done.

3651
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:22,410
Okay?

3652
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:24,000
And this is the good thing about this.

3653
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:27,840
We needed to see how dumb these fucking
people are or I need to see how bad they

3654
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:28,740
are at their jobs,

3655
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,450
how cruel they are,

3656
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,740
how callous they are.

3657
01:49:31,741 --> 01:49:32,574
The fact that they don't,

3658
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:37,700
they just think it's think it's okay to
take away $165,000 from the guys purse

3659
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:42,420
and take away his ability to compete
and make a living for five years in his

3660
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:43,200
prime.

3661
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,060
It's career just over.

3662
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:45,450
Yeah,

3663
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:47,100
five years is a career killer.

3664
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:48,280
I mean,

3665
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:48,890
nick,

3666
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:50,380
how did you come up with that number?

3667
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:51,214
Because they're assholes.

3668
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:53,050
Did that number come just come out of.

3669
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:53,890
Because I have,

3670
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:54,723
I've never heard.

3671
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,750
Maybe with the exception of.

3672
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:56,584
What's his name?

3673
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:01,630
The guy who the manko alexander's flamenco
got tested positive in California and

3674
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:02,470
andy foster,

3675
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:05,290
who the chairman in California is,

3676
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:08,350
he's very hell bent on
taking out cheaters.

3677
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:09,760
He doesn't want any of that shit.

3678
01:50:09,761 --> 01:50:11,770
And schlep mancos tests
were through the roof.

3679
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:13,250
His testosterone was playing stairway.

3680
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:14,050
Yeah.

3681
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:14,860
And uh,

3682
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:15,191
they,

3683
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:15,700
they,

3684
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:16,001
you know,

3685
01:50:16,001 --> 01:50:19,510
and he's got a court case and I
don't know how that's going to go.

3686
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:20,470
I don't know what really.

3687
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,513
We don't know.

3688
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,510
You never know.

3689
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,500
How do you feel about.

3690
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,011
Okay.

3691
01:50:24,011 --> 01:50:28,600
Even in the case of steroids where
it's an obvious performance enhancer,

3692
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,750
how do you feel about a five
year suspension for that?

3693
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:33,220
Like a five year suspension?

3694
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:33,640
Is that,

3695
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,680
is there ever a place for five years?

3696
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:35,921
Well,

3697
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:36,311
here's the thing.

3698
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:39,040
Devonna tried to ban vandelay
silva for a lifetime.

3699
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:40,050
That was what I was thinking of.

3700
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:40,330
Yeah,

3701
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:41,330
that's who I was last.

3702
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:42,820
That they lost that in court.

3703
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:44,440
They could so they couldn't.

3704
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,281
They went to court.

3705
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:47,320
Vandelays lawyers went to
court and they beat that.

3706
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:50,380
Of course they beat him because he didn't
live in test positive for anything.

3707
01:50:50,381 --> 01:50:51,190
Ran away from the test.

3708
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:54,700
You ran away from the tests
that you run away from the test.

3709
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:55,331
In their eyes,

3710
01:50:55,331 --> 01:50:57,940
you're guilty and they
wanted to send a message.

3711
01:50:57,941 --> 01:51:00,310
They're not to be trifled with says,

3712
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,450
d is going to take this to court.

3713
01:51:01,451 --> 01:51:01,751
You think,

3714
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:02,381
fuck yeah,

3715
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:03,280
and he's going to win too.

3716
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:05,170
And I hope he sues the shit out of them.

3717
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:07,450
I hope he soon as the shit out of him.

3718
01:51:07,451 --> 01:51:12,451
I really do and I hope he wins and I hope
that the governor steps in or someone

3719
01:51:12,461 --> 01:51:14,260
steps in because my say you,

3720
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:17,620
there are people that you can hire that
will understand what the fuck is going

3721
01:51:17,621 --> 01:51:18,100
on.

3722
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,510
You need former athletes.

3723
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,650
You need people who are experts in science
and medicine that understand what the

3724
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:24,371
thresholds are.

3725
01:51:24,371 --> 01:51:27,880
Understand the difference between urine
tests and blood tests if you and also

3726
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:30,210
you need commissioners that you.

3727
01:51:30,211 --> 01:51:30,510
You're,

3728
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:31,840
you're gonna need people that are,

3729
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:36,580
that have the educated ability to make
these judgements based on whatever

3730
01:51:36,581 --> 01:51:40,240
discipline that they would
need to be a master of.

3731
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:41,150
To understand this,

3732
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:42,370
like if you're talking about steroids,

3733
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:44,950
you would need someone who's a
steroid expert if you're talking about

3734
01:51:44,951 --> 01:51:48,160
performance enhancing drugs like
meth or you would need someone.

3735
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:53,280
You should have to establish the fact
that you understand what the effects of

3736
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:54,161
all these things are.

3737
01:51:54,161 --> 01:51:57,940
You shouldn't have to have some education
and the effects of all these things.

3738
01:51:58,210 --> 01:51:59,440
Now with marijuana,

3739
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:00,070
there's.

3740
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:02,320
There's no data you've just got.

3741
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:05,230
You've got no data that shows
that if a person takes marijuana,

3742
01:52:05,231 --> 01:52:08,320
they can hurt someone more easily
than if they don't take marijuana.

3743
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:09,760
So as soon as you have that,

3744
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:10,810
you don't have any data,

3745
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,970
so if you don't have any
data then you've got to go.

3746
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,680
How you banning people for this.

3747
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:17,320
Like ronda rousey fucking went off today.

3748
01:52:17,321 --> 01:52:18,154
It was watched.

3749
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:19,000
I watched that clip.

3750
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,710
She went off and drop the mic after it
was over and one of the things that she

3751
01:52:23,711 --> 01:52:26,110
said I totally agree with about marijuana.

3752
01:52:26,111 --> 01:52:27,250
She said this in the past too,

3753
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:29,680
it's an invasion of privacy is what it is.

3754
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:31,720
You're invading someone's privacy.

3755
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:33,540
Just like the fact that if you're.

3756
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:38,580
If you work for a company and the company
decides to test you and you work all

3757
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:39,401
week,

3758
01:52:39,401 --> 01:52:40,390
you do a great job,

3759
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:41,224
you work hard,

3760
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:42,630
and then fridays,

3761
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:44,470
since 5:00 baby,

3762
01:52:44,471 --> 01:52:45,304
it's over.

3763
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,490
You want to smoke a joint,

3764
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:47,210
your home,

3765
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:48,170
you worked all day.

3766
01:52:48,171 --> 01:52:49,730
You want to watch the walking dead.

3767
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:51,740
You want to put your feet
up and you want to get high.

3768
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,023
You can't.

3769
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,040
You fucking can because they own you.

3770
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:56,090
They own you.

3771
01:52:56,091 --> 01:52:57,410
They own your flesh.

3772
01:52:57,530 --> 01:53:01,550
They literally own your mind when you're
not there because everyone knows that

3773
01:53:01,551 --> 01:53:03,890
marijuana is not psychoactive permanently.

3774
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:07,730
It's not like you smoke a joint on
friday and then you show up on monday

3775
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:07,731
morning.

3776
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:10,130
You're still high as fuck and you're
high for the rest of your life.

3777
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,300
That's not the case.

3778
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:12,291
So if you,

3779
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:13,070
if you,

3780
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:14,120
if you smoke pot,

3781
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,360
you will be tested four
or five weeks from now,

3782
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:19,040
you will still test positive.

3783
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:21,470
If you don't smoke any pot,

3784
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:25,280
if you get high right now and then
four weeks from now they give you a

3785
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:26,091
urinalysis test,

3786
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,320
depending on what they're looking for.

3787
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:29,000
If they're just trying
to trace metabolites,

3788
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:31,160
you can still test
positive and four weeks,

3789
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,930
that's fucking insane.

3790
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:33,720
So it is.

3791
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,030
It's simply a control thing.

3792
01:53:35,031 --> 01:53:35,690
It's a power thing.

3793
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:36,523
It's a power thing.

3794
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:40,070
These people or government people or
government people that like to be able to

3795
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:40,970
tell people what to do.

3796
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,200
That's my concern though,

3797
01:53:42,201 --> 01:53:43,460
is if it's a power thing,

3798
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,810
how deep is it?

3799
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:46,790
How many levels does it go to?

3800
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:50,000
How many judges are friends
would not admit should find out.

3801
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:50,541
Yeah,

3802
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:52,220
well they probably already on the case,

3803
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:54,650
but ultimately I hope they're on the case.

3804
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:58,130
Ultimately autonomous
catholic public outcry.

3805
01:53:58,190 --> 01:53:58,371
Look,

3806
01:53:58,371 --> 01:53:59,330
this is a tyranny.

3807
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:03,530
These are a few people that
are deciding which again,

3808
01:54:03,531 --> 01:54:05,840
we're not talking about steroids here,

3809
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,490
we're just talking about pot.

3810
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,060
Yeah,

3811
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:09,110
it just doesn't make sense.

3812
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:14,140
And we're also talking about a guy who
passed to world anti doping agency tests.

3813
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,700
Those are the most trick fucking
tests in the world of sports.

3814
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:22,490
He passed two of those and failed a quest.

3815
01:54:22,491 --> 01:54:23,480
I think quest,

3816
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:24,660
again,

3817
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:25,910
I apologize from wrong,

3818
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:30,740
but the bottom line is the tests were
not the test that you need when you're

3819
01:54:30,741 --> 01:54:35,741
taking away a guy's fucking livelihood
and you're finding him for $165,000 out

3820
01:54:35,751 --> 01:54:37,220
of a $500,000 purse,

3821
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:38,240
which by the way,

3822
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:39,830
he has to pay his managers.

3823
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:41,150
He has to pay taxes.

3824
01:54:41,151 --> 01:54:42,650
He has to be all these different things.

3825
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,480
When you make 500 grand,

3826
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:47,270
you don't make 500 grand
because you have a manager,

3827
01:54:47,271 --> 01:54:48,450
the manager has 10 percent.

3828
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,600
You might have an agent
and the agent gets a piece.

3829
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:51,830
You might have a lawyer,

3830
01:54:51,831 --> 01:54:53,150
you might have a business manager,

3831
01:54:53,151 --> 01:54:53,870
you might have.

3832
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:54,980
You have to pay taxes.

3833
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,900
You have training,

3834
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,130
expensive training partners.

3835
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:02,090
You mean you have to be very strict and
nick is notoriously disciplined with his

3836
01:55:02,091 --> 01:55:02,870
diet.

3837
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:03,470
I mean he's.

3838
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:05,120
He eats all organic food.

3839
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:06,410
He's mostly vegan,

3840
01:55:06,411 --> 01:55:07,910
except I think he eats some fish.

3841
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:12,710
He doesn't need any land animals and
he does this based on the effect on his

3842
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:15,140
body because he's an
extreme endurance athlete.

3843
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:18,350
He does a lot of triathlons
and he does a lot of running.

3844
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:20,960
He swam back and forth
from alcatraz twice.

3845
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,550
I mean he's a motherfucker dude.

3846
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:25,940
He takes care of his body
and if he's smoking pot,

3847
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:28,160
that should tell you the
pot's not bad for your body.

3848
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:29,750
It's real simple,

3849
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:31,220
but he's not cheating.

3850
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,810
He's not doing steroids.

3851
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,850
He's not doing anything that
gives them an unfair advantage.

3852
01:55:34,851 --> 01:55:35,780
He's working hard.

3853
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:36,950
He's tough as shit.

3854
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:40,790
Any fucking fight smart
and these assholes.

3855
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:45,240
They stole his ability to entertain and
he's one of the most popular guys in the

3856
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:46,074
fucking sport.

3857
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,120
When he came back and
fought anderson silva,

3858
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:50,280
the paper view was through the roof.

3859
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,420
And why was that?

3860
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:51,901
Well,

3861
01:55:51,901 --> 01:55:55,110
partly because when people want to see
what anderson silva would look like after

3862
01:55:55,111 --> 01:55:56,580
he came back from a leg injury,

3863
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:58,020
this horrific leg break,

3864
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,180
but also it's because
he's fighting nick diaz,

3865
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:01,110
nick diaz,

3866
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:02,160
gonna talk shit to him.

3867
01:56:02,161 --> 01:56:02,994
Like he did,

3868
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,020
like he got in his face.

3869
01:56:04,021 --> 01:56:04,291
He's like,

3870
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:04,830
what bitch?

3871
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:05,430
What bitch?

3872
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:08,940
Like nobody ever done that to anderson
silva before he laid down on the ground

3873
01:56:08,941 --> 01:56:10,500
like he was making a sleepy face like,

3874
01:56:10,501 --> 01:56:10,711
look,

3875
01:56:10,711 --> 01:56:12,330
I'm sleep and you're
boring the fuck out of me,

3876
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,650
and jumped back up to his feet.

3877
01:56:13,651 --> 01:56:17,490
He humiliated anderson completely
fucked with his head inside that cage.

3878
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:22,700
That's what people paid for and what he
is experiencing right now is a bunch of

3879
01:56:23,671 --> 01:56:26,070
assholes taken away
his ability to compete,

3880
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:31,220
taken away his ability to thrill people
at what he does best has worked for more

3881
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:34,440
than a fucking decade as a professional
mixed martial arts fighter.

3882
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:38,550
More than a dad who knows how many years
before that training and learning how

3883
01:56:38,551 --> 01:56:41,250
to fight all that's taken
away by some assholes.

3884
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:42,930
I don't think it's going to stick it all.

3885
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:44,340
It's not going to stick to.

3886
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:47,190
I hope the the what the outcome is,

3887
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:51,150
is that we realized that these people
are just bad at what they do and they get

3888
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:51,601
removed.

3889
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:51,871
Kevin,

3890
01:56:51,871 --> 01:56:53,760
I only wrote a fantastic piece about it.

3891
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,790
I'm kevin.

3892
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:57,300
I who's a very respected sports reporter.

3893
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:58,210
I forget what,

3894
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:59,670
what publication he writes for,

3895
01:56:59,671 --> 01:57:02,100
but he's very respected in the
world of combat sports especially.

3896
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:05,010
He said they expose themselves
as being ridiculous.

3897
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:06,990
They expose themselves being incompetent.

3898
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:07,710
Yeah.

3899
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:08,071
It's like a.

3900
01:57:08,071 --> 01:57:12,840
It's like it takes a critical moment like
this to get everybody motivated enough

3901
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:14,640
to actually incite some change.

3902
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:14,970
It's.

3903
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:16,110
It made me so angry,

3904
01:57:16,111 --> 01:57:16,470
dude.

3905
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:17,220
Yeah.

3906
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:18,053
I haven't seen.

3907
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:19,710
I haven't seen this kind of reaction.

3908
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:22,350
Not that I can remember
since the lion killer.

3909
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:23,610
Yeah.

3910
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:24,443
This is like the,

3911
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:27,010
you know,

3912
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:29,520
the other side of the thing,

3913
01:57:29,521 --> 01:57:30,000
because it's.

3914
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,590
This is a.

3915
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:33,170
Most people would taking social media,

3916
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:36,460
but the way that joe is
talking about here is,

3917
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:36,870
is,

3918
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:37,890
is measured,

3919
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,341
right?

3920
01:57:38,341 --> 01:57:41,820
He's not saying go to these people's
homes and torture their children.

3921
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,330
Right.

3922
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:46,200
That's the problem is that like
this stuff gets misconstrued.

3923
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:48,210
Like getting back to the
lion killer thing is like,

3924
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:49,291
yes,

3925
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:50,340
be motivated,

3926
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,080
but be smart about it.

3927
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:53,003
Yes.

3928
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:53,843
Well,

3929
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,370
it's also the thing that we
were talking about before.

3930
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,090
It's.

3931
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:57,930
I think you're right though.

3932
01:57:57,931 --> 01:57:59,250
It does bring it full circle.

3933
01:57:59,330 --> 01:58:03,150
It's like this highlights what's good
about being able to express themselves

3934
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:08,430
and it also highlights how
these established sort of
structures they operate on

3935
01:58:08,441 --> 01:58:11,830
this old paradigm and they haven't
caught up to the new paradigm yet.

3936
01:58:11,831 --> 01:58:15,280
They don't understand that this is not
going to end like this whole nick diaz

3937
01:58:15,281 --> 01:58:16,660
thing and the vandelay silva thing.

3938
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:19,360
You've got to legends of the
sport that you've fucked.

3939
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:20,590
You fucked over,

3940
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:21,281
you know,

3941
01:58:21,281 --> 01:58:25,480
and there's one thing also when people
are injured and they're taking things to

3942
01:58:25,481 --> 01:58:26,410
help them recover.

3943
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:27,460
Man,

3944
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:28,540
I'm not against that.

3945
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:29,374
I'm just not.

3946
01:58:29,410 --> 01:58:29,951
Oh really?

3947
01:58:29,951 --> 01:58:30,311
Yeah.

3948
01:58:30,311 --> 01:58:31,000
If a guy,

3949
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,440
like there's certain things,

3950
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:37,090
there's certain things that you can take
that will help you recover from injury

3951
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:38,080
that are absolutely illegal.

3952
01:58:38,230 --> 01:58:38,411
Like,

3953
01:58:38,411 --> 01:58:40,120
here's one stem cells.

3954
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:40,691
Okay,

3955
01:58:40,691 --> 01:58:42,160
here's one that I have
personal experience.

3956
01:58:42,161 --> 01:58:43,030
Are those uh,

3957
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:43,810
outlawed yet?

3958
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:44,291
No,

3959
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:44,950
they're not.

3960
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:46,060
But dude,

3961
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:47,470
they fucking work.

3962
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:49,270
They weren't to repair injuries.

3963
01:58:49,271 --> 01:58:50,260
They're incredible.

3964
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:50,651
I mean,

3965
01:58:50,651 --> 01:58:51,490
it's incredible.

3966
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:51,701
The,

3967
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:53,530
they can regenerate cartilage now.

3968
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,920
So if you don't have access to stem cells
and you're competing with someone who

3969
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:02,560
does and this guy gets a stem cell
injection on his knees and his knees are

3970
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:02,951
fixed up,

3971
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:05,800
so he's going to be able to train
harder and you have to tough through it.

3972
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:07,360
Well what should that be?

3973
01:59:07,361 --> 01:59:11,920
Legal or there's a similarity to that
to people who get knee injuries or knee

3974
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:15,220
surgeries and then take a steroid
to help themselves repair,

3975
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:18,010
repair quicker so they can
get back to competing quicker.

3976
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:18,690
You know,

3977
01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:22,910
one of the fucked up things about this
too is just looking at it surface level.

3978
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,260
The these,

3979
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:28,640
these dudes go out there and beat
each other up for other people's

3980
01:59:28,641 --> 01:59:29,474
entertainment.

3981
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:31,160
And you know,

3982
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:33,860
in that interview with
diaz after the fact,

3983
01:59:33,861 --> 01:59:37,640
he was talking about how the people making
decisions about what he can and can't

3984
01:59:37,641 --> 01:59:38,091
do.

3985
01:59:38,091 --> 01:59:41,960
Those people sitting on the
board or whatever the hell it is,

3986
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,450
they don't have to experience that.

3987
01:59:44,451 --> 01:59:44,871
You know what I mean?

3988
01:59:44,871 --> 01:59:49,250
Like they're not in what you're saying
as far as recovery is concerned.

3989
01:59:49,251 --> 01:59:52,520
It's like how can a regular
person make a judgment on that?

3990
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:57,050
And coming back to the thing about having
a union fighters are the only people

3991
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:59,060
who should be making
decisions about fighters,

3992
01:59:59,110 --> 01:59:59,920
right?

3993
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,160
Like most fighters feel very strongly
that you shouldn't be able to use

3994
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:06,320
performance enhancing drugs and compete.

3995
02:00:06,321 --> 02:00:09,080
And rhonda has said this very clearly.

3996
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:09,590
Um,

3997
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:10,151
and she,

3998
02:00:10,151 --> 02:00:13,310
she says something I totally agree with
the difference between this and any

3999
02:00:13,311 --> 02:00:16,490
other sport is if you give a guy
steroids and he plays baseball,

4000
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:17,780
what's the big deal?

4001
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:19,040
He's just going to hit a ball better.

4002
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,560
But if you give a guy steroids
and you let them fight,

4003
02:00:21,650 --> 02:00:24,950
he could administer damage that maybe he
would not have been able to administer.

4004
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:28,130
He could hurt someone that maybe he
wouldn't have had the endurance to her.

4005
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:31,100
He wouldn't have been able to deliver the
combination that wound up hurting this

4006
02:00:31,101 --> 02:00:31,911
person very badly.

4007
02:00:31,911 --> 02:00:33,800
Or possibly even killing someone.

4008
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:38,810
And she said that if someone ever does
die and the other person tests positive

4009
02:00:38,811 --> 02:00:39,620
for steroids,

4010
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:40,190
they should,

4011
02:00:40,190 --> 02:00:41,930
they should really get
charged with murder.

4012
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:43,063
Well,

4013
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:43,581
yeah,

4014
02:00:43,581 --> 02:00:45,500
but I mean why it kind of does.

4015
02:00:45,501 --> 02:00:46,310
Right?

4016
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:47,480
I don't know about that.

4017
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:48,680
I don't know about that either.

4018
02:00:48,681 --> 02:00:50,930
But there's a fine line and I just think,

4019
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:55,160
I just think it's so hard to put
yourself in the person's shoes that's

4020
02:00:55,161 --> 02:00:55,860
competing.

4021
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:56,660
Like for me,

4022
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:57,440
for me,

4023
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,930
I don't have somebody

4024
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:03,280
trying to knock my fucking head off
and if that was going to work for me,

4025
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:08,650
I just feel like that you need different
kind of set of rules agreed upon by the

4026
02:01:08,651 --> 02:01:10,320
person you're about to step in there with.

4027
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:12,740
That's an interesting
way of looking at it.

4028
02:01:12,741 --> 02:01:13,790
And I agree with that as well.

4029
02:01:13,791 --> 02:01:18,030
Like say if you guys were going to fight
and you made an agreement that we're

4030
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:19,480
both going to be juicy juice.

4031
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,030
Yes.

4032
02:01:20,030 --> 02:01:20,900
You should be able to do that.

4033
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:21,380
Yeah,

4034
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:22,520
I think I agree with that.

4035
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:23,060
And we.

4036
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:23,960
And we could write.

4037
02:01:23,961 --> 02:01:24,320
Yeah.

4038
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:24,800
No,

4039
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,490
it's not legal.

4040
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:25,641
Well,

4041
02:01:25,641 --> 02:01:26,090
not in.

4042
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:26,440
Not,

4043
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:27,170
not.

4044
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:27,830
Not on a page.

4045
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:29,010
Not in the United States.

4046
02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:30,710
The island though.

4047
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:37,250
The next thing for fucking buy an island.

4048
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:39,963
No,

4049
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:42,800
I didn't know what was it?

4050
02:01:42,801 --> 02:01:46,630
That podcast with the floating countries.

4051
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:46,920
So.

4052
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:47,201
Yeah.

4053
02:01:47,201 --> 02:01:48,040
Yeah,

4054
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,861
that's right.

4055
02:01:48,861 --> 02:01:52,220
These guys are want to
be a barge off the coast.

4056
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:53,390
What do they call that shit again?

4057
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:54,860
Seasteading seasteading.

4058
02:01:54,861 --> 02:01:55,340
Thank you.

4059
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:56,060
That's what it was.

4060
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:56,490
That's,

4061
02:01:56,490 --> 02:01:56,930
that's.

4062
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:58,160
That's totally true.

4063
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,540
That's totally true.

4064
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:04,130
They need to have seasteading fights just
off the coast of catalina and fucking

4065
02:02:04,131 --> 02:02:04,970
they duke it out.

4066
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,930
All juiced up.

4067
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:10,100
Everybody's 190 fucking percent
testosterone free hookers in the audience.

4068
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:10,941
Sounds exciting.

4069
02:02:10,941 --> 02:02:12,440
Show how much you paid and get in there.

4070
02:02:12,670 --> 02:02:13,280
That wasn't ours.

4071
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:13,790
A ticket.

4072
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:14,110
That's a.

4073
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:14,510
Well,

4074
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:15,343
that's not enough.

4075
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:16,610
These hookers are good.

4076
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:19,310
That's not enough money
to pay for the ticket.

4077
02:02:19,311 --> 02:02:20,180
If they're all free,

4078
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,000
how much these girls going to get paid?

4079
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,450
They just want to be on the island.

4080
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:25,350
This agree,

4081
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:28,070
but I think in bringing it full circle,

4082
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:33,250
what we're exposing here is that this
ability to communicate about things,

4083
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:34,610
it's changing.

4084
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:37,500
It's changing radically
than anybody has a say.

4085
02:02:37,501 --> 02:02:38,180
Now,

4086
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,740
like literally anybody,

4087
02:02:39,741 --> 02:02:42,620
no matter you're not vetted
out based on your intelligence,

4088
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:45,350
you're not judged beforehand,

4089
02:02:45,351 --> 02:02:48,320
you're not screened is
anybody can just scream out.

4090
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:48,741
Like,

4091
02:02:48,741 --> 02:02:52,580
I have a friend who goes
and reads comments on his
stuff and he gets all upset.

4092
02:02:52,581 --> 02:02:52,731
I go,

4093
02:02:52,731 --> 02:02:54,390
you're getting upset at
people you don't even know.

4094
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:54,621
Yeah,

4095
02:02:54,621 --> 02:02:54,790
yeah,

4096
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:55,000
yeah.

4097
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,650
You were allowing these people into
your head and like they're saying,

4098
02:02:57,651 --> 02:02:59,510
these people say idiotic
things and he gets upset.

4099
02:02:59,520 --> 02:02:59,730
I'm like,

4100
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:00,450
of course they're gonna.

4101
02:03:00,450 --> 02:03:01,281
Say idiotic things.

4102
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:02,114
They're idiots.

4103
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:03,410
Do you hang out with idiots?

4104
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:03,951
Will listen,

4105
02:03:03,951 --> 02:03:04,130
man.

4106
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:06,680
If you go to idiots houses and
start asking them questions,

4107
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:09,500
we're going to say some shit you disagree
with or you gonna argue with them all

4108
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:09,710
day.

4109
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:10,640
You won't have a life.

4110
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:13,460
You don't have enough time
in the day to pay attention.

4111
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:14,960
Look at yourself,

4112
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:15,980
make your own job.

4113
02:03:15,981 --> 02:03:18,140
He'd be honest and be self objective.

4114
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:22,610
Make your own sort of analysis of the
pros and cons of your behavior and your

4115
02:03:22,611 --> 02:03:23,444
thinking,

4116
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,700
and then if they disagree with that,

4117
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:28,250
you kind of have at least
some sort of an idea,

4118
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:29,271
but you don't.

4119
02:03:29,271 --> 02:03:30,710
You don't have that idea on the internet.

4120
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:31,251
See,

4121
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:32,240
because you just,

4122
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:34,100
you all you see is text.

4123
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:37,510
You don't see the person's
life behind that text.

4124
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,460
You don't see what a fuck up
they've been their whole life.

4125
02:03:40,970 --> 02:03:43,160
That's allowed them to be lacking context.

4126
02:03:43,161 --> 02:03:44,510
You don't see that they're 12

4127
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,793
fucking,

4128
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:49,131
you know.

4129
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:51,080
That's another thing to
take into consideration.

4130
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,700
Wonder like what the effect of it,

4131
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:54,770
if like let's say for example,

4132
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:57,620
I had access to the same
stuff when I was 12.

4133
02:03:57,621 --> 02:03:57,791
What?

4134
02:03:57,791 --> 02:04:01,040
I have been the same asshole
probably I think I would,

4135
02:04:01,140 --> 02:04:02,790
I was an angry kid if I,

4136
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:03,900
if I was um,

4137
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:08,450
if I was able to for whatever reason get
upset about something that I felt like

4138
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,130
it's somewhere that it would be justified.

4139
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:10,761
But again,

4140
02:04:10,761 --> 02:04:14,840
my anger wouldn't have really been
directed towards what I was getting upset

4141
02:04:14,841 --> 02:04:15,171
about.

4142
02:04:15,171 --> 02:04:18,320
They would have just given me the green
light to express some of the anger that

4143
02:04:18,321 --> 02:04:19,610
I had about my own life.

4144
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:20,690
You know,

4145
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:21,021
that's.

4146
02:04:21,021 --> 02:04:22,970
I think that's a lot of
what we're dealing with you.

4147
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:26,180
I think it just a manifests
itself in these various causes,

4148
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:26,560
you know,

4149
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:27,440
like days that you,

4150
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:31,790
like you said before it is that people
are not all that happy about their own

4151
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:33,050
personal situation,

4152
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:38,070
but it's a lot easier to latch on
to conflict that someone has sort

4153
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:42,810
of shaped for you than it
is to necessarily tackle the
super personal thing that

4154
02:04:42,811 --> 02:04:43,590
you're upset with.

4155
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:43,831
Yeah.

4156
02:04:43,831 --> 02:04:48,690
Or get your life to a point of balance
where you can actually look at anything

4157
02:04:48,691 --> 02:04:53,250
that's going on in the world and have
just sort of an intelligent well,

4158
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:53,541
and,

4159
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:53,881
and that's.

4160
02:04:53,881 --> 02:04:54,714
And that's where I,

4161
02:04:54,730 --> 02:04:58,050
I think that even though this is the
wild west and everyone has a voice,

4162
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:03,210
there are obviously voices that have
emerged as more prominent when communities

4163
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:08,300
to communities and I think that
that's where I still see a sense of

4164
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:12,990
responsibility that k fine all you
need is a smartphone in twitter to,

4165
02:05:13,020 --> 02:05:15,050
to say what you want but there,

4166
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:15,781
but it's not.

4167
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:17,310
The influence still exists.

4168
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:17,940
Yes.

4169
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:22,320
And I feel like sometimes you'll
witness influence being irresponsible.

4170
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:23,723
Um,

4171
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:25,260
case in point.

4172
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:26,303
And I mean,

4173
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:27,900
I don't know how people feel about this,

4174
02:05:27,901 --> 02:05:30,120
but like when jimmy kimmel
was crying on the air,

4175
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:36,060
like for me that's an abusive influence
because he wasn't painting the entire

4176
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:36,510
picture.

4177
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,960
There he was,

4178
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,130
he was picking his side in a,

4179
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:41,520
in a very short form.

4180
02:05:41,521 --> 02:05:42,181
Little what was it,

4181
02:05:42,181 --> 02:05:47,181
two sentences and then showing that kind
of a physical emotion associated with

4182
02:05:47,491 --> 02:05:47,611
it.

4183
02:05:47,611 --> 02:05:48,570
That was fuel,

4184
02:05:48,571 --> 02:05:49,170
man.

4185
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:49,860
Yeah.

4186
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:51,840
Well that was his perspective though.

4187
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:54,810
He's got a limited perspective.

4188
02:05:54,811 --> 02:05:55,290
First of all,

4189
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:58,680
you saw his perspective about video
games and how offended people got about

4190
02:05:58,681 --> 02:05:59,160
that.

4191
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,080
They were calling in
death threats against him,

4192
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:04,590
which I found incredibly ironic
after he defends the lion hunter.

4193
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:08,650
Then he goes off about video
games sport like fuck you.

4194
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:10,321
I'm just saying.

4195
02:06:10,321 --> 02:06:10,860
I'm sure.

4196
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:12,960
I'm just saying I agree
with the video game guys.

4197
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:13,980
It's a sport.

4198
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:14,983
Yeah.

4199
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:15,530
I'm with.

4200
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:18,870
So he's what he was doing by
saying what by by mocking it.

4201
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:20,040
I guess he's trying to do comedy,

4202
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:20,610
but yeah,

4203
02:06:20,610 --> 02:06:23,490
he's being disrespectful
to an emerging sport,

4204
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:28,730
which is an unquestionably involves skill
and intelligent planning and strategy

4205
02:06:28,801 --> 02:06:29,580
and just didn't know.

4206
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:30,413
He didn't come.

4207
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,150
It was also not informed
about the line guy.

4208
02:06:33,151 --> 02:06:33,630
He was wrong.

4209
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:34,380
That's what I'm saying.

4210
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:35,280
That's what I'm saying.

4211
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:40,281
It's like I think we all need to get
smarter if we have established a voice on

4212
02:06:40,411 --> 02:06:41,220
the web,

4213
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:45,660
like take an extra second to
before you hit that send button.

4214
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,521
I know I've.

4215
02:06:46,521 --> 02:06:48,780
I've had this experience myself in,

4216
02:06:48,781 --> 02:06:49,160
in,

4217
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:49,361
in,

4218
02:06:49,361 --> 02:06:52,410
in the various communications
I've had about products let's say,

4219
02:06:52,411 --> 02:06:57,000
or videos I want to make or tweets I want
to send of like what is the effect of

4220
02:06:57,001 --> 02:06:57,601
this thing going to be.

4221
02:06:57,601 --> 02:07:01,740
It might even be the way that I feel and
I still don't want to do it because I

4222
02:07:01,741 --> 02:07:02,160
don't.

4223
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,810
I'm thinking about the reaction.

4224
02:07:03,811 --> 02:07:08,811
I'm thinking about the trickle effect
of this particular sentiment and I don't

4225
02:07:08,851 --> 02:07:09,750
think we're there yet.

4226
02:07:09,870 --> 02:07:11,460
I think a lot of the influencers,

4227
02:07:11,461 --> 02:07:15,630
if you want to call them that
are behaving irresponsibly in,

4228
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,410
in wa,

4229
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:18,330
in wanting to put out a hot take,

4230
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:22,080
wanting to have something to say about
this topic that has overwhelmed the web

4231
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:27,090
that we're susceptible to the same thing
that the lower level jerk in his room

4232
02:07:27,091 --> 02:07:31,020
or that other guy that you were
speaking about because it's attractive,

4233
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:33,390
it's attractive to get
involved in the conversation.

4234
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:35,160
Even with limited information.

4235
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:35,891
That's a real.

4236
02:07:35,891 --> 02:07:36,040
You're

4237
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,431
right,

4238
02:07:36,431 --> 02:07:36,971
you're dead right,

4239
02:07:36,971 --> 02:07:40,630
and I think we've all been guilty of that
and I think that's a really good point

4240
02:07:40,631 --> 02:07:45,190
and a really important point because I
think that whenever a subject comes up

4241
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:46,233
people do.

4242
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:48,490
If say there was no podcast,

4243
02:07:48,491 --> 02:07:49,480
no podcasts at all,

4244
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:52,570
and someone brought up some point like
that lady who's denying people gay

4245
02:07:52,571 --> 02:07:53,404
marriage,

4246
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,730
that lady in Kentucky and we will
be like this fucking dumb cunt.

4247
02:07:56,731 --> 02:07:57,190
Like we,

4248
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:57,390
we'll,

4249
02:07:57,390 --> 02:07:59,350
we'll all start talking shit like someone,

4250
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:03,640
someone should go over house to hold her
down and make make guys fuck right in

4251
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:04,474
front of her face.

4252
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:10,480
A bunch of crazy shit that's not
really a responsible thing to say,

4253
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:12,760
but then you do it in a podcast like this.

4254
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:16,510
One of the things that I like about people
wearing headsets is that at least it

4255
02:08:16,511 --> 02:08:18,790
makes you think that you're
do something professionally.

4256
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:19,680
Ah,

4257
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:20,590
there's a bit of a ride.

4258
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:22,630
It's been a few times where I was like,

4259
02:08:22,631 --> 02:08:22,931
man,

4260
02:08:22,931 --> 02:08:25,810
maybe wearing headsets like,

4261
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,730
because you forget that.

4262
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:29,980
That is really cool what you're saying.

4263
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:30,121
Yeah.

4264
02:08:30,121 --> 02:08:31,090
I never thought of that.

4265
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:33,370
That's how I think about it
because I think there's something,

4266
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:35,500
something about it being in your ear,

4267
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:38,170
like I hear you in my ear
just as clearly as I hear him,

4268
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:40,060
even though he's a few extra feet away,

4269
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,651
every.

4270
02:08:40,651 --> 02:08:45,651
We're all in the same sound waves and
I and that makes me feel professional

4271
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:51,250
extracts you just enough from the sort
of regular hangout zone that you're like,

4272
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:52,000
okay,

4273
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:52,811
people are listening.

4274
02:08:52,811 --> 02:08:53,400
Yeah.

4275
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:53,980
People do.

4276
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:55,930
You measure it just to maybe a second.

4277
02:08:56,130 --> 02:08:57,040
Wait a second longer.

4278
02:08:57,130 --> 02:08:59,320
It's a real point that
I think a lot of people,

4279
02:08:59,321 --> 02:09:01,750
especially comedians when I
have comedians on the podcast,

4280
02:09:01,751 --> 02:09:04,840
sometimes they just forget that or
they're not aware of that or they're not

4281
02:09:04,841 --> 02:09:08,750
aware of it to the extent that I am
because I know the numbers like you're.

4282
02:09:08,750 --> 02:09:12,130
You're doing a show and there's a lot
of people listening and you have a

4283
02:09:12,131 --> 02:09:13,660
responsibility to be entertaining,

4284
02:09:13,661 --> 02:09:15,580
but you also have
responsibility to be accurate.

4285
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:18,940
You can't really say things that
people might just take as fact.

4286
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:21,370
You haven't researched them because you,

4287
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:21,790
you.

4288
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:25,840
You're reaching millions and millions
of people now and I can change the way

4289
02:09:25,841 --> 02:09:26,770
they look at things.

4290
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,280
Yep.

4291
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:30,520
So like when this mike
huckabee guy latches on,

4292
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:33,070
you know that fucking guy who
latched onto that kim lady,

4293
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:34,181
what the fuck her name is?

4294
02:09:34,181 --> 02:09:36,100
The Kentucky clerk wouldn't allow it,

4295
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:36,580
gave me.

4296
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:38,290
He fucking immediately like,

4297
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:42,190
this is a great thing of who
he starts tweeting about it.

4298
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:44,290
There's a warm religious freedom,

4299
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:45,730
religious liberty,

4300
02:09:45,731 --> 02:09:46,810
and it was hilarious.

4301
02:09:46,811 --> 02:09:50,400
Like hashtag religious liberty and
all these other apes got involved.

4302
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:51,243
They're all

4303
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:54,010
screaming and yelling and it's cool.

4304
02:09:54,011 --> 02:09:59,011
It's cool to watch because you're
watching like the last gasps of a dying,

4305
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:01,060
ignorant perspective.

4306
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:06,240
You're literally seeing the last few
generations of monkeys that believe some

4307
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:10,660
dumb shit that was written on
animal skins thousands of years ago.

4308
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:15,490
You're seeing the last echoes of the
game of telephone where you tell someone,

4309
02:10:15,491 --> 02:10:19,090
and I tell someone and it gets translated
from generation to generation for over

4310
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:20,670
a thousand years before anybody buys.

4311
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:22,120
It bothers writing it down.

4312
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:23,470
Then once they write it down,

4313
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:27,190
they write it down into
fucking dead language and
that's to be translated to all

4314
02:10:27,191 --> 02:10:28,090
these other languages.

4315
02:10:28,091 --> 02:10:28,320
I mean,

4316
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,380
that is what we're seeing.

4317
02:10:29,381 --> 02:10:33,440
We see that lady screaming with her
glasses on the mike huckabee fucking

4318
02:10:33,441 --> 02:10:34,274
convention,

4319
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:36,140
going to stop all that.

4320
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:39,050
Fuck fucking she's yelling it out.

4321
02:10:39,051 --> 02:10:43,730
We're seeing a woman who contradicts
the very message of the bible itself

4322
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:45,470
because she's been
married for fucking dimes.

4323
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:46,910
You're not supposed to get divorced.

4324
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:49,220
How many religious people that
you know that have tattoos?

4325
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:50,840
You're not supposed to get tattoos.

4326
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,730
He can't fucking pick and choose.

4327
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:54,680
We can't pick and choose your shit.

4328
02:10:54,681 --> 02:10:55,820
Cherry picker religion.

4329
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:56,161
They do.

4330
02:10:56,161 --> 02:10:58,790
They cherry pick what they like and what
they don't like about their religion

4331
02:10:59,070 --> 02:11:01,620
she has done is just as
bad as a mouth fucking.

4332
02:11:03,070 --> 02:11:04,120
I think what I think.

4333
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:08,420
I think what you're saying is
completely true here in north America,

4334
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:11,000
but globally religion.

4335
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:11,810
Oh yeah,

4336
02:11:11,810 --> 02:11:12,160
it ain't.

4337
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:13,700
He's slowing down will.

4338
02:11:13,701 --> 02:11:18,701
It's hard to get the internet to like
places in the middle of nowhere and it's

4339
02:11:19,881 --> 02:11:22,670
hard to get the influence of
those communities in them,

4340
02:11:22,671 --> 02:11:24,200
but it will happen eventually.

4341
02:11:24,201 --> 02:11:24,680
I agree,

4342
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,120
and when it does happen,

4343
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:30,830
you realize that your
perspective is simply the
perspective of the people around

4344
02:11:30,831 --> 02:11:31,490
you,

4345
02:11:31,490 --> 02:11:33,750
that you have sort of adopted and your,

4346
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:34,850
your view of life,

4347
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:35,990
your view of religion,

4348
02:11:35,991 --> 02:11:36,680
your view of all.

4349
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:41,540
I mean I've had people on my podcast
that used to be muslim and they've become

4350
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:42,600
atheists and they,

4351
02:11:42,610 --> 02:11:42,890
they've.

4352
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:44,530
They lived there in,

4353
02:11:44,590 --> 02:11:44,920
in,

4354
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:47,870
in the middle east and they were a part
of that culture and they thought like

4355
02:11:47,871 --> 02:11:50,780
those people did and then they came
over here and they started reading.

4356
02:11:50,781 --> 02:11:51,614
I started getting into it.

4357
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:53,510
They hard to really know what the fuck is.

4358
02:11:53,511 --> 02:11:55,280
This ideology that I've subscribed to,

4359
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:57,380
this isn't the only way to
think and not only that,

4360
02:11:57,381 --> 02:12:01,130
it's not if you take enough
time and look at it objectively,

4361
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:02,780
it's not even rational.

4362
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:06,080
It's not like this is
a bulletproof ideology,

4363
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:09,830
but that's how it's most religions
try to pass their stuff off.

4364
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:12,980
Scientology tries to pass
them their self off like that.

4365
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:15,200
They try to pass their
stuff off as bulletproof,

4366
02:12:15,201 --> 02:12:17,090
like this is the way that's the sale,

4367
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:17,960
that's the sales pitch.

4368
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:20,030
This is the way to become happy.

4369
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:20,760
Yeah.

4370
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:21,593
Yeah.

4371
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:22,371
But again,

4372
02:12:22,371 --> 02:12:25,670
I think the internet is the
cure to that information.

4373
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:27,500
Information for sure.

4374
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:27,890
Is it.

4375
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:32,890
Is is the number one sort of ulterior
fighting force against this type of stuff

4376
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:35,054
that you're talking about?

4377
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:40,300
Access to it in the same way we were
talking about getting internet into a hard

4378
02:12:41,001 --> 02:12:41,990
to reach places.

4379
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:46,130
That's actually a google x project
that they're working on with these air

4380
02:12:46,131 --> 02:12:46,551
balloons.

4381
02:12:46,551 --> 02:12:47,600
I don't know if you've heard about this.

4382
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:48,291
Yeah,

4383
02:12:48,291 --> 02:12:49,520
the wifi balloons,

4384
02:12:49,521 --> 02:12:49,780
right,

4385
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:54,380
so it's like crazy weather balloons that
hover above areas that have no service.

4386
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:58,070
I'm hard to reach places
and they're on a cycle,

4387
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:02,780
so your phone is rapidly switching between
the one that's actually overhead at

4388
02:13:02,781 --> 02:13:06,500
that point and is that one slowly
drifts out of range on the jet stream.

4389
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:08,990
The next one float off the next one,

4390
02:13:08,991 --> 02:13:09,340
flow,

4391
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:09,680
flow,

4392
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:10,341
flow is in,

4393
02:13:10,341 --> 02:13:13,430
and then you hand off to that one so
you don't notice an interruption in

4394
02:13:13,431 --> 02:13:14,264
connection.

4395
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:16,790
But since a weather balloon
can't sit there forever,

4396
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:17,390
it,

4397
02:13:17,390 --> 02:13:17,741
you know,

4398
02:13:17,741 --> 02:13:18,001
it's,

4399
02:13:18,001 --> 02:13:18,250
it's,

4400
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:21,620
it's float floating along
along with the weather system.

4401
02:13:22,010 --> 02:13:22,310
Uh,

4402
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:24,050
but some really cool technology.

4403
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:27,110
There's some videos online that
show how they've made it a.

4404
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:28,040
So the idea being,

4405
02:13:28,041 --> 02:13:31,880
it's like places like
North Korea for float,

4406
02:13:31,881 --> 02:13:31,980
you

4407
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,380
fucking balloons to just
shoot them out of the sky.

4408
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:35,430
Well,

4409
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:36,263
it's actually kind of,

4410
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:36,500
they're,

4411
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:39,930
they're pretty high up sound
like you're selling them.

4412
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,100
And I am,

4413
02:13:41,101 --> 02:13:43,590
I am because fuck this
North Korea shit for real,

4414
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:44,271
for real,

4415
02:13:44,271 --> 02:13:44,770
for real,

4416
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:45,330
for real.

4417
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:48,690
That's bonkers that we're
allowing that to still exist.

4418
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:49,270
And,

4419
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:50,160
and the beauty of it,

4420
02:13:50,161 --> 02:13:53,280
it's like going in there without
weapons going in there with information.

4421
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:54,870
Don't you love that storyline?

4422
02:13:55,210 --> 02:13:56,910
We're going in there with connectivity.

4423
02:13:56,911 --> 02:13:57,744
Bitch.

4424
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:58,410
We're gonna.

4425
02:13:58,410 --> 02:13:58,950
We're gonna,

4426
02:13:58,950 --> 02:13:59,640
we're gonna.

4427
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:00,030
We're gonna.

4428
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:01,680
Bring it up from the grassroots,

4429
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:03,680
the rise of a nation led bulbs.

4430
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:06,750
Let the people make the
decision for themselves.

4431
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:08,490
And you've got South Korea right there.

4432
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:09,091
I mean,

4433
02:14:09,091 --> 02:14:10,080
it'd be so easy.

4434
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:13,680
So you get this beautiful little
base to let these things go over.

4435
02:14:13,681 --> 02:14:14,070
I've just,

4436
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:16,350
I love the idea of informational warfare.

4437
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:17,340
You know,

4438
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,180
that he doesn't,

4439
02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:21,810
that he doesn't have to be
about bullets and bombs,

4440
02:14:21,811 --> 02:14:24,510
that if you can reach enough
people with a particular message,

4441
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:25,050
you know,

4442
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:27,010
they can figure it out just to just like,

4443
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:28,530
right for them.

4444
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:29,460
It'll take a lot of time.

4445
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:30,750
They're so deep in the web.

4446
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,471
I don't know man,

4447
02:14:31,471 --> 02:14:35,190
because anywhere like you just spoke
about a person completely changing their

4448
02:14:35,191 --> 02:14:37,920
religious outlook just upon
arriving somewhere else.

4449
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:38,671
When you think about it,

4450
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:39,630
what is the difference?

4451
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:43,130
It's the information available to them
even though it might not be on a phone or

4452
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,400
or a or a laptop.

4453
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:47,670
It's the information they're supposed to
by the culture they're surrounded with.

4454
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:49,410
It's not the geographic location.

4455
02:14:49,970 --> 02:14:50,220
Yeah,

4456
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,120
you're exactly right.

4457
02:14:51,121 --> 02:14:55,620
And if you look at how quickly uprisings
took place in places like Egypt and so

4458
02:14:55,621 --> 02:14:56,310
on spring,

4459
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:57,810
it was just like give them twitter,

4460
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:58,830
holy shit.

4461
02:14:58,831 --> 02:15:03,360
And immediate overhaul in the behavior
because all of a sudden now you've got

4462
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:07,140
this massive cultural shift
of communication and so on,

4463
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:08,670
and people with access to google.

4464
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:09,001
I mean,

4465
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:14,001
why do you think China has been blocking
youtube and google since day one,

4466
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:15,451
day one,

4467
02:15:15,451 --> 02:15:16,740
because the warfare is,

4468
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,540
has always been about information.

4469
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:21,120
World war two doesn't
happen without propaganda.

4470
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:22,830
Will have a friend who works at worked,

4471
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:24,080
doesn't work anymore.

4472
02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:24,391
Google.

4473
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:27,510
But she would go over to China and have
meetings with these people and they were

4474
02:15:27,511 --> 02:15:27,661
like,

4475
02:15:27,661 --> 02:15:27,781
well,

4476
02:15:27,781 --> 02:15:29,470
we want access to these people's emails.

4477
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:31,170
We want to be able to block these things.

4478
02:15:31,171 --> 02:15:31,411
They're like,

4479
02:15:31,411 --> 02:15:31,670
whoa,

4480
02:15:31,670 --> 02:15:31,891
whoa,

4481
02:15:31,891 --> 02:15:32,101
whoa.

4482
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:33,500
That's not what we're dealing with.

4483
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:37,410
That's an important distinction
to make because it's not that.

4484
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:38,890
It's not that I'm,

4485
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:40,260
that they're just blocked.

4486
02:15:40,261 --> 02:15:43,800
It's also that google doesn't want to
be there either for those exact reasons.

4487
02:15:43,801 --> 02:15:44,101
So it's a,

4488
02:15:44,101 --> 02:15:44,730
it's a,

4489
02:15:44,730 --> 02:15:46,200
it's a two way thing.

4490
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:46,980
But,

4491
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:47,640
uh,

4492
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:48,150
I think,

4493
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:52,380
I think that the control control
structures that exist in our global

4494
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:53,310
perspective,

4495
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:56,250
they exist for because of an agenda,

4496
02:15:56,251 --> 02:15:57,240
a particular agenda,

4497
02:15:57,241 --> 02:15:57,931
whatever that might be.

4498
02:15:57,931 --> 02:15:59,700
And you can't control people if you,

4499
02:15:59,750 --> 02:16:00,583
if you can,

4500
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:02,400
if you don't control information flow.

4501
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:07,550
And also I think that people are almost
automatically or naturally gravitate

4502
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:11,070
towards controlling
others if they have power,

4503
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:12,243
Nevada,

4504
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:16,410
Nevada state athletic commission or any
king or dictatorship or what people felt

4505
02:16:16,411 --> 02:16:17,490
about the nsa.

4506
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:21,270
That's why people are so outraged with
edward stoten thing that these people who

4507
02:16:21,271 --> 02:16:22,170
are no different than,

4508
02:16:22,171 --> 02:16:22,591
you know,

4509
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:27,591
different than I just got jobs and could
research ex-girlfriends emails and I

4510
02:16:28,461 --> 02:16:32,320
mean they could do all kinds of creepy
shit that you shouldn't really be able to

4511
02:16:32,321 --> 02:16:33,071
do in the public.

4512
02:16:33,071 --> 02:16:34,510
Didn't know about power corrupts.

4513
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:35,700
Power corrupts absolutely.

4514
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:36,553
Absolutely pal.

4515
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:37,240
Absolute.

4516
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:38,230
Whatever the hell it works.

4517
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:39,183
How's it going?

4518
02:16:39,550 --> 02:16:43,140
Absolute power corrupts absolute
power corrupts absolutely.

4519
02:16:43,141 --> 02:16:44,710
And absolute power corrupts absolutely.

4520
02:16:44,711 --> 02:16:45,430
That's what it is.

4521
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:47,620
Power corrupts and absolute
power corrupts absolutely.

4522
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:48,221
Yeah.

4523
02:16:48,221 --> 02:16:50,140
And the governments have absolute power.

4524
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:50,680
Yeah.

4525
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:53,980
Government of North Korea absolutely has
absolute power and that's the scariest

4526
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:55,120
version that we have.

4527
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:59,350
And it's also throws in the face whenever
the us talks about invading Syria or

4528
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:00,161
in these other places.

4529
02:17:00,161 --> 02:17:02,230
Like what about the worst spot?

4530
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:04,660
The spot with nuclear bombs,

4531
02:17:04,661 --> 02:17:05,950
it's run by a fucking nut,

4532
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:07,060
completely true.

4533
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:11,890
And when you have allies like South Korea,

4534
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:14,770
Japan that are right in the zone,

4535
02:17:14,771 --> 02:17:17,350
they're writing bombs zone and like what?

4536
02:17:18,430 --> 02:17:22,630
I just imagined that there was a border
here with that kind of shit on the other

4537
02:17:22,631 --> 02:17:23,350
side.

4538
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:24,630
Like that's a,

4539
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:27,610
a daily life type situation
for people in South Korea.

4540
02:17:27,611 --> 02:17:29,590
It's a completely developed place,

4541
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:34,800
much like here culturally complete free
and open marketplace and their neighbor,

4542
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:37,390
their neighbor or these psychos,

4543
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:40,420
like it's one thing for us to
think about it at this distance,

4544
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:44,920
but those people daily life is wondering
what the fuck is gonna happen and the

4545
02:17:44,921 --> 02:17:45,641
whole country,

4546
02:17:45,641 --> 02:17:50,641
north and South Korea is like the size
of Texas that too had those big as North

4547
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,030
Korea and South Korea.

4548
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:52,661
Find that out.

4549
02:17:52,661 --> 02:17:53,840
I would say that combine.

4550
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:54,220
No,

4551
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:55,480
I would say you're about right.

4552
02:17:55,481 --> 02:17:57,010
And if their grocery stores are fake,

4553
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:57,310
you know,

4554
02:17:57,310 --> 02:18:00,770
and if they're like putting this whole
fake thing on their nuclear stories

4555
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:01,180
affect,

4556
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:01,421
you know,

4557
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:04,000
like how they have the vice documentary.

4558
02:18:04,001 --> 02:18:04,180
Yeah,

4559
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:04,950
the restaurants.

4560
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:05,280
Yeah.

4561
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:06,000
Yeah.

4562
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,540
Vice did they set up fake restaurants
for pr purposes to make it look like

4563
02:18:10,550 --> 02:18:11,383
they're normal,

4564
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:12,020
but you know,

4565
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:12,853
you got another.

4566
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:15,580
Their nuclear plans probably fake.

4567
02:18:15,581 --> 02:18:16,480
They can't do anything.

4568
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:17,051
They're just,

4569
02:18:17,051 --> 02:18:17,320
you know,

4570
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,680
they've actually proven that,

4571
02:18:18,681 --> 02:18:21,340
that they're nuclear missiles
and they're all wonky.

4572
02:18:21,341 --> 02:18:25,140
They've done so they saw
canadians or something.

4573
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,280
Now I'm not going to look at him.

4574
02:18:30,180 --> 02:18:32,600
I'm not going to get killed.

4575
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:34,653
Hey,

4576
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:35,950
we keep you guys honest.

4577
02:18:35,951 --> 02:18:36,221
All right.

4578
02:18:36,221 --> 02:18:37,050
That's our job.

4579
02:18:37,050 --> 02:18:38,290
While you're nicer than us,

4580
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:39,490
we always go over there and go,

4581
02:18:39,491 --> 02:18:39,791
god,

4582
02:18:39,791 --> 02:18:44,791
why can't we be like canadian firm
that can settle a liquor guy heard?

4583
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:46,090
I've actually been getting a.

4584
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:46,271
Yeah,

4585
02:18:46,271 --> 02:18:47,104
that's fucked up.

4586
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:48,550
Don't get me started on that.

4587
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,190
What's going on?

4588
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:49,631
The government.

4589
02:18:49,631 --> 02:18:51,680
What government owns all the candidate?

4590
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:52,613
Cbo,

4591
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:53,741
provincial.

4592
02:18:53,741 --> 02:18:56,290
The lcpo fuck you.

4593
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:56,711
All right.

4594
02:18:56,711 --> 02:18:58,720
Now you guys don't have
legal weed anywhere.

4595
02:18:58,721 --> 02:18:59,230
Do you?

4596
02:18:59,230 --> 02:18:59,891
Legal weed?

4597
02:18:59,891 --> 02:19:00,131
Yeah.

4598
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:01,360
Well medical like.

4599
02:19:01,450 --> 02:19:01,691
Yeah,

4600
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:02,340
but no,

4601
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:03,130
Colorado.

4602
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:07,450
Nobody has given a fuck about weeding
Canada for as long as I've been alive.

4603
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:08,350
So it.

4604
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:09,430
Maybe it's not on paper,

4605
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:10,690
just make it on paper.

4606
02:19:10,691 --> 02:19:10,871
You know,

4607
02:19:10,871 --> 02:19:14,260
Colorado has made more money in taxes
this year for the first time ever.

4608
02:19:14,261 --> 02:19:15,610
Then alcohol with weed.

4609
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:16,240
Oh,

4610
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:16,920
your money from.

4611
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,770
We'd actually.

4612
02:19:17,771 --> 02:19:18,131
And this is,

4613
02:19:18,131 --> 02:19:19,900
that's perfect for what
he's talking about.

4614
02:19:19,930 --> 02:19:22,420
The lcpo is the ontario liquor board.

4615
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:25,960
Who is the single biggest
retailer of alcohol in the world.

4616
02:19:26,050 --> 02:19:27,160
That's hilarious.

4617
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,360
Because it's a huge marketplace.

4618
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:31,100
Well big a big marketplace.

4619
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:34,910
And they're the only sellers
so they get to set the price.

4620
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:36,740
So alcohol is expensive.

4621
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:42,430
The stores are fucking magnificent
samples and when they close at 8:00 PM.

4622
02:19:42,831 --> 02:19:44,690
So if you want to get some
Jack Daniels at eight,

4623
02:19:44,691 --> 02:19:45,161
10 years,

4624
02:19:45,161 --> 02:19:45,994
you know,

4625
02:19:46,130 --> 02:19:47,270
most of them are 10.

4626
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:47,770
Well,

4627
02:19:47,770 --> 02:19:48,490
it still,

4628
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:52,490
he doesn't even go to bed until
six or 10 and listen and listen,

4629
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,930
there's an argument to be made.

4630
02:19:53,931 --> 02:19:54,230
I,

4631
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:54,890
I,

4632
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:55,560
you know,

4633
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:55,791
I,

4634
02:19:55,791 --> 02:19:56,900
I see that side of it,

4635
02:19:57,110 --> 02:20:01,430
but there's some shady ass liquor stores
too that you don't have to deal with

4636
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:02,563
because it's,

4637
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,100
it's treated the way that it is.

4638
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:06,290
But see that's part of
the fun of an open market.

4639
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:07,340
Those shady ass lickers.

4640
02:20:07,341 --> 02:20:07,950
That's true.

4641
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:08,370
That's true.

4642
02:20:08,370 --> 02:20:08,970
In phoenix.

4643
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:10,370
Went to a drive through store.

4644
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:11,301
We're in phoenix.

4645
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:12,260
There was a guy who,

4646
02:20:12,261 --> 02:20:12,500
uh,

4647
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,030
he's dead now so we can
talk shit about him.

4648
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:17,330
He used to run this comedy club
and he was out of his fucking mind.

4649
02:20:17,331 --> 02:20:18,680
He wouldn't let us drink on stage.

4650
02:20:18,681 --> 02:20:21,590
He said it was a law and we found
out that there wasn't a law.

4651
02:20:21,890 --> 02:20:25,790
So what we decided to do was drive to
this drive through fucking liquor store on

4652
02:20:25,810 --> 02:20:28,130
a bottle of Jack Daniels in a flask.

4653
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,950
And then while I was on stage,

4654
02:20:30,951 --> 02:20:32,780
I explained that I was drinking diet coke,

4655
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:35,360
but I liked to have warm
diet coke and my cold.

4656
02:20:35,361 --> 02:20:36,090
Makes sense.

4657
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:37,040
You would like turn around,

4658
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:42,170
pull out of my pocket and one
of the waitresses ratted me out.

4659
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:42,710
Yeah,

4660
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:44,420
I'm with you either tomorrow by the way.

4661
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:45,413
Oh,

4662
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:46,700
phoenix Arizona.

4663
02:20:46,710 --> 02:20:47,690
A stand up live.

4664
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:50,120
Unless the shooter hits
me and I go to naca.

4665
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:51,440
The phoenix shooter?

4666
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:51,771
Yeah.

4667
02:20:51,771 --> 02:20:55,160
There's a highway shooter that's
just shooting cars on in phoenix.

4668
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:57,770
I think he's got 11 people so far killed.

4669
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:58,191
Uh,

4670
02:20:58,191 --> 02:20:58,610
no,

4671
02:20:58,610 --> 02:20:59,600
no one had been killed yet,

4672
02:20:59,630 --> 02:21:02,300
but he's just shooting with sniper rifles.

4673
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:05,690
And hinchcliffe and ico to naca.

4674
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:06,613
That's a great show.

4675
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:07,940
And that's that standup live.

4676
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:09,110
Great fucking comedy club.

4677
02:21:09,111 --> 02:21:09,411
We got to.

4678
02:21:09,411 --> 02:21:09,951
Unfortunately,

4679
02:21:09,951 --> 02:21:10,880
we've got to wrap this thing up.

4680
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:11,470
I go.

4681
02:21:11,470 --> 02:21:13,430
Can I just be clear about one thing here?

4682
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:16,400
Open market booze in ontario.

4683
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:17,270
I'm for that.

4684
02:21:17,430 --> 02:21:17,960
Okay.

4685
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:18,500
Okay.

4686
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:20,150
The lcb ozone is okay,

4687
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,050
but I'm not.

4688
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:23,660
That sounds like I was on team lcpo there.

4689
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:25,520
I see what else cbo is.

4690
02:21:25,521 --> 02:21:27,020
That's the ontario liquor board.

4691
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:29,660
The group that controls alcohol.

4692
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:30,740
Okay.

4693
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:31,573
Free market.

4694
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:32,623
Yes.

4695
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:33,590
Yeah.

4696
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:34,430
It didn't sound like you were.

4697
02:21:34,431 --> 02:21:34,990
Okay.

4698
02:21:34,990 --> 02:21:37,130
Well it was painting something.

4699
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:41,140
Let's get frustrated every time I go
to toronto and then I get some Jack

4700
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:41,160
Daniels.

4701
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:41,571
I'll wait.

4702
02:21:41,571 --> 02:21:42,860
I can plan in advance.

4703
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:43,290
Yeah.

4704
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:44,480
Now I just forget what.

4705
02:21:44,481 --> 02:21:45,680
You could still go to a bar.

4706
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:46,000
Yeah,

4707
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:46,330
yeah,

4708
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:46,940
yeah.

4709
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:47,121
Yeah.

4710
02:21:47,121 --> 02:21:47,480
But I'm,

4711
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:47,760
you know,

4712
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:49,370
I think liquor stores
should be 24 hours a day.

4713
02:21:49,371 --> 02:21:52,040
That's the one thing that I really love
about vegas is that they don't restrict

4714
02:21:52,041 --> 02:21:52,710
when you drink.

4715
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:56,780
The bad thing is you have to have 15
different kinds of aids to get a medical

4716
02:21:56,781 --> 02:21:57,740
marijuana card there,

4717
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,180
but that's just for now.

4718
02:21:59,430 --> 02:21:59,680
Yeah,

4719
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,530
well what I suppose to thinking there
might be that if people get high,

4720
02:22:03,531 --> 02:22:04,341
they're drinking less,

4721
02:22:04,341 --> 02:22:05,540
spending less gambling,

4722
02:22:05,541 --> 02:22:05,960
less.

4723
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,860
You want to hear irony,

4724
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,320
one of the chairman's,

4725
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:09,771
uh,

4726
02:22:09,771 --> 02:22:12,980
one of the commissioners for the
Nevada state athletic commission,

4727
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,350
his company that he owns,

4728
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:18,230
applied for a medical marijuana license.

4729
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:19,520
Whoa,

4730
02:22:19,690 --> 02:22:20,420
that's awesome.

4731
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:21,110
Yeah.

4732
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,531
Yeah.

4733
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:23,900
His name is able to dig into this.

4734
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:25,830
His name is a commissioner

4735
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:31,060
mel and his company applied
for a marijuana distributor
dispensary license last

4736
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:31,590
year.

4737
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:32,423
Not that,

4738
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,413
how about that?

4739
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:34,171
How about that?

4740
02:22:34,171 --> 02:22:35,400

4744
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:42,330
A red band on twitter.
