00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,630
My kids are getting old enough now
where their sports leagues no longer,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,883
you know,

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,280
for awhile there I was just driving me
crazy as it was apparent and go into a

5
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:13,880
game and realizing that they weren't
keeping score because they didn't want to

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,853
upset.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,310
Oh my God.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,140
That's the whole reason
why people get better.

9
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:18,890
You fucks.

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,060
Meanwhile the kids are keeping score.

11
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,990
The kids know for sure.

12
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,330
And kids don't want you to
blow smoke up their ass.

13
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:23,541
Right.

14
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:23,960
You don't want it.

15
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,940
They'd come off the court and if my,

16
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,880
you know what,

17
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,471
I would like the,

18
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,250
the oldest boy,

19
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:28,881
a scooter,

20
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:30,080
he's 10 years old and he's,

21
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:31,400
he plays a lot of Lacrosse.

22
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:33,320
He's been playing for
five years and so he's,

23
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,760
he really likes it and he does.

24
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,541
He does well,

25
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,051
but you know,

26
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm not raising the
Division One champion there.

27
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:39,554
Right.

28
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,000
But he plays other sports too.

29
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,511
So there's,

30
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:43,010
there's sort of a well-roundedness there.

31
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,800
But we came off the field one day
and we were walking along and,

32
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,023
and um,

33
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,470
you know,

34
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,880
all the parents were kind of
marching off and the game was over.

35
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,270
And he says,

36
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,131
he says,

37
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:52,521
how do I do?

38
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:52,851
And I said,

39
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,360
well,

40
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,840
you know,

41
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,920
you could've done better.

42
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,850
Um,

43
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,151
I said,

44
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:59,240
I just get the impression he
didn't try as hard as you could.

45
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,260
What do you think?

46
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,180
And he looked at me irritated,

47
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,540
right?

48
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,321
He looked at me like,

49
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,850
I can't believe you didn't
just say I did great.

50
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,010
And so he said,

51
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:07,400
what?

52
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,651
And I,

53
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,660
and I looked at him,

54
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm walking along and I didn't realize
the parents were within earshot.

55
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,631
And I said,

56
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:11,751
well,

57
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:12,050
look,

58
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,350
you know,

59
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,711
screwed.

60
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:15,350
Do you want me to blow smoke up your
ass or do you want me to be honest with

61
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:16,070
you?

62
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,330
And to his credit,

63
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:18,060
he said you,

64
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,130
and he'd be honest with me,

65
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:20,150
even though he wasn't happy about it.

66
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:20,960
The honesty.

67
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,920
So you should be honest with me.

68
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,120
And so we,

69
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,050
we tell kids,

70
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:24,710
we,

71
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,670
they know better.

72
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,091
You know,

73
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:29,120
if you tell a kid that they're great
and they're doing wonderful and they

74
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,954
didn't,

75
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,550
what did they take away from that?

76
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,760
They take away from it that
you're kind of bullshit,

77
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,260
right?

78
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,093
You know,

79
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,470
unless they're just super,

80
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,304
super young,

81
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,031
they pretty,

82
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,470
they get it at a pretty early age.

83
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:39,901
Well,

84
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,350
here's,

85
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,060
here's something that's important to
relate to children that you are not your

86
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,020
accomplishments.

87
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,010
You are you,

88
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,130
and the only way you are going to get
better at accomplishing things is to be a

89
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,310
hundred percent honest about the amount
of effort you put in and what the actual

90
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,660
result of that effort is.

91
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,040
Whether it's a failure or a
success that does not define you.

92
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,030
The defines your participation
in this particular activity.

93
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:06,864
It is not you.

94
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,400
You are an individual that will hopefully
learn from all of your endeavors,

95
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,850
but you're never going to learn
shit if you lie to yourself.

96
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,470
He never going to learn shit.

97
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,640
If somebody makes this,

98
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:21,540
nobody scores a point in there are new
winners and there are no losers in.

99
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,620
Everybody's amazing that that's not
good because good voice by the way,

100
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,790
it's not good because there's going to
be people out there that are fucking

101
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,730
driven and psychotic and
they're going to get ahead.

102
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,410
There's people that are task oriented and
goal oriented it and they have an idea

103
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,930
ahead of them going to try to
figure out how to make this happen.

104
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,741
They have a goal,

105
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:41,610
they want to reach it,

106
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,720
and if you're competing with that person
and any form of life and they're not

107
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,721
burdened down by the bullshit
that we give so many kids today,

108
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,450
they're going to have a massive advantage
and this idea that this kid who's been

109
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:57,180
coddled and treated like he's
always going to be a winner,

110
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,370
that somehow or another they're
going to be happier fucking crazy

111
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,620
kid camp process.

112
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,040
What's true and what's not and
the kid can't process criticism,

113
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,720
constructive criticism,

114
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:07,961
right?

115
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,850
You don't just stand there and
berate you're kid of course.

116
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,050
Now that's just as bad as the other.

117
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,260
Yeah,

118
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,401
no,

119
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:12,801
absolutely.

120
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,920
They're the guys that stand
on and everybody's seen them.

121
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,460
Right.

122
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,930
The dads and sometimes the moms,

123
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,710
it's down on the sideline and break
their kid because kids jeopardizing his

124
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,860
scholarship to some more on school morons.

125
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,611
But no,

126
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,080
I,

127
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,070
I think you're absolutely right.

128
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,904
They've got to,

129
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,790
the sooner they're able to assess that,

130
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,530
that equation effort,

131
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,221
uh,

132
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:37,450
and result and compare it to
what's going on around them.

133
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:37,901
Well,

134
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:38,141
look,

135
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,321
you know,

136
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,060
not everybody wins the lottery
of life to a little bit.

137
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,060
Isn't that the problem with socialism
and the idea of we should even out the

138
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:46,810
playing field?

139
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,171
Yes.

140
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,560
I mean the idea that competition,

141
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,870
you're a competition guy,

142
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,440
right?

143
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,080
But you know,

144
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,210
a famous Democrat,

145
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,470
John Kennedy said that life is
unfair and in a different era,

146
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
but it's not fair.

147
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:57,701
Right?

148
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:57,851
I mean,

149
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,950
just trying to bang a lot
of checks and you can't,

150
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,161
you know,

151
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,470
you can't dwell on the
things that you don't have.

152
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:02,780
Hey,

153
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,600
I wish I could've been
born better looking.

154
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,250
I could have been born taller.

155
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,671
You know,

156
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,690
you've got to make the most,

157
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:08,560
it's like playing poker.

158
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,030
You got to play it.

159
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,580
You could have the worst
hand and you can win the pot.

160
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,091
Right?

161
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,510
So,

162
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:13,990
you know,

163
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,380
obviously is it easier to win
the hand if you got right?

164
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,180
If you're a bad player,

165
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,040
you'll win nothing cause
everybody's going to drop.

166
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,460
Right?

167
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,050
And so even getting the best hand,

168
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,060
it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna,

169
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,420
you're gonna you're
going to play it right.

170
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,130
But you know it's not,

171
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,810
I mean if two people,

172
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:32,920
if I want to hire somebody and the way
they look I believe is going to help me

173
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:36,370
earn more money because I think that
having a more attractive person in

174
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,090
particular business position is going
to somehow lead to greater sales.

175
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,330
I mean that's really the only reason
that you're going to pay somebody more

176
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:44,680
money if they look good.

177
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,250
Like look it on,

178
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,401
you know,

179
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:47,470
I go on Fox television or CNBC,

180
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
it's not an accident that all these
women interviewing me are pretty hot,

181
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,370
right?

182
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,360
I mean unattractive women could read the
news and ask me questions just as good

183
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,194
as they can,

184
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,340
but they're hoping and they're betting
that more guys like us are going to tune

185
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,100
in to watch a hot chick interview me.

186
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,530
Then a home we won and
they're probably right.

187
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,071
Right.

188
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:09,010
Because probably lots of the girls
that are applying for these jobs,

189
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,970
they're not getting hired.

190
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,410
No,

191
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,100
I agree with you 100% but there,

192
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:16,420
there's a fascinating thing that's going
on today where competition is thought

193
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,920
to be and somehow some way,

194
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,270
shape or form a negative thing.

195
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,490
And that this kind of competition,

196
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:24,640
whether it's even capitalism
itself is criticized,

197
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:24,850
right?

198
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,180
Like there's a lot of people today that
are in favor of socialism and it's one

199
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,390
of the reasons why Bernie Sanders
was so attractive is because like,

200
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:31,900
Hey,

201
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,990
you people that are not winning this crazy
competition out there that don't have

202
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,824
any desire.

203
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,440
We're going to even out this playing
field and those people that are out there

204
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,820
kicking ass and taking names,

205
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,670
we're going to take some of that money
and we're going to just give it to

206
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,504
everybody else.

207
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,691
Yeah.

208
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,380
That is the appeal of socialism
because it appeals to the lowest common

209
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:47,891
denominator.

210
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,540
That'll just appeal to ignorance.

211
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,180
But it appeals to greed
because an envy like,

212
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,331
oh,

213
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,090
this person has so much more
than me and it's not fair.

214
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,280
But here's the beauty of competition
because this is why we want competition.

215
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,160
We all want stuff,

216
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,113
right?

217
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,900
And,

218
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,320
and so I want people
competing to sell me stuff,

219
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,890
right?

220
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,730
I want to have as much as I
can as far as consumer goods.

221
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,600
That's what we all want.

222
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:15,290
We want products and services
that enhance our lives.

223
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
And the way we get the best products,

224
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,700
wait with the highest quality that deliver
the most value at the lowest price is

225
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,260
to have lots of competition.

226
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,530
All kinds of people
competing for my business.

227
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,711
Hey,

228
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,940
I've got some money to spend.

229
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,300
Oh,

230
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,111
buy my product,

231
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:30,890
buy my product.

232
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,720
Competition is what's made is what makes
sure that I get the best thing that is

233
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:36,450
soup

234
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,980
per hard to wrap your head around.

235
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,843
Yeah.

236
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,160
And then there's the big question,

237
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:41,341
right?

238
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:42,960
We wouldn't get paid the
big bucks if it were,

239
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,420
the big question is why?

240
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,910
Like why do you think
this is all happening?

241
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,740
Or do you ever use that word?

242
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:50,910
Why is,

243
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,870
why is a weird word,

244
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:52,111
right?

245
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:52,261
Yeah.

246
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,910
Why is it weird is happening?

247
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,730
It is,

248
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,230
uh,

249
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,790
what's causing it to happen?

250
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,610
What are the forces that
caused it to happen ever?

251
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,080
Why do you ever look at it all and go,

252
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,490
is there a purpose to all this?

253
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,160
So,

254
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,730
sure.

255
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,330
Um,

256
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,290
and I think the answer is no.

257
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,153
I think,

258
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,000
I think that,

259
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,420
yeah,

260
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,460
there's no reason why.

261
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:09,911
And again,

262
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:12,220
just looking up into the sky,

263
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,113
uh,

264
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:13,931
you know,

265
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:16,300
unless the purpose was
to make it pretty sky,

266
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,691
boy,

267
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:20,260
anything that we're seeing here on earth
could have been done much with much

268
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,570
less effort than making
100 billion galaxies.

269
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,433
Right?

270
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,363
Um,

271
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,060
there's no evidence than anything that
we've learned about science or the

272
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:32,050
universe that gives us a reason to believe
that there's a purpose behind it all.

273
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,920
Um,

274
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,790
if anything,

275
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,020
as time goes on,

276
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,560
the entropy of the universe is increasing
and the university becoming more

277
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:39,940
random and disorderly.

278
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,321
Um,

279
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:41,951
I think that we're,

280
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:42,251
you know,

281
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:47,251
riding a wave of a universe that is
growing and expanding and cooling and

282
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,810
becoming more and more disorderly.

283
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:51,520
And that's a finite amount of time.

284
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,170
So 14 billion years from the big
bang to today sounds like a lot.

285
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,100
That's 1.4 times 10 to the 10 years.

286
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,690
But the future of the universe
is enormously longer than that.

287
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,190
According to our best current theories.

288
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,030
It's it's way.

289
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,860
It's potentially infinitely long.

290
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,401
Anyway.

291
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:13,300
The last star is not going to burn out
until a quadrillion years from now.

292
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,610
We are very close to the beginning
of the history of the universe and,

293
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
but it's not forever.

294
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,730
It doesn't last an
infinite amount of time.

295
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,500
So the universe is a femoral.

296
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,930
We human beings and living creatures
are temporary structures within it.

297
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,020
And the idea that it's all
for some big cosmic purpose,

298
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,490
it seems to hold very little water.

299
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,610
Do you ever contemplate what,

300
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,120
what function human beings have in the,

301
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,080
in the university,

302
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:43,360
the way we interface with reality,

303
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,860
the way we interface with our,

304
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,200
the nature around us?

305
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,741
Yeah.

306
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:48,461
I think that a,

307
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,241
we don't have the function.

308
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,730
I don't think that's the right way
to think about what human beings are.

309
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,900
We should be glad to be alive,

310
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,190
enjoy it while we're here,

311
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,080
uh,

312
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,890
nice to each other and try to
learn more about the universe.

313
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:01,170
But it's not if we choose not to do that,

314
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,770
that's not going against any
preordained function that we have.

315
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,191
Your,

316
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,980
your own remarkably calm when
you discuss these things.

317
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,160
Like,

318
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,341
do you,

319
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,260
do you have any existential angst?

320
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:10,861
Do you have any,

321
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:11,580
like,

322
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,930
I think it's the other way around,

323
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:13,441
and honestly,

324
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:13,981
this is very,

325
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,360
very small amounts of data.

326
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,223
But,

327
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,063
uh,

328
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,310
from what I can tell when personal
tragedies strike people who were atheistic

329
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,660
cosmologists and scientists deal with
it way better than people who think that

330
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,840
we're embedded in a matrix with a
bigger purpose or a spiritual reality.

331
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,703
Really.

332
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,581
Yeah.

333
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,600
Cause you get that this is,

334
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,890
this happened and you to
have an infinite perspective.

335
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,580
Good.

336
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,341
Like when someone dies,

337
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:38,941
it's sad.

338
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,020
You can be sad,

339
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,030
but you see,

340
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,940
you can't say,

341
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:42,420
well,

342
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,260
it shouldn't have happened.

343
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:43,821
Right,

344
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:44,460
right.

345
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,791
This is,

346
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,050
these are the kinds of things that happen.

347
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:56,240
Okay.
