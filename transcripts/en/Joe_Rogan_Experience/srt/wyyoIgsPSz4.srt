00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,290
When people heard about this like and
you see the headlines and this is another

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,150
problem with clickbait journalism.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,340
The headlines look like I
was fucking accused of rape.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,550
There was one article that used
the word sexual harassment.

6
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,630
Sexual misconduct was
in all the headlines,

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,510
is that I have no thoughts and ideas.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,550
I've seen that one about people connected
to Harvey Weinstein about Ben Affleck,

9
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,990
they called it sexual misconduct.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,300
What does that mean?

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,920
Like something that you
don't think they should do.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,910
What's really crazy?

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,610
Eagle and I almost lost a job.

14
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:37,470
I did just lose a gig because when you
google it's like sexual misconduct stuff

15
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,200
and like that's really scary and again,

16
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,190
I don't want to be like,

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,110
you know who the real victim
of Harvey Weinstein is?

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,130
Jamie Kilstein.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,950
But like let me just stop you right here.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,090
If you say like one more time,

21
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,200
I fucking head's going to explode.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:49,710
Dude.

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,580
I get comments like that.

24
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,450
It's brutal.

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,961
It's a brutal.

26
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,860
Isn't as bad as.

27
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,191
All right.

28
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,290
I just want you to slow it down.

30
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,970
I'm going to use it every now and then.

31
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,640
Flip this coffee over here,

32
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,870
breaking like the light meter.

33
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,460
I'm going to do it to men.

34
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,323
A lot of people do it.

35
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,150
It's an easy one to do
it switched to water.

36
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:07,980
But that word is a,

37
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,903
it's an,

38
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,020
it's a.

39
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,220
people use it as um,

40
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,970
I know,

41
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,420
I know.

42
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,930
It's okay.

43
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,763
I do it too.

44
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,461
We all do it,

45
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,294
but it just,

46
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,290
it's nice to know.

47
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,610
Yeah,

48
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:16,930
no,

49
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,130
I,

50
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,020
it's also a very progressive thing.

51
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,210
Like there's a way that people talk,

52
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,360
like when they're really progressive
that like you don't hear like left wing

53
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,050
people talk.

54
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,750
I keep getting fucked
over by the progressive's.

55
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,750
It's a way of appearing.

56
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,613
Um,

57
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,060
what's the word?

58
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,710
Submissive or

59
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,650
passive?

60
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,160
Yeah.

61
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,731
It's not a,

62
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,740
it's not an aggressive
way of communicating.

63
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,100
All right.

64
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,911
What if I said like,

65
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,590
but like I kept like punching the table,

66
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,960
like as I did it on a fucking like,

67
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,491
you know,

68
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:52,140
like go to like step to me
just smash up perhaps a can.

69
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,910
So,

70
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
so you got a bunch of people that were
upset at you because you had embodied the

71
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,220
quintessential allies.

72
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,330
So it was,

73
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,620
there was nobody had a reason to like
me or to defend me on one half of the

74
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:14,151
twittersphere you had progressives
who thought I was a sexual creep.

75
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,800
And then on the other half you
have comedy fans who were like,

76
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,210
fuck this dude.

77
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,130
He's the one who called everyone a sexist.

78
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,440
You don't need to read the
article if you see a headline.

79
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:25,621
I mean,

80
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:25,921
God,

81
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,410
I attacked so many people without
fucking reading the articles.

82
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,860
Of course there are people to this day
that will come up on citizen radio that I

83
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,240
don't know why I was mad at.

84
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,030
I would just figure out the story
as we were covering it and be like,

85
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:36,480
yeah,

86
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,261
fuck that guy.

87
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:38,430
I guess of course.

88
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,860
And so nobody.

89
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,880
There was no reason to root for me.

90
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,620
There wasn't a strong enough fan base.

91
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,450
It wasn't like if you know,

92
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,730
a,

93
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,640
a bigger comic gets accused of something.

94
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:52,641
Well he has thousands or millions of
fans and then this small community who

95
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,900
accused me of something
I had sort of nobody.

96
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,380
And when I burned all the bridges
and in comedy and you know,

97
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,880
I never just showed up at clubs
to do sets and stuff like that.

98
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,750
I just had this audience and sort
of thought I could never get fired,

99
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,650
you know?

100
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,483
Um,

101
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,160
like when w,

102
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,580
when Allie and I sort of became more
platonic before the open relationship.

103
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:12,881
I mean,

104
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,640
there were days it was,

105
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,040
it was.

106
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,341
So,

107
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:15,550
uh,

108
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:15,911
you know,

109
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:17,440
I mean I would sleep on the couch,

110
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,470
but there were days I would go on the
road and I would not cheat and I'll go

111
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,940
back to the hotel and jerk off and like,

112
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,290
my orgasm was better because I'm like,

113
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,520
I saved citizen radio.

114
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,760
Like I was trying so hard not to,

115
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,800
not to do anything like that.

116
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,480
And so anyway,

117
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,440
I lost.

118
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:32,981
Yeah,

119
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:33,970
there was no one to root for me.

120
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,420
I just had this small audience,

121
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:38,680
this small audience be thinks I'm a
Predator or they're too nervous to say

122
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,131
anything.

123
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,670
Well,

124
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,680
you fit the quintessential [inaudible].

125
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,710
There's a classic view of what a male
feminist is in that class in view is a

126
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:53,200
sneaky guy that is getting in tight with
women and saying all the things they

127
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,820
really want to hear and the classic
story is that those women are never

128
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,200
attracted to that guy anyway.

129
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
And went up and go and fuck some jocks.

130
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,053
I'm Alpha Guy.

131
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
I didn't mean that's
literally what happened.

132
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:03,971
I was like,

133
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:04,121
yeah,

134
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,931
you don't say like,

135
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:09,070
do you the royalty of is
this enormous movie empire.

136
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,150
Right.

137
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,550
And we find that particularly offensive.

138
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,291
This not just,

139
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,330
he's not just a creep trying to get laid.

140
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,720
He's a guy that was trying to hold that
power over people and use it against

141
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:22,481
them.

142
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,640
And then on top of that he
was like physically forceful.

143
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,810
So you've got like your worst case
scenarios and then you have guys that are

144
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,340
just trying to get laid and you're like,

145
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,174
okay,

146
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,540
how do you w w,

147
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,790
w we,

148
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,690
we demonizing aggressive heterosexuality.

149
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,980
Like where does this go?

150
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
Where does this go into sexual assault?

151
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,920
Like rubbing up against someone physically
touching them when they don't want

152
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:45,161
you to.

153
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:45,341
Well,

154
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,240
that's sexual assault,

155
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,710
but hitting on someone,

156
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,593
but

157
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,490
that doesn't seem like
sexual assault or anything.

158
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,050
It seems like someone
just trying to get laid,

159
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:53,830
like where does it?

160
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,060
But then when someone's,

161
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,080
the boss he go,

162
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:56,740
okay,

163
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,750
but then you're not supposed
to do that when you're a boss.

164
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,360
Right.

165
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,650
I,

166
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,210
I was,

167
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,320
I was very interested in the,

168
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:01,710
in the,

169
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,660
in the dynamic between what specifically
with Harvey Weinstein and his people

170
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:08,630
under him for many decades about it.

171
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,440
I was trying to put myself
in this position of like,

172
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,870
how does this stay quiet for so long?

173
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:13,980
Even though there's a little rumblings,

174
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:18,200
like they talk about Seth Mcfarlane's
joke at some award show Kevin Spacey to

175
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,370
break a little kid was
running away from silos.

176
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:23,920
We're locked in Kevin Spacey's basement.

177
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,520
It's,

178
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,980
it's amazing that this stuff is kind of
like an open secret but still doesn't

179
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,000
seep out or really.

180
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,870
And um,

181
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,020
it makes you think about the pie,

182
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,160
the power dynamics and how fearful people
are in these positions because it's

183
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:35,850
easy.

184
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,960
My initial instinct was like,

185
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,720
why didn't anyone say anything that
was similar to the bill cosby thing?

186
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:39,871
I'm like,

187
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,010
why didn't anyone say anything?

188
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,660
But then you realized
people were saying things.

189
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:42,930
They were,

190
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,280
they were being given hush money.

191
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:45,660
They were being shut up.

192
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:46,380
But these are really,

193
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,131
really bad people.

194
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:48,720
But I agree with you that it,

195
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,351
you know,

196
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,600
I've never been a um,

197
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,070
an aggressive flirt flirter as it were.

198
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,430
I've always been very passive with
women because I never really believed in

199
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:57,110
myself that much.

200
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,920
All that.

201
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,070
But

202
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,290
I've known people that have
been very flirtatious and,

203
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,153
and you know,

204
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,420
and all of that.

205
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,631
I'm like,

206
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,130
I wonder what is the line there now and,

207
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,210
and is it okay to,

208
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,520
to be flirtatious,

209
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:11,330
to call a woman beautiful at a bar or
to do something like that as opposed to,

210
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:11,690
you know,

211
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,970
kind of if a girl likes you,

212
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,290
that's the thing.

213
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,890
Like if you meet a girl at
a bar and the girl's like,

214
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,500
Colin is a really cool guy,

215
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,760
God,

216
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,010
I'm so into him and cons,

217
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,844
like,

218
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,870
you're really beautiful.

219
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,291
And she's like,

220
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:24,441
oh,

221
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,270
I gotta thank you.

222
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,180
And then next thing you know,

223
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,750
you guys are hanging out or
you meet a girl at a bar,

224
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,130
she has nothing.

225
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,510
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with you.

226
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,320
She's sober,

227
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,950
you're drinking your breath,

228
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,803
smells,

229
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,040
know,

230
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,920
like you're really beautiful.

231
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,280
And you're like,

232
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,450
oh gross,

233
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:39,620
get the fuck away from me.

234
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,160
You know,

235
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,770
it can be exactly the same attempt,

236
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,420
but the person is just not into you.

237
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,473
You become a creep.

238
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,801
Right?

239
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,251
Exactly.

240
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:46,491
So,

241
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:46,760
uh,

242
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,240
I'm uh,

243
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,341
I don't,

244
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,100
uh,

245
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,200
I don't look at the
situation now in 2017 with,

246
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,710
you know,

247
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,550
on college campuses and
all these things as,

248
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:57,740
as desirable for anyone because who
knows who the hell knows the rules of the

249
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:58,300
landscape,

250
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,510
you know,

251
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,280
now I think a lot of it just comes
down to mutual respect and all of that.

252
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,440
Unless you look at merit and character,

253
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,274
you're fucked.

254
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,301
Like if you're like,

255
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,580
I'm rather or not,

256
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,550
you think white people are special and
then you should keep them down or boost

257
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:11,030
them up.

258
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,290
It's both toxic.

259
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,470
I think like when it comes
to Rachel Dolezal like her,

260
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,460
her problem is not that she
wants to be black and she's not.

261
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,120
Her problem is that people give
a fuck about what she wants.

262
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,440
She just didn't have that language.

263
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,460
Just didn't like.

264
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Imagine her whole world
could be exactly the same.

265
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,500
The way she behaves could
be exactly the same.

266
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,910
The way she dresses,

267
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,661
her actions,

268
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:36,230
everything.

269
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,610
If she didn't utter a few words that
like I'm actually black and people are

270
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:40,731
like,

271
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:41,564
wait what?

272
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:41,931
Like,

273
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,310
and then they go into her history.

274
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,403
No,

275
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,600
you want it to be black
but you weren't black.

276
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
You look

277
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
and that just quick,

278
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,121
quick,

279
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:53,361
quick.

280
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,110
It's just eyeballs.

281
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,711
Shaun king,

282
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,880
I mean he was a part of
black lives matter obviously.

283
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:57,830
He wanted to do good.

284
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:01,820
Obviously he wanted to spread
good ideas and help people.

285
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,620
The people that he really identified with,

286
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,640
if those tweets are real and I don't
know if they are Hashtag wrong skin and

287
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,440
Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff,

288
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,030
then that's literally how he felt.

289
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,130
He didn't feel it because
he hated those people.

290
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,080
He felt because he identified with them
and they're more attractive to him than

291
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,570
the than what he actually was.

292
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,900
So if he just Paul Walden and
never said to me Paul Wall,

293
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:23,370
right?

294
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,530
The wrapper with the grill.

295
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:24,951
I mean,

296
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,510
isn't that essentially
I have a deep love of,

297
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,930
of black American culture.

298
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,610
I mean there's a lot of people that
just will just be themselves and go in.

299
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,440
Just go in is what I appreciate more.

300
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:40,220
There's a lot of black people at golf
clubs with fucking Polo shirts on.

301
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,073
Right?

302
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,451
Why?

303
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,130
Because they identify with that culture.

304
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,964
It's appealing to them.

305
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,380
We'll just let people,

306
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,580
fucking cultures,

307
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,241
everything man.

308
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,074
That people.

309
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,620
And the irony is is like Joey Diaz,

310
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,620
he's going to get us grills.

311
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,843
You heard about that.

312
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,770
And the irony is is like
inner city black culture,

313
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:55,980
like

314
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,270
things like comes to my shows and thinks
I'm funny because they liked that crazy

315
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,104
shit.

316
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,630
Like man you fucking funny
tell to talk about things.

317
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,220
They just think it's funny.

318
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,560
I think when I say they,

319
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:08,670
it's annoying because it's like,

320
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,920
of course not all black
people finding funny,

321
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,300
but like that culture,

322
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,081
that black redneck,

323
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:13,860
white liberal culture,

324
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,840
it's like I'm from a culture that's more
similar to American southern or urban

325
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:22,650
black culture than a lot of the liberals
calling me names and it's just this

326
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,090
type of culture that bonds
through shit talking,

327
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:25,390
you know,

328
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,071
like Boston,

329
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,860
where it's like if you talk shifts,

330
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,261
someone's like,

331
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:28,441
oh,

332
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,274
you're dead,

333
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,821
