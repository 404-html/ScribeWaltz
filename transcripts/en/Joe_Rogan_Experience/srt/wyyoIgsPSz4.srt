1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,250
Her low freak bitches when
people heard about this like,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,580
and you see the headlines and this is
another like problem with like click bait

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,270
journalism.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,370
The headlines look like I
was fucking accused of rape.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,520
There was a one article that
used the word sexual harassment.

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:19,521
Sexual misconduct was in all the headlines
that I have no fucking idea about.

7
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,540
People connected to Harvey Weinstein,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,550
like about Ben Affleck,

9
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,960
they call it sexual misconduct.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,281
What does that mean?

11
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:26,430
Like,

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,920
but in something that you
don't think they should do.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,690
What's really crazy legal and,

14
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,580
and I almost lost a job.

15
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,930
I did just lose a Gig.

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,440
Um,

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,940
because when you Google and B,

18
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,750
it's like sexual misconduct stuff
and like that's really scary.

19
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,201
And again,

20
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,190
I don't want to be like,

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,110
you know who the real victim
of Harvey Weinstein is?

22
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,130
Jamie Kilstein.

23
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,400
Right.

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,233
But like,

25
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,930
uh,

26
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,950
let me just stop you right here.

27
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,090
If you say like one more time,

28
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,560
I fucking head's going to explode too.

29
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,610
And I get comments like that.

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,473
It's brutal.

31
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,961
It's a brutal,

32
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,190
is it as bad as all right.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,290
I just want you to slow it down.

34
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,930
I'm going to use it every now and then.

35
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,320
This coffee break,

36
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,700
you're breaking the light.

37
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,870
The light meter.

38
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,451
I'm going to,

39
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,131
I do it too,

40
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:02,490
man.

41
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,330
A lot of people do it.

42
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,350
It's an easy one to do.

43
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,150
I'm going to hit the switch to water,

44
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,010
but that word is a,

45
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,550
it's an,

46
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,180
um,

47
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,451
it's,

48
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:10,050
uh,

49
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,883
people use it as,

50
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,340
um,

51
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,970
I know,

52
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,420
I know.

53
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,930
It's okay.

54
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,763
I do it too.

55
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,461
We all do it,

56
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,294
but it's just,

57
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,290
it's nice to know.

58
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,620
Yeah,

59
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:16,980
no,

60
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,250
I,

61
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,020
it's also a very progressive thing.

62
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,240
Like there's a way like that people talk,

63
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,980
like when they're really
progressive that like,

64
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,020
you don't hear like leftwing people talk.

65
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,690
I keep getting fucked
over by the progressive's.

66
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,750
It's a way of appearing.

67
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,643
Um,

68
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,061
what's the word?

69
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:34,740
Submissive or

70
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,643
passive.

71
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,160
Yeah.

72
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,731
It's not a,

73
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,740
it's not an aggressive
way of communicating.

74
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,101
All right.

75
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,911
What if I said like,

76
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,560
but like I kept like punching the table,

77
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,570
like as I did it on a fucking,

78
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,870
like how much,

79
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,491
you know,

80
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,370
like go to like step to me,

81
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,480
just smash a paps.

82
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,810
Uh,

83
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,180
can,

84
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,013
um,

85
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,940
so,

86
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
so you got a bunch of people that were
upset at you because you had embodied the

87
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,220
quintessential allies.

88
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,360
So it was,

89
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,610
there were nobody had a reason to like
me or to defend me on one half of the

90
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,260
twittersphere you had progressive's
who thought I was a sexual creep.

91
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,800
And then on the other half you
have comedy fans who are like,

92
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,210
fuck this dude.

93
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,130
He's the one who called
everyone in a sexist.

94
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,440
You don't need to read the
article if you see a headline,

95
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:25,921
I mean God,

96
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:28,410
I attacked so many people without
fucking reading the articles.

97
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,860
Of course there are people to this day
that will come up on citizen radio that I

98
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,240
don't know why I was mad at,

99
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,030
I would just figure out the story
as we were covering it and be like,

100
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:36,480
yeah,

101
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,261
fuck that guy.

102
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:38,460
I guess of course.

103
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,830
And so nobody,

104
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,880
there was no reason to root for me.

105
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,590
There wasn't a strong enough fan base.

106
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:44,850
It wasn't like if,

107
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,510
you know,

108
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:45,670
a,

109
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,640
a bigger comic gets accused of something,

110
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:52,641
well he has thousands or millions of fans
and then this small community who are

111
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:56,810
accused of something I had sort of nobody
and when I burnt all the bridges and

112
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,410
in comedy and you know,

113
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,850
I never just showed up at clubs
to do sets and stuff like that.

114
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,750
I just had this audience and sort
of thought I could never get fired,

115
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,650
you know?

116
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,483
Um,

117
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,983
like when,

118
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,610
when Allie and I sort of became more
platonic before the open relationship.

119
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,650
I mean there were days it was,

120
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,513
it was so,

121
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:15,911
you know,

122
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:17,440
I mean I would sleep on the couch,

123
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,470
but there were days I would go on the
road and I would not cheat and I would go

124
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,790
back to the hotel and sure coffin,

125
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,930
like my orgasm was better.

126
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,291
Cause I'm like,

127
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,520
I saved citizen radio.

128
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,760
Like I was trying so hard not to,

129
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,800
not to do anything like that.

130
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,480
And so anyway,

131
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,470
I lost.

132
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,981
Yeah,

133
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:33,970
there was no one to root for me.

134
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,380
I just had this small audience.

135
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,680
This small audience either thinks I'm a
Predator or they're too nervous to say

136
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,161
anything.

137
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:42,520
Well you fit the Quintess you,

138
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:42,730
you,

139
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
there's a classic view of what a male
feminist is and that classic view is a

140
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:53,080
sneaky guy that is like getting in tight
with women and saying all the things

141
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,220
they really want to hear.

142
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,200
And the classic story is that those women
are never attracted to that guy anyway

143
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,250
and one up and go and fuck some jocks.

144
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:02,084
I'm alpha.

145
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,120
I mean that's literally
what happened is like yeah,

146
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:09,070
you don't say like do you the royalty
of is this enormous movie empire,

147
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,120
right.

148
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,290
And we find that particularly
offensive that it's not just,

149
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,330
he's not just a creep trying to get laid.

150
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,720
He's a guy that was trying to hold that
power over people and use it against

151
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:22,451
them.

152
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,640
And then on top of it he was
like physically forceful.

153
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,660
So you've got like your worst case
scenarios and then you have like guys that

154
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,060
are just trying to get laid.

155
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,341
You're like,

156
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:31,174
okay,

157
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,050
how do you,

158
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,411
what,

159
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:32,571
what,

160
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:37,571
what we we demonizing
aggressive heterosexuality.

161
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,950
Like where does this go?

162
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,530
Where does this go into sexual assault?

163
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,890
Like rubbing up against someone physically
touching them when they don't want

164
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,161
you to?

165
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,240
Well that's sexual assault.

166
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:46,600
Sure.

167
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,710
But hitting on someone,

168
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,540
right.

169
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,373
Hmm.

170
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,490
That doesn't seem like
sexual assault or anything.

171
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,050
It seems like someone
just trying to get laid,

172
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:53,800
like where does it,

173
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,080
but then when someone's the boss he go,

174
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:56,710
okay,

175
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,750
but then you're not supposed
to do that when you're a boss.

176
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,400
Right.

177
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,660
I,

178
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,210
I was,

179
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,320
I was very interested in the,

180
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:06,060
in the d and the dynamic between what
specifically with the Harvey Weinstein and

181
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:08,440
his people under him
for many decades about,

182
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,740
I,

183
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,410
I was trying to put myself
in this position of like,

184
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,900
how does this stay quiet for so long?

185
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:13,980
Even though there's a little rumblings,

186
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:18,280
like they talk about Seth Mcfarlane's
joke at some award show Kevin Spacey to

187
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,490
a little kid was running away from
silos with Lockton Kevin Spacey.

188
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,540
Spacement it's,

189
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,200
it's amazing that like this stuff is
kind of like an open secret and so,

190
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,030
but still doesn't seep out or really,

191
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,840
um,

192
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,970
it makes you think about the,

193
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,160
the power dynamics and how fearful people
are in these positions because it's

194
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:35,850
easy.

195
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,960
My initial instinct was like,

196
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,040
why didn't anyone say anything?

197
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:38,591
It was similar to that,

198
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,690
like the bill Cosby thing.

199
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:39,871
I'm like,

200
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,010
why didn't anyone say anything?

201
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,900
But then you realize people
were saying things they were,

202
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,250
they were being given hush money,

203
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:45,660
they were being shut up.

204
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:46,380
But these are really,

205
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,131
really bad people.

206
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:48,750
But I agree with you that it,

207
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,351
you know,

208
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,220
I've never been a,

209
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:50,820
um,

210
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,070
an aggressive flirt flirter as it were.

211
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,730
I've always been very passive with women
cause I never really believed in myself

212
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,130
that much,

213
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,920
all of that.

214
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,130
But

215
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,310
I've,

216
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,290
I've known people that have
been very flirtatious and,

217
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,190
and you know,

218
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,361
and all of that.

219
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:02,631
And I'm like,

220
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:06,230
I wonder what is the line
there now and is it okay to,

221
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,580
to,

222
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,490
to be flirtatious,

223
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,360
to call a woman beautiful at a bar or
to do something like that as opposed to,

224
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:11,720
you know,

225
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,970
kind of if a girl likes you.

226
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,290
That's the thing.

227
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,570
Like,

228
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,920
if you meet a girl at a
bar and the girl's like,

229
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,500
Collin is a really cool guy,

230
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,781
God,

231
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,010
I'm so into them and cons,

232
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,844
like,

233
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,870
you're really beautiful.

234
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,320
And she's like,

235
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,431
Oh,

236
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:24,710
I god,

237
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,280
thank you.

238
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,180
And then next thing you know,

239
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,720
you guys are hanging out or
you meet a girl at a bar,

240
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,130
she has nothing.

241
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,510
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with you.

242
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,320
She's sober,

243
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,280
you're drinking,

244
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,480
your breath smells,

245
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,201
and you're like,

246
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,220
you're really beautiful and you're like,

247
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,820
oh,

248
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,451
gross,

249
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:39,620
get the fuck away from me.

250
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,161
You know,

251
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,800
it could be exactly the same attempt,

252
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,450
but the person is just not into you.

253
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:44,640
Right.

254
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,473
You become a creep.

255
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,801
Right.

256
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,221
Exactly.

257
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:46,520
So,

258
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,890
uh,

259
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,723
I'm,

260
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,673
uh,

261
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,341
I don't,

262
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,174
uh,

263
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,240
I don't look at the
situation now in 2017 with,

264
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:52,690
you know,

265
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,600
on college campuses and
all of these things as,

266
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:56,570
as desirable for anyone
because of who the,

267
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,290
who the hell knows the
rules of the landscape,

268
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,521
you know,

269
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,280
now I think a lot of it just comes
down to mutual respect and all of that.

270
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
Unless you look at merit and character,

271
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,274
you're fucked.

272
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,630
Like if you're like a,

273
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,560
whether or not you think white people
are special and then you should keep them

274
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,000
down or boost them up,

275
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,290
it's both toxic.

276
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,270
I think like when it comes
to Rachel Dolezal like,

277
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,490
or her problem is not that she
wants to be black and she's not,

278
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,120
her problem is that people give
a fuck about what she wants.

279
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,770
Right.

280
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,400
She just didn't have that Lang.

281
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
It just didn't like,

282
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,080
imagine her whole world
could be exactly the same.

283
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,530
The way she behaves could
be exactly the same.

284
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,910
The way she dresses,

285
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,661
her actions,

286
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:36,230
everything.

287
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,930
If she didn't utter a few words that like,

288
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,730
I'm actually black and people were like,

289
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:40,941
wait,

290
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:41,774
what?

291
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,310
And then they go into her history.

292
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,471
No,

293
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:43,541
no,

294
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:43,620
no,

295
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,453
no.

296
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,490
You want it to be black,

297
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,600
but you weren't black.

298
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,120
You look right.

299
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,940
We added in pasta and that just quick,

300
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,151
quick,

301
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,361
quick.

302
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,110
It's just eyeballs.

303
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,711
Shaun king,

304
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:54,891
I mean,

305
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,330
he was a part of black lives matter,

306
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,901
obviously.

307
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:57,830
He wanted to do good,

308
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:01,820
obviously he wanted to spread
good ideas and help people.

309
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,650
The people that he really identified with,

310
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,640
if those tweets are real and I don't
know if they are Hashtag wrong skin and

311
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,420
Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff.

312
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,030
And then that's literally how he felt.

313
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,100
He didn't feel it because
he hated those people.

314
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,920
He felt it because he identified with
them and they're more attractive to him

315
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,570
then the than what he actually was.

316
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,220
So if he just Paul Walden and never said,

317
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,031
I mean Paul Wall,

318
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:23,331
right?

319
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:23,451
The,

320
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,530
the wrapper with the grill.

321
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:24,951
I mean,

322
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,370
isn't that essentially
he's lived a deep love of,

323
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,930
of black American culture.

324
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,441
Right.

325
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,150
And there's a lot of people that just,

326
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,610
just be themselves and go in,

327
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,440
go in is what I appreciate more.

328
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,220
There's a lot of black people at golf
clubs with fucking Polo shirts on,

329
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:40,590
right?

330
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,240
Yeah.

331
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,451
Why?

332
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,130
Because they identify with that culture.

333
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,964
It's appealing to them.

334
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:44,451
What?

335
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,410
Just let people,

336
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
fucking cultures everything man.

337
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:47,870
That people,

338
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,160
Neil.

339
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,680
Whoa.

340
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,620
And the irony is is like Joey Diaz,

341
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,620
he's going to get us grills.

342
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,843
You heard about that.

343
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,231
And the irony is,

344
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,770
is like inner city black culture,

345
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,010
like

346
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,530
things like comes to my
shows and thinks I'm funny.

347
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:58,950
Yeah.

348
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,600
Because they liked that crazy shit.

349
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:01,501
Like,

350
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:01,711
man,

351
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:02,520
you're fucking funny.

352
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,660
You free to talk about things,

353
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:04,051
right.

354
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:05,220
They just think it's funny.

355
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:05,431
I,

356
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:05,821
I think,

357
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,550
uh,

358
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,560
when I say they,

359
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:08,670
it's annoying because it's like,

360
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,920
of course not all black
people find me funny.

361
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,300
But like that culture,

362
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,051
that black redneck,

363
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,860
white liberal culture,

364
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,490
it's like I'm from a culture that's
more similar to American southerner,

365
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,600
urban black culture than a lot
of the liberals calling me names.

366
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,200
And it's just this type of culture
that that bonds through shit talking,

367
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:25,411
you know,

368
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,610
like Boston where it's like,

369
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,830
if you talk shit,

370
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:28,290
if someone's like,

371
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:28,441
oh,

372
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,274
you're dead,

373
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,641
you're dead.

374
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,890
Acts like a home on I grease.

375
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,280
My Dad's didn't kill himself.

376
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:32,431
You know,

377
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,231
and then your friends,

378
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:33,960
Huh?

379
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
Cause it's like you've
hit the darkest shit,

380
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:35,821
right.

381
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,540
And then you're like,

382
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:36,691
oh,

383
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:37,550
we'll make it through a winter.

384
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,393
Yeah.

385
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:47,630
Okay.
