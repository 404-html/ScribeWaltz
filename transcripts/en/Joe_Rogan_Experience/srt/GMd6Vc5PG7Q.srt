1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,410
We're here in the podcast on day one of 
the robots attacking the people.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,550
It started in Tempe,
Arizona.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,200
Someone's killed by a self driving uber.
I'm not buying those things.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,990
Put the self driving ubers.
I'm not ready for this yet.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,720
No chance.
It's not ready to die.

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:25,721
I'm not ready for planes.
They should have those things on a 

7
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:25,721
closed course over a long period of 
time,

8
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:28,320
you know,
and then let them drive around cities.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,700
Yeah,
we got to build some trust.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
Yeah,
I'm not,

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,180
I'm not trusting.
We got to have some obstacle courses.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,210
Self-Driving.
Uber Kills Arizona pedestrian as all as 

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,940
cops.
This is hilarious.

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,740
Is that an uber car?
A cop car?

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,810
Uber's.
They look like cop cars.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,700
What's the thing on the roof?
Uh,

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,440
the camera.
It lets it drive fencers,

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,810
dude.
Fuck all that.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,810
Not to say that a guy couldn't have done
that.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,450
And not to say that this person,
whoever it was,

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,920
who knows what the circumstances were.
Sometimes accidents are unavoidable,

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,950
right?
I mean there are certain times where 

23
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:03,950
someone makes an error.

24
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,100
We don't know,
but I just feel better if it's a person 

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,890
making an error for some strange reason 
came here.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,500
I think uber and lyft would have like a 
gang war.

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,150
They probably would.
Yeah.

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,070
If you let the algorithms take over,
it's over.

29
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,850
They probably fuck with each other.
Don't they like the Uber Guys?

30
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,630
Super aggressive as they get.
Didn't get in trouble for doing the uh,

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,090
like fake.
Oh,

32
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:25,150
that's causing problems.
Finding a real.

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,040
Is that real?
Is that a real story?

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Networks.
But it was like allegations I think 

35
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,260
because they were private getting sued,
sued each other,

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,540
whatever.
So I don't know if it ever came out and 

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:36,540
[inaudible] yeah,
no,

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:36,760
there was allegations that they were 
like making fake calls.

39
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:37,690
Right?
Is that what it was?

40
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,670
Fake requests just bailing last minute 
to do you got the right idea.

41
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,280
Living up in the middle of the nowhere.
You got the right idea with that.

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,490
We uh,
we just got to uber but it's only two 

43
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:50,970
dudes and I have both their numbers.
Say just call me.

44
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,330
I can just cry.
Yeah,

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,510
that's actually cool.
People are in your town a little like 

46
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,220
2,400
slugs,

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,310
you know how to drink.
That's a fucking good place to live.

48
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,120
The currencies beer,
but that's the thing that was.

49
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,410
Everyone can do everything but no one 
wants to work.

50
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,670
It's pretty hilarious.
Look at this.

51
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,760
Uber's dirty tricks.
Quantified rival counts.

52
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:14,080
Five thousand 560 canceled rides.
That's in 2014.

53
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,240
Is that real?
And that's right when it started.

54
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,510
Is that definitely.
It's on CNN so it can't be fake news.

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,360
I've never canceled an uber.
I feel really bad about it.

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
About never canceling.
Well No.

57
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,770
I mean if I canceled I'd be like,
I'd want to like tell the guy.

58
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,850
Yeah,
I'd be like,

59
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,080
hey man,
just should be a way.

60
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,850
If you have to cancel it to give the guy
a tip,

61
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,650
that's a good move.
You know,

62
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:38,320
like say I have like super last minute 
cancel.

63
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:39,670
This guy's already wanted us way over 
here.

64
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,820
Let me throw them 30 bucks.
Or are we used to five star at least 

65
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,040
something.
Something given some money.

66
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,280
Give him five bucks,
five bucks per canceled ride.

67
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,990
That's not bad.
Right?

68
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,140
That's more than fair.
You're setting them back a few minutes.

69
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,360
You don't get anything back when they 
fuck with you though.

70
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,040
So know you son of a bitch,
but who are people that are fucking with

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,960
you?
Is it the rare uber driver?

72
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,030
Every Uber I've ever been to was a 
dream.

73
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,540
I've never had a single problem.
Have you had uber x ever though?

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
That's the truck.
Well,

75
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,560
that's just like random people with 
cars.

76
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:11,950
Oh,
right,

77
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,280
right,
right.

78
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,670
No,
I always do the one with like.

79
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,060
It's basically limo drivers that are 
like off duty.

80
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,020
Yeah,
those are awesome.

81
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,150
If you ever uber acts,
it can get a little dicey.

82
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,390
Oh,
you're just with a random chick that's 

83
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,390
having a meltdown.
Oh yeah.

84
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah.
I can imagine.

85
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,420
I mean,
she's cool.

86
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,460
It's not like it's a big thing,
but it's just like,

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you know,
I can't pay my dsl bill this month and 

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you're like,
lady,

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,100
I'm right here.
It's a very small car.

90
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,110
This people that just.
They're working their life out,

91
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,770
but let's say if they're unlike a 
hundred level game,

92
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,310
they're on level one and they're 
bouncing into the walls over and over 

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,590
again and they just don't seem like in 
order for you to give them real advice,

94
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,270
you'd have to basically move into their 
house.

95
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,050
You'd have to like give a full revamp of
the way they look at things.

96
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:56,800
You'd have to go.
Okay,

97
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,510
stop.
Okay.

98
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,560
First of all,
what are all these pills?

99
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,620
Second of all,
what are you eating third of all?

100
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,180
Like why are you talking to people like 
that?

101
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,520
Like if you talk to people like that,
they're not gonna want to talk to you,

102
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,200
like you're upset that they don't like 
you,

103
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,600
but then you act in a way that's very 
unpleasant to be around.

104
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,660
Right.
And then you'd have to go through every 

105
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:15,970
mistake this person's been.
Then you'd have to find out.

106
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,160
It's almost all shitty parenting.
It's like plumbing.

107
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,310
Yeah.
Back Down to the root system.

108
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,980
The roots got into the pipes or you 
know,

109
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,100
I'll look at crack because of the earth 
shifted and you're losing all this water

110
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,090
down here.
Yeah.

111
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,940
You just start screaming when you feel 
threatened at all.

112
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,650
Like that may be a thing from your 
childhood.

113
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,420
Yeah,
there's a lot of that out there.

114
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,530
There is.
Um,

115
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,210
I wanted to talk to you about social 
media.

116
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,120
Okay.
Because I,

117
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,600
I love you too.
I think you're very good guy.

118
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,630
I really do.
But you are the worst representative of 

119
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,840
yourself on social media.
I'm a lawyer myself.

120
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,580
It's a bad form of getting out tricky 
ideas.

121
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,070
It's a bad form.
It's just not good.

122
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,750
I mean now it's,
what is it to 80 now?

123
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:58,680
Two hundred 80 characters is better than
it was 1:40

124
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,820
was very rough,
like 1:40.

125
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,450
You'd have to,
you know,

126
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,880
you have to really think about what 
you're saying.

127
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,930
So you're yelling like as you're falling
into a well you have like one sentence 

128
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,200
but you,
you are without a doubt addicted.

129
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,000
And I know you bailed on your phone for 
awhile and you went to a flip flip on.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.
But I see these manic tweets from you 

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,210
and I,
I just want to go hang out with you and 

132
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,210
go,
dude,

133
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,791
what are you doing?
Why are you constantly tweeting and 

134
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,750
attacking people and it's like sometimes
the chaos helps me.

135
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,190
I mean,
you're right,

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,840
right?
I'm not challenging.

137
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:36,841
That's David,
but like I see it as almost like a idea 

138
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:37,030
sonar where you're just like,
I,

139
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,500
I get that.
I get that,

140
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:42,190
but I get that because I know you did a 
really good dude and real life.

141
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:47,191
Thanks man.
So when I see this online and I see 

142
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:49,930
these blurting out post just outbreak 
posts,

143
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,250
they're just,
they're just like,

144
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,710
like you got diarrhea.
I mean just let me see if I could throw 

145
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,030
the word nigger in here for a goof.
Let me see if I can say something that's

146
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,050
going to piss people off.

147
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,050
And it's just,
there's this weird thing you're doing 

148
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,260
like this Jessalyn next thing.
Like you just decided to attack Anthony.

149
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,170
Jessalyn,
I'll tell you.

150
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,250
Did he attack?
You know what happened was someone said 

151
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,950
that a data hurt I,
he said I was outright,

152
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,980
which is like the new people can believe
that they could believe that you were 

153
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,791
outright,
but if someone tells them it's appear 

154
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,970
outrageous tweets,
there's one or two of them,

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,450
they'd go,
oh,

156
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:28,451
this guy's an outright comedian,
and then they see you with certain 

157
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,120
people that you've had podcast with and 
talk to.

158
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,340
That might also be lumped in immune 
ridiculously.

159
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,080
So like Jordan Peterson,
they lump him into.

160
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,130
No,
I gotcha.

161
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,430
It doesn't make any sense,
but they do it like I'm in luck.

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,100
I've had people on that people think are
all right.

163
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,680
I mean people.
People are fucking crazy.

164
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,430
I mean there's people out there think 
Ben Shapiro is antisemetic.

165
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,960
That's how.
That's how I know there's no,

166
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,810
there's no logic at all.
Like right now,

167
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:55,811
Martin Luther King Jr would be 
considered outright by certain crazy 

168
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:59,771
people.
He would probably have adjusted his 

169
00:06:59,771 --> 00:06:59,771
views.
Don't you think?

170
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:03,220
I mean his views,
it probably changed knowing all that we 

171
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,370
know about people today and I mean he 
would be a different person.

172
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
You've got to think that guy growing up 
in the 19 fifties and then beans into 

173
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,370
the sixties as a,
the most important civil rights activist

174
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:18,371
of all time.
He was dealing with a completely 

175
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:18,371
different world.
Man.

176
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,420
There was no social media,
there was,

177
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,270
there was not much consolidated power is
probably very difficult to get people to

178
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:26,570
March once they start sicking dogs on 
people and blowing fire hoses on them.

179
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,710
I mean,
you had to be,

180
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,030
you had less protection and he'd had to 
be more,

181
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,090
more rigid and conservative than just 
because people would have to be just 

182
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,420
very careful if that's,
you know,

183
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,070
we,
we talked about this recently,

184
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,100
I guess it was,
was it Danielle Lee Bailey we were 

185
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,140
talking about about how recently slavery
was.

186
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,420
Was it him?
Was it Danielle might.

187
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,020
Might've been either way.
Um,

188
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,140
it's,
that's a crazy small amount of time.

189
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Crazy 200 years ago and it's been 
existed for like tens of thousands of 

190
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,640
years and that there's more slavery in 
the world today because there's more 

191
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,830
people alive.
It's kind of tricky.

192
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,950
But this last percentage of people that 
are slaves,

193
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,400
so it's kind of misleading when people 
say it's more sleek slavery,

194
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,830
there's way more people.
That's a good point.

195
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,210
Yeah.
There's more everything way,

196
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:11,840
way,
way,

197
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,841
way,
way more people and there's way more 

198
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:16,841
crazy people and now they all have 
Internet access.

199
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:21,370
Yeah.
Because I was looking at this thing 

200
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,170
where they were trying to trace.
You've heard about that new species of 

201
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,550
human that they found,
I think around somewhere in the range of

202
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:28,200
a seven or eight years ago.
Dyno scions,

203
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,120
I think they call them.

204
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,660
They found them in Russia.
And what they are is,

205
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,230
um,
you know,

206
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,120
when there was neanderthal and Homo 
Sapiens,

207
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,170
there was another one and then this 
other one bread.

208
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:42,410
There's apparently they think there was 
many different kinds of humans.

209
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,400
Oh yeah,
for sure.

210
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,340
But what the faith thing.
That fucking freaked me out,

211
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:49,550
they were talking about how long ago,
this was like 70,000

212
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:53,330
plus years ago that they were,
they were talking about one era and then

213
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,070
they were talking about the amount of 
people that were alive then.

214
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,870
And they said something around the area 
of 100,000

215
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,440
humans total amount that's on the four 
or five right now.

216
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,240
Just fuck that on the four.
Oh,

217
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:07,140
five between here and West Hills.
Probably more.

218
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,170
And that's why we have such a vicious 
instinct because at that point it's 

219
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,060
just,
I think it got down to like 10,000

220
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:15,870
people at one point.

221
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,260
Yeah,
that's what I was reading the article 

222
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,260
about.
It was also talking about um,

223
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,740
in Sumatra.
And we talked about this recently.

224
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,920
There was a gigantic super volcano that 
blew up and it fucked the earth up for 

225
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,340
like a thousand years.
And we had to survive that.

226
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,370
Yeah.
And now we're trying to survive twitter 

227
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:34,370
storms and,
but we have those same instincts,

228
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,440
the same instincts that are like,
if you can't eat your dog right now,

229
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,230
you're going to die with the Jesuit 
thing.

230
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,260
So what?
So I just went on his and he had already

231
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,410
blocked me and I had never written 
anything to him.

232
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,790
So I just.
So I just posted that instead he got,

233
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,850
he has a liposuction is asked because I 
thought that was funny because I didn't 

234
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:52,850
want to go too big.
I was like,

235
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,960
well why even do that?
Like who gives a shit if he blocks you.

236
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,970
I just thought it was funny.
Right?

237
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,340
But you're attacking them publicly.
This is the thing.

238
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,220
It's like you have like how many 
thousands of twitter followers.

239
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,590
Yeah,
like 120,000.

240
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,800
That's a lot of fucking people.
So a lot.

241
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,740
But he's a strong man that have messed 
with me way too long,

242
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,320
man.
Like that's got to sting.

243
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,730
There's got to be like this disturbance 
of peace and tranquility for no reason.

244
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,800
Just because he blocked.
You give a shit if people.

245
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,220
I hope you gentlemen,
I like you.

246
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,740
Go block me buddy.
I love a good guy.

247
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,710
He's a great joke,
right?

248
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:27,810
It's a funny guy,
man.

249
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,660
This is the problem is said like I'm a 
colleague of his,

250
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:35,661
um,
at the comedy store with him all the 

251
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,161
time.
We go on back and forth next to each 

252
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:39,861
other all the time and you know,
just like you should attack someone when

253
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,410
they do something really bad,
but you know what I'm saying?

254
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,410
I do know what you're saying,
like the sheets stored until you 

255
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,410
absolutely need it.
Yeah.

256
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,610
I'm all about that and I.
I wasn't like full attack mode.

257
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,030
I was being playful.
The wars started.

258
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,050
You're talking about him getting 
liposuction and talking about him being 

259
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,940
gay and you're talking about a.
You said a bunch of different things,

260
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,060
but that's after he said in response.
He said that I'm an outright the third 

261
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,840
rate piano comic and I was like,
dude,

262
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,700
I just did a,
a liposuction joke,

263
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,260
but the thing is I'm not even mad at the
guy at all like I want.

264
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Then again,
do a terrible job of representing 

265
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,321
yourself.
That's a good point because it seems to 

266
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:21,321
me even I had a text you.
I'm like,

267
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:21,321
what are you doing?
I know.

268
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:22,560
By the way,
I just want to give you a compliment.

269
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,050
I love it.

270
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,060
You're more critical offline.
Like you're one of the few people right 

271
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,060
now in this world.
It's like,

272
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,830
oh,
what the fuck are you doing?

273
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:34,831
I love it,
but online you're chill and so many 

274
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,730
people are the opposite.
They attack on line and apologize in the

275
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:40,731
DM and you're.
I just want to say that that's good 

276
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:40,731
leadership qualities.
Oh,

277
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:41,580
well that's very nice for you,
but I'm not trying to be a leader.

278
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:46,581
I just try to be a good person.
I think if you you have an issue with 

279
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,390
someone you should do.
You should talk to them in person if you

280
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,920
can,
if not on the phone,

281
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,280
but that one on one,
like this idea that you should 

282
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,950
automatically blurt out what you think 
about someone's public mistakes to the 

283
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,120
rest of the world to state your 
position.

284
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Like there was a lot of the requests to 
state your position after Louis C K got 

285
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,360
in trouble.

286
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,020
I have no idea what actually happened.
If,

287
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,010
if the way that women are telling it is 
100 percent true than I am,

288
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,080
I think it's fucking gross and 
disgusting and I'm sad.

289
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm sad that he had that in his head 
that he wanted to do that.

290
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,370
I'm sad that the girls had to experience
it.

291
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,760
It's an uncomfortable thing,
but I don't know that and I've heard 

292
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,220
stories about people thinking it was 
funny too,

293
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,000
you know,
there's.

294
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,220
There was like this weird thing going 
on,

295
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,260
the tribal stuff where it's like,
what side,

296
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,380
what side are you on?
But people were like this,

297
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,450
the Louis C,
k instance was the first instance so 

298
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,090
that I can recall where people were 
demanding a response,

299
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,250
like a public response about something.
Well,

300
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,900
I noticed that in entertainment with 
trump,

301
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,520
it's like the lack of talking about 
trump is now seen as endorsements.

302
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,550
Like when Taylor swift just didn't get 
involved in the chaos.

303
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,550
People were calling her like,
all right man,

304
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:55,210
it's,
it's,

305
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,300
there's so many people just waiting,
waiting to pull the trigger and they're 

306
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,251
doing so in such a fucking insane and 
ridiculously misrepresentative way.

307
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,050
There was something about Jordan 
Peterson,

308
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,590
Jordan Peterson,
I'm going to speak somewhere,

309
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,750
and there was these people sending 
emails that he was a Nazi and Oh yeah,

310
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,520
schist and a racist and trans phobic and
just.

311
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,670
But they're just hurling.
These nuclear bombs have words with 

312
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,800
literal.
Literally.

313
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:28,801
No.
We're no thought whatsoever about the 

314
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:32,041
consequences of using these words to 
describe someone who's absolutely 

315
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,440
clearly not that of course it's when 
someone can't argue another side,

316
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:40,441
they just.
That's how they shut down the 

317
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:40,441
conversation,
but here's my point,

318
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:43,171
is that it elevates this manic 
misrepresentation of reality because 

319
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:45,730
they've agreed to not look at it 
realistically.

320
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,920
They've agreed.
Who cares if he's not a Nazi,

321
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:51,000
we're going to fucking calm Nazi,
and in doing that you,

322
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,590
you,
you're,

323
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,500
you're escalating.
What's like,

324
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,210
if there's a mob mentality,
right?

325
00:13:55,211 --> 00:14:00,211
It's part of what's going on.
One of the things didn't happen to mom 

326
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:00,211
mentality,
so people start murdering.

327
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:03,631
People jump in.
If people killing people and you're 

328
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:03,700
trying to get away the guys running at 
you with a knife,

329
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,350
you're going to fucking kill it.
That's what people do.

330
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,650
It's a normal thing.
It happens with my mentality to,

331
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,870
to happens this with this,
these kinds of arguments,

332
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,080
the same kind of thing.
People could just decide they don't care

333
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:19,081
if you're right,
they're going to call you a fucking 

334
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:19,081
racist.
They're going to call you a Nazi.

335
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:19,570
They could just gonna keep saying it 
until you believe it.

336
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:23,530
One hundred percent.
Like this fucking Nazi Kurt Metzger.

337
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,190
Ladies and gentlemen.
Good to see you,

338
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,920
pal.
Thanks for coming,

339
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,480
man.
Pull up.

340
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,300
Pull up.
Get them in there.

341
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,270
You got him on camera then.
Good.

342
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,260
Good to see you buddy somewhere.
Oh,

343
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,530
well this room is separately heated.
This is its own little,

344
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,570
uh,
air conditioning and thermostat system.

345
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,690
Like the sauna looking good.
Yeah.

346
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,700
This part was built.
This was not a room.

347
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,250
So this room was created like a radio 
studio.

348
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:52,040
Like same deal with thick walls.
All insulated and on a nice sense

349
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,780
of the world bunker.
Yeah Buddy.

350
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,400
It's all concrete.
Cement Shit.

351
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,980
And there's a fan that sucks pot smoke 
out.

352
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,840
So if people are getting high,
he just.

353
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,770
Oh wait.
Huh?

354
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,500
What's the matter?
What about it?

355
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh Shit.
Scenic drive.

356
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,070
Well today it is man.
La,

357
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,260
when it rains out,
it's like nothing else.

358
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,470
Beautiful.
Gets so green and drive over by.

359
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,600
Um,
uh,

360
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,610
when you're going over the four or five 
when you come in over the top of the 

361
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:24,610
hill.
Holy Shit.

362
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,340
It's stunning doing this area sick.
Like I,

363
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,100
I can't stand west Hollywood area now.
There's too many people,

364
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,760
too many people,
too many people to it.

365
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,960
I really would like to do what you're 
doing.

366
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,200
What you're doing,
I think is ideal.

367
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,980
Where are you doing?
Oh,

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,890
and did you return to the land of 
giants?

369
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:41,891
To.
With my wild length where we just yell 

370
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:42,140
at each other and it's all good.

371
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,070
Did you return to lilliput?
Put as the god of those little people.

372
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,320
I brought home new information and gold 
and silk.

373
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,460
Are you.
Where are you living again?

374
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,130
You told me in the adirondack mountains 
in northern New York.

375
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,030
Oh,
I get a.

376
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,070
or just thinking about that.
Wow.

377
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,190
I love the idea of it sounds amazing 
except for where you are.

378
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It's got a lot of ticks that have a line
when it gets too cold in the winter to 

379
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:09,611
really have that.
But it just started coming a little bit 

380
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:09,770
because it's like negative 40 where I 
live in the winter,

381
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:13,920
so he's Christ.
So now my 44 real negative 40 for like a

382
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:18,921
while.
That's why I got the sauna because I 

383
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:18,921
just fire up and then go outside Newton 
and roll around and it's just crazy.

384
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:20,810
Negative 40.
Yeah.

385
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,930
I don't think I've felt that before.
It's so remarkable where it's just you 

386
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,890
go outside and you think,
if I didn't have clothing,

387
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,670
I have 10 minutes to live it.
It's just this wild feeling.

388
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,110
Well you know,
I do that cryotherapy,

389
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,970
which is a lot colder,
but it seems fake.

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,630
Like a million dollars was dancing a 
million.

391
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,100
A guy on youtube,
that Italian guy who that guy is,

392
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,720
he puts you to videos of him dancing.

393
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,090
Fifty year old guy at dances on boats.
John Luca vaccine.

394
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,560
He's friends with Zac Efron.
Oh,

395
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,480
you signs with everybody?
That guy's hilarious.

396
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:56,120
He's a DJ.
He does everything.

397
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,270
He's an heir to have vitamin fortune or 
something.

398
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,700
Is that what he is?
Or his grandfather didn't.

399
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,460
A company.
Gary Centrum grandfather.

400
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,300
That's so funny,
dude.

401
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,590
Lucas Centrum.
Centrum fortune,

402
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,260
that guy is living a fun life,
you know,

403
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,230
he's like an Italian version of Dan 
Bilzerian and a lot of ways.

404
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,010
Yeah,
right.

405
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,710
That's like a thing like that old buff 
rich guy,

406
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,430
but he's like in his thirties,
like this.

407
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,610
Yeah.
This guy's only his thirties with a art 

408
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:26,610
attack and shit.
He did,

409
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,410
but it was from doing a lot of coke and 
doing.

410
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,450
He did a lot of shit.
He told the story.

411
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:33,600
It was up for like two days,
like dancing thousand dollars.

412
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,990
Guy John Zika vaccine.
Hilarious.

413
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,220
This guy's awesome.
Doing weird stuff with his pants that 

414
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,220
are very feminine.

415
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,920
Like you know,
like Lou,

416
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:44,120
those shorts when he's Italian,
if a dude.

417
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,050
Yeah.
But be honest.

418
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:50,051
If a dude that was wearing shorts like 
that came up to you start talking to in 

419
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:50,051
a men's room,
you'd go,

420
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:51,810
hey buddy,
let me get past you and get through that

421
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,800
door.
Oh,

422
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:56,520
we're going to have a problem now.
Those shorts shorts are more obvious,

423
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,040
like,
I don't want to be too judgmental,

424
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:03,420
but that's more than like an erection in
Asana is the tattoos.

425
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,390
I got tattoos everywhere,
everywhere.

426
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,940
It's his whole body and he just had 
another one.

427
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:13,941
He had himself on his back.
He's got a new one called the shut the 

428
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:18,210
fuck up tattoo.
It's him going like shush on his back.

429
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:23,211
I guess if I were to guess,
if I wanted to decipher that people are 

430
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,270
talking shit behind his back this way.
He's always facing them.

431
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,150
Go and Shush.
It's pretty hilarious.

432
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,360
I like when people get tattoos to,
you know,

433
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,400
like it's a power like eyes on the back 
of your head in prison.

434
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,580
Look at this.
All that writing.

435
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,130
That's it.
Look at all that writing.

436
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,950
It looks like he's got a little tiny 
writing all over his body.

437
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,951
He's a weird guy.
It doesn't look like the stop talking 

438
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:42,951
behind my back show.
She looks like I just fucked your mom.

439
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:44,450
Don't tell anybody.
It's also,

440
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,970
it tells also kind of passive aggressive
debt font that small because logo.

441
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,040
Who's going to take the time to read his
back?

442
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Yeah.
You got to be real close that are 

443
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,100
fucking him.

444
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,050
Such a great body.
Got To stop from coming.

445
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,610
So I read.
He does have his back.

446
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,080
He does a lot of body weight.
Exercise freezes himself.

447
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:05,880
That's why I brought it up because I saw
him on a video.

448
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,640
Freezing himself was the time you want 
to do it after the show,

449
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,180
what does it do?
It jacks up your nor epinephrin 

450
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,070
Epinephrin norepinephrine levels.
It produces something called cold shock 

451
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,130
proteins that are a radical inflammation
fighters.

452
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,310
It's fantastic for people that have like
arthritis aches and pains.

453
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,740
There's a lot of older folk that go to 
the place that I go to that go all the 

454
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,290
time and they said it's just changed 
their life.

455
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,020
Like people with hip issues.
Yeah,

456
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,860
because your body goes into this thing 
and if you do doubles,

457
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,290
I like to do a double means.
I go in for three minutes,

458
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,690
I warm up for about 10 minutes and I go 
in for another three minutes.

459
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,130
How much is it to do it?
A lot.

460
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,360
It's a good question.
Find out.

461
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,860
I Dunno.
It's not cheap.

462
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,050
Yeah,
because I only saw this fucking Julian.

463
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:52,660
Yeah.

464
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,920
Whenever you can go to his place.
It's going to my mountain,

465
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,360
man.
It's the whole thing all the time.

466
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,420
What it is is your body has to feel like
it's going to die and when your body 

467
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,511
feels like it's going to die,
it freaks out and produces these anti 

468
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,310
inflammation properties.
It's basically like twitter.

469
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,420
The same thing with the sauna.
You know Barry Criminal Law.

470
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,600
He wanted me and him went on tour.
Do that last year.

471
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,010
Yeah.
That guy saved my life man.

472
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,600
I was like in a bad way when that guy 
called me.

473
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:22,320
But uh,
anyway,

474
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,710
we got in a car,
this guy driving on black ice and 

475
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,620
Pennsylvania where he tries to pass,
say a tractor trailer,

476
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,970
you know,
some people don't want to be behind 

477
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,890
trailer so he goes to pass it and we're 
like 60,

478
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,840
which is the,
it's under the speed limit but it's 

479
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:40,840
black ice,
you know,

480
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,340
so we're going next.
It felt like a jet engine sucking that.

481
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,110
It was just wobbling.
And so I'm in the passenger seat.

482
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,770
Barry was behind the driver

483
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,330
and we just get sucked into under the 
trailer and the trailer.

484
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,470
Yeah.
So my head,

485
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:58,471
I mean I already got my head cut off and
I had time to say what the fuck three 

486
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,290
times I didn't know what the fuck,
what the fuck,

487
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,480
and then I was like,
oh,

488
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,490
I got some dead.
I just remember thinking that swerved 

489
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,910
and then the back end,
like my it started going away from the 

490
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,840
trailer and the back end got caught 
instead where no one was sitting that 

491
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,790
got pulled in,
the windows blew in and then a drug us a

492
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,890
little bit and spit us out.
And we spun in Atlanta in the median.

493
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,930
That's insane.
It was.

494
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,150
And uh,
the driver was weeping.

495
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,970
Oh my God,
me and barry were like,

496
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,110
I swear to God,
like high,

497
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:29,290
like I have never felt I could do that 
once a year,

498
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,820
like a vacation to me,
I swear to God,

499
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,250
I like it,
but I had to be.

500
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,600
I was like,
sure.

501
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,220
I guess my brain thing,
I'm going to die,

502
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:40,180
but I'm sure my body thought it was too.
But it felt fucking amazing.

503
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:41,650
Dude.
I never felt anything like that.

504
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:44,980
Like the be a trigger to die and they 
just don't know what happens to vet.

505
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:47,050
Sometimes when they come back they don't
want to admit it.

506
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,210
But they got addicted to war.
Yeah,

507
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,500
right.
Her locker,

508
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,330
they can hurt law.
Just thinking of that.

509
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,740
Oh,
that's 100 percent legit.

510
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,770
They also.
There's a good Sebastian younger book 

511
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:58,770
about that.
I read that based on your pod tribe.

512
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,980
Yeah,
and these people,

513
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:04,981
that's like the closest.
They have a field in each others when 

514
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:04,981
they're in the middle of a war zone.
It's like me on twitter.

515
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:09,091
Man was weird talking about his twitter 
outbursts and poor representation of who

516
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:11,440
he is as a person.
Wait,

517
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:12,080
so I don't understand.

518
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,900
What did you settle the matter at the 
guy.

519
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,520
What do we say?
Nothing.

520
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,200
He just blocked him.
He blocked him on twitter,

521
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,780
so he decided to not sure he blocked.
You definitely blocked him.

522
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,960
So I just said something that he had 
wife on his ass.

523
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,290
I didn't think that.
That's a good question.

524
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,230
I mean,
I'm not.

525
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,310
Whatever.
I'm not worth it.

526
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,260
He was never a fat guy.
Now that's what it is.

527
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,310
Crazy.
If it was like,

528
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,400
because he's really handsome man,
so it's like that is so funny to me to 

529
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,280
light weight.
So he did do that.

530
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:42,710
No,
no,

531
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,380
no.
We just made.

532
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,690
Oh yeah.
Because it seems like a very extreme.

533
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,910
It's just a funny insult.
How many comics,

534
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:51,280
if you had a guest.
I've had life on their ass over.

535
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:54,820
I would.
If I had like a friend that was like,

536
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:55,460
hey dude,
I.

537
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,450
I do like,
like you would want to do some friend.

538
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,280
You have to wear like this crazy 
compression close afterwards to really 

539
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,190
do it.
It's not a joke.

540
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:08,380
Then I probably want to do is fucking 
surgery.

541
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,030
Yeah,
right.

542
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,540
They're,
they're,

543
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,640
they're good numbing your shit up and 
they're going in with a god damn pipe 

544
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,360
that's got a vacuum attached to it and 
they're roughing you up and sucking 

545
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,380
chunks.
Violent.

546
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,430
It looks fucking mad at how fat you are.
Probably doesn't work because you don't 

547
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,440
change your habits.
Either tape works,

548
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,990
but listen,
you're going to get fat again,

549
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,150
like it'll make you look good for a 
little bit,

550
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,410
but if you don't change how you eat your
you,

551
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,500
your,
your static state right now where you're

552
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,790
at,
you're getting fatter.

553
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,680
Most people,
most people,

554
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,810
if they're overweight,
they're getting more overweight.

555
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,640
They're not steady at at,
you know,

556
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,500
whatever the fuck it is,
50 pounds over.

557
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,010
They keep keep going

558
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,110
because it's the same pattern of 
behavior,

559
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,760
so if you get yourself sucked down 
there,

560
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,330
I know people have done this,
get yourself sucked down with the vacuum

561
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:58,331
down to a good legitimate size.
They just balloon back up and a lot of 

562
00:23:58,331 --> 00:24:02,711
times there's a lot of unevenness why 
people get fat and weird places because 

563
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:07,031
they took out,
get a little out right around the 

564
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:09,581
winter.
I feel like I got a quarter inch in 

565
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:09,581
there that isn't being abused.
Fat.

566
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,150
It's also,
I think they're saying based fat out 

567
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,780
your blood can get lumpy.
Fucking wouldn't be smooth.

568
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,930
Yeah,
like at least if you've got a natural 

569
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:19,930
layer of fat,
it's like a smooth.

570
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,660
It feels right,
but I suppose it doesn't work.

571
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,540
I've seen people like,
no,

572
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,950
you understand I can't develop pectoral 
muscles.

573
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:29,951
I had showed her nonsense.
It's nonsense because like I can't do 

574
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:31,730
it.
Well,

575
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,690
no,
that's not true.

576
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,850
There's all these talk shows.
These guys are packing plants.

577
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,760
Yeah,
know dude,

578
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:39,560
who have one of those I know do two 
implants and how did it end up for her?

579
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,410
Not so good,
man.

580
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,420
Yeah.
That's so good.

581
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,690
That sounds real bad.
And he wound up killing himself because 

582
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:46,690
of something else.
I.

583
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,670
Here it is life.
Jesus Christ in the holy fuck.

584
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,570
Yeah.
I'd be scared.

585
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:54,890
What's under the fat?
My ass.

586
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:56,270
I got.
I don't know what's under there.

587
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,840
This step limits cut.
There might be a look at this,

588
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,860
this weird shape.
It's blood loss and maximizes post op 

589
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,561
comfort and what they're doing is going 
in on this person's stomach and just 

590
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:11,000
sucking tubes of it out.
Here's the thing.

591
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,940
This guy's not even that fast.
No,

592
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,960
that's a little bit all this guy or Gal,
I don't know.

593
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,340
We're only looking at a building site 
and Joseph was already hot.

594
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,920
He just was getting a little bit.
She's like handsome guy.

595
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,930
That's like so irreverent.
I think that's really funny how it 

596
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,620
works.
Look at the little fucking edges on the 

597
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:29,620
thing.
Oh,

598
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:29,840
that's.
This is disgusting.

599
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:32,090
This thing.
Look how like you see,

600
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,180
like when he was going back it up a 
little jamie.

601
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,160
Those little things,
those holes that like little knives,

602
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,600
man,
like a little bit.

603
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,650
This is violent.
There's a good few little knives in the 

604
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,570
end.
It's took a cat's Dick,

605
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,230
so he's just scooping it out of there.
Is this a woman or a man?

606
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,240
I don't know if someone is not that fat.
If whoever the fuck this is,

607
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,660
if they just got on the carb free diet 
for like a couple of weeks,

608
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,310
it's not even like a thought.
That long of weight to lose.

609
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,660
I know a lady who didn't need it and got
it done.

610
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,730
She literally didn't need it.
I don't know.

611
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:09,731
I don't know her that well,
but I remember her friends saying how 

612
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:12,761
much extreme discomfort she was in 
because she had to wear essentially 

613
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:12,761
elect this,
these tights.

614
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,850
Super tight compression pants everywhere
to keep all your ass fat together is an 

615
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,620
amazing deal.
So debt.

616
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,710
What I was having my ass fat loosened a 
little.

617
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,750
I had a hair transplant.
That was the dumbest thing I've ever 

618
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,750
done.
One of the Feldman,

619
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,690
that's what he did.
I was giant scar in the back of my head.

620
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,480
It looks like a smile.
I wonder if that's a piece of meat.

621
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,280
My job.
You get like a scar from it.

622
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,620
Yeah.
My joke was that it's like taking people

623
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:44,621
from a town where everybody is healthy 
and moving them into a town where 

624
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,770
everybody's dying.
Feeling ones that were left elected,

625
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,030
new recruits the hair that was supposed 
to be up there.

626
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,450
So where do you get it from?
Like other parts of it from the back of 

627
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,891
your head.
They take a strip off of that now the 

628
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:57,891
way they do it and a lot of places they 
do it differently.

629
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:02,001
Do one individual follicle at a time.
I just was scared that it was going 

630
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:02,520
bald.
I was like,

631
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,710
what can you do?
And they tell you they could fix it.

632
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:05,400
They're like,
oh great.

633
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,550
I'll just get it fixed.
But it doesn't really fix it now.

634
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,510
Well how come?
Because Joel Mchale from suit,

635
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,150
because I remember him from those Burger
King commercials where you had less hair

636
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:18,030
than I do and it all.
Now he's got Dragon Ball Z.

637
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,370
Wow.
It's real thick.

638
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:25,371
It's almost like more thick.
Then they start with some killer 

639
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:25,740
transplant or is that just a great head 
of hair man?

640
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,110
You remember the Burger King Commercial,
right?

641
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,590
I do.

642
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,250
I do.
Not.

643
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:34,290
Nobody does.
It was when the office was getting 

644
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,231
popular,
not to put the American one and Burger 

645
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:38,840
King at these commercials that were 
Kinda like the office and he was like 

646
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,290
the wider picture.
One Burger have thicker hair,

647
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,910
works better.
Every bald guys.

648
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,430
Fucking hair.
More hair.

649
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:48,600
I remember people with a thick hair 
follicles can get away with it.

650
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,310
Like my hair would have looked way 
better,

651
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:52,980
but I have thin hair.
The hair's themselves are thin.

652
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,280
So if someone has thick hair,
they could prove they could have some 

653
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,280
pretty dramatic result of it's the right
kind of thinning.

654
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,820
Dirty?
No,

655
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:01,530
not even 30.
Yeah,

656
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,410
but what did you tell him to 31?
Yeah,

657
00:28:03,411 --> 00:28:08,411
I think I was 28.
I just started acting on TV and I was 

658
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:10,020
panicking because my hair was like,
seriously fallen out and I was like,

659
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,520
this shit,
it's going quick,

660
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,120
and I was like,
well where's it going to go and get 

661
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,400
thicker pubes?

662
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,130
I knew that part of the reason why I was
making money was the way I looked.

663
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,360
I mean I,
I was doing stand up and I was acting in

664
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:30,720
these shows,
but I wasn't an ugly dude and it helped,

665
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,870
you know,
like it was getting certain kinds of 

666
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:35,870
roles like boyfriend roles.
That's chicken has to go through it.

667
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,080
Yeah,
you can be panic because you're like,

668
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,750
well this is how I'm making money and I 
never made any money before.

669
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,870
So all of a sudden I went from being 
completely broke and being a super 

670
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,050
struggling comic.
Like if I got lucky,

671
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,830
I was making 300 a week.
Three 50 a week was a big.

672
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,710
Was that bad?
That bad for a week.

673
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,820
Perfect.
If you're a 25 year old guy,

674
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,920
which is what I was trying to make it as
a comic,

675
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,820
then it went from that to making fucking
shit piles of money and you're like,

676
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,110
how do I not move back?

677
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,260
I'm not getting rid of this.
Figuring out a way to keep this rolling,

678
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,490
but if I should've just shaved my head.
I just didn't know.

679
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,890
Freedom.
Freedom.

680
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,270
Now even if I grew like a thick head of 
hair,

681
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,040
I guarantee you it's still shaved my 
head.

682
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:19,370
I don't want to go to a barber.
I had a really nice lady used to cut my 

683
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,370
hair too.
I loved her.

684
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,830
She's fun,
fun conversations,

685
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,330
but I'd have to go to we're fucking 
place and she'd have to come and wake up

686
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:27,890
every four day like a wine.
Where's your mommy?

687
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,050
Could you talk about that?
That chilling pursuit,

688
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,060
but I was on Samba Gb smoothies at this 
dinner show where it'd be like a couple 

689
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,960
of athletes and like a couple of comics.
Oh yeah,

690
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,650
and I don't because I don't really 
follow sports,

691
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,100
but these guys were originally as a 
hockey player

692
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,100
in some football players in which 
minority and they're talking about all 

693
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,100
these treatments they would get,
you know,

694
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,360
and most of them started out as beauty 
treatments for,

695
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:53,890
for rich fuck in Hollywood women real.
And then they trickle down to athletes.

696
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,420
That's,
I swear to God they were talking about 

697
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,541
Cryo that way,
like it was for fucking hot checks 

698
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:03,880
because they are kind of like a hot 
checks and kind of athlete.

699
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,220
You go like,
Oh yeah,

700
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,330
when Kathleen Turner,
like Blue Bluer face out from that shit 

701
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,320
on steroids for arthritis.
No Way.

702
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,470
She didn't want to be.
You want people to know about some 

703
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,140
illness which start to get less work.
So she just took all the jokes about how

704
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:28,141
she looked like a man.
She just took all the jokes to work and 

705
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:28,141
then find the chemo.
We took kind like,

706
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:28,141
hey,
good for you man.

707
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,390
If he got work at it because you're not.
People are terrified a for sick.

708
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Yeah.
I mean being going from being an 

709
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,560
insanely hot woman.
I know rose,

710
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,690
that is a change of everything.
That's a change of character.

711
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,940
It's a character building,
sky,

712
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,960
losing all his money.
You find out who really liked you the 

713
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:48,960
whole time,
you know?

714
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,450
Yeah.
Just how you interface with the world.

715
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,790
Like a beautiful woman.
Interfaces with the world.

716
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,670
Like the most popular celebrity 
possible.

717
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,220
Beautiful woman is like Tom Cruise 
everywhere she goes.

718
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,270
It's like Michael Cost as a bit about 
the same amount of data.

719
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,870
It's almost the same amount of danger 
too.

720
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:04,740
Have you got to watch who's coming up on
you?

721
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,570
Like how famous person with worse though
for girls.

722
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,890
Listen,
men are dangerous and that's why we have

723
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:16,891
a system called the patriarchy took 
women cost been a great system to 

724
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,510
protect women from the ages of men 
called Patriarchy and we threw it.

725
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,730
We throw it away because the colleges.
I think it's important to talk about 

726
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,990
Patriarchy because I feel that young 20 
year old women need their own Illuminati

727
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:30,060
to talk about,
you know,

728
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,280
their failures on it's.
Yeah.

729
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:36,300
It's like it's Illuminati for girls 
conspiracy,

730
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,660
patriarchy to ask for the set 
definition.

731
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,930
There isn't one is that suspicious?
Same with racist.

732
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,430
There is one in the dictionary,
but that's not the accepted one.

733
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,620
Ask just any online feminist.
What does it mean?

734
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,650
There's no.
Well you can be whatever you want to be 

735
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:52,650
like.
It's,

736
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,111
it's,
it means you're my ex boyfriend named 

737
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:55,930
Gary Click of mean girls is that 
patriarchy are in a position of power.

738
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,050
That's the patriarchy.
But men have been in the workplace for 

739
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,660
hundreds of years more than women is 
that there's a real problem.

740
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,180
Well,
it should be caught up.

741
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,240
But what about when you hear this shit 
where somebody goes and people wonder 

742
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,950
where all the female comedians like?

743
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,880
No.
Uh,

744
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,040
two people talking about it.
When Louie got shellacked by that fucked

745
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,220
up article,
people were saying that shit about you.

746
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,130
How come there's not an equal number of 
female comedians to males?

747
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:26,310
Well,
because women are treated better in our 

748
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,310
society.
Yeah.

749
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,590
If there's damage amount of female 
Comedians,

750
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,710
you know,
women are being abused way more than 

751
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:31,710
ever because you don't get in this job 
from a happy.

752
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,660
This job isn't about support.
It's you get last because you fucked up.

753
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,840
So I hope there's not a lot of women in 
it that would mean they're being raped 

754
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,010
more does that,
but it is

755
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,120
also,
it's just from a female perspective of a

756
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,130
chick's funny.
It's harder because something happened 

757
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,130
to her.
They can't,

758
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:48,770
but they can't talk about certain things
like,

759
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:53,771
no,
no man wants to see a woman on stage 

760
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,890
telling politic stories or politic 
jokes.

761
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:59,330
It's funny you say that,
but it did create a daily show.

762
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,710
Maybe you,
maybe you,

763
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,230
but most people in the audience for the 
woman started out.

764
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,570
I won't rule out anything if I'll take.
I won't say any premise has hacky,

765
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:13,571
just punch line.
So if your premise is airline fucking 

766
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:13,571
peanuts,
that's fine.

767
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:14,360
Tell me what your punchline is.
Maybe a punchline justifies it.

768
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,440
I don't,
I don't,

769
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,150
I won't rule out any premise on the 
premises or hacky,

770
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,530
but people probably don't want to hear 
it.

771
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:22,220
But who,
you know,

772
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,090
it's like,
look,

773
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,120
if you can get people to listen to some 
shit that they basically don't want to 

774
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,120
hear.

775
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,220
Like,
oh great,

776
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,290
this is where I used to do the black 
rooms I started.

777
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,080
So I totally agree with you.
I'm totally in agreement with you.

778
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,330
We're not talking about drinking caveman
coffee.

779
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:40,630
We're not talking.
I feel wired is wicked from 270 

780
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:42,040
milligrams.
How many did you have?

781
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,010
Like.
Well,

782
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:44,630
I just started skipping one,
but I'm like,

783
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,670
I'm the one that's empty.
Did you black out and suck though?

784
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:48,890
Ingestion?
I just drank one.

785
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:52,580
What the fuck is this dude talking about
me?

786
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,940
I'm talking about most people.
When a woman goes on stage and does 

787
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,661
stand up,
most people that are going to be in the 

788
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:03,251
audience,
there's men that are just not going to 

789
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,921
want to hear you talk about politics.
There's men that are not going to want 

790
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:05,921
to talk about sex.
It's harder for a woman.

791
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,700
I think it's a hard.
It's a harder position.

792
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,950
Being a standup comic for a woman is 
just harder.

793
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:15,100
So I think if it's harder,
you're naturally going to see less 

794
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,350
people doing it and then there's 
naturally less people inclined to do it,

795
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,770
but it's just like female mma,
like most women are not going to do it.

796
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,090
But guess what?
A lot of women do it.

797
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,160
If you're the type that does it,
you fucking do it,

798
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:25,520
but there's no fucking weird.
What about the Patriarchy in an mma?

799
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,260
Why Arthur equal number of women than 
men?

800
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,620
You don't say that,
right?

801
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,450
They're not really fans of.
I noticed that.

802
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,680
Remember who the think?
That's it.

803
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,360
I think it's because it's an untenable 
argument.

804
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:40,390
What you can't say.
This should be an equal amount of women 

805
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,661
fighting as men because it's not getting
punched in the face area.

806
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,990
That's one area where we agree.
It's one area we get to a goal.

807
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,560
Yeah,
well men are.

808
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,190
They do this better.
This is.

809
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,210
They do it more.
They're doing it constantly and there's 

810
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,400
some elite female athletes in mma.
Don't get me wrong,

811
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,310
of course rivaled the elite athletes of 
men,

812
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,320
but they used to summit and they had the
operation when more men fucking way 

813
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,801
more.
I mean it's not even seen with 

814
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:05,801
basketball.
I was watching sport,

815
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:05,801
I hope.
Right,

816
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:09,970
but my point is the same as standup 
stand is another getting punched in the 

817
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,380
face sport.
To me that's super fucking difficult.

818
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,990
You take an emotional beat.
Some people don't want to do it.

819
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,110
It's not a judgment call.
It's not like you're better or you're 

820
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,540
worse picks you because the people that 
left that I started,

821
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,880
I don't know if you think of when you 
started,

822
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,060
people thought that were funny,
that left and people that stage,

823
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,120
I can't believe you're still here.
It's clearly a calling at Nada.

824
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,620
Yeah,
you got to take a beat it.

825
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,990
Some people just decide to.
They've had enough.

826
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:38,010
They like,
they don't want to get off this fucking 

827
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,010
ride.
You know?

828
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,010
There's a lot of guys that were like big
time touring headliners and they get to

829
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,920
a point though the fuck this.
We usually go to vegas or something,

830
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,400
right?
Yeah.

831
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:46,401
They do that.
Or they just fucking get some sort of a 

832
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:46,740
writing job sometimes get writing jobs,
you know,

833
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:50,620
they started doing tree work like me,
middle of nowhere.

834
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,040
Just start cutting down trees.
You know,

835
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,660
I was,
I liked the writer's guild,

836
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,350
but listen,
man,

837
00:35:55,351 --> 00:36:00,351
anybody who thinks that should be an 
equal number of men or women in any job 

838
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:04,580
and that if there's no clear evidence 
that this is a neutral occupation,

839
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,790
that this is an occupation that doesn't 
favor any gender,

840
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,790
like there's got to be jobs where it's 
equally represented,

841
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,410
men and women.
Outside of that,

842
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,750
your job is what you choose to do with 
your life.

843
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,780
When boys grow up playing with fucking 
trucks and superheros and girls grow up 

844
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,461
playing with dolls and they obviously 
are more inclined in this direction and 

845
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:29,441
men are more inclined in that direction 
that we expect them to meet at any 

846
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:31,570
interest and then we would that we would
force it and force it,

847
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,750
ruins it for women.

848
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,750
It makes them think that they should do 
jobs that they might not enjoy and then 

849
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:38,750
they get really depressed.
Right?

850
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,951
Yeah.
Or they think that they need to prove 

851
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:42,951
themselves by doing a man's job.
Exactly.

852
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:43,360
Instead of just doing what they actually
enjoyed doing.

853
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,220
Well,
I mean,

854
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:45,240
you know,
it's funny.

855
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:50,241
As long as I can remember,
my mom wanted to work and she got a job 

856
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:50,730
and then she was mad because she wanted 
to stop working because it's um,

857
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,600
but uh,
I mean it just depends on the level of 

858
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:56,600
need,
right?

859
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:56,720
Like what if there's like a war or a bad
economy?

860
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,810
So I'm guessing,
what are you going to go get people?

861
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,840
That's a different thing,
right?

862
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,850
It's different during the war,
like everybody was sort of bonded 

863
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,610
together because they make shit 
constantly.

864
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:07,790
Well,
there seems to be a much more of a uh,

865
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,990
you know,
sometimes my girlfriend,

866
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,230
my girlfriend's at college,
I was like,

867
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,510
I realize isn't even ties in with this 
jazz night thing because I realized or 

868
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,310
she realized that like half the bad 
things that happened to her in the last 

869
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,310
four years were social media related.

870
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,260
All this lyric or maybe all of them.
I'm thinking about it like if I think 

871
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,190
all the bullshit like stress on my life 
that I had in his fucking need.

872
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,330
It is real though.
Like I've had a couple of theaters can 

873
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,290
say like ruined my life.
Strangers like set out.

874
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,420
I'm going to ruin your life.
Like where I was like,

875
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,750
wow,
you got a lot of dude it.

876
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,930
It costs money now.
It's crazy.

877
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,810
That's when you get theaters canceled 
for.

878
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,880
Well,
I booked a two art schools.

879
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:52,881
I just paid them to run it like the area
and I sold it out myself and then they 

880
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:56,090
would just cancel saying that I do hate 
speech or something saying,

881
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Oh,
there's one merit in Chicago and then 

882
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Brooklyn School of music just can't sign
me.

883
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,241
And I had to switch it that day.
Chicago and Brooklyn though are hotbeds 

884
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,890
lubrizol Chicago was filled with and 
that's like,

885
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:09,030
I'm a,
I'm a piano player.

886
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,710
Has Two social jihadists.
No Dude.

887
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,060
And I thought that was like my,
my,

888
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,730
my safe spot.
I'm like,

889
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:15,640
dude,
I'm a piano player.

890
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,970
Algo is so full of like,
dude,

891
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,700
everywhere is the nothing from the 
neverending story.

892
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:22,230
It's just like everywhere now.
Well,

893
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,830
you know,
dude,

894
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:25,320
if you go to these underserved markets,
like Detroit's right there,

895
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:27,090
there's people that want to see in 
Detroit.

896
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:28,210
You Go,
I'll go to Detroit.

897
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,660
Be fucking amazing and track.
Is that the [inaudible] areas?

898
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,190
And I did this place.
Oh,

899
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,800
small some rock,
dude.

900
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:38,500
It was tremendous.
I had a great time in Detroit.

901
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,600
I did that.
Fillmore did two shows there.

902
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:42,730
It was fucking amazing resource in 
there.

903
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,020
Like seven years ago.
I was sick.

904
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:44,860
Fucking fun,
man.

905
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:46,090
They appreciate you.
Well,

906
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,810
it's easy to forget or happy to be 
there.

907
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,120
You know this horse shit because this 
cult that these people are in that's in 

908
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,460
Hollywood and New York and Chicago,
religious there.

909
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,770
It's not the rest of the country.
People aren't,

910
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,830
you know,
this is the thing that you get fooled 

911
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:01,830
with social media as you think this is 
reality,

912
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,590
but it is everywhere,
but they don't like it.

913
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,720
That's the difference.
I like how it would connect people being

914
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,290
like,
oh no,

915
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:10,291
this is great.
But it is in other colleges and college 

916
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:15,150
kids write me that they have to sign a 
white privileged contract like the 

917
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,901
college I've seen them,
but at least they know it means they 

918
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:18,901
acknowledged their white privilege,
which is basically.

919
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:23,590
I don't know.
It's something that happens usually for 

920
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,260
genocide or whatnot,
but we put you acknowledge your 

921
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,260
privilege.
You have it easier.

922
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,780
That's amazing.
I've never heard of grow.

923
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,620
It's unreal.
Well,

924
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:31,621
they're giving kids in certain schools 
are given kids lectures on gender and 

925
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:35,611
then how some people are gender fluid,
meaning that they can switch back and 

926
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:35,920
forth from male to female at anytime.

927
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,900
Like at what point in time do we go,
okay,

928
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,250
maybe that's true,
but what's the odds that that's 

929
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,880
nonsense.
The 100 percent overwhelming.

930
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,280
I mean Kim,
you might be someone with some sort of a

931
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:53,281
psychological disorder where they do 
bounce back and forth between being a 

932
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:53,281
man,
a woman,

933
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:57,480
but at what point in time could we 
recognize this as a psychological 

934
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,301
disorder and this is just not a natural 
state of being like having red hair by 

935
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:03,421
the way.
Also I don't give a shit like I know 

936
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:06,600
that involved me,
but why do you have to teach kids that 

937
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:06,600
are fighting to be,
you know,

938
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,360
they go like,
well,

939
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,010
white is considered a default.
I'm like,

940
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:14,011
well that's because it's a majority 
white population like default doesn't 

941
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,440
mean because I don't understand what 
people are finding is by default.

942
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:16,660
What do you mean?
It doesn't make any sense.

943
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,060
Like when people go flesh colored 
bandaids or white,

944
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,730
which I don't even know if that's still 
true,

945
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,760
crown bending do,
but it's literally a matter a matter of 

946
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,911
like populate,
like why are you fighting to be default 

947
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:31,360
or like the boring.
Like I became a comedian to be marginal.

948
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,670
Like on the margins.
I didn't want to be in the main dude.

949
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:38,671
My gone.
If I can't go on a fucking 

950
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:38,671
rollercoaster.
Well the answer the bandaid thing,

951
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:40,870
it's very easy.
The time that bandaids were invented,

952
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,510
it was a far greater population of white
people.

953
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,560
Yeah,
no shit.

954
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:49,561
There's more now.
It's like they say within 30 years why 

955
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:51,640
people are going to be the minority.
I think looking forward to it.

956
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,380
Why is my kid white?
I don't even know.

957
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,060
Your kid is definitely not white.
And your kids half Mexican.

958
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,100
Yes.
I spoke this in here by the way.

959
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,790
Yeah,
sure.

960
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,520
I'd rather use marijuana.
What do you got going on?

961
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:07,540
There are some little glass pipe.
It's a chillum chill them.

962
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,250
That's what these fish concert.
But chill them.

963
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,070
Was that thing they do with Hash a 
movie?

964
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,410
Sure.
But that's what I mean.

965
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,190
So just a a one hitter.
We got joints here.

966
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,730
If you want to spark a joint.
I do want to smoke a joint or joint.

967
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
I think it's because it's student debt 
that all this shit's happening because 

968
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:25,800
of what?
Student debt?

969
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,160
No,
a lot of fucking.

970
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,460
No one's going to get a job from 
underwater vagina ballet.

971
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,410
The economy tanked.
All of a sudden there's money to be made

972
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,040
and they're 60

973
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,930
grand in debt for underwater Vagina 
Ballet.

974
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:37,700
And then they have to like justify it 
somehow.

975
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:38,510
It's crazy.
First of all,

976
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:40,520
if you are an expert under water,
Vagina Ballet,

977
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,550
that's a marketable skill to.
But you should not be broken all under 

978
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,790
one vagina.
Ballet.

979
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,680
The,
the social media.

980
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,250
If you noticed the news media started 
taking cues from like gossip shit.

981
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Okay.
So like tmz is almost a quaint old 

982
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:57,990
respectable thing.
Now to the onion is the most value.

983
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,370
The Werewolf,
right?

984
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,510
Is that I'm going to smoke out this 
waiting for you to go to.

985
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:09,090
It's okay,
but you keep drinking craft golf 

986
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:14,090
whenever Gawker and fucking buzzfeed.
Basically the print media is going out 

987
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:18,191
of business all of a sudden,
gossipy bullshit and all the social 

988
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:18,710
jihadis.
It makes a lot of money.

989
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,480
Everything has got to be outraged or 
uplifting click.

990
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,370
I said,
yeah,

991
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,200
and my friend who works in a no more,
but my friend Aaron knew her from a rate

992
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:28,700
when you came on race wars,
it's serious.

993
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,150
She was like,
yeah,

994
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:30,000
I remember.
That's.

995
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,240
Yeah,
may be managing.

996
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:32,360
Get her Isabelle.
Okay.

997
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,150
She would get sick of these fucking 
generation.

998
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:38,840
She spawned with her fucking just to 
sell shit too.

999
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:40,490
That's the thing.
It isn't like a big plan.

1000
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,590
It's just like to sell.
It's the,

1001
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,270
there's now these people,
whatever these problems are,

1002
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:48,780
they're claiming they don't want them 
solved.

1003
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,790
They clearly want to have the conflict 
going on forever because they make a 

1004
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,320
living on it.
There's people that just made,

1005
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,120
they're all in patriot.
They're basically clergy,

1006
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,890
the clergy,
this jihadi shit.

1007
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,990
Uh,
uh,

1008
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:04,340
and you're always on Patrion with the 
handout who helped me go to schools and 

1009
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,340
tell kids about fucking,
you know,

1010
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,620
hit the Werewolf General queefs or 
whatever.

1011
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I know they got to like make like make 
problems where there aren't any 

1012
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:11,840
problems,
but I think it's because of our instinct

1013
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:14,390
to run away from a lion as stronger than
towards a banana.

1014
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,150
I got offered an alternative point of 
view.

1015
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:21,570
Think about how often you get into 
bullshit arguments online and you're a 

1016
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,840
successful comedian who's married with 
children.

1017
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:27,990
Now,
think of yourself as being 20 years old 

1018
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:27,990
at college,
talk and Shit,

1019
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:33,050
writing a blog,
whatever decided you're going to take 

1020
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,611
down all of these points.
It's a natural inclination to do it and 

1021
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:36,700
it's also natural.
Pick a fucking side.

1022
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:42,090
It's natural to decide.
You see people aggressive in one 

1023
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,491
direction.
I'm going to be on the other side and 

1024
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:44,491
say,
fuck those people.

1025
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:44,491
Look at it again.

1026
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:44,491
I'm just smoking the manliest pipe in 
the world.

1027
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,650
Don't mind me.
How dope is that?

1028
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,240
SB pipe design on Instagram,
talking about fucking society and Shit.

1029
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:53,690
Smoking a werewolf by Mr Rogen.

1030
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,460
Well,
you can't default on any of these loans.

1031
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:58,410
It's a trillion dollar debt.
Well,

1032
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:01,320
that's a giant issue.
Those kids getting fucked because it's a

1033
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:06,321
hustle.
They tell you you have to do it and in 

1034
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,230
some jobs you do have to do it,
but you should probably think about what

1035
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:10,560
the fuck you wanna do with your life.
Ultimately before you do it.

1036
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,270
I don't think it's a bad idea to travel 
overseas to experience some things,

1037
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,230
take some jobs,
and then get some life experiences that,

1038
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,620
you know what,
I'm leaning towards being a this or I'm.

1039
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,300
What interests me is that take the time 
to find out what gender you are.

1040
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,020
Don't let your out.
If you bounce

1041
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,170
to that.
I spent 50 grand on a history education 

1042
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:33,170
that I could gotten from Dan Carlin

1043
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,200
for nothing or dude,
yeah,

1044
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,360
he's on fire history.
Florida case is sick.

1045
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:41,850
He's a bad motherfucker that Danieli 
about.

1046
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,460
He's.
He's a history podcast.

1047
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,330
Guys,
not reading books by white males for the

1048
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,750
next month to solicit.
Just read more books of people of color.

1049
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,690
You can read what books by white people.
Look the way I suggest,

1050
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:58,140
I suggest a five to one ratio.
People of color makes no sense.

1051
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,060
Nigeria and a Filipino and like a three 
lock and have in common.

1052
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,020
There was somethings,
not Jordan yet,

1053
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:10,021
person tweeted real recently,
it was a huff post editor that was 

1054
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:13,431
talking about her ultimate goal of home 
runs being white or less contributions 

1055
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:20,610
being white,
more contributions by people of color 

1056
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:20,880
and women and she had like this whole 
breakdown in numbers,

1057
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,770
like the numbers that they've achieved 
of like how there is still working on it

1058
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,930
of getting rid of the white voice.

1059
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,060
Just be the white guy.
He's never done.

1060
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:35,320
That's the bottom line.
What women do so much because I don't 

1061
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,861
know any black people by the way.
Who all the jibberish that you here you 

1062
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,400
think of a single black person in my 
life that has ever demanded I say any of

1063
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:49,401
it or agree or never say shit that 
they're claiming 40 though.

1064
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,840
So there's like people like I guess my 
age and not.

1065
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,900
You know,
it's generational too because if you 

1066
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:56,900
were in the twenties,
if you were hanging out with 20 year old

1067
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,860
kids,
you'd be experiencing this will now.

1068
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,860
They went full circle,
but they're trying to see your Dick.

1069
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,850
Doesn't matter though,
with the racist,

1070
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,880
like I can't even believe it's a point 
where people with a straight face push 

1071
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,110
segregation under the guise of anti,
you know what I mean?

1072
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:12,630
Like safe space.
So this is a colored space.

1073
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,350
I'm like,
you know,

1074
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:16,230
we had that in the fifties and shit.
The Soviet Union,

1075
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,231
they do everything the opposite.
It's doublespeak tolerance is 

1076
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:21,630
authoritarianism.
Well yeah,

1077
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:25,020
but say it again.
It's the opposite.

1078
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:26,880
It's doublespeak where if you say 
tolerance,

1079
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:28,460
that means authoritarianism.
No,

1080
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,390
it's what is,
is it enforced tolerance?

1081
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,270
It becomes like a mandatory behavior 
pattern that you're supposed to like 

1082
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,160
hate speech is free speech because this 
isn't who decides.

1083
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:43,161
Hey,
why don't you got this being a stupid 

1084
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:43,161
call I got,
I,

1085
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:44,930
I have an obsession like explaining to 
people who haven't.

1086
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,860
You heard you on the show before,
they don't know about your job.

1087
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:48,060
A witness,
which I never thought.

1088
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:49,620
I never thought of it as a cult.
Honestly.

1089
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:52,200
I never called them a call and I never 
really had an anger towards it.

1090
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:54,090
But when I think about it,
you know,

1091
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:56,260
they didn't help.
It didn't help my fucking family.

1092
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,230
And only hurt.
That's the thing with these religions,

1093
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:00,080
they never help.
And that's what they should also seeds.

1094
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,090
Some,
some religions I think can help certain 

1095
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:05,090
people.
I don't believe they don't.

1096
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,020
Especially men's helped nicest people on
the planet.

1097
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:12,230
What I'm saying is the parts that helped
were parts I didn't need the religion 

1098
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:12,230
for.
You didn't,

1099
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,090
but you haven't accelerated in mind.
I saw people have their lie.

1100
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,610
I saw a guy who was a meth head mean 
this is my church.

1101
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:19,310
And he had bad teeth and shit.
And then uh,

1102
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,790
his whole family came in and all of a 
sudden you got new teeth and they were 

1103
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,530
like a happy and the.
Oh,

1104
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,160
sorry,
go ahead.

1105
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,960
See what I wanted to hear that story.
That's what I'm talking about.

1106
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:30,070
No,

1107
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,130
I've seen that happen.
Like I don't think I'm an atheist at 

1108
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,130
all.
Like I,

1109
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,130
I have no,
uh,

1110
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,490
uh,
when you were under that truck,

1111
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,210
so when you were in that accident did 
contemplate like,

1112
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:45,211
oh my God,
it might be going to heaven or I might 

1113
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:47,371
be going to hell.
I didn't even have time for that until 

1114
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:47,620
we were just like,
this is the end.

1115
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:51,730
I'll tell you why I felt good was it was
so out of my control what was happening.

1116
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,550
I mean not one part because usually I 
think I'm going to die because I fucking

1117
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,690
did something,
but like it was so out of my hands.

1118
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:00,610
That was comforting.
Like I was like,

1119
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,900
oh,
there's nothing.

1120
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,260
It's just your time when it's your time,
man,

1121
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:05,600
and this one,
it's not my fault.

1122
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:06,940
Yeah,
that's right.

1123
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:07,690
Yeah.
I'm like,

1124
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,560
oh,
that's right.

1125
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,460
It's an versus me.

1126
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,330
I'm like,
I shouldn't have tweeted that is they're

1127
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,140
stabbing.
I think this is.

1128
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,220
This is the creepy part because the 
job's witnesses and that guy with the 

1129
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,020
teeth,
he had a way to come back in,

1130
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,520
or my ex girlfriend that got caught 
shoplifting because all white girl 

1131
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:25,520
shoplift.
I don't know if you know that too,

1132
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,310
because no one would ever believe it was
them passed with a rider was the queen 

1133
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,080
shoplifting white girl because who would
think she would do that?

1134
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:31,780
I wouldn't ask like why would they all 
do it?

1135
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,470
So they.
And they all have,

1136
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:36,150
I've almost all white girls.
I'm not sure.

1137
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,170
I mean my church,
I'm sure there were sincere people 

1138
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,330
fucking thing to do to shoplift birth 
control,

1139
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,620
birth tests.
A Galley.

1140
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:48,780
You said date had a real issue?
Yeah,

1141
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:53,830
she was a real addicted shoplifts.
She got arrested hundreds of dollars of 

1142
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,170
clothes and change into different 
things.

1143
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:01,170
Put things on under clothes and walk out
with them and well my ex got caught and 

1144
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:01,420
she had to go and I didn't even know 
like,

1145
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,620
I don't even know why she didn't tell 
me.

1146
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:03,510
She was like,
I didn't want to tell him.

1147
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,360
I'm like,
I don't care.

1148
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:08,100
But she got caught and had to do 
community service I think in like Harlan

1149
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:13,110
and she was afraid to do it,
but she said like people are walking up 

1150
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,301
and thanking her for like picking up 
trash with the orange vest because 

1151
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:17,050
people just skip out on it.
Once you do the service,

1152
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:18,920
they wipe it from your record.
Basically they offer.

1153
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's like you get caught,
you're offered a way back where you 

1154
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,000
don't have it on your record.
It's on mark it.

1155
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,590
That's the thing that could work for 
somebody that's not going to be like,

1156
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,030
so religion has that.

1157
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,530
If I wanted to go back and meet job as 
witness,

1158
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,280
I could go,
listen,

1159
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:31,020
I was wrong.
I,

1160
00:49:31,021 --> 00:49:33,610
I missed being part of the truth,
blah,

1161
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:35,320
blah blah,
and I can get back in.

1162
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,590
These people have created a religion 
where they catch you in some minor 

1163
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,861
mistake and they throw you into your 
advantage to Kramer island or whatever 

1164
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:48,300
and they're fucking proud of it.
And the only way you can move ahead as 

1165
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,660
to catch someone else.
So it's much worse than religion because

1166
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,230
there's no love or forgiveness of any 
kind.

1167
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,980
It's this empty button.
The only thing that matters is your part

1168
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:58,450
of the right identity.
I mean,

1169
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,640
it's basically just the racism as 
religion,

1170
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,910
but they use shame and that's why the 
only way out of it is to not care 

1171
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,511
because shame is the only way to control
people are your biggest ways you could 

1172
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:10,070
control the other way.
No,

1173
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:10,550
no.
For the,

1174
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,760
uh,
for the social justice warrior religion,

1175
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,360
like the way to do it.
I think it's important.

1176
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,260
What you're saying is,
um,

1177
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,120
that,
that is the files,

1178
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,630
the same sort of patterns that these 
benches and find Jesus,

1179
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:26,580
it'd be happier.
No gluten free.

1180
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,470
Jesus Christ.
Oh fuck.

1181
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:34,310
It's like what you experienced as a 
Jehovah witnesses the same thing like 

1182
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,350
they,
like we were talking before you got here

1183
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:40,351
about them trying to cancel Jordan 
Peterson speeches and these people were 

1184
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:41,380
sending these emails and professors were
sending emails,

1185
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:46,620
calling him a racist and a Nazi and 
saying he's a fascist and all these 

1186
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,421
different things like.
And what I'm saying is that when you 

1187
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:52,190
ramp up the fake reality to the point 
where you,

1188
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,980
you're saying things you know aren't 
true,

1189
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:59,180
right,
you think you're thinking of doing it 

1190
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,180
for the right reason,
to a purpose.

1191
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,040
They do it purposely.
They think they're doing it for the 

1192
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,040
right reason,
but if they really aren't,

1193
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,320
they're not.
They've really not a fan of Jordan 

1194
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,590
Peterson.
They would realize how crazy it is to 

1195
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,121
say he's racist.
How crazy it is to say he's transphobic 

1196
00:51:09,121 --> 00:51:12,270
or anything.
He's not a Nazi by any stretch of the 

1197
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:12,520
imagination.
So he just doesn't tolerate nonsense.

1198
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:15,670
It's all it is.
They want nonsense of course.

1199
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:18,160
So they're proving him right by calling 
him a Nazi.

1200
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:18,890
Yeah,
right.

1201
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:19,980
Well,
it's just,

1202
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,040
look,
this is why I think it'll just burn 

1203
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,040
itself out eventually because.
No Man,

1204
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,360
you can't keep throwing.
They throw people,

1205
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:29,570
they throw their people away.
You add Jamie Kilstein on recently.

1206
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,020
I didn't,
I never will.

1207
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,200
They stick around like the hunchback and
300,

1208
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:33,620
you know,
they're like,

1209
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,570
can I get back in?
They don't,

1210
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,350
they don't really feel that.
I know that guy from.

1211
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,500
I started comedy.
Okay.

1212
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:45,090
And Jamie was always like,
I think I talked with like a while ago 

1213
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:45,090
talking about,
but it was like,

1214
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,480
you know,
he was always a dude that felt small 

1215
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,550
that it was.
I always got the impression his 

1216
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:51,550
girlfriend made up most of,
most of,

1217
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,060
most of him when I knew him that he met 
this girl he was married to and she put 

1218
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,811
all that shit.
She turned him into who he was because 

1219
00:51:58,811 --> 00:51:59,220
he just like a low self esteem dude,
you know.

1220
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,580
And uh,
I mean I can relate to that.

1221
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,530
I can relate to a lie,
that shit of where someone's like,

1222
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:08,531
all right,
somebody feels bad and they want to be 

1223
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:08,531
part of a group,
but that's what I'm just fascinated by.

1224
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:09,290
How do you,
for yourself?

1225
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:14,291
Like how do you make old?
And he's telling me all his personal 

1226
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:17,201
experience like Shit,
some shit I won't share it with like he 

1227
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:19,241
can't.
But it sounded like being in a fucking 

1228
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:19,640
religion and like when it went like 
dirty tests,

1229
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:24,641
there's literally like purity tests.
Like you heard outside ideas you better 

1230
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,990
not to listen to.
It sounded so much like we were supposed

1231
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:30,650
to guard our hearts and like not even 
read certain things.

1232
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:35,651
You know,
like if we had doubts not say them 

1233
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:39,311
because you might stumble your brother 
out of the faith and that's the worst 

1234
00:52:39,311 --> 00:52:39,830
thing there is like,
okay,

1235
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:44,831
just put the question side because God 
forbid you say something to put stout 

1236
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:44,840
and Owen and then he falls out of the 
truth.

1237
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,060
It's a clever little tactic.
So they all do isolated.

1238
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:53,100
The reason they got to crack down on 
bullshit like comedy or whatever the 

1239
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,740
fuck or your facebook or who give.
If you give a shit about something,

1240
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:57,740
somebody tweeted,
I mean you must be fucking stupid,

1241
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:02,741
but that's all of them ever hurts.
Cognitive dissonance hurts where it's 

1242
00:53:02,741 --> 00:53:03,430
like Donald Trump is Hitler.
Now give them all your guns.

1243
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,210
Then like that hurts your brain and so 
when someone shows you,

1244
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,210
say that again,
I'm sorry.

1245
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:14,030
Smoking Pot.
A lot of these same people have been all

1246
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,220
year,
have been trying to convince everyone 

1247
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:19,220
that donald trump's being run by the 
Russians and he's Adolf Hitler,

1248
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,680
and then the government should have all 
your guns.

1249
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:26,040
It's the same as being pro free market,
but not acknowledging you're so stupid.

1250
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,700
Both of us did.
I've certainly smoked myself.

1251
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:31,540
Stupid.
Donald trump is.

1252
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,640
To me,
he's the guy.

1253
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,990
He's the perfect.
First of all,

1254
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:36,480
the perfect president of America.
This is.

1255
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,660
There's never been,
and I mean for whatever party or in he 

1256
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:41,660
is your Avatar,
man.

1257
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,260
He is.
He is the fucking,

1258
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,410
like everybody that thinks they can do a
job that they can't do,

1259
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,500
but they saw something on tv,
like I could probably do that better.

1260
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,810
Tell Him we didn't have an expert.
Just a guy like very like,

1261
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:00,350
he's the candidate of the volunteer 
fireman of the gender studies professor 

1262
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:03,420
of the fucking the vine star that became
a comedian.

1263
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,050
Like all these people that think they 
can just walk into some fucking.

1264
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,620
He is that.
Well that's our DNA.

1265
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,580
It's being like the earth is flat.
Give me a boat.

1266
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,970
Is there a golden.
I'm like my truth.

1267
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:19,971
And you all that shit like small.
He learned from Lewis and Clark like 

1268
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:21,240
though the original fucking two man 
comedy duo,

1269
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,710
we had to wait like the people that 
Lewis and Clark that the explorers.

1270
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,730
No,
she got a blood relative to that guy.

1271
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:27,870
How,
how'd you know that?

1272
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,700
Did you go to one of those genealogy 
report?

1273
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,330
Now?
My,

1274
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,010
uh,
my dad told me he just knew.

1275
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,510
Oh wow,
that's crazy.

1276
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,710
Who told him?
Why am I Warren Pocahontas things?

1277
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,560
I took the genealogy tests.
It turns out I'm gay.

1278
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,980
Is that,
how crazy is that?

1279
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,380
Elizabeth Warren Lady?
She was.

1280
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,040
She's insane.
Well,

1281
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,420
I'll take a fucking.
She won't take an ancestry test.

1282
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,360
She went to this class,
you know,

1283
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:56,540
I will say this though.
I hadn't gone on race racecourse long 

1284
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,540
time ago.
What the fuck is his name?

1285
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,360
Shawn,
let me ask you this.

1286
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,270
Oh,
what was built by?

1287
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,690
We're on this little Elizabeth Warren 
thing.

1288
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,740
Do you care about what?
About whether or not she's really native

1289
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:07,320
American.
She brought it up for.

1290
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,370
She took a job,
like she robbed these job.

1291
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,080
She's at Harvard.

1292
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,080
She got like one of those.
She got a scholarship for being native 

1293
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,080
American.
She got a scholarship to how much native

1294
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,960
American and she pulled the Shaun King 
one 32nd.

1295
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,520
Yeah.
But you have to understand something,

1296
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:23,800
and I didn't know this,
uh,

1297
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,120
that should have blood quantum native 
Americans didn't have.

1298
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,060
You could be fucking.
If I'm,

1299
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,440
let's say I'm a chief and I just adopt 
your Rogan.

1300
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,650
Joe Rogan is my son.
He is now 100 percent part of my thing 

1301
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:36,650
no matter what.
His blood.

1302
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:40,140
They didn't get hung up on that.
That came about to divvy up benefits,

1303
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,810
you know,
after we like the real evil shit.

1304
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,720
We did.
The natives was modern times back then.

1305
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:50,721
I don't,
I mean that's what everybody did back 

1306
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:50,721
then.
I don't give a fuck,

1307
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:50,721
but in modern times you're absolutely 
right dude.

1308
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:52,280
But in modern times he did some very 
evil shit with them.

1309
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,530
The blood quantum,
that was what they're kind of cool about

1310
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,180
the most,
uh,

1311
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:01,190
most native nations is they didn't get 
hung up on your amount of blood when 

1312
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,210
you're in the family.
And so you could be one like Johnny Depp

1313
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:05,610
when he said he got brought in the tribe
so we could play Toronto.

1314
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,480
That's a legit thing in traditionally in
native America,

1315
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:11,840
they were much cooler about racial shit.
Like,

1316
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,160
like Europeans kind of brought that 
nonsense over more,

1317
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,720
but a kidnap people and people would 
stay with them.

1318
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:23,750
They better vibe the Sebastian younger 
detailed how many

1319
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,180
people would leave Western society and 
joined the native Americans.

1320
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,970
I didn't know how much it was,
like separate countries.

1321
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:35,971
See if they teach American history.
That's what they should start at the 

1322
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:38,941
very first whatever countries were here 
and then just move up through American 

1323
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:39,010
because it's thousands of years.
Shit,

1324
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,750
count them.
They don't even count today.

1325
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,910
It's really interesting shit.
Like I didn't know how populated it was.

1326
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:49,080
Like two,
they were considered fauna in Canada 

1327
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,080
until the sixties or it might've been 
Australia,

1328
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,520
but they were considered like fauna.
Like,

1329
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,120
well I might be insane.
Australia.

1330
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,060
Yeah.
Australia.

1331
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,400
The aborigines,
they have a terrible story.

1332
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:02,401
They.
They was in the 19 I saw quickly and 

1333
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:05,161
under guys kidnapped the average new 
babies and made them raised by white 

1334
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:09,271
people.
They took the babies from aboriginal 

1335
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:09,271
families.
It's like,

1336
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:09,271
where'd you get that baby?
It's like,

1337
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:09,280
I don't know.

1338
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,880
They did it like a concerted effort that
we're going to try to create the.

1339
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,740
They decided they were going to 
symbolize people.

1340
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,830
I had my buddy Adam green tree lives 
over there and it'll show it.

1341
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Yeah.
He's born and raised and he works in 

1342
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,641
mining companies,
so he deals with all these different 

1343
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:26,641
aborigines and they all have different 
languages.

1344
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,710
They call them.
They're called a mob like instead of a 

1345
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,890
clan or a town,
they call themselves a mob.

1346
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,580
Really?
Yeah,

1347
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:37,120
and they have.
They might have a totally different name

1348
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,150
for things.
As a guy that lives five miles away,

1349
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,840
five miles away,
there's a bunch of totally different 

1350
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:45,840
names and those people stick to 
themselves.

1351
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,100
These people stick to their selves,
so the bands of them,

1352
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,170
hundreds of them all over the place and 
these.

1353
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,320
All these different languages are all 
the losing all of them.

1354
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:58,530
They're going to lose all these 
languages if these people get 

1355
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:59,110
assimilated because they're not really 
written down in a lot of cases.

1356
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,340
Do you see that?
It was on some fucking discovery.

1357
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:05,230
Maybe you know one of them fucking 
things,

1358
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:10,231
but the oldest human language,
I think his case on people that got 

1359
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:12,320
wiped out by the Zulus back in the day,
like Shaka Zulu conquered them,

1360
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:17,610
but the case on their language is like 
the oldest thing they can find a k,

1361
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,040
a e song son Jay,
I think.

1362
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,990
Whoa.
But the old thing,

1363
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,350
there's this old ass lady who knew 
something about like the word and it was

1364
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:27,280
like,
whoa.

1365
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,320
She's like,
they come from animal noises,

1366
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:34,321
like the lion goes bra.
And then the words they got came from 

1367
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:34,540
mimicking.
It was interesting as fuck.

1368
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,010
But it's.
So,

1369
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:38,800
uh,
it's such cradle of civilization shit.

1370
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,480
But the case song I think,
I think that's like their languages.

1371
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,920
The oldest like Prodo.
Well,

1372
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:48,921
you know,
monkeys have a language that's 

1373
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:48,921
different,
different sounds for different things.

1374
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:51,220
Like watch out,
there's a lion is a different noise than

1375
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:52,450
watch out.
There's an eagle.

1376
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,990
And these,
these biologists or what would they be?

1377
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,610
Would they be,
if they're studying monkeys,

1378
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,640
primatologists,
I guess he's primatologists setup these 

1379
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,520
speakers and played the sound of watch 
out.

1380
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:08,521
It's an eagle and all the monkeys 
fucking duct and went running down the 

1381
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:11,911
tree and they played watch out.
There's a line and they're all looking 

1382
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:11,911
down,
have a language.

1383
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:16,210
The language.
They have a language and they play 

1384
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:16,210
tricks on each other.
Like one guy will say,

1385
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:16,660
hey,
watch out.

1386
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,760
There's a line.
And they all run up the tree and he gets

1387
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:22,070
the food.
I told her I was

1388
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,820
coming on.
He goes,

1389
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,230
oh,
you go,

1390
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,690
you guys get all pothead excited about 
the same still learning chair.

1391
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,690
Never gonna stop either.
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.

1392
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:37,691
You can't shame me into getting not 
geeked out about like super volcanoes 

1393
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:38,000
and shit.
I'm going to freak out about it.

1394
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:39,320
I don't care.
It's wicked exciting.

1395
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,910
It's fun.
It's super volcanoes.

1396
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,530
I would love to.
Oh,

1397
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:46,190
we already talked about one before you 
got here that killed most of the people.

1398
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,010
Seventy thousand years ago.
We were talking about 70,000

1399
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:50,600
years ago there was only 100,000
people.

1400
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,020
Oh yeah.
Is this still a thing that said that?

1401
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:57,950
Like when they trace the jeans bag comes
from like a population about 600 people.

1402
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

1403
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:05,770
Yeah.
I mean there was probably at many times 

1404
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,230
during our history we trembled dwindled 
down to a very small number two.

1405
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,770
It's crazy.
It was really cold too.

1406
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:15,100
Oh fuck man.
Didn't half of North America under more 

1407
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:15,140
than a mile of ice.
And we made it through.

1408
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:17,930
We can make it through twitter guys,
we can make it to throw it.

1409
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:20,440
But you,
you gotta leave Anthony Jeselnik alone.

1410
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,710
You got to play this.
How much weed has steered me off course.

1411
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Do you know how many people in the last 
like two weeks and I mean having 

1412
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,691
conversations about or shit in their 
lives are like a show and so unfollowed 

1413
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:35,840
me on instagram and it was like weighing
on them.

1414
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:38,180
Right.
So follow me.

1415
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,950
How come you don't follow me on 
something?

1416
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:42,950
And I'm like do the greatest thing that 
media shit storm man.

1417
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,970
Cause I feel like I did everything you 
can do on social media by having that 

1418
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:47,970
happen.
I get,

1419
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,840
I got to the limits of social media for 
myself grabbing bandit.

1420
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:50,900
I'm so glad.

1421
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,900
I'm so glad.
I mean I put shit to promote on it but I

1422
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:58,901
was telling you that like I'm so glad 
not to be talking to people on fucking 

1423
01:00:58,901 --> 01:01:02,531
social media.
The idea that I would give a shit and 

1424
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:02,531
that's like adults,
man,

1425
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:06,200
like grown adults.
We're dealing followed me on instagram.

1426
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:09,020
Like just thinking who gives a shit of 
just blocked.

1427
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,760
You want to,
I mean I just,

1428
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,480
I was too aggressive,
but it's not even that,

1429
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:19,610
but there's no context but there's no 
context so it doesn't matter.

1430
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:20,810
There's no way to take it,
right,

1431
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:25,811
because it's not being said.
You could say it to somebody and they 

1432
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:25,811
go,
oh,

1433
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:25,880
I get what he's saying and let's say 
you,

1434
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,470
he even,
he got the context.

1435
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:32,471
You're trying to be funny.
Someone else is going to make it 

1436
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:32,471
something that's not,
that's what they did.

1437
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:32,740
It's such a.

1438
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,580
and I didn't even,
it didn't even occur to me dude.

1439
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:36,230
How much like quick sand,
like,

1440
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,260
like people that shouldn't be allowed to
make fucking eye contact with me that 

1441
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,101
I'm,
I'm having discourses with and Shit 

1442
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,111
online.
I mean just because you're getting your 

1443
01:01:47,111 --> 01:01:50,531
head the way pete to diet people like 
threatening to create whatever the shit 

1444
01:01:50,531 --> 01:01:55,310
you hear some fucking a college speaker 
complain about 10 times over.

1445
01:01:55,311 --> 01:02:00,311
I had coming at me from you.
I'm going to rape and murder your 

1446
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:00,311
neighbor.
It's explained.

1447
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:03,380
Most people that don't know this 
terrible thing where I said,

1448
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,330
hey,
if you get raped,

1449
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,540
maybe go to the cops.
On the way to posting it on facebook,

1450
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:12,860
that UCB has determined guilt in a rape 
case like nearly suggested.

1451
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:18,430
Hit the brakes.
No one knows what the fuck you're 

1452
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:18,430
talking about.
So let's just explain the story to this.

1453
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,020
Cost is so strong.
It's very.

1454
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,640
I drink it.
He was off the charts.

1455
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:25,410
He had one and a quarter and it is 
fucking to crank.

1456
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,120
I'm trying to counteract it with his 
indycar.

1457
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,820
I just want.
I want people to understand the story.

1458
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:34,821
There was a guy that was accused of rape
and you had decided like they shouldn't 

1459
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:37,810
be tried in the court of public opinion 
on social media and what you said is why

1460
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,820
humorous wind,
first of all,

1461
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,270
nothing with my friend.
Somebody now not even defending him.

1462
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:47,750
I'm defending any but like how is this 
fucking cool that this is going to be 

1463
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,160
tried on fucking facebook?
Someone's sending random message.

1464
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,710
So and so has been found a ucb that 
noted clown college has done an internal

1465
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:58,920
investigation and term and so and so is 
guilty of rape.

1466
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,650
So if you have any information come in 
and that's on facebook.

1467
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,150
Did they really say it that way?
It was first in an online woman group.

1468
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,190
Then it got leaked onto regular 
facebook,

1469
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:12,370
but as a representative of the UCB that 
said that they didn't.

1470
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:16,500
It was some fucking girl on her own.
I found out that's a big difference.

1471
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,760
Right.
Like she said,

1472
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,390
the umbrella of UCB.
Did she do it under the UCB twitter page

1473
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:23,280
or facebook page or other?
I have no idea.

1474
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:25,260
It was from twitter or something.
Whatever it is.

1475
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,260
I mean,
she could have just been.

1476
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,810
I saw thought.
I'm like,

1477
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,220
chase page.
It wasn't even a thing.

1478
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,670
The problem is if you're saying the UCB 
did it and they didn't know they did 

1479
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,740
not.
They did not.

1480
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,610
Okay.
She said that she said,

1481
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,750
but you said that you see be determined 
that it was.

1482
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,970
I saw a post that said that.
Right,

1483
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,370
and this is from a person,
but she said it.

1484
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,870
The UCB didn't say it.
No,

1485
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:50,250
it's not their official word at all.
Right.

1486
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:51,590
Okay.
So it's just a personal,

1487
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,780
very clear about that.
They never claimed that it was a person 

1488
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,021
who I think was like a rape counselor or
something or somebody had to deal with 

1489
01:04:00,021 --> 01:04:00,021
like this.
There's a bunch of like a rapey job.

1490
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:03,550
So something happened,
performers,

1491
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:08,690
something happened between performance 
and this one guy was being accused and 

1492
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,520
you said he just real simple without 
knowing who's guilty or not.

1493
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,130
You said he shouldn't be trying to call.
Here's what happened.

1494
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,430
A guy that opened for me somewhere with 
friends with I go,

1495
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:19,140
Hey,
can he call you now?

1496
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,290
First question,
why call me right?

1497
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,060
What am I a noted rape investigator on 
facebook?

1498
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,960
I think just because I was somebody 
yelled,

1499
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,080
this is me not being aware of what to 
build it up.

1500
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,750
I would just yell out on facebook about 
stuff and I had a following.

1501
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:33,090
So it's almost like a,
Oh,

1502
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:35,850
like a can you talk to you and then 
throw your weight behind?

1503
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,200
I think it was like,
eh,

1504
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,400
but um,
you know,

1505
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,860
I didn't look at it as shit,
facebook like that.

1506
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:45,861
Like it was like not,
I don't understand like how people were 

1507
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:47,340
looking at my facebook.
It's ridiculous.

1508
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:52,341
But anyway,
I talked to the guy on the phone and he 

1509
01:04:52,341 --> 01:04:53,430
told me something I think was a lie.
I mean,

1510
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,840
you know,
obviously I can't say one or the other,

1511
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:59,841
but looking back,
I think when he told me was a lie that 

1512
01:04:59,841 --> 01:04:59,841
people were accusing them because he 
didn't book them on a show,

1513
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:04,100
which just doesn't really make a lot of 
sense so much.

1514
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:07,120
And with that quick to pull the trigger 
on a rate back,

1515
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,490
how evil they would have to be booked 
me,

1516
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:14,200
he fucking crazy.
That accusation.

1517
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:19,270
I couldn't believe they would be 
involved in comedy but that at once 

1518
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,270
together

1519
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:20,320
at eight minutes,
ah,

1520
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:22,120
make a 10 or else we got rape on our 
hands.

1521
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,800
So my point was just used guilty.
This is worse because what you've done 

1522
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,530
is handed somebody a lawsuit.
You can't defame someone like that.

1523
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,750
And it's like you can just get sued for 
that.

1524
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:37,180
And also this is just to be convicted 
before you're allowed to say that 

1525
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,050
legally.
But to me it's not.

1526
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:43,110
I mean,
it's like they're taking the campus 

1527
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,671
thing of like where we're going to have 
a college campus say kick you out of 

1528
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:44,671
school for that rape.
You committed,

1529
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,910
talk over each other,
but it's hard.

1530
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:53,911
That's not a punishment.
That's not a punishment for rape is you 

1531
01:05:53,911 --> 01:05:54,250
get kicked out of school.
This is gender studies.

1532
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,500
Bullshit trickling down into real life.
Okay.

1533
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,590
So the colleges I assume wet.
Let that,

1534
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,740
let that go on because they don't want 
to be known as a school where your 

1535
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:04,740
daughter could get raped.

1536
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,220
So they let these little groups pretend 
to have power and do a little tribunal 

1537
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,940
and then everybody's happy.
But we want to know what a rapist got 

1538
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:11,940
expelled.
That's their punishment.

1539
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,160
Great job.
It sounds like the Catholic church 

1540
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:16,160
transferring people,
it doesn't sound any different.

1541
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,010
So this is someone to.
So to me that was just like a garbage 

1542
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:20,010
ass.
If this guy's dangerous,

1543
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,700
go to the fucking cops.
So,

1544
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,010
so uh,
then I'm getting all this.

1545
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:27,430
People come to me about like,
don't you dare tell a victim to go,

1546
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,290
I don't know.
You're a victim yet though.

1547
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,780
That's the thing.
Like when a victim says you're a victim,

1548
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,910
if you don't believe them,
you're calling them a liar.

1549
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,120
We have to make sure you are a victim 
before we say one way or the other.

1550
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:41,080
So we're getting ahead of ourselves.
But this is just basic due process shit.

1551
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,320
I guess the argument is because 
historically this is like the argument 

1552
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,650
on coming against me from finishing a 
historically,

1553
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:49,690
women are not believed,
uh,

1554
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,420
which by the way,
by who other women.

1555
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:56,110
Because what my experience is,
is any woman close to me,

1556
01:06:56,111 --> 01:07:01,111
they'd say she got raped.
I probably believer and every man I 

1557
01:07:01,111 --> 01:07:01,330
know.
In fact I know women that get dudes into

1558
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,790
fights over shit like that.
Especially if you're in like white trash

1559
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:08,120
town where I grew up around like women 
are the ones that don't believe women.

1560
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,870
Men are the only people stupid enough to
believe women most of the time.

1561
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,080
Okay.
So that's already a bullshit thing that 

1562
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,080
women aren't believed we.
There's lynching.

1563
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,910
Rosewood,
remember that shit that was [inaudible] 

1564
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:20,910
a woman,
a white woman was just believed.

1565
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:21,890
And then there's a bunch of lynchings of
black people was.

1566
01:07:21,891 --> 01:07:26,891
I think there's got to be instances we 
should be very measured about this 

1567
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:27,640
because it's got to be instances in 
which women weren't believed.

1568
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,460
Of course.
Full spectrum has nothing to do.

1569
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,270
The idea is that you can't believe him 
every time.

1570
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:37,000
The larger point is you'd have to look 
at it as an individual case.

1571
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:40,450
Every case is individual and you look at
it on it because that's fair.

1572
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,600
It doesn't matter.
Let's say no woman in history has ever 

1573
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,000
lied about rape once.
Well,

1574
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:49,030
you still have to have due process in 
case it happens once.

1575
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,750
I'm not getting sacrificed to the state 
for the good of the fucking.

1576
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,120
You know what I mean?
If it had shit happens,

1577
01:07:54,121 --> 01:07:59,121
it does happen.
It happens when you have something to 

1578
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,870
lose.
Like you're famous custody cases,

1579
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,400
rape case.
Yeah,

1580
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:06,750
and news stories of this going 
uncritically believed when,

1581
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:12,070
when by the way with someone not 
believed in the media and and it turned 

1582
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:16,021
out.
I see a lot of people getting believed 

1583
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:16,021
who lot.

1584
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:16,021
None of it matters though because like I
said,

1585
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:18,170
that has no bearing on my individual 
anything.

1586
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:23,230
Like we've cleared double standards,
like when will just believe you and one 

1587
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:27,020
will be super skeptical.
Barry Barry crimmins like because he,

1588
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:27,370
you know,
he,

1589
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,420
if you haven't seen that documentary,
anybody listening,

1590
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:34,460
uh,
call me lucky is really great because 

1591
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,520
he,
because that guy kind of heroic what he 

1592
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:37,520
did with a aol.
He basically,

1593
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,640
he was raping me was for which uh,
uh,

1594
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,860
uh,
I mean that's crazy what that would do 

1595
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,721
to somebody and he,
I think he told us talking about it 

1596
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:48,671
onstage first or something and he ended 
up winning when the Internet was first 

1597
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:51,220
becoming a nationwide thing,
he was,

1598
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,550
there was child pornography everywhere,
like pedophiles were by aol by the hour.

1599
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,490
If you are rich and you could just 
freely trade child pornography.

1600
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:03,820
So he had to testify before Congress,
the Senate and AOL had a lawyer there 

1601
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,640
because they didn't want to change their
policy,

1602
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,450
which was three strikes and you're out 
for child pornography.

1603
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,460
That's in the beginning.
They actually with a straight face,

1604
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:12,620
like we have a from three strikes and 
you're out policy.

1605
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:16,700
Isn't that crazy that that was only like
1995 or 96 or something like that.

1606
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,780
It's just one of the best parts of the 
documentary because Barry's like,

1607
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:20,540
well,
he told me,

1608
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,670
he's like,
the guy says three strikes you're out.

1609
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:21,940
Goes,
yeah,

1610
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,330
listen,
I love baseball too.

1611
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,420
But I love baseball more than anybody 
but.

1612
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,010
But they,
they,

1613
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:33,011
uh,
the senators and congressmen were 

1614
01:09:33,011 --> 01:09:34,871
tripping over themselves in a manly 
display of being ignorant of technology 

1615
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,130
or very like really is like a quotable 
dude,

1616
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:37,700
like the,
he says,

1617
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:39,260
but they got lot.
Oh No.

1618
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:40,700
It,
all this Internet is.

1619
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:45,701
I just know that pornography is bad.
Like some of them didn't know where the 

1620
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:49,121
fuck they were.
Robert Byrd is just like the age of 

1621
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:52,151
pornography where he for a school age 
and at one point and the documents that 

1622
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:55,010
he was talking about how it was almost 
like the other lawyer against him and it

1623
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:56,510
was who had better stage presence.

1624
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:58,250
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1625
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,290
Where he was just clearly a better 
speaker.

1626
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:04,160
Like this really expensive lawyer was 
just like a shitty opener.

1627
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:10,310
Yeah.
He was in bow and barry got to talk to 

1628
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,050
testify,
you know,

1629
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,700
he went over his time.
He went over his time very.

1630
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:16,420
They had to change it.
But anyway,

1631
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:16,970
I,
uh,

1632
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,040
I wrote through him after that.
I saw that document.

1633
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:19,310
It's like,
well,

1634
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:24,311
that guy's fucking try me.
And I was like crying from that 

1635
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:24,311
documentary.
Uh,

1636
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:27,830
well anyway,
so I got the shit.

1637
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:33,040
All that shit came down on me.
People are going to bury to get them to 

1638
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,040
like denounce me,
like I hardly knew him.

1639
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,640
So he called me up and uh,
you know what,

1640
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:41,910
you have to realize a lot of this shit 
because he did real work helping people 

1641
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:42,500
who rape victims.
Kids were building like Batman Shit.

1642
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:47,570
Okay.
And basically he fucking this shit's 

1643
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,610
turf if you're a feminist or whatever 
political thing.

1644
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,230
He goes,
you understand this is turf to them.

1645
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,810
They don't give a shit about an actual 
victim.

1646
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,900
So like,
you know,

1647
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,920
you'll try to do something good at helps
someone and if you go to groups they 

1648
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,580
could grab it and they use it as their 
little symbol or whatever.

1649
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,760
It's never about an individual person.
I talked to this woman just a one way 

1650
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,011
when at the height of things coming down
on me for saying go to the cops and off 

1651
01:11:11,011 --> 01:11:12,260
facebook and always people I know,
like the system has failed.

1652
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:12,920
Well you,
I,

1653
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,580
I don't know that you didn't go to the 
system,

1654
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:16,560
so how do you now also,
you're a white woman.

1655
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:17,340
I think it'll,
it'll,

1656
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:22,740
but does want to call me to be fair.
There's one to call me who wanted to.

1657
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,070
She want to get touched me some other 
creep inserted herself,

1658
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:31,100
like some blogger check who initially 
basically they baited me with these 

1659
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:31,100
nonsense.

1660
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:31,100
All you guys.
That's what I'm saying.

1661
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,530
Watch on there because nobody's talking 
to you on there.

1662
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,060
Like having a chat or there's what I 
learned there.

1663
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,550
They're baiting you to get you to say 
something that they can.

1664
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:39,570
They can say,
oh,

1665
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:43,140
I took down such and so and it.
There's no.

1666
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,850
I'm,
I'm from this dumb Colt,

1667
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:49,851
so I'm sincerely interested in peanut 
chatty cathy and people are not sincere.

1668
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:52,500
They they want to make a name for 
themselves,

1669
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:54,780
baiting you into doing something,
get you in trouble,

1670
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:57,360
and they will fucking fuck with you is 
shit.

1671
01:11:57,361 --> 01:11:59,520
You can't believe you'd be in trouble 
for saying such as.

1672
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:02,250
Go to the police and not fucking 
facebook if you're raped.

1673
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:07,770
So,
so this woman called me in the thick of 

1674
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:07,770
it.
I don't know her name still okay.

1675
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:07,770
Because she didn't really know anything 
about me.

1676
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,630
They're telling her I'm a rape 
apologist,

1677
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:13,080
which thank you for putting that next to
my name online for all time.

1678
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,420
I have now crazy.
It's just pop up around.

1679
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:16,780
It's just,
it's just to put raped by.

1680
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,320
Explain what happened at the Improv the 
other night.

1681
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:20,820
Oh,
this was a few months ago.

1682
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:25,821
I didn't know about some woman I've ever
met in my life right after it happened.

1683
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:28,020
I think I texted you.
I couldn't believe it.

1684
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:28,480
I,
I,

1685
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,800
my manager assistant texted me a picture
so somebody would giant glasses feel 

1686
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,070
like you told me in person I might have,
but she goes,

1687
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:40,071
do you know this person?
I thought it was someone from Tim and 

1688
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:40,071
Eric,
like she was asking me about a cat.

1689
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:42,300
I don't know where I got now.
Why Tim and Eric Personality,

1690
01:12:42,301 --> 01:12:43,640
that kind of weird look,
she's,

1691
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,100
she went in the Improv and said,
Kurt Metzger raped me.

1692
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,380
I'm here to confront him.
And uh,

1693
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,930
yeah,
they said she was visibly not right.

1694
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,400
Like it wasn't like,
I mean,

1695
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,290
but just someone throwing that around 
casually.

1696
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,030
But that's because she,
they put,

1697
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,690
they make these little shitty names.
Like what the fuck is that?

1698
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,760
There's no such thing as that.
Okay.

1699
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,950
No one's pro fucking Reiki magic.
There's someone out there go.

1700
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,140
What's the little rape?
Yeah.

1701
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:13,200
No,
I've never met a person out there that's

1702
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:18,130
doing that is if you don't accept no 
for.

1703
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,560
Yes,
same thing.

1704
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Yeah.
If you don't accept every tenant of 

1705
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,070
fucking white girl Taliban feminism that
you love rape,

1706
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,450
that's the fucking org.
It's like,

1707
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:31,200
it's like arguing with a girlfriend that
you should have dumped three years ago.

1708
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:35,660
It's a bad relationship except you're 
not dating it so hostile because this is

1709
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,760
because there are going.
We don't even know they're so into this 

1710
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,440
identity shit.
You know what it is?

1711
01:13:41,441 --> 01:13:43,490
Yeah.
I think part of it is um,

1712
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:48,620
social media of course.
I think all of these attacks and shit or

1713
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,130
antisocial,
they're like weird.

1714
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,280
The way people would talk.
Well,

1715
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:57,980
it's tricking these girls to the 
thinking.

1716
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,850
They're going to have their little angry
black guy moment.

1717
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:02,610
But here's the thing,
you're not like black people.

1718
01:14:02,611 --> 01:14:05,160
You're not like a suppressed 
marginalized minority,

1719
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:10,430
feminine.
I don't know where they're getting that 

1720
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:11,961
from.
You are absolutely not an identity of 

1721
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:14,691
women together.
And here's how I know they proved that 

1722
01:14:14,691 --> 01:14:14,691
at the women's March when they kicked 
the prolife women out.

1723
01:14:14,691 --> 01:14:16,990
See Black people have to take all,
all their garbage.

1724
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:19,990
Black people they have to take in their 
movement because it's still don't doe,

1725
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,170
but black people have to.
They're forced to,

1726
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,740
to,
to bargain like a minority.

1727
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:27,850
I get that women are half the population
got fucking women's March.

1728
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:31,510
They kick out the prolife women.
That's a luxury you have when you're not

1729
01:14:31,511 --> 01:14:33,690
in the press minority.
That's when you have it pretty good.

1730
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,360
We don't know what like what is minority
mean?

1731
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:42,361
Like being one in 10,000.
That's the Asians.

1732
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,610
That story though.
That's crazy that they know that.

1733
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:50,670
No,
I did not see if you can find that 

1734
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:50,670
Jamie.
Yeah.

1735
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:50,670
They want to see some footage.
I mean,

1736
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,540
I wouldn't be surprised if there were 
like kicking a woman.

1737
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,910
Yeah.
Like you're not an oppressed minority.

1738
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:58,420
If you can afford to kick out the 
prolife women this March.

1739
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,480
It's a crazy time too.
I mean objectively with no political 

1740
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,830
leanings left or right.
It's crazy when they're kicking out.

1741
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:07,840
The people that are saying don't kill 
the babies.

1742
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:11,710
I now look at what it is.
I mean,

1743
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,680
I'm not saying you shouldn't do it,
but what is it about.

1744
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:14,810
You were a boarding.
Well,

1745
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:19,811
you know what will eventually be at 
these are people that fundamentally 

1746
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,741
refused to acknowledge.
It's like watching people that you get 

1747
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:22,741
divorced.

1748
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:24,670
Argue the argument.
I've tried to argue this patient because

1749
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:26,020
like,
my mother doesn't hate women.

1750
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,880
She's a Christian lady that thinks it's 
murder.

1751
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,140
I think,
hey,

1752
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:31,330
maybe you're killing a baby.
I don't give a fuck I.

1753
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:32,860
it's not my baby.
Go do what you want.

1754
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:36,310
The anti,
the pro choice or intense.

1755
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,890
I don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

1756
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,690
Like,
listen,

1757
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,010
if you're the kind of person that can do
it,

1758
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,540
they maybe you should do it.
You know,

1759
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,430
like,
I,

1760
01:15:44,431 --> 01:15:45,760
I don't give a shit.
It's not,

1761
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:47,770
it's not a fucking uh,
uh,

1762
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,890
that's you and your God does to,
you know,

1763
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,560
so,
but you know,

1764
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:59,230
conversely also if you have your kid,
I also don't give a fuck about your kid 

1765
01:15:59,230 --> 01:15:59,230
and if I don't have kids,
I just don't,

1766
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,370
I don't think that it to you,
but I'm just saying,

1767
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:03,250
I'm not like [inaudible] you're a 
different amount of caffeine.

1768
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:08,250
Bra is so jacked up.
Why is the women's March excluding pro 

1769
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:08,710
life women?
Well this is the week now.

1770
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:09,340
Wait,
are they get.

1771
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:14,490
Oh,
you should find someone that's saying a 

1772
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:16,060
should do on it.
But once I listen to the bottom line is 

1773
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,230
they go and I have talked a million 
times to people that talk about they go.

1774
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,000
It's either somewhat always emotional,
the person you're talking to and it's a,

1775
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,610
they want to control my body as a woman.
And that's why they're anti abortion.

1776
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:26,050
I'm like,
no,

1777
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:27,400
they think it's baby murder.
No,

1778
01:16:27,401 --> 01:16:29,410
they want to control my.
Then you talked to the other people like

1779
01:16:29,411 --> 01:16:33,610
they want to have an immoral lifestyle 
and Blah like really gets broken down.

1780
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:35,770
Is that one sentence a woman's right to 
choose.

1781
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,070
Like you don't even say to choose what I
keep going.

1782
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:42,040
Like they cut it off because it sounds 
uncomfortable.

1783
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:46,900
It's a woman's a woman's right to choose
to abort a baby.

1784
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,220
Right.
And I think it is.

1785
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,440
That's not my right.
That's pregnant.

1786
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,150
I would decide if I'm fucking avenue I 
couldn't care about.

1787
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,160
I'm like Nah,
I'm going to decide.

1788
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,740
I could only put myself in so much 
choose if that's what I'd watched.

1789
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,830
So that's why I'm for so.
But.

1790
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:02,590
But rovy Wade is a very excellent 
compromised,

1791
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,160
by the way,
it's late term abortion.

1792
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:10,190
See the late term abortion is fucking 
gross and I understand if it's a 

1793
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:10,790
miserable fucking defect,
fine.

1794
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:16,480
But if you look at the numbers and it's 
very hard to get accurate abortion 

1795
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,811
numbers because it's so politicized.
The late term abortions are not as I 

1796
01:17:19,811 --> 01:17:20,360
would have thought because of 
deformities.

1797
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:25,390
It's a lot of times they either didn't 
know they were pregnant or just hit 

1798
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:25,920
like,
it's Kinda shitty bro.

1799
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,930
You can see the wrong man.
But like I said,

1800
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:31,790
if you as a mother could do that that 
late,

1801
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,380
Eh,
maybe you shouldn't raise a kid,

1802
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,680
you know?
Uh,

1803
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,500
but,
but early on,

1804
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,760
I don't think you're murdering anything.
Like,

1805
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:39,050
or if you do it early,
I think,

1806
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:39,550
you know,

1807
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,070
it's a,
it is a slippery conversation though.

1808
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:47,100
And this is what people who are 
ideologically attached to that left wing

1809
01:17:47,741 --> 01:17:52,741
dogma,
they're not willing to have this 

1810
01:17:52,741 --> 01:17:52,750
conversation.
So if you have these pro life women,

1811
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,140
they don't want to have a dialogue like 
their mind is completely,

1812
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:57,450
well,
they better listen.

1813
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:02,480
Here's my other thing is just be 
consistent if you're pro life because 

1814
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:02,480
the Catholic church is at least 
consistent prolife,

1815
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:04,240
they're anti death penalty.
Okay.

1816
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:06,690
They're pro life.
They were against the Iraq war,

1817
01:18:06,691 --> 01:18:07,500
like,
okay,

1818
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,630
go down the last birth control.
Yeah,

1819
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:11,140
because you're supposed to bring more 
light.

1820
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:14,010
So at least you're teaching is 
consistent.

1821
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:15,630
I can't see in these people that are 
like,

1822
01:18:15,631 --> 01:18:17,400
no,
if you want to have your right wing,

1823
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:22,401
no social welfare state,
you're going to have to fucking allow 

1824
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:23,070
abortion because you're gonna have to 
take help.

1825
01:18:23,071 --> 01:18:25,320
Take care of these fucking kids.
Are you willing to do that?

1826
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,210
Some of them are,
but a lot of them are not,

1827
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,790
and by the way,
if we went and blew up Iraq,

1828
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,300
Ms Dot Christians that wanted to do 
this,

1829
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,370
there's Kelvion Christians.
They're okay.

1830
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:37,371
They're like the original fucking 
Christians there have babies at their 

1831
01:18:37,371 --> 01:18:38,280
collateral damage.
You call them and that's,

1832
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:39,570
that's fine.
It happens,

1833
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:45,010
but okay.
What's the difference between that and 

1834
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:47,841
some woman in New York?
The collateral damage of on the way to 

1835
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:47,841
her career,
she doesn't have the baby.

1836
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:51,590
If you accept that OSCE dropping bombs 
on somebodies fucking pregnant wife and 

1837
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,400
killing their unborn baby because it's 
convenient for us.

1838
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:58,550
Thanks.
Shut the fuck up about someone getting 

1839
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,550
an abortion because you're a hypocrite.
Control life down the line.

1840
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,550
Well,
yes,

1841
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:00,600
that's a very good rant and true.
Yeah.

1842
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:02,440
Well I can't go on facebook anymore.
I'll get in trouble.

1843
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:04,180
That's a very good rant.
I mean,

1844
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:07,450
what you're saying is right.
If the people are very convenient,

1845
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,600
it's very inconsistent.
I think you're absolutely right.

1846
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,640
Bitter.
I'm bitter for my religion because I'm 

1847
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:15,640
the sucker that would believe it.
Right?

1848
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,080
It would dawn on me later.
Oh yeah.

1849
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,770
We don't actually do that.
We're just,

1850
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:18,880
you know.
No,

1851
01:19:18,881 --> 01:19:20,560
you can't fudge chip on your shoulder 
because of that.

1852
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:24,190
And you and I have had this conversation
a bunch of times because you'll say,

1853
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:26,260
I know what these people are trying to 
do with their words.

1854
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,250
I remember this shit from when I was 
told the same thing.

1855
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:31,840
I'm a suppressive person,
right?

1856
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,290
Or an apostate.
Joe Is witnesses.

1857
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,550
I'm always in a positive thing.
It should be an ally castle title.

1858
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:38,710
Well,
because dude,

1859
01:19:38,711 --> 01:19:41,400
I get a good title.
Ooh,

1860
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,230
I like it,
dude.

1861
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,520
12 apostates.
I get fucking,

1862
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:46,850
uh,
uh,

1863
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,560
really upset by that group.
Like,

1864
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,740
don't stumble your brother once,
once.

1865
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:52,990
The truth is just saying,
telling the truth.

1866
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:55,450
It's not in the interest of the group to
tell the truth.

1867
01:19:55,451 --> 01:19:58,290
That's really upsetting.
It just really gets under my.

1868
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,300
Well,
it should.

1869
01:19:59,301 --> 01:20:04,301
It's like what we're talking about,
it brings back the same thing as Jordan 

1870
01:20:04,301 --> 01:20:07,540
Peterson thing when they're calling him 
a Nazi and they're calling him a 

1871
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:07,540
transphobic.
I understand.

1872
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,100
He's a professor at the University of 
Toronto.

1873
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:13,100
It's become very famous for battling 
against Social Justice Warrior Ideology 

1874
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:18,530
Online,
specifically them imposing in one of 

1875
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:21,981
their bills and Canada.
The you have to use someone specified 

1876
01:20:21,981 --> 01:20:25,170
gender pronouns and there if you.
If you don't do it,

1877
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,410
it could be thought of as like a human 
rights violation.

1878
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,280
Will they have those human rights 
courts,

1879
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:33,190
the human rights councils up there.
It's subtle counselor.

1880
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:35,970
It's a very different thing.
They don't have freedom of speech.

1881
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:39,150
It's not the same as free speech is kind
of an American thing,

1882
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,500
but what it talked about it.
What would it be?

1883
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:47,550
Pronouns like Faggot,
like if you have to say that because 

1884
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,470
that would also be hate speech.
It's like this weird.

1885
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:54,471
Circle me my word,
so it can't be a pronoun you parents or 

1886
01:20:54,471 --> 01:20:59,300
identity.
There's some control over what the 

1887
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,791
pronouns will be like.
You could probably say you're a storm 

1888
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:01,791
trooper,
right?

1889
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:06,260
You could probably get crazy,
but you probably can't say you're a 

1890
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:06,260
Faggot,
but what if that's your identity,

1891
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:11,211
like who's to say what your identity is?
Your identity cannot be an offensive 

1892
01:21:11,211 --> 01:21:12,030
word it because your identity is lashing
out,

1893
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:16,140
hurting other people.
What if you identify as white CIS male?

1894
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,400
That's it.
I'm a white cisgender gay.

1895
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:23,420
I got no problem.
I'll call you whatever the fuck you 

1896
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:23,420
want.
I got no issue with that.

1897
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:23,760
No issue.
Forced,

1898
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:29,100
forced.
He was saying he was battling against it

1899
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:34,101
very early on and almost everything he 
said would happen is happening now in 

1900
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:36,000
terms of this overreaction culture.
Welcome.

1901
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,050
By the way,
how come that's.

1902
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:43,220
Remember Jamie Kilstein had had a 
capacity of about it that a white boy 

1903
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,420
blues song he did and he goes,
oh,

1904
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,780
I don't know what this means,
and I go,

1905
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:52,160
Jamie,
I know you got to put everything on the 

1906
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:52,160
white males.

1907
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,990
Now that's like the religion,
but do you want us to believe anyone 

1908
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,480
outside of a young white male knows what
the fuck's?

1909
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:56,970
This means like where I used to live in 
Washington heights in New York.

1910
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:59,160
I want you to go out and talk to any of 
Dominicans on the corner and go,

1911
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,900
do you know you're a CIS male?
Right.

1912
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:02,460
And ask her if they know what the fuck 
that means.

1913
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:07,461
They'll stop you.
You have to be a white super recent 

1914
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:07,890
thing.
Plus gender is supposed to adopt it.

1915
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:08,430
Like,
okay,

1916
01:22:08,431 --> 01:22:11,220
I'll tell you what you want,
but why you get to pick my title.

1917
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,410
It's also nonsense words.
It's a Marxist.

1918
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:18,890
Marxism does it alliance and if you 
agree to nonsense,

1919
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:23,850
that's one step closer to dominance.
That's where everyone knows.

1920
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,770
Yeah,
it is really like a religion.

1921
01:22:25,771 --> 01:22:29,160
You're right.
It's a consensus based religion which is

1922
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:30,930
really being Vegan is kosher.

1923
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,570
Is it that people fall into that so easy
because they come to comfortable by.

1924
01:22:36,571 --> 01:22:41,571
Barry told me that I didn't understand 
the level because people fucking hate 

1925
01:22:41,571 --> 01:22:43,140
themselves.
That's why they're online creating these

1926
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:46,830
new identities and shit and if you don't
hate yourself,

1927
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,530
because I.
before I had that,

1928
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,880
that media shitstorm I,
I had,

1929
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:55,970
I had alright guys would fucking try.
They all did different things to try to 

1930
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,690
ruin your life.
Like would be people pose it.

1931
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,240
Alright guys like to be a fake you and 
then go to people you kind of know like 

1932
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:03,570
John Daly,
who I'm like,

1933
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:05,380
I know I'm bound.
No one where like,

1934
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:08,080
and then as you say,
some fucked up shit.

1935
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,910
And then they think like that's the John
Daly,

1936
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:12,130
the golf guy.
Now they'll give you from kroll show.

1937
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,090
He's pretty funny.
Dude.

1938
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:14,710
Actually he's on the uh,
you.

1939
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,200
He always is in shake daily.

1940
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,510
Daily.
You've seen him in shared.

1941
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:19,930
Trust me,
he's got like a square head.

1942
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,050
Okay.
But uh,

1943
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,150
uh,
but fine,

1944
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,550
whatever.
But they will go at him a fake me.

1945
01:23:24,551 --> 01:23:26,080
Oh,
when Patton Oswald's wife died,

1946
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,010
somebody as me sends them a thing with 
his dead wife.

1947
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:34,200
Photoshopping the ghostbusters poster.
Can you say your shitty on?

1948
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,310
Because they all.
The whole thing was you're not.

1949
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,600
You don't know what's funny.
So don't.

1950
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,430
If I tell you,
you know,

1951
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,440
there's that whole joke thief shit.
I'm like,

1952
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,510
listen,
I,

1953
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,950
I was there.
And also I know comedy and I know better

1954
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:47,820
than you jerk off at home.
So if I tell you just know,

1955
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,780
think I know better.
I'll just put it that way.

1956
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:54,810
Maybe that's arrogant,
but I just been doing it for 20 years 

1957
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:54,810
and you never had the balls to get on 
stage.

1958
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:54,810
So I think I just know better.

1959
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:59,460
They're outta here.
You're fighting with someone who's not 

1960
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,210
even here.
I started some jokes.

1961
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:03,220
He fight.
No one has any idea what the fuck you're

1962
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:05,110
saying,
right guys is when I defended amy,

1963
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,500
amy and I had people like lecture and 
I'm like,

1964
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:10,870
don't listen,
don't presume to tell me Shit.

1965
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,640
But.
But they're outraged.

1966
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:17,860
But at the same as the social jihadis,
they all think the same reason I became 

1967
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:17,860
a comic.
I could do that,

1968
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:20,110
but at least I did it.
You know,

1969
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,700
if you get on stage and do it,
I'll give it to you.

1970
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:23,320
But these people think they can do your 
job,

1971
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,180
but hold on a second.
In their defense,

1972
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:30,510
they're looking at a film that shows 
time after time that daddy made 

1973
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,700
specifically fuck her because she said,
I play a racist Republican.

1974
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,070
The little youtube video where they took
movies fuck in the show.

1975
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,690
Which by the way,
she doesn't write the show.

1976
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:45,930
It was ridiculous and it was exactly 
what the fucking sjws did to me where 

1977
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,500
they don't like you.
They think you have an agenda.

1978
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:50,320
They got to destroy.
So they create this fucking,

1979
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,510
uh,
uh,

1980
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:52,360
uh,
you know,

1981
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:53,200
it's like a smear job.

1982
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:58,240
There were bits that were exactly the 
same,

1983
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:01,540
very mediocre bits that thought off,
dude,

1984
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,220
relax,
relax.

1985
01:25:03,221 --> 01:25:05,980
I drank.
I Cave Man Nitros,

1986
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:07,350
and you're talking to me this way.
I do.

1987
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:12,351
I know this,
but you're going to run through the 

1988
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:15,781
wall.
And then there's a crick shaped and 

1989
01:25:15,781 --> 01:25:17,171
print content.
So get a caveman nitrile you're,

1990
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,000
but you're,
you're arguing against someone who's not

1991
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:21,900
even here.
Why they are going at me.

1992
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,390
That's what the problem with what you're
saying is they have evidence.

1993
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:28,600
They're looking at one bit.
That's a good point.

1994
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,810
Where if I look at the evidence and I 
come to a different conclusion,

1995
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:34,060
let's go with my conclusion because I 
was there.

1996
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:38,710
A process guy.
That's not enough.

1997
01:25:38,711 --> 01:25:40,750
That's not enough.
That's not enough to convince someone,

1998
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:41,700
oh,
just trust me.

1999
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:46,060
You think of authoritative sheriff type 
Shit.

2000
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:46,810
Just trust me.

2001
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:53,080
I'm not going to them.
They're coming to me,

2002
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:57,100
trust me,
I'm watching this video,

2003
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,770
I'm watching these jokes.
They're being repeated.

2004
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,550
You're saying,
just trust me.

2005
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:02,310
Chokes.
You taught.

2006
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,580
I'm talking about sketches piece get 
claimed were taken,

2007
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:06,320
which is nonsense.
I was in the room.

2008
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,760
I left the fucking cop of the room with 
that shit.

2009
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:11,470
That doesn't mean that you know and 
watch mad TV and stop.

2010
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:14,600
That doesn't mean anything because the 
bits still got on the air.

2011
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:17,100
So you what I'm saying like you might 
not have been happening.

2012
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,220
It doesn't matter.
That's what you have to say.

2013
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:20,540
That's not what you say.
Say that.

2014
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:20,770
No,
no,

2015
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:20,970
no,
no,

2016
01:26:20,971 --> 01:26:21,230
no,
no.

2017
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,500
But that's not a job you can't,
but you can't say that.

2018
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:29,210
These people don't have actual examples 
of the same bits over and over again.

2019
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:31,670
If they're parallel thinking,
that's fine,

2020
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,530
but it has to be related.

2021
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,130
But you didn't really see this,
this whole thing about this.

2022
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,730
I'm very confused,
very confused.

2023
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,210
The whole thing from the top down.
Look,

2024
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,340
I don't give a shit about it.
By the way,

2025
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,790
if they see the evidence,
right?

2026
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,720
You have to like,
you have to be real clean,

2027
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
real confrontational when you're,
when you're handling something like 

2028
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,000
that.
I won't.

2029
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,490
First of all,
number one,

2030
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,610
the larger issue is I'd never should be 
on social media talking to any of these.

2031
01:26:58,611 --> 01:27:03,611
Fucks it all explaining it.
I don't owe any of you anybody 

2032
01:27:03,611 --> 01:27:04,280
listening.
If you have a question or a judgment,

2033
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,510
I don't owe you an explanation for shit.
I understand.

2034
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,570
I know where the fuck you got the idea 
that I do so I was wrong.

2035
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,060
I even fucking at any answer at all 
because you have people.

2036
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:16,250
Hey joke thief.
Really?

2037
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:19,610
That's the word about me that I'm a joke
thief from some no,

2038
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:21,320
nothing and they just want to see.

2039
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:26,320
I'll talk back to them to these animals 
that you did steal it and you got to 

2040
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:31,010
explain how this was parallel.
Thank you to be many times I did.

2041
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,140
I know,
but a lot of people haven't heard it and

2042
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,770
you're blurting it out like that.
Someone's arguing you in the room.

2043
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:39,860
I'm just pro rape.
First of all,

2044
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,480
you guys.
Here's one thing I want to be clear.

2045
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:45,130
I am probate,
a rape apologist.

2046
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,200
I'm.
I'm pro rape,

2047
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:49,970
rape and apologize for one thing.
I know Duke.

2048
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,530
Yeah.
I'm only bringing it up.

2049
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:52,410
Why?
Why?

2050
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:57,430
I was getting shit.
Getting Shit for defending amy from 

2051
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,430
these.
Right.

2052
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:58,400
I understand.
But it's also because you're confronting

2053
01:27:58,401 --> 01:27:59,360
them.
Like you're.

2054
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,950
You're confrontational.
Yeah.

2055
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,960
I liked.
I like being online and also it seemed 

2056
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,390
like of no consequence to me.
I'm like,

2057
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,360
I got all this other shit going on.
I can put one your hand sit here and hit

2058
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:12,050
to your dumb shit.

2059
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,880
I was like cocky.
I understand.

2060
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:19,210
I understand.
But what I'm saying is from the 

2061
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:19,210
perspective of someone who's a standup 
fan,

2062
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,620
my hand is trembling from the Matrix.
That's crazy.

2063
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,520
It's got some serious shit.
What the fuck is in this 270 milligrams?

2064
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:30,521
Caffeine?
You probably had some coffee earlier to 

2065
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:33,640
see you do twitter like me where you 
think it's almost like the candy crush 

2066
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,540
of words and then before you know what I
just pissed off uber or some shit.

2067
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,060
Listen,
I'm speaking as a cave.

2068
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:43,180
A nitrile caveman to you.
You're saying though is like a person 

2069
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:45,770
who's a fan of comedy and I am a fan of 
comedy.

2070
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:51,130
When I see like if I.
If I was never a standup and I saw this 

2071
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:53,060
all going down and I was a Kurt Metzger 
Fan,

2072
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:57,310
I would want Kurt Metzger to explain to 
me what happened.

2073
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,210
I would want you,
your,

2074
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,010
your specific words on this because you 
were

2075
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,800
a writer over there,
so like as a fan,

2076
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:09,801
I would want to know.
I think Kurt Metzger is a hilarious 

2077
01:29:09,801 --> 01:29:09,801
creative comedian.
I want to know how this happened.

2078
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,520
For you to say it defensively,
to brush it off and say that you know 

2079
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:20,430
better than to tell you why?
Because the way someone would come at me

2080
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:24,410
immediately like who we have,
why are you speaking to me this way?

2081
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:27,060
So defensive.
You already defensive.

2082
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,580
As soon as I have somebody coming at me 
a certain way,

2083
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,910
like just your natural mode course.
Naturally,

2084
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:38,030
dude,
I found out that that's one reason why 

2085
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:39,381
people think I'm a psycho is because 
I'll react to that and no one else sees 

2086
01:29:39,381 --> 01:29:39,381
that guy.
Yeah.

2087
01:29:39,381 --> 01:29:43,550
They don't got a psycho from reading 
your twitter isn't enough to do is read 

2088
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:47,520
your tweets will hold on cause I got way
off track of what I'm trying to get to,

2089
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:49,530
but just what you said,
that girl.

2090
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:50,910
So,
so what I'm saying,

2091
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:52,020
hey go,
maybe go to the cops and,

2092
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:54,900
and don't on facebook announced to a 
rape verdict.

2093
01:29:55,660 --> 01:30:00,660
I had this.
I'm not gonna even say her name because 

2094
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:00,660
he's people benefit.
Every time I fuck mentioned them.

2095
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,310
Just go right to this idiotic blog at 
night we have a back and forth.

2096
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,400
I mock the stupid language of her 
stupid.

2097
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:09,390
She said asking for any details of what 
happened is like reshaping the victim.

2098
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,040
Just belief.
And I go,

2099
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:13,400
so I go,
that's like I said the word rape hole in

2100
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:16,140
a post mocking her language.
Okay.

2101
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:21,680
She deletes her comments,
takes what I wrote and goes to these 

2102
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,920
chicks that say they're like,
look what he said about you.

2103
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:27,780
Nobody cares what anyone is saying to 
you.

2104
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:32,990
You're the person that they've heard of.
So they only care what you say and 

2105
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:32,990
there's no context.
They just go.

2106
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:35,730
He said rape whole.
Go ask somebody what I did that's wrong,

2107
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,310
but they won't be able to tell you and 
they'll go,

2108
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:41,250
well that he said something.
Re poll is that's all they have.

2109
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:46,450
Is that proven?
Do you have screenshots of the original 

2110
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:46,860
tweets?
A?

2111
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,710
No,
because then people complained.

2112
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,590
Not only could I not because I don't 
delete anything that I put up.

2113
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,170
Markers were moved.
All of that.

2114
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:58,680
Facebook has removed all that because 
the people I am offended so I can't even

2115
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:00,690
go back and show any of the facebook 
took it down.

2116
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,840
Oh Wow.
But even if she didn't take fucking shit

2117
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:04,890
off,
it doesn't matter.

2118
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:06,810
Like nobody's reading her shit.
They don't give a fuck.

2119
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,250
Which he's saying.
They're like,

2120
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:13,280
oh,
the writer for Amy Schumer show is 

2121
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,531
saying,
and that's what all these people can't 

2122
01:31:15,531 --> 01:31:17,601
believe.
It's so easy to access you and fucking 

2123
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:21,321
have.
You get a reaction to them and they're 

2124
01:31:21,321 --> 01:31:21,321
amazed.
They can't believe it.

2125
01:31:21,321 --> 01:31:24,920
They're like,
I can talk to the fucking me and the TV 

2126
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,760
and they've built an industry around it,
so if you speak to them at all,

2127
01:31:26,761 --> 01:31:28,980
you're a sucker dude.
If you have any emotion about this,

2128
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:29,720
you're.
I mean,

2129
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:31,860
you're a fucking soccer.
Don't just don't get suckered.

2130
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,750
That's all I'm saying.
Same thing happened to me with that,

2131
01:31:33,751 --> 01:31:38,751
the Black Panther stuff,
because I was just doing the reverse of 

2132
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:38,880
any marketing to Black Panther,
Black Panther,

2133
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,530
Black Panther.
I was like,

2134
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:43,170
finally I'm movie with black people for 
black people,

2135
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:46,080
so I was just like,
no white people in it pass.

2136
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:51,110
Who do I relate to that really?
Because I know what you're talking 

2137
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,110
about.
Oh,

2138
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,190
that was like the whole thing.
And then a couple of people like Jeffrey

2139
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:54,780
Wright,
the actor and Don Cheadle,

2140
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:57,990
they start reacting like I was serious 
and I started being like,

2141
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,500
this is sad.
Tired,

2142
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:00,100
man.
I'm just

2143
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,410
doing black mirror.
She guilt.

2144
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:04,180
Did you feel like a little cool that you
got don cheadle?

2145
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:06,880
Jeffrey,
did he say to you,

2146
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,470
who's like,
how do you think it feels to me?

2147
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:09,130
I'm like,
Dude,

2148
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,030
how do you think it feels?
What?

2149
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:11,350
Finish the sentence.
Sorry Matt.

2150
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,960
I'm a little jacked up to his energy.
Got Me really good.

2151
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:18,340
How would you feel watching,
you know,

2152
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:21,910
growing up as a black man and watching I
only white movies and I was like,

2153
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,640
dude,
I had Michael Jordan on my wall.

2154
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,370
I love Karl Malone and Kung Fu movies by
way.

2155
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,320
Still got a point.
You still got a point.

2156
01:32:29,321 --> 01:32:31,720
I mean,
the problem is that he didn't take it as

2157
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:36,721
satire,
but he's right to.

2158
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:41,020
The problem is you weren't,
you weren't being serious.

2159
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:45,280
You were cracking a joke about how 
people are reacting to this movie.

2160
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,560
I love it because they're black and it's
black dude.

2161
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,400
I'm at the worst level of being known 
where like I have reached,

2162
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:53,890
but I'm not famous enough for people.
Like he's a comedian.

2163
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,620
No.
You brought that up when I got fucked.

2164
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,540
It's like not famous enough to be like,
fine.

2165
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:04,140
Famous enough to get fucked over.
Like I'm big enough where someone wants 

2166
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,140
to hunt me,
but like,

2167
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,810
no one's like,
oh,

2168
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:05,830
oh,
one bedroom in the comedian.

2169
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,160
Some of them are like,
oh,

2170
01:33:07,161 --> 01:33:09,250
we must work for a college hr 
departments.

2171
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:11,020
By the way,
did you see the Black Panther?

2172
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:12,850
No,
no,

2173
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:15,310
it's good.
It's pretty fucking good though.

2174
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,620
Annihilation.
I want to see that.

2175
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:18,160
Yeah,
dude,

2176
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:19,900
that's a trip.
You don't spoil it,

2177
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:20,440
but it's.
I won't.

2178
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:24,740
But from that [inaudible] guy,
the guy made a watch that if,

2179
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,070
if this was such a racially uplifting 
movie,

2180
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:28,360
first of all,
his name,

2181
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:31,160
his first name wouldn't be black.
The Black Panther.

2182
01:33:31,161 --> 01:33:32,950
That wouldn't be in the Black Panther 
forever.

2183
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:37,951
Yes.
It's like a fucking exploitation saying 

2184
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:39,780
shaft is like Selma.
Like when do you think they came up with

2185
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,340
a Black Panther?
16.

2186
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,860
By the way,
panthers are black already.

2187
01:33:44,861 --> 01:33:47,140
You don't need to specify that unless 
you're letting me know.

2188
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:48,760
The guy under the suit is black.
Well,

2189
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:50,740
you know what it actually is.
It's a Jaguar.

2190
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:55,950
It's the Jaguar that has spots 
everywhere instead of just some spots 

2191
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:58,870
because Jaguars some Jack.
They're not really totally black,

2192
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:00,670
like a black panthers kind of.
It's.

2193
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,800
It's not like scientific drama.
You can't find a black jacket for they.

2194
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:15,661
If you see the black ones,
you could still see like some faint 

2195
01:34:15,661 --> 01:34:17,710
outlines of like those Jaguar little 
dots and circles.

2196
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:22,770
It's kind of funny.
I like David attenborough does almost 

2197
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:22,770
make it seem like black panthers are 
more hostile.

2198
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,570
They were like the black panthers 
stocking is pray.

2199
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:26,710
Well,
the snow leopard is as elusive as he is.

2200
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,800
Grateful they're all jaguars.
Is there?

2201
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:34,860
Yeah.
I think the black ones probably evolved 

2202
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,981
to be more successful hunting at night 
because you can't see a god damn thing 

2203
01:34:37,981 --> 01:34:40,300
at night in the jungle.
You don't know what black is,

2204
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,610
I would imagine until the jungle.
No,

2205
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:47,611
but I've been to the Pacific northwest.
I'm into those essentially rain forest 

2206
01:34:47,611 --> 01:34:52,441
up there,
like there's some parts of the Pacific 

2207
01:34:52,441 --> 01:34:52,441
northwest that are insane at night too.
Right?

2208
01:34:52,441 --> 01:34:55,100
Like you can't believe how dark it gets 
because you don't see shit.

2209
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,190
It's dark in at noon.

2210
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:00,320
When you go through the woods,
it's dark.

2211
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,170
Like you won't get a Tan.
It could be fucking new.

2212
01:35:03,171 --> 01:35:06,860
Now it can be 85 degrees out and it's 
dark walking through those woods because

2213
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:10,220
this canopy of leaves and super dense 
tree growth,

2214
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:12,890
like it's dark.
It's fucking night.

2215
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:15,650
You must just hear these crazy noises.
Oh yeah man.

2216
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:20,710
Like elk sound intense.
They're intense and you just hear the 

2217
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:25,091
sound like a dude.
Where's my point about it being dark 

2218
01:35:25,091 --> 01:35:25,091
there?
I told about the Black Panther,

2219
01:35:25,091 --> 01:35:27,740
Black Panther,
the ones most likely in the jungle.

2220
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:31,100
It's the same situation and the ones 
that have the darkest or the less likely

2221
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:36,101
to be seen and less likely or more 
likely to be successful because there 

2222
01:35:36,101 --> 01:35:38,390
attack ambush predators.
They sneak up on things and Jack,

2223
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:40,790
um,
what else do they do to deer and fucking

2224
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:45,791
people to that spirit is what the king 
of Wakanda has come into to become the 

2225
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:45,860
Black Panther.

2226
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:48,470
I thought it was technology.
That's actually pretty cool.

2227
01:35:48,471 --> 01:35:53,471
The suit is,
I think the coolest part of the movie 

2228
01:35:53,471 --> 01:35:53,570
because it builds your forcing hit you 
back like the dope.

2229
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,930
But then his other part of his power is 
they have this,

2230
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,830
this giant they make from flowers and he
lays down and they,

2231
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,670
I swear to God,
they give him a purple drink.

2232
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:04,130
He drinks a purple drink.
Oh Jesus.

2233
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:05,810
That's where he gets his other powers.
Oh,

2234
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:10,811
Jesus Christ.
Guys watching this ad from the comic 

2235
01:36:10,811 --> 01:36:10,811
book to the Purple Drink.
I'm like,

2236
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:15,950
when they make this,
are they even because they're making it 

2237
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:15,950
like,
you know,

2238
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:19,611
it's like guest star fucking Maya 
Angelou was giving them the purple 

2239
01:36:19,611 --> 01:36:19,820
drink,
Jewish guys.

2240
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:23,530
As long as no whites were involved.
It was an exploitation comic.

2241
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:28,540
It's two Jewish guys from the seventies,
like that's when it came out to put it 

2242
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:28,540
out.

2243
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,080
Like finally,
you know,

2244
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,430
let's get the origins of the Black 
Panther Comic Luke Cage.

2245
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,340
That was already out and that was a 
fucking awesome.

2246
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:39,860
I think that is superman.
If they were like,

2247
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:42,470
what would a ghetto superman.
Almost like the old joke,

2248
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:44,120
but it's fucking great.
I do.

2249
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:46,760
Luke cage was cage gets to fuck.
Jessica Jones.

2250
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:47,750
He.
Yeah.

2251
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,760
Yeah.
Little interracial romance going on up 

2252
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,391
in that Netflix.
He has to super fucker because they're 

2253
01:36:55,391 --> 01:36:55,590
both super fucking each other.
They're both reconstituted.

2254
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:56,570
Grind,
your pelvic.

2255
01:36:56,571 --> 01:36:58,700
The dust.
He's fighting gentrification.

2256
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:04,410
Well,
she sees him beat the fuck out of some 

2257
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:04,640
dudes in a bar and realizes that he's 
one of them and that she's been.

2258
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:07,640
She's a mutant and he's a mutant.
They get together in Buton Saxon.

2259
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:10,250
Fucked up the bed.
Spoiler alert,

2260
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,990
alert.
He can lay pipe awakened.

2261
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:21,010
Looks like a guy who could lay pipe the 
pipe.

2262
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:25,820
If you look at them,
you go,

2263
01:37:25,821 --> 01:37:28,010
I bet that guy.
That guy's was sex scenes.

2264
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:31,210
Was there a rumor that they really were 
having sex on camera work?

2265
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,760
It was a big one in that movie.
Angel Heart.

2266
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:35,570
It's never been true time that natural 
at all.

2267
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:36,930
Angel Hearts.
Never true.

2268
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:39,470
I think if Donald Sutherland in that 
killer midget movie,

2269
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,700
they say Mickey Work Really a bank.
Kim bessinger and nine and a half weeks,

2270
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,340
but he did.
He,

2271
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,400
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

2272
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,620
I like to believe like,
I mean you're so anti religion.

2273
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,100
You don't even want to believe rumors.

2274
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:02,700
I'm not buying it is witness.
Let me tell you this.

2275
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,030
It's like that.
And I stopped at a crack.

2276
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:09,200
My back was fine.
My first,

2277
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:14,210
by the way,
my first joke ever similar to that 

2278
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:17,120
really,
but I was like when I was 11 and my 

2279
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:23,550
block and Uncle Charlie,
they used to rape me everyday and he 

2280
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:23,570
would go,
if you ever tell anybody what I did too,

2281
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,270
I'm going to kill your parents.
And I told everybody as your first joke,

2282
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,450
I told everybody he never killed.
My parents are,

2283
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:35,460
you know,
don't we have to deal now?

2284
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:42,800
All black audiences do not enjoy that 
joke at all for the fucking weird 

2285
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,900
looking for a white guy.
Did Not enter laughing at that.

2286
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,640
They little different.
Yeah.

2287
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,130
Yeah.
But,

2288
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:51,450
uh,
I will say best thing,

2289
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:54,000
don't we started out in those rules 
because there was a crowd.

2290
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:55,980
It wasn't other comics that were waiting
to get on.

2291
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,660
Right?
It was a fucking audience.

2292
01:38:58,180 --> 01:38:58,980
And uh,
it,

2293
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,870
it Kinda,
you couldn't be precious.

2294
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:01,980
Yeah.
The fucking perform,

2295
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:07,010
you know,
like you couldn't be one of these like 

2296
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:07,010
hanging in the back pocket.
Oh Dude,

2297
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:07,010
you can't.
No,

2298
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,390
you gotta perform you gotta paint.
Yeah.

2299
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:14,420
And so,
and you didn't have to fucking talk 

2300
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:16,341
black.
We just be very confident in your own 

2301
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:16,341
whatever.
And crowd will go with it,

2302
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:16,760
you know?
Yeah.

2303
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,390
Just speak funny.
Just be funny.

2304
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,910
There was a big can bring a notebook.
They see it as weakness.

2305
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,340
They're like fucking notebook.
I see it as weakness.

2306
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:25,180
Did do your homework.
Yeah.

2307
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,430
But there's some rooms where they're 
like,

2308
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,930
oh,
that means it's like brand new.

2309
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,320
His writing,
he's working on shit today.

2310
01:39:31,321 --> 01:39:36,321
The worst is when someone pretends 
they're reading their notes and they do 

2311
01:39:36,321 --> 01:39:38,070
the same bits over and over again.
Like you can't.

2312
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:43,310
You just pretended.
You just looked in that book and the 

2313
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:43,860
name for now.
What else?

2314
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:45,360
This one.
What else?

2315
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,780
What else?
What else does that?

2316
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,550
I'm like,
I could do your act.

2317
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:56,090
Well,
it's just like people in the audience 

2318
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:56,090
like,
Hey,

2319
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:56,090
don't don't do that.
You know,

2320
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:56,090
Jay,
right.

2321
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:56,580
Big J.
sure.

2322
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,760
Were these people called them comics,
but I a comedy pause when they're not 

2323
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:09,831
really saying like spinning the wheels.
Trying to get some traction.

2324
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:16,250
Yeah.
There's some new thing that I think 

2325
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,681
people have mistaken laughter for 
support or like a pr or do you stitch 

2326
01:40:18,681 --> 01:40:19,860
you say that to me,
they mistake it for applause.

2327
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:22,170
W they've confused laughter and 
applause.

2328
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:25,320
You know,
it's an ideology versus like laughter's.

2329
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:27,600
When someone relates applause is when 
someone agrees.

2330
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,900
Well there's too many people that are 
trying for applause.

2331
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,370
Right.
My point is like the.

2332
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,270
You're supposed,
this is only supposed to be funny,

2333
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,600
like when you're just trying to like say
a bunch of Shit and memorize it and say 

2334
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,860
it real fast and then to get a big 
applause at the end.

2335
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,480
Like that's.
Do you remember?

2336
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:42,820
Like,
dude,

2337
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:45,810
I'm not trying to change policy.
I'm starting to laugh,

2338
01:40:45,811 --> 01:40:47,790
but I was a kid.
I remember like Eddie Murphy,

2339
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:53,440
Eddie Murphy is the biggest county in 
the world and it's funny when it in the 

2340
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,400
eighties,
I remember watching stand up.

2341
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:59,430
It seemed more integrated or something 
like in the eighties and I swear to God 

2342
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:03,340
like when the evening at the Improv in a
comic strip live or on tv on like Friday

2343
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:08,341
night or that's what I used to watch 
stand up comedy when I was like 11 or 

2344
01:41:08,341 --> 01:41:08,560
12.
And then the nine like death.

2345
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,260
I remember when def jam came out and I 
remember it was like,

2346
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,290
and also racially a lot of shit seemed 
more segregated and it was like,

2347
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:17,110
I think the beginning of just marketing 
to specific,

2348
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,430
uh,
you know what I mean?

2349
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:19,900
Like oh here's an all black show.

2350
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:24,900
And,
and these had jokes on Seinfeld about 

2351
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,211
it,
like Seinfeld's market was being eaten 

2352
01:41:27,211 --> 01:41:29,341
away with def jam.
His mother sang it to him and I didn't 

2353
01:41:29,341 --> 01:41:29,380
think of that,
but that was the beginning.

2354
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,440
So now it's like everybody just 
specifically,

2355
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,930
you know,
I like to hell.

2356
01:41:33,931 --> 01:41:36,640
It was like kind of grab bag.
When I'd watch standup it would be like,

2357
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:39,580
you'd see like a Ventriloquist,
you'd see like,

2358
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,300
you know,
Eddie,

2359
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:43,990
Eddie Murphy kind of person and like 
some fucking real dry person.

2360
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,770
There'd be like La and it was more mixed
on its own.

2361
01:41:47,771 --> 01:41:48,820
And I,
you know,

2362
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:50,410
well,
I'll tell you the solution,

2363
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,880
I think we should do some of those,
like a Rodney dangerfield type specials 

2364
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:58,080
I called Rodney would do a special on 
thinking of also.

2365
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:01,010
But that dude,
we should do it also.

2366
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,180
A lot of us,
uh,

2367
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:03,760
you know,
if you're going to put out a special,

2368
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:08,790
it takes you a couple of fucking years 
or a year solid to have the material 

2369
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:10,180
locked down,
rock and roll.

2370
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:13,120
But if you're going to do 15 minutes,
I think you're a minimum by the way.

2371
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,920
Sometimes that's not enough.
I agree.

2372
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:15,260
Great.
Nice.

2373
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:20,400
I agree.
I've been doing a year and a half in 

2374
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:20,400
between specials and I think that's the 
right amount of time.

2375
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:26,590
I've got a nice juicy now two and six 
months that either,

2376
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:30,870
because that's shit gets hammered down 
like a Samurai warrior with Louis on his

2377
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,880
website and the fucking point is like if
there's more of those 15 minutes sets,

2378
01:42:39,311 --> 01:42:41,800
like you could come up with a 15 minute 
set and a couple of months.

2379
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:42,760
Right.
You know,

2380
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:45,040
you really could,
it would be locked in.

2381
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:45,880
Right?
Right.

2382
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:48,580
And so if you were,
if you were doing something like that,

2383
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:53,850
you could do that,
like get a prepared set over like three 

2384
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:54,730
or four months and have,
hey,

2385
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:56,200
you know,
we're going to be filming,

2386
01:42:56,380 --> 01:43:01,380
we'll film some of them here,
we'll film some of them like three 

2387
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:01,380
months later.

2388
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:01,910
So you'll know you'll have it all locked
in.

2389
01:43:01,911 --> 01:43:05,260
You'll know when to go do that with a 
white precious.

2390
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:10,261
I couldn't,
I didn't have a booking agent for the 

2391
01:43:10,261 --> 01:43:11,821
road.
I switched managers and I was like we 

2392
01:43:11,821 --> 01:43:12,280
can't take him until he fucking does,
uh,

2393
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:13,600
does the hour.
But I'm like,

2394
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:18,601
I need to work the hour out,
so I had to do it in 15 minute chunks 

2395
01:43:18,601 --> 01:43:19,540
around the city and just do a lot of 
city spots.

2396
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:20,890
Oh Wow.
Which is,

2397
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:26,340
I'm happy with how it came out,
but I mean it was so fucking nerve 

2398
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:26,590
wracking because I'm like,
I know I'm not preparing this properly.

2399
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:26,890
Right,
right,

2400
01:43:26,891 --> 01:43:31,891
right.
Because I have to do these 15 minute 

2401
01:43:31,891 --> 01:43:32,560
chunks of the material.
The really why didn't you catch yourself

2402
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:37,561
on the road?
And like small cloud had been writing a 

2403
01:43:37,561 --> 01:43:37,561
lot and I just like,
like I said,

2404
01:43:37,561 --> 01:43:39,400
I switched managers and I didn't have an
agent,

2405
01:43:39,401 --> 01:43:42,610
a book and I don't know how easy it was 
to book you at this point.

2406
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,130
Once I,
once I have all these people were like,

2407
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:45,620
well,
you know,

2408
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:48,820
I'd banished to Kramer island.
I couldn't get them to do shit for me.

2409
01:43:48,821 --> 01:43:51,010
I found out it's actually very easy to 
go book.

2410
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:51,860
Like

2411
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,720
people actually wanted to book me 
everyday.

2412
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,320
It turns out not everybody is in this 
dipshit Colt.

2413
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:01,640
Uh,
the way it seems when you like online a 

2414
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:01,640
lot.
Well,

2415
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:05,111
I just think if you can clearly explain 
yourself and you can feel like,

2416
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:07,640
well,
I didn't realize you don't get to see.

2417
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:08,960
I used to go,
yeah,

2418
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:13,961
they could do it without you.
They don't need you present to fucking 

2419
01:44:13,961 --> 01:44:13,961
you up is whatever.
I thought,

2420
01:44:13,961 --> 01:44:14,480
oh.
Then they will go.

2421
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:15,470
Kurt,
what did you say?

2422
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:17,090
They don't.
They don't even bother with that,

2423
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:19,250
but they don't care.
A lot of people just want to burn.

2424
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:24,270
You just saw your media is based on this
conflict now and the patrice used to 

2425
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:24,710
say,
I like,

2426
01:44:24,711 --> 01:44:29,711
they always need us to be at war,
so they need men versus women in white 

2427
01:44:29,711 --> 01:44:33,161
for.
They always need that going all the 

2428
01:44:33,161 --> 01:44:33,161
time.

2429
01:44:33,161 --> 01:44:35,740
What district are you talking about?
People that sell that piece of shit.

2430
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:39,070
Did you watch that documentary about 
Gallcher and Hulk Hogan?

2431
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:39,800
No,
I did not.

2432
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,240
Oh my God,
it's on Netflix.

2433
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:44,270
If you got to see it because it's 
amazing.

2434
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:49,430
It.
It's very heavily skewed to make you 

2435
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,580
feel bad for Gawker,
but it doesn't.

2436
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,500
It actually makes you go,
are you shitting me?

2437
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:52,370
Gawker,
like,

2438
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,350
feel bad for cosby.
It's like,

2439
01:44:54,351 --> 01:44:59,351
dude,
you can't tell me that I feel bad for 

2440
01:44:59,351 --> 01:45:01,121
fucking body think it's designed to make
you feel because they're like so whole 

2441
01:45:01,121 --> 01:45:06,031
cogan basically because Gawker,
this is how the news media like that 

2442
01:45:06,031 --> 01:45:06,830
despicable shit they did to Louis and 
the New York Times,

2443
01:45:06,831 --> 01:45:11,831
which shouldn't.
The New York Times is now fat girl's 

2444
01:45:11,831 --> 01:45:11,831
diary basically like they never 
should've been allowed.

2445
01:45:11,831 --> 01:45:13,430
My girlfriend made that up.
I didn't make that.

2446
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:15,580
That's very funny.
And he said Damn Shit.

2447
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:17,510
And he's very funny,
but that's what it is.

2448
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,900
And nonsense.
I mean like if you read the article,

2449
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:22,810
there's no crime.
People just make up what?

2450
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:27,890
Like what did Louis Do?
I used to ask like when that should 

2451
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:27,890
happen to him,
I go,

2452
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:28,670
what's it Louis do wrong?
And they go,

2453
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,940
well one time at work my boss grabbed my
tit.

2454
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:32,600
I have my actual friend says to me,
I'm like,

2455
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:35,930
I'm sorry I asked you what Louie did.
It's not about that.

2456
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:39,230
We're going to use him as a fucking 
symbol because what did he do wrong?

2457
01:45:39,231 --> 01:45:44,231
Ask for consent for non in like what are
you talking about?

2458
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:47,600
Like why would that have to come out and
why would that be anybody's business?

2459
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:50,690
It's to make him look like he's a 
Weinstein for comedy.

2460
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,160
Like Harvey Weinstein.
Right?

2461
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:53,120
And by the way,
Harvey Weinstein,

2462
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:55,400
that's the old casting couch,
which I'm like,

2463
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:56,420
good,
get rid of that shit.

2464
01:45:56,780 --> 01:46:01,100
But they tried to paint Louis up a stand
up comic as if he's a producer director.

2465
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:04,340
Like it is a conflict of interest.
If you have a producer come to my room,

2466
01:46:04,341 --> 01:46:04,880
they're like,
hey,

2467
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:08,870
but another comedian at a festival,
it's reasonable.

2468
01:46:08,871 --> 01:46:11,150
Thank you.
Might be fucking because you're not on a

2469
01:46:11,151 --> 01:46:12,500
different.
The power level.

2470
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:17,501
We're comedians.
We don't work for a corporation 

2471
01:46:17,501 --> 01:46:17,501
together.
Okay,

2472
01:46:17,501 --> 01:46:18,360
we're an independent company and make 
companies can fuck with each other.

2473
01:46:18,361 --> 01:46:23,361
But also that what it was is just a 
weird thing that he liked to do and what

2474
01:46:23,541 --> 01:46:26,170
they made it out to be is like a sexual 
look.

2475
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:29,990
Like he's fucking a Predator and there 
was no such anything.

2476
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:32,330
He doesn't never surprised.
People jerk.

2477
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:34,250
And now I'm going off what Louis told 
me.

2478
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:36,460
By the way,
I believe lily,

2479
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,030
by the way.
Oh my God.

2480
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:40,700
You're supposed to believe women.
There's a whole new thing.

2481
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:42,790
What kind of an imbecile me to.
I mean,

2482
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:47,890
first of all,
there's no woman on this earth who is 

2483
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:48,230
stupid enough to just believe women like
women know way better.

2484
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:51,150
So I'm just imbecile.
People are always like,

2485
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:56,180
oh,
I just that you're a woman is not 

2486
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,881
evident exhibit a,
but you do have to admit it's kind of 

2487
01:46:58,881 --> 01:46:59,530
weird to just do like an impromptu whack
off sash.

2488
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,420
Yeah,
it was.

2489
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:04,920
It is weird unless you're talking about 
sex shit back and forth like Weinstein,

2490
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:06,360
but it's.
You start whacking.

2491
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:09,150
You told me.
That's a point that you told me.

2492
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,890
Tell the lies of omission.
First of all,

2493
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:11,790
just,
well,

2494
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:16,810
I'll just go with the article because I 
don't know what trouble I'll get in 

2495
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:16,810
anybody's name,
but just read.

2496
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:18,060
Listen,
just read the fucking article.

2497
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:23,120
Okay.
There's nowhere where it says there in 

2498
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:23,120
Houston.
He says,

2499
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:23,400
Hey,
will you watch me masturbate?

2500
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,750
Somebody said,
no,

2501
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,690
you didn't masturbate.
They went and said something reported or

2502
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:28,500
whatever.
Supposedly,

2503
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:33,501
and by the way,
the story of that that I know more 

2504
01:47:33,501 --> 01:47:33,501
about,
it's despicable how they frame that.

2505
01:47:33,501 --> 01:47:37,790
The guitar comic thing,
absolutely despicable how they frame 

2506
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:37,790
that.

2507
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:42,240
Anybody read the article?
Nobody did.

2508
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:44,030
Right?
Nobody reads the read.

2509
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:48,210
I read it.
He literally did nothing.

2510
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:50,760
If you read John,
nevermind what I would know personally,

2511
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:53,160
just read the article.
Nobody bothered to.

2512
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,650
So all this nonsense that everybody put 
out of him.

2513
01:47:55,651 --> 01:47:57,660
Surprised whacking off.
That's not even in there.

2514
01:47:57,661 --> 01:47:58,920
Okay.
Like,

2515
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:04,010
like it's the first one is the guitar 
duo that people thought were Garfunkel 

2516
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:06,360
and oates because all these young kids 
can't imagine anything happening before.

2517
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,870
Who took guitar?
Duo that Louis supposedly jerked dot.

2518
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:13,940
You don't remember this now.
That's why a lot of shit hard duo that 

2519
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:15,790
really jerked off in front of the New 
York Times was like,

2520
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:17,970
dude,
I saw like some of the headlines and saw

2521
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:20,470
some people commenting it online.
That's okay.

2522
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,250
What do you just let me ask,
what do you guys think Louie did that he

2523
01:48:23,251 --> 01:48:23,750
got in trouble for?

2524
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:24,690
I'm just,
I'm just curious.

2525
01:48:24,691 --> 01:48:27,480
Someone to master if he could masturbate
in front of him and then did it.

2526
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:28,960
They said yes and he did it.
That's it.

2527
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:34,800
Essentially asked it to people who said 
no and they felt very uncomfortable and 

2528
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:34,800
they had to work with them.
Right.

2529
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,080
That is the sexual harassment aspect of 
it.

2530
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,270
That's the difference.
Like if you're on a TV set,

2531
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,890
right?
That's the only one that I went.

2532
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:41,730
I'd read and went,
wow,

2533
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,950
that's crazy.
But you were telling me something.

2534
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:46,500
Yeah.
I don't know what I'm not going to.

2535
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:50,860
He could say what he wants to explain 
what I'm not gonna Take Shit.

2536
01:48:50,861 --> 01:48:51,890
That's what he told me.
No,

2537
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:56,250
no need no need to.
But I'll just add to the story.

2538
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:56,980
Yeah.
And,

2539
01:48:56,981 --> 01:48:59,340
and,
but there's a flat out agenda here.

2540
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:02,000
Now what's the agenda to ruin a guy who.
Well,

2541
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:04,230
I mean he's Mexican now.
I know it doesn't help his case.

2542
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:10,410
This is like the Taliban,
this shit now.

2543
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:15,440
Like they have to.
I bet he's a fucking Buddhist statue 

2544
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:15,840
that has to be exploded.
Do you understand?

2545
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:18,240
We now have to take all these unfunny 
people.

2546
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:21,540
Okay.
That for political reasons and you can't

2547
01:49:21,541 --> 01:49:26,541
have evidence.
So if someone being funny that fits in 

2548
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:26,541
the wrong group,
there's no styling.

2549
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:32,080
Kill his fucking leg.
See is like every band that ever 

2550
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:32,310
achieved anything,
they got to remove it.

2551
01:49:32,311 --> 01:49:35,430
So we're gonna throw Louis away.
Louis Ck.

2552
01:49:35,431 --> 01:49:38,190
We gonna throw him away with Harvey 
Weinstein.

2553
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,730
I'm sending you right now.
Jamie.

2554
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,560
You got to put the shit up.
You're going to cry.

2555
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:45,810
Yeah,
no,

2556
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:47,650
you're right.
And in some ways that,

2557
01:49:47,651 --> 01:49:47,970
uh,
there's,

2558
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
there's a Taliban going on,
but if a guy like Harvey Weinstein 

2559
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:53,080
existed,
you know,

2560
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:56,650
there was a real fucking problem for a 
lot of people for sure.

2561
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:58,180
A hundred percent.
In fact,

2562
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:00,910
Hollywood's fucking despicable.
Both things.

2563
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:03,640
What you're saying is true.
And that's true,

2564
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:08,730
but the idea that another comedian,
because back when this happened at 

2565
01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:09,360
Aspen,
it was not a fucking.

2566
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:11,830
He was a comedian who was a few more 
years ahead.

2567
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:14,050
Then these two girls that were also 
comedians.

2568
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,960
I've been at festivals and had sex with 
comedians.

2569
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:21,050
This is outrageous,
but you should have done on the internet

2570
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:26,060
or even industry and shit out of these 
girls attractive and you were attracted 

2571
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,240
to them and you guys had consensual sex.
Is that what you're saying?

2572
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,620
Just rape.
What the fuck did that?

2573
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:32,270
Or as it's known now,
Reagan,

2574
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:36,040
this guy,
88 percent of white wealth is duty,

2575
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:38,260
honor,
and a privilege to get a t shirt on.

2576
01:50:38,410 --> 01:50:41,360
I hope that that's not really his shirt.
I hope someone,

2577
01:50:41,361 --> 01:50:44,750
he thinks he's a fucker and they,
they photoshop that shit out a shirt.

2578
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:48,780
Maybe that's.
Maybe that's fucking despicable it.

2579
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:53,790
Because first of all,
what does that have to do with me at 

2580
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:56,161
all?
Like let's say if I earn something for 

2581
01:50:56,161 --> 01:50:56,161
70 percent,
I'm not in that.

2582
01:50:56,161 --> 01:50:58,330
When you throw those numbers up,
I want to see studies.

2583
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:00,870
I want to see 88 percent.
What would that do?

2584
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,370
Very specific number Geno.
See what do you not notice?

2585
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:06,910
The fucking shit that the white,
white,

2586
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:09,880
young,
white woman led fucking movement.

2587
01:51:09,881 --> 01:51:14,881
The social jihadis,
they're just fighting for the right to 

2588
01:51:14,881 --> 01:51:15,130
do white men what they've always done to
black men,

2589
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:16,780
which is like,
he scared me.

2590
01:51:16,781 --> 01:51:17,710
I want him fired.
Well,

2591
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,920
it's also,
it's scrubbing all the meds,

2592
01:51:19,930 --> 01:51:22,810
so congratulations.
You get to be like an inward now.

2593
01:51:22,870 --> 01:51:27,870
Well,
it's also toxic femininity where it's 

2594
01:51:27,870 --> 01:51:29,791
like the way a lot of women's instincts 
are based around keeping a toddler away 

2595
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:31,540
from Mike light sockets,
so it's like whatever they do,

2596
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:36,541
it's all good.
It's not the field instinct to do that 

2597
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:36,541
too as well.
Hold on,

2598
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:38,590
keep going.
Keep the father away from a life socket.

2599
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:43,850
All right.
Like women are more designed in general 

2600
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:47,641
to take care of very young children and 
men are more like seven onward where 

2601
01:51:47,641 --> 01:51:51,271
it's like if you fall down,
you hurt yourself and you learn your 

2602
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:51,271
lesson.
Now get out there.

2603
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:55,620
Just the design that makes them do that.
How do you mean ergonomically designed 

2604
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:59,580
or how would they know emotionally wired
to do that where it's like women.

2605
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,110
Once my wife first had a baby,
I really was like,

2606
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:03,670
oh,
this is like.

2607
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:05,890
Makes perfect sense.
That's why they have bras.

2608
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:07,400
You feed a baby,
right?

2609
01:52:07,401 --> 01:52:08,980
Exactly.
Yeah.

2610
01:52:08,981 --> 01:52:10,810
Well I don't think that's a.
no,

2611
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:15,890
but that's what I mean though.
It's kind of like a lot of the this sjw 

2612
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:17,500
mentality is that safe space.
Like if there's a group of people,

2613
01:52:17,501 --> 01:52:19,810
there's nothing they could possibly have
done wrong,

2614
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:23,200
but protect at all costs.
Almost maternal.

2615
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:26,290
Exactly.
Maternal.

2616
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:31,291
I mean like this is the thing that makes
me laugh and that's the point I was 

2617
01:52:31,291 --> 01:52:33,871
making.
You want to bother you want to mother 

2618
01:52:33,871 --> 01:52:33,871
society,
but you,

2619
01:52:33,871 --> 01:52:34,880
you killed your babies.
Didn't yet have.

2620
01:52:35,190 --> 01:52:37,410
You shouldn't.
You don't have board us.

2621
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:42,690
They didn't kill their babies.
Like you throw in the ones that got 

2622
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:45,010
abortions in and they're all 
contaminants on the clergy.

2623
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:48,890
On the levy.
Specifically the online feminist clergy,

2624
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:50,330
right?
To have an abortion,

2625
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:55,100
you get in the club,
you have to show you receipt card.

2626
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:57,500
Lena Dunham is the classic because I 
feel bad for her.

2627
01:52:57,501 --> 01:52:59,990
It's like she's like,
I just want to be good in my church.

2628
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:03,890
I'm the guy who worked for me didn't 
commit rape.

2629
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,450
Oh,
I'm sorry he did this.

2630
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:07,220
Communism.
This isn't harmless.

2631
01:53:07,221 --> 01:53:12,221
The body's stack like the number one 
death of the 20th century was your own 

2632
01:53:12,221 --> 01:53:12,520
government.
My own.

2633
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,100
Wait,
wait,

2634
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,010
who you talking to me?
Who's me?

2635
01:53:15,730 --> 01:53:20,210
You people and us like human government 
is 60 million Russians,

2636
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,710
a 60 million Chinese and he got Hitler.
He got like that.

2637
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,570
Are we in of so high?
Are we in Russia?

2638
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,180
What do you mean by that?

2639
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:32,510
When you say your own government 
inclusivity,

2640
01:53:32,511 --> 01:53:37,511
all that stuff,
it all leads to like the way to make a 

2641
01:53:37,511 --> 01:53:37,730
forest equal is with an ax.
That's it.

2642
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,820
And the tallest nail gets hammered down 
like these are all and we're starting to

2643
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:45,821
enter like a upside down world and the 
left or the right wing tyranny is more 

2644
01:53:48,141 --> 01:53:50,300
sexy.
That's why you hear about Hitler because

2645
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:52,460
he's an evil guy,
but at least he had like great boots and

2646
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:55,520
shit.
But like the styling is a bean counter.

2647
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:58,670
That's why he has way bigger death cap.
We never hear about it because he's just

2648
01:53:58,671 --> 01:54:00,170
like,
let them starve.

2649
01:54:00,171 --> 01:54:05,171
We thought stolen.
I always would always read about Stalin 

2650
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:06,580
was he was Kinda like a meathead and 
Lenin was the intellectual install,

2651
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:10,370
like the muscle that kind of crept up,
but he was just like a fucking,

2652
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:11,870
you know,
am I wrong in that?

2653
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:14,360
That's what I know of.
Lenin was a little bit of both.

2654
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:15,740
He was in.
He was an ideologue.

2655
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:18,380
Did you read the Shit of classified 
when?

2656
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:18,830
Uh,
uh,

2657
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,930
from Russia.
That stuff's donald had them working on.

2658
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:25,931
No,
he wanted to make these gorilla human 

2659
01:54:25,931 --> 01:54:27,911
hybrid soldiers.
This is when they couldn't say no to 

2660
01:54:27,911 --> 01:54:28,040
Stalin like the later years where 
whatever he said,

2661
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:28,550
God,
okay,

2662
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:29,960
Stalin.
He goes,

2663
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:32,270
make gorilla soldiers that don't have to
eat very much.

2664
01:54:32,271 --> 01:54:32,810
And then they're like,
well,

2665
01:54:32,811 --> 01:54:34,750
gorilla is actually eat all day.
It might not be,

2666
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:39,950
but don't let the soldiers that don't 
have man,

2667
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:42,440
half gorilla soldiers so that they 
wouldn't have to eat a lot.

2668
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:43,430
I mean,
it's crazy.

2669
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:44,390
This shit.
Well,

2670
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:49,391
if you stop clapping first he killed you
and there's this one time where there's 

2671
01:54:49,391 --> 01:54:50,750
nine straight minutes of everyone 
clapping and like,

2672
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:55,810
because they knew the people knew that 
the first one is stop is going to die 

2673
01:54:55,810 --> 01:54:59,760
and someone finally passed out and they 
killed them yet because that's how far 

2674
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:00,140
compliance goes.

2675
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,660
It's just they keep getting you to 
comply,

2676
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:03,620
comply,
comply.

2677
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:08,621
And that's,
that's a question I want to know about 

2678
01:55:08,621 --> 01:55:08,621
guns and abortion.
It's like what?

2679
01:55:08,621 --> 01:55:10,340
Where's the line?
Because if you can't determine it,

2680
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:15,740
someone's when like you were saying like
when do you think it's okay or not okay 

2681
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:20,951
to have an abortion?
You wait is a good fucking one day 

2682
01:55:20,951 --> 01:55:22,400
before too.
On both sides.

2683
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:24,920
There's an unreasonable argument on both
sides.

2684
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,480
They're not willing to give it up at 
all.

2685
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:27,470
Right?
On both sides.

2686
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:28,340
You know,
it's funny man,

2687
01:55:28,341 --> 01:55:33,341
because like I,
like I said I don't care about all your 

2688
01:55:33,341 --> 01:55:33,341
kids.
However,

2689
01:55:33,341 --> 01:55:34,360
I don't get,
I don't get aggressive opening statement

2690
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,230
but I don't get that.
Having been said,

2691
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:38,360
I don't get why the only thing we can do
is nothing.

2692
01:55:38,361 --> 01:55:39,470
Like they're like,
I'm very sorry.

2693
01:55:39,471 --> 01:55:41,060
There's absolutely nothing that can help
them.

2694
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:44,100
But if you're a gun,
a gun lover or just

2695
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:49,100
shoot her or know anything about guns 
and someone says air 15 and they don't 

2696
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:52,250
realize that a 10 is the same gun except
with bigger bullets or an sks or are 

2697
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:56,751
that automatic guns are already illegal 
and they want to like band something 

2698
01:55:56,751 --> 01:56:01,221
they don't understand.
Like there is no such thing as an 

2699
01:56:01,221 --> 01:56:01,260
assault rifle.
That doesn't make any sense.

2700
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,830
You,
you call it an assault rifle.

2701
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:07,830
You noise with your mouth.
Who Cares?

2702
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,900
We'll do.
The point is there's guns that didn't 

2703
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:12,900
shoot a bunch of people really easy 
with.

2704
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:16,610
You have ar 50.
They know what's going on.

2705
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:21,890
Is it guns killing people like all this 
other stuff is nonsense and people get 

2706
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:22,250
lost up in the minutia of it.
Like you know,

2707
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,590
they don't know the names.
What's a bump stock do,

2708
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:29,600
do you think?
Like I was in South Dakota not long ago 

2709
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:29,600
and the dude I was hanging out with like
a doomsday prepper.

2710
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:34,371
Right?
He's a guy that worked at a club but 

2711
01:56:34,371 --> 01:56:34,371
he's like a nice guy.
The same canned peaches.

2712
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:43,060
So corny was like,
don't call me that guy man bro.

2713
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:48,150
How many cans are gonna need?
Thirty years worth.

2714
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:53,490
Shit doesn't go bad bro.
Good pitches are good when they're 

2715
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:54,600
fucking canned peaches.
Like in someone's basement.

2716
01:56:54,601 --> 01:56:58,970
How long has that shit last a while.
Like years does it last year's.

2717
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,170
Yeah.
They're designed for the apocalypse.

2718
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,880
There's like 50 shit.
That's what they'll do.

2719
01:57:02,881 --> 01:57:07,670
They can cause he was doing it.
Not yet.

2720
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,290
I swear to God told me he's not.
He's a Christian,

2721
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:11,680
but he's not a good Christian.
Oh,

2722
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:14,000
so what do you do wrong?
I didn't.

2723
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,220
I didn't pry,
but he.

2724
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:20,300
He's not going.
He's not going up in the first like 

2725
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:20,300
pickup.
Oh,

2726
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:23,841
he'll have to like the thing about the 
Christian says you could always even on 

2727
01:57:23,841 --> 01:57:28,551
the fucking buzzer on the Buzzer,
except Jesus and you're not during.

2728
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:34,850
Not during the great tribulation that he
was planning to live through which the 

2729
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:38,100
stockpiles before it was going to have 
to live through that and then get caught

2730
01:57:38,101 --> 01:57:41,270
up in the second pickup.

2731
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,200
He won't be the disappearing out of his 
clothes guy.

2732
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:48,260
The problem with where both of us live,
you and I is if the shit does hit the 

2733
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:48,820
fan,
we're kind of far,

2734
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:51,510
far too many people,
too many people in Manhattan.

2735
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:53,970
Too many people in here.
It ain't good.

2736
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,000
This is no Bueno.
I did carry that with the winter but.

2737
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:00,870
But yeah,
like a winter look,

2738
01:58:00,871 --> 01:58:05,871
if you don't have laws you're going to 
go out and you could whack 30 fucking 

2739
01:58:05,871 --> 01:58:07,260
deer and stack those fuckers up in your 
garage.

2740
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:09,450
Like there's deer all over the place up 
there.

2741
01:58:09,451 --> 01:58:14,451
You are going to have fresh water 
everywhere with your car and not even 

2742
01:58:14,451 --> 01:58:16,980
wanting to do well.
They,

2743
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,600
some places they allow you to pick that 
deer up and take it home and eat it.

2744
01:58:21,930 --> 01:58:24,720
Like after you hit it with your car they
should for sure.

2745
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:26,400
But the thing is that they were saying 
like,

2746
01:58:26,401 --> 01:58:28,110
what if people are targeting the deer?
Like,

2747
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:31,890
well what could you do?
How much it costs the damage that a deer

2748
01:58:31,891 --> 01:58:34,470
does your fucking car.
Like they destroy your car.

2749
01:58:34,471 --> 01:58:37,380
Thousands of dollars of damage.
Who the fuck is going to do that?

2750
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:40,940
And that's a lot of driving for a deer 
that you could buy a tag for,

2751
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,660
for like 50 bucks and kill with like a 
knife,

2752
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:48,820
like deer in my yard.
Literally just be eating my flowers and 

2753
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:48,940
just look at me like bitch,
you know,

2754
01:58:48,941 --> 01:58:50,530
this is the village.
And I'm like,

2755
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:53,450
dude,
I lived in boulder when you are,

2756
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:56,480
when you get out,
like in the town of Boulder,

2757
01:58:56,510 --> 01:59:01,510
you'll see a fucking giant mule deer 
sitting on the side of the road eating 

2758
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:04,900
big ass book,
giant antlers just sitting there and you

2759
01:59:04,901 --> 01:59:07,390
can get out of the car and go,
motherfucker are you for real?

2760
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,940
And this thing would just be looking at 
you just eating there.

2761
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:12,640
So convinced that no one's going to eat 
them.

2762
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:15,340
They just wander through the city.
It's amazing.

2763
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:17,050
It's fucking amazing.
I just,

2764
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:21,130
I was just in Denver,
boulder is about our outside maybe less,

2765
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:24,730
maybe a little less than an hour.
It's a cool little mountain community.

2766
01:59:24,731 --> 01:59:25,810
Very,
very quiet.

2767
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,570
I love it.
To the best town.

2768
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,500
They just give you an egg a day.
It was hilarious.

2769
01:59:29,501 --> 01:59:34,501
I had not seen like a,
the guy with like the oakleys on top of 

2770
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:35,210
his fucking son.
Like,

2771
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:38,080
like whoa.
The homeless white kids with the dog and

2772
01:59:38,081 --> 01:59:43,081
Shit I haven't seen in awhile.
That is a juicy bag in Denver.

2773
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:49,110
No,
outside was like the mountain I was in 

2774
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:49,110
under the.
So yeah,

2775
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:50,800
one of those around mountain,
like a South Park town.

2776
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:51,400
Yeah,
there's,

2777
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:52,400
that's where evergreen is.

2778
01:59:52,810 --> 01:59:57,810
Evergreen is where they grew up.
Training that Parker grew up in 

2779
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:57,910
evergreen.
Evergreen is fucking amazing.

2780
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:00,440
It's amazing.
Just like outside of Denver,

2781
02:00:00,441 --> 02:00:05,441
like just outside evergreen has a 
population of elk that's 100 strong to 

2782
02:00:05,441 --> 02:00:06,590
walk through the middle of the fucking 
city.

2783
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:08,800
A buddy of mine lives there.
My friend Brian called.

2784
02:00:08,801 --> 02:00:10,390
We put a bunch of videos on his,
uh,

2785
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:15,810
his uh,
instagram is instagram is the gritty 

2786
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:16,110
bowman or it might be gritty bowman.
He's got a podcast called degrees.

2787
02:00:16,130 --> 02:00:18,330
All of those things.
Even like a,

2788
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:20,590
like a horse on the west banks or like a
life worth,

2789
02:00:20,591 --> 02:00:24,040
but like look like a fucking dinosaur to
you if you've been in city long enough,

2790
02:00:24,041 --> 02:00:29,041
you're like,
I can't believe is a giant fucking 

2791
02:00:29,041 --> 02:00:29,041
animal looking at me.
I mean,

2792
02:00:29,041 --> 02:00:29,980
that's a look at that.
That looks prehistoric.

2793
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:31,000
Yeah,
those are elk.

2794
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:33,370
That's great.
I don't know who that gentleman,

2795
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:38,480
his buddies that got one of those,
but he's got some videos on his 

2796
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:39,820
instagram somewhere of his town.

2797
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:42,130
He lives in evergreen,
I believe in,

2798
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:46,390
and these gigantic fucking deer just 
walking through his yard.

2799
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:48,270
Well,
curious.

2800
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:53,780
It's on his facebook.
It says his two loves or bowhunting and 

2801
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:56,890
Barack Obama.
What are the odds this horn size have to

2802
02:00:56,891 --> 02:00:58,570
do with hammer size?
Oh yeah,

2803
02:00:58,571 --> 02:01:00,220
for sure.
Like hammers on them.

2804
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:02,470
The bigger the elk,
the bigger the antlers.

2805
02:01:02,471 --> 02:01:03,880
The older.
If they keep it,

2806
02:01:03,881 --> 02:01:06,430
like she's trying to get rid of it.
She is in her yard.

2807
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:09,190
They just wander into people's yards and
that's a female,

2808
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:13,360
but that's probably a 300 pound animal 
and an animal.

2809
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:13,900
You know what,
man?

2810
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,450
I'm A.
I'm a little because I love shooting,

2811
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:17,680
but I'm.
I'm like,

2812
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:22,770
I think that'd be a little queasy.
I just don't want to clean my like 

2813
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:22,770
that's what I want to.
You get used to it.

2814
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:24,730
It's not even fishing.
I never did.

2815
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,560
It's a different thing.
That fishing.

2816
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:27,790
It's way more intimate.
Yeah.

2817
02:01:27,791 --> 02:01:32,791
Fishing,
like I don't do any remoting into your 

2818
02:01:33,011 --> 02:01:38,011
blooded now.
I don't feel any remorse when I kill a 

2819
02:01:38,011 --> 02:01:38,011
fish.
Hey,

2820
02:01:38,011 --> 02:01:38,011
weird.
By the way,

2821
02:01:38,011 --> 02:01:40,040
the Donner party die in Colorado.
They were.

2822
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:42,290
No,
they were in.

2823
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:44,920
Why wasn't it the Sierra Nevadas?
Is that what they done?

2824
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:47,540
Drove through there on the way back.
He doesn't remember how long it was.

2825
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:48,830
Nevada.
The Donner Party?

2826
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:50,390
Yeah.
How long before you eat a guy?

2827
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:55,630
Me None.
I mean no chance to look.

2828
02:01:56,610 --> 02:01:58,310
What kind of fucking life is this going 
to be?

2829
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,820
Am I hold on,
am I getting the story wrong?

2830
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:04,220
They got trapped in the snow.
It had to eat each other,

2831
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:06,680
meet each other out.
All winter.

2832
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:12,890
Each other's is isn't true.
This is where father and son,

2833
02:02:12,891 --> 02:02:16,250
mother and daughter eating each other,
print it online and it'll be so.

2834
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:21,280
It was a tragedy at any correction of it
will be ignored each other out for 

2835
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:25,351
months.
The entire winter months they just had 

2836
02:02:25,351 --> 02:02:29,501
our standing 69 constant just staring at
each other.

2837
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:31,760
The Bush size back then to eat,
throw.

2838
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:33,000
Oh Man.
Huge.

2839
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:36,340
It's chaos.
There's some dicks.

2840
02:02:36,341 --> 02:02:38,270
It wouldn't make it through that Bush.
Yeah,

2841
02:02:38,271 --> 02:02:41,060
probably a lot of them.
Just like you can have a four or five,

2842
02:02:41,061 --> 02:02:46,061
eight Bush.
Especially like super measuring the 

2843
02:02:46,131 --> 02:02:47,960
butch,
like I got a five inch.

2844
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:54,880
He's at beards,
they have these long ass beards and the 

2845
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,240
longer the beard,
the more desirable that Turkey is.

2846
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:59,370
Balls on their nose.
Is a beard on.

2847
02:02:59,380 --> 02:02:59,590
No,
no,

2848
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:04,600
no.
Down here it grows like a write off of 

2849
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:04,600
like their neck area,
like where the kits,

2850
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:08,850
the chest.
It's this long thing that gets called a 

2851
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:08,850
Turkey beard.
Yeah.

2852
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:09,670
They're like dinosaurs,
cock and balls on.

2853
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:12,800
They got all that stuff,
but I forget what that's called.

2854
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:15,290
It's all fucked up too.
Yeah.

2855
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:20,291
What does that shit.
The red stuff like gristle or when you 

2856
02:03:20,291 --> 02:03:23,150
see a rooster rooster's what did you 
call the fucking red thing?

2857
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:29,700
Never know man.
I have no idea what they call the red 

2858
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:29,700
thing.
I have no reason to know that.

2859
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,510
Yeah,
put Turkeys will fuck you up too.

2860
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:34,070
Fuck you.
They're aggressive in some places.

2861
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:39,510
I got to do a joke about that and it 
sounds like I have this personal issue 

2862
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:40,040
with Turkeys when I play,
because I saw a pbs thing about Turkeys.

2863
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:42,080
They will never be a friend.
A Turkey.

2864
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:43,760
Did you see where the guy lived with 
Turkeys?

2865
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:45,040
No,
he fucking.

2866
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:49,100
My life is a Turkey.
If you can identify as a Turkey,

2867
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:52,190
is that what was going on?
He was with them for when they hatch.

2868
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:54,260
They would follow him around the second 
they hit puberty.

2869
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:57,400
They turn into prehistoric dinosaur.
Vicious fucking.

2870
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:00,440
They're gone.
Except like lizards favorite.

2871
02:04:00,441 --> 02:04:01,820
Stayed with them.
Turkey boy.

2872
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:03,580
His favorite Turkey.
Okay.

2873
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:05,690
Yeah.
And then one day there by a log.

2874
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,840
And this is what to me,
if you should watch this as soon as 

2875
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,881
possible.
I hope I'm not remembering this wrong 

2876
02:04:12,881 --> 02:04:12,881
highlight,
but I swear to God.

2877
02:04:12,881 --> 02:04:16,120
So Turkey boy,
one day just fucking turned on him and 

2878
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:16,120
attack him and went for his eye.
They go for your eyes.

2879
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:18,110
Favorite Turkey.
Turkey boy.

2880
02:04:18,111 --> 02:04:23,111
Who was like,
I thought that was going to be an in 

2881
02:04:23,111 --> 02:04:23,111
Turkey.
Boy wouldn't have no,

2882
02:04:23,111 --> 02:04:24,820
he went for his eyes and a state show 
reenactment with uh,

2883
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:27,470
another like,
it's like an after Turkey.

2884
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:32,060
I don't know how they did it was in the 
union because Turkey is just go for your

2885
02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:33,140
fucking eyes.
Yeah.

2886
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:35,450
You don't need a lot of training and 
they visit Turkey.

2887
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:38,110
But my joke is,
because you know as a live Turkey is

2888
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:40,750
a huge size of Kat Williams and it's 
like,

2889
02:04:41,450 --> 02:04:45,440
and it's like,
and his buddies probably didn't get very

2890
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:50,910
good.
They probably weren't too compassionate 

2891
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:50,910
when they're like,
what?

2892
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:51,060
Why did he turn on me?
Like I shouldn't trust the Turkey.

2893
02:04:51,061 --> 02:04:53,010
And they're like,
fucking Turkey,

2894
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:54,450
man.
Well you think about a chicken.

2895
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:57,250
Chicken's a ruthless.
And then now think about a Turkey.

2896
02:04:57,310 --> 02:05:02,310
Turkey's are giant chickens when they 
haven't been bread and all the trees 

2897
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:05,970
where my grandfather lived in Florida 
before he died,

2898
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:11,330
there was all these feral cats and 
chickens on their property and we feed 

2899
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:11,330
them.
He put this big feeder out.

2900
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:16,070
It was amazing how they formed a little 
society because it will be a kitten or 

2901
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:16,070
cat,
a chicken catcher.

2902
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:18,420
They didn't have any interaction.
They just all came and ate the food.

2903
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:19,590
That's amazing.
Yeah.

2904
02:05:19,591 --> 02:05:21,180
I mean you're watching it.
That's just crazy.

2905
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:23,400
And they were listening to the cast and 
kill the little chickens.

2906
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:25,590
Not even at all.
A little bit crazy.

2907
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:30,750
There's just plenty of food that's super
rare that a feral cat can keep it 

2908
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:34,761
together.
I would have never thought that until I 

2909
02:05:34,761 --> 02:05:34,761
was watching them do it.
It was adorable.

2910
02:05:34,761 --> 02:05:34,761
You don't see the numbers.
Disney movie.

2911
02:05:34,761 --> 02:05:37,680
See the numbers of birds that feral cats
killed in America every year.

2912
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:39,860
It's in the billions.
Do we need them to do it?

2913
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:41,490
No.
I probably,

2914
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,450
you know,
when you think about it,

2915
02:05:42,451 --> 02:05:44,670
we probably do because in Israel they're
like rats.

2916
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:45,090
My,
uh,

2917
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:47,610
my ex Israeli,
she told me they're like cats or not.

2918
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:50,700
Same with Egypt.
I lost a chicken to a coyote last night.

2919
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:53,530
I had to uh,
finish the chicken off with my chickens.

2920
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,680
I had a,
we had a coyote in the yard,

2921
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:57,510
caught it in the yard by the chickens 
were out.

2922
02:05:57,570 --> 02:06:02,570
What do you walked up on the top of the 
chicken coop and jumped over and it 

2923
02:06:02,570 --> 02:06:02,570
chased a couple oven bit.

2924
02:06:02,570 --> 02:06:04,800
One of them was knock,
some feathers loose,

2925
02:06:04,801 --> 02:06:07,020
but one of them it actually got and 
killed.

2926
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:08,550
It's wild.
There's coyotes here.

2927
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,170
Oh Dude,
it's,

2928
02:06:09,171 --> 02:06:12,450
it's a crazy thing to be around man.
To watch that through New York too,

2929
02:06:12,451 --> 02:06:13,680
by the way.
Jump the wash.

2930
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:15,720
The thing jumped to the roof of this 
chicken coop,

2931
02:06:15,721 --> 02:06:20,721
like it was nothing.
I'm talking about a six foot jump and 

2932
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:21,360
it's so elegant.
It's kind of beautiful and watch the way

2933
02:06:21,361 --> 02:06:26,361
they did it.
It was a bummer that had killed a 

2934
02:06:26,361 --> 02:06:28,161
chicken and I had a scare it off and now
we know that they're targeting the 

2935
02:06:28,161 --> 02:06:28,350
chickens because it's happened more than
once.

2936
02:06:28,351 --> 02:06:29,820
Last time it happened was like two years
ago though.

2937
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:34,350
One of them keep coming back to all 10 
wants to coyotes.

2938
02:06:34,450 --> 02:06:36,840
A Fisher cat and a raccoon.
I believe.

2939
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:38,450
So.
You guys were chicken farmers.

2940
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:39,730
Is that understood?

2941
02:06:39,740 --> 02:06:41,610
You get an egg a day per hand?
Yeah.

2942
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,450
No,
not always,

2943
02:06:42,451 --> 02:06:47,451
but close in the winter.
Want to get all the exit one's price,

2944
02:06:48,490 --> 02:06:50,820
bro.
Dude,

2945
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,470
we could have 20 eggs right now if I cut
this.

2946
02:06:52,471 --> 02:06:53,790
Come on.
Fuck this chicken.

2947
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:56,400
Yeah.
I don't feel bad about killing chickens.

2948
02:06:56,401 --> 02:06:58,010
It's like don't kill him.
But uh,

2949
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:00,150
their pets to me,
I don't eat them.

2950
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:04,420
That's the kind of smart aren't the 
roosters around.

2951
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:07,140
Like I got videos of them follow me 
around because I give him treats.

2952
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:12,200
So I walk around the backyard and it's 
like I'm the fucking Pied Piper of 

2953
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,080
chickens.
Like it's kind of hilarious.

2954
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:18,390
Do you have any of me carrying my 
daughter's bunny walk in and all these 

2955
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:22,191
chicks are follow me.
I'm like a mini beastmaster like away 

2956
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:25,790
games.
Tell how bad is how smell.

2957
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:30,960
Bravo channel you feed them.
Especially when I give them these little

2958
02:07:30,961 --> 02:07:33,260
worm treats.
There's these dried mealworms.

2959
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:36,110
They fucking love these things.
They go crazy for them so I can.

2960
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,960
That's how I get them back into their 
chicken coop.

2961
02:07:37,961 --> 02:07:42,961
They were pretty big chicken coop,
but when they wanted or the yard and I 

2962
02:07:42,961 --> 02:07:42,961
want to get them back.
I take their,

2963
02:07:42,961 --> 02:07:43,730
their worms and shake them.
Chow.

2964
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:48,860
They come running to me and then I give 
him a little treat every time so that 

2965
02:07:48,860 --> 02:07:49,630
they know that every time I shaky,
shaky,

2966
02:07:49,631 --> 02:07:50,800
shaky.
It's time for a treat.

2967
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:53,230
And they all there so carnivorous.
They,

2968
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:58,150
you've never seen as something attack 
worms with the kind of passion and vigor

2969
02:07:58,151 --> 02:07:58,890
that the chicken suit?

2970
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:00,230
No,
I'd say I've seen it.

2971
02:08:00,231 --> 02:08:01,830
It's terrifying.
They'll eat chicken.

2972
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:04,280
You see?
Um,

2973
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,960
uh,
a shit.

2974
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:12,170
Oh,
fighting roosters and I went to Hawaii 

2975
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:14,931
by the way,
roosters are way different than hence 

2976
02:08:14,931 --> 02:08:14,931
no,
no rape the shit out of anybody.

2977
02:08:14,931 --> 02:08:16,420
And they also just,
I mean,

2978
02:08:16,430 --> 02:08:18,150
they're fucking crazy about to say same 
thing.

2979
02:08:18,151 --> 02:08:18,480
I'm like,
Oh,

2980
02:08:18,481 --> 02:08:23,481
you have a different point than me in 
Hawaii there had been a hurricane and 

2981
02:08:23,481 --> 02:08:23,820
like these people had chickens like 
that,

2982
02:08:23,821 --> 02:08:25,290
that it got it.
So on the street corners,

2983
02:08:25,291 --> 02:08:27,150
it made me laugh.
It would look like a pimp.

2984
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:32,510
It'd be like one rooster and then like a
bunch of hens behind him and he would 

2985
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:34,130
just go around the corner and he was a 
wild chasing Hawaii every quarter.

2986
02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:35,720
Just see roosters.
Wow.

2987
02:08:35,790 --> 02:08:37,120
Wild chicken.
But uh,

2988
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:39,630
I keep forgetting why you brought this 
up.

2989
02:08:39,710 --> 02:08:42,990
Maybe because I've been in Hawaii.
Yeah,

2990
02:08:42,991 --> 02:08:45,570
well rapey roosters,
bird the fight,

2991
02:08:46,490 --> 02:08:48,520
right?
Because you know,

2992
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:51,510
it's like when they go to rescue the 
fighting roosters,

2993
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:56,660
I didn't know they just killed them 
because that's all they want to do is 

2994
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:56,660
fight.
So they just fucking,

2995
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:58,220
if they bust one of those rings up,
they just put the route,

2996
02:08:58,410 --> 02:09:00,390
like just let him fucking fight.
If that's what they're into,

2997
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:01,830
you know,
it doesn't seem.

2998
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,600
They get them adopted or something.
They just fucking place.

2999
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:10,870
They were bred for it.
There's championship bloodline's like 

3000
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:10,910
there's a reason why these things do it.
What does this say?

3001
02:09:10,970 --> 02:09:13,850
If that's what Jesus did and I would say
let them do it,

3002
02:09:13,851 --> 02:09:18,080
but it's showing us wild chickens in 
Walmart in one of these fucking shopping

3003
02:09:18,081 --> 02:09:21,680
cart return bar things and they're 
covered with chickens.

3004
02:09:21,681 --> 02:09:23,780
This is crazy.
Why he hadn't quite.

3005
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:25,310
That's nuts,
man.

3006
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:28,460
There's wild chickens now.
What's the word on killing those?

3007
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:30,840
Can you.
If you want some chicken soup and you'll

3008
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:35,870
have a lot of money,
are you allowed to just whack one of 

3009
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:35,870
those?
I hope so.

3010
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:35,870
Look,
look at all of them.

3011
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:36,710
That's crazy.
They don't have any predators.

3012
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:39,380
See,
Hawaii is a really bananas place when it

3013
02:09:39,381 --> 02:09:40,220
comes to wildlife

3014
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:44,720
because they used to have these burdens 
called noni birds and they were.

3015
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:49,780
They were so docile people.
The native just picked them up and 

3016
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:52,371
crack.
I mean like Dodo birds are like that 

3017
02:09:52,371 --> 02:09:52,371
when exchanges datum extinct because 
these birds had no fear.

3018
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:55,920
Right?
That's interesting over there.

3019
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:56,590
But they didn't bring

3020
02:09:56,690 --> 02:10:01,690
predators for it,
so they have like these wild pigs and 

3021
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:01,690
just running around everywhere.
They have to hunt them down.

3022
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:03,420
Pigs are very.
Because we're on pigs,

3023
02:10:03,421 --> 02:10:05,770
like in South America,
that was not,

3024
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:10,800
not just disease,
but the case was brought pigs that 

3025
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:11,810
fucked up the crops.
The native fucks.

3026
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:13,130
Everything up.
Pigs turn.

3027
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:15,040
You must watch all that pig shit.
Right?

3028
02:10:15,041 --> 02:10:19,900
They turned wild and get tusks.
Inheriting what Jamie pulled up here,

3029
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:25,270
last major contributor to the key 
chicken population is always a shocker 

3030
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:25,700
even to people who have lived here all 
their lives.

3031
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:29,990
[inaudible] wild jungle fowl is 
protected under state law.

3032
02:10:29,991 --> 02:10:34,991
Like all birds of Hawaii.
The Moa is protected as an important of 

3033
02:10:34,991 --> 02:10:34,991
nature.

3034
02:10:34,991 --> 02:10:39,790
Oh God.
That's a terrible idea because that 

3035
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:39,790
means nothing's going to eat them.
So if nothing's going to eat them,

3036
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:42,220
they don't have any predators.
That means to get disease.

3037
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:43,760
Not.
Yeah,

3038
02:10:43,770 --> 02:10:46,310
you can have abortions up until 40 weeks
out there too,

3039
02:10:46,311 --> 02:10:49,520
but you can't touch the chickens if you 
have food for them.

3040
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:54,550
They're just going to keep breeding the.
The real question is do you have food 

3041
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:54,620
for them?
Because if there's just a law of nature,

3042
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:59,640
if there's no predators,
their population is going to match the 

3043
02:10:59,640 --> 02:10:59,640
food supply.
Oh yeah.

3044
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:04,140
Was awesome.
Did you go secret beach that no one's 

3045
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:04,140
supposed to know about,
but it's on every map.

3046
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:05,450
Not even gas stations do that.
Oh,

3047
02:11:05,451 --> 02:11:06,320
wait a minute.
Which ones?

3048
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:07,640
No,
I've never been to Hawaii.

3049
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:09,250
I've been to a waa.
Waa.

3050
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:11,660
Who is Hawaii?
Hawaii.

3051
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:15,910
Hawaii is where Lulu I went and did that
in Nepali coast tour that,

3052
02:11:16,110 --> 02:11:18,230
that uh,
Marin told me that it,

3053
02:11:18,231 --> 02:11:19,190
but he took a helicopter.

3054
02:11:19,190 --> 02:11:21,590
But I stand up in Hawaii.
No,

3055
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:25,960
my cousin got married.
She looks impossible to deny.

3056
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,030
It's really like a rich kid that like 
drops out.

3057
02:11:29,031 --> 02:11:30,260
You threw it in Hawaii.
Like,

3058
02:11:30,650 --> 02:11:35,650
let's see,
you're from here and you're some rich 

3059
02:11:35,650 --> 02:11:35,650
kid or like sort of Williamsburg or 
whatever.

3060
02:11:35,650 --> 02:11:35,990
That's Hawaii because you got to be 
rich.

3061
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:37,580
The houses,
I guess,

3062
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:39,470
uh,
it's expensive because the upkeep,

3063
02:11:39,471 --> 02:11:41,840
because the houses degrades.
The white people live in.

3064
02:11:41,841 --> 02:11:43,580
There are a lot of cultural 
appropriation.

3065
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:46,910
Yeah.
South Park had a funny thing about it.

3066
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:49,160
But look,
if you go there,

3067
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:51,050
you rent a house,
don't go to a resort,

3068
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:54,550
but also like the natives and it is the 
only place I ever go wrong.

3069
02:11:54,551 --> 02:11:55,640
I'm like,
you know,

3070
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:58,190
I feel like a white guilt like Alaska.
I was like,

3071
02:11:58,191 --> 02:12:00,110
there's no way this was better before we
got here.

3072
02:12:01,010 --> 02:12:02,450
Why I felt like,
Oh,

3073
02:12:02,451 --> 02:12:03,440
I hope you didn't fuck this up.

3074
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:04,120
You know,
because it's,

3075
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:05,480
I mean,
I couldn't believe it was.

3076
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:07,850
I found out later because drove a 
witness.

3077
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,790
Publications have like these paradise,
you know,

3078
02:12:10,791 --> 02:12:12,620
would you like to live in a place like 
this?

3079
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:18,370
And uh,
I found out later they were based on in 

3080
02:12:18,370 --> 02:12:20,231
Hawaii where I went because I got there 
at night and so I didn't know what it 

3081
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:24,101
looked like.
And I woke up the morning and it looked 

3082
02:12:24,101 --> 02:12:24,101
like the shit that I was told after 
Armageddon,

3083
02:12:24,101 --> 02:12:25,160
God will never.
So I'm like,

3084
02:12:25,161 --> 02:12:30,161
what?
It looked like fucking jurassic park is 

3085
02:12:30,161 --> 02:12:30,161
crazy.
Like these birds flying.

3086
02:12:30,161 --> 02:12:30,440
And we were like on a cliff.
It was crazy.

3087
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:32,030
Dude.
It's so pretty.

3088
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:37,520
Our falls are a helicopter through it.
It's fucking insanity.

3089
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:39,410
Tell you something.
Five days is plenty.

3090
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:41,690
I was doing this.
I'm like,

3091
02:12:41,691 --> 02:12:43,040
listen,
I have plans in life.

3092
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:44,690
Like if she was dead,
it'll come live here.

3093
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:47,120
There's no.
But that's where you go if you like,

3094
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:49,220
I'm going to drop out of society.
There's no technology.

3095
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:53,270
I used to live in key west playing piano
for tips when I literally was like,

3096
02:12:53,271 --> 02:12:54,790
I got.
It was like the island is.

3097
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:55,930
No,
you know,

3098
02:12:55,960 --> 02:13:00,960
I'm like,
if I don't even know this hotel 

3099
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:00,960
California for me baby.
Yeah,

3100
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:01,490
right.
It's like 23 just playing piano for tips

3101
02:13:01,491 --> 02:13:04,280
and it was just everything was going.
So it was the same deal every day,

3102
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:05,630
ladies.
No,

3103
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:07,610
no.
Cigarette breath.

3104
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:11,990
I'm here to escape my life.
Forty two years old.

3105
02:13:11,991 --> 02:13:13,580
Still Kinda hot.
It was too humid.

3106
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:16,610
It was a lot of movement.
But that's true,

3107
02:13:16,611 --> 02:13:19,220
right?
Hangs in real good.

3108
02:13:19,221 --> 02:13:20,840
You see a lot of really hot 50 year 
olds.

3109
02:13:21,470 --> 02:13:22,400
That's true.
Florida,

3110
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:26,520
I don't know why.
Yeah,

3111
02:13:26,521 --> 02:13:28,340
you got to moisturize moisture.
Yeah.

3112
02:13:28,341 --> 02:13:30,900
Cause dryness does fuck up your scamming
you.

3113
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:34,980
It seemed different to like less house.
Like where I live is so dry.

3114
02:13:34,981 --> 02:13:38,700
Like I'm 21 years old right now.
I made you can really fast.

3115
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:41,580
Why is it's one of those places where 
you're like,

3116
02:13:41,581 --> 02:13:43,470
wow,
how is this America?

3117
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:46,530
We flew five hours across the ocean to 
get here.

3118
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:48,090
This is America,
right?

3119
02:13:50,930 --> 02:13:52,710
I think if you just.
If I had lived there,

3120
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:57,860
it would eventually become a kind of 
beautiful hell am I only joy would be 

3121
02:13:57,860 --> 02:13:59,010
showing visitors around and crystal 
meth.

3122
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:04,280
What if.
Which would if somebody offered you a 

3123
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:07,500
residency at the four seasons in Maui 
and it was serious cash,

3124
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:12,530
what does that mean?
Kurt Metzger doing standup every 

3125
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:12,530
weekend?
People come down there.

3126
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:13,080
I don't know.
Let's do a three year contract.

3127
02:14:13,081 --> 02:14:13,800
Kurt,
what do you think?

3128
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:15,810
Three years.
Okay.

3129
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:20,870
Yeah.
You would do like basically what 

3130
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:22,410
[inaudible] does some serious gender.
You get three years for three years.

3131
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:24,660
I think that's more palatable than a job
at snl.

3132
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:29,820
Comedy's tough in Hawaii though because 
there's no pain.

3133
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:31,560
Dude.
I said the same thing.

3134
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,310
In fact,
I don't know if you know Russman,

3135
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:35,000
eve?
No.

3136
02:14:35,150 --> 02:14:36,100
Okay.
He's a funny kind of way,

3137
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:37,400
but he.
I know the name.

3138
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:44,270
I got myself on laid at this wedding.
It was like my cousin who is about to 

3139
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:45,880
get married,
picture and put,

3140
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:51,180
but you the.
They had a joke about dolphins blow 

3141
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:51,180
hole.
He goes,

3142
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:51,180
yeah.
He goes,

3143
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:52,140
don't fuck.
He goes,

3144
02:14:52,141 --> 02:14:54,080
I'm guys,
don't fuck them in that hole.

3145
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:57,750
But if you do,
hold on,

3146
02:14:59,610 --> 02:15:03,460
you got a 69 to this girl had her.
I mean it was like,

3147
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,430
it was already touching my shoulder and 
shit.

3148
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:08,010
Well,
and I said that at her hand,

3149
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:11,910
shot off it because I didn't know they 
have to worship dolphins is a god there.

3150
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:13,760
There is.
It's like a.

3151
02:15:13,761 --> 02:15:14,800
it's like it tells jokes.

3152
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:16,030
Funny Joke.
They came,

3153
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,620
they got mad,
she got mad because it's like,

3154
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:25,810
it's like the ultimate.
If you're a girl that makes her own 

3155
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:28,161
jewelry,
best could let you know with colorful 

3156
02:15:28,161 --> 02:15:28,800
seashells.
So you've got these seashells,

3157
02:15:29,370 --> 02:15:34,370
that aura gemstone.
They're like these rainbow shells that 

3158
02:15:34,370 --> 02:15:35,880
they're the only show you can insure.
Lloyd's of London,

3159
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:37,540
which island was young.
Hawaii.

3160
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,200
But there I brought,
I got my girl,

3161
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:41,880
my ex at the time I got brody some 
necklace.

3162
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:43,420
I mean,
you know,

3163
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:45,660
I brought back all this coffee,
you spend all this money,

3164
02:15:45,661 --> 02:15:50,661
they're like,
you come back and let this shit you 

3165
02:15:50,661 --> 02:15:51,980
can't wear in society.
This is some fucking handbags.

3166
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:57,040
Like what the fuck is what?
It's also,

3167
02:15:57,740 --> 02:16:02,740
there's a terrible thing if you're 
trapped on an island with a bunch of 

3168
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:06,021
lamers,
like they could try to get you to be 

3169
02:16:06,021 --> 02:16:08,511
lame.
Like if you've got a bunch of boring 

3170
02:16:08,511 --> 02:16:10,581
people and you're stuck thinking that 
show last bar.

3171
02:16:11,641 --> 02:16:15,090
It's all about locals and the locals are
cool,

3172
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:17,310
right?
If you get lucky and get a bunch of cool

3173
02:16:17,311 --> 02:16:18,510
locals,
that must be awesome.

3174
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:23,240
But if your locals are all dip shits,
you gotTa Fund,

3175
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:26,520
there's a bunch of local celebrities 
were like,

3176
02:16:26,521 --> 02:16:30,040
usually it's a fat guy that could sing.
He's

3177
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:34,900
real cocky and like that's your Hawaiian
guy,

3178
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:40,200
but it's like they know I'm going,
guy comes in and does all these covers 

3179
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:40,810
are like four non blondes.
Like,

3180
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,830
Hey Jesus.
I say,

3181
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:45,630
Hey,
can I sing that?

3182
02:16:45,690 --> 02:16:46,710
And I'm like,
Hey,

3183
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:47,740
hey,
good job man.

3184
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:48,710
I was like,
okay.

3185
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:49,720
I like,
you know,

3186
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:52,970
I'm just being nice to him that you're 
dumb cover act like,

3187
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:55,000
you know,
this years ago I remember,

3188
02:16:55,030 --> 02:17:00,030
Oh my God,
it's coffee for guy's going to die at 

3189
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:03,181
50.
You're pretty cocky if you're being 

3190
02:17:03,181 --> 02:17:05,071
really negative about this guy,
they're all either in the most 

3191
02:17:05,071 --> 02:17:05,071
beautifully.
The engineer's from premier atheists,

3192
02:17:05,071 --> 02:17:08,290
right?
Or 800 pounds with the Samoan,

3193
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:13,680
the engineer per this incredible.
Because my inlaws are a great 

3194
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:17,790
description of like the perfect body.
No,

3195
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:22,900
just dudes are fucking like,
because you know Joe was witnesses in 

3196
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:23,690
women's do.
It does very well in Ireland.

3197
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:26,590
Places with Pacific islander,
his job,

3198
02:17:26,591 --> 02:17:31,591
his witnesses and Mormons do very well.
That's why Brigham Young University has 

3199
02:17:31,591 --> 02:17:33,530
ways big Samoan and fucking backwards.
Yeah.

3200
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:35,730
And they have big family,
big families naturally.

3201
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:38,260
So it just lends itself to there,
you know.

3202
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:43,650
And uh,
that's my favorite call even though the 

3203
02:17:43,650 --> 02:17:45,811
one of the most preposterous ones in 
terms of like what their background 

3204
02:17:45,811 --> 02:17:49,531
origin story is.
When you find out about Joseph Smith 

3205
02:17:49,531 --> 02:17:52,291
being 14 and 18,
20 and he writes about golden tablets 

3206
02:17:52,291 --> 02:17:55,951
that contained the last work of Jesus.
And only you could read him because he 

3207
02:17:55,951 --> 02:17:58,621
had a seer stone.
I like that because it's such a great be

3208
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:02,320
the first person to say this,
but the only reason you're like,

3209
02:18:02,321 --> 02:18:04,450
fuck that.
It's because it's like two recently,

3210
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:08,020
well not a few years to it.
No one could debate it.

3211
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:10,900
Well sword up,
but a 14 year old.

3212
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:11,710
He was 14.

3213
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:13,690
Oh,
I didn't know that.

3214
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:15,880
When I think of Biggie and Tupac,
I'm like,

3215
02:18:15,881 --> 02:18:17,950
they like 23.
They were kids.

3216
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:23,340
Well all 14 year olds are full of Shit.
They're practicing what they can get 

3217
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:23,340
away with.
They make mistakes,

3218
02:18:24,610 --> 02:18:29,610
but he's like high level full of Shit.
Well he wasn't just high level full of 

3219
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:31,030
Shit.
He was probably like a compulsive liar.

3220
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:35,200
Probably pathological.
And it was ultimately a con man.

3221
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:40,260
I mean that's what he became.
He was the people usually you don't 

3222
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:40,260
realize these comments like how did they
do?

3223
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:43,630
It's like people are so complicit in 
that and there's people addicted to that

3224
02:18:43,631 --> 02:18:48,631
bullshit being conned.
And they will ben Franklin quote write 

3225
02:18:48,631 --> 02:18:52,621
about like quacks.
Patients are the biggest liars or some 

3226
02:18:52,621 --> 02:18:55,141
shit like they.
It's such a bizarre drug dealer 

3227
02:18:55,141 --> 02:18:56,020
situation.
The con man and Connie,

3228
02:18:56,021 --> 02:18:58,510
a lot of times there's this drug 
thereafter,

3229
02:18:58,511 --> 02:19:03,511
and I know I know people like 
compulsively have to be conned or sold 

3230
02:19:03,511 --> 02:19:06,010
or leased with psychics and people who 
love psychics.

3231
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:11,700
They will convince themselves.
They'll convince themselves that this 

3232
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:14,200
person has some secret information about
them and they were so dad.

3233
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:17,500
Mike Epps has a great job.
Mike epps has never faded,

3234
02:19:17,501 --> 02:19:19,300
underrated,
or the silver suit.

3235
02:19:19,301 --> 02:19:20,630
He's gone on and I haven't seen it.
No,

3236
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:22,720
that's why the best hours.
He's a funny dude.

3237
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:27,110
That dude that makes me actually.
Yeah,

3238
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:28,100
it's one

3239
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:29,360
of the.
Say the name again,

3240
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:32,380
like underrated.
Never faded or some shit.

3241
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:36,220
He's in Detroit,
but I'm like old ladies.

3242
02:19:36,221 --> 02:19:37,740
I'm like,
uh,

3243
02:19:37,741 --> 02:19:42,741
uh.
Let me pass the collection plate around 

3244
02:19:42,741 --> 02:19:44,520
too many times old ladies break breakout
of catching the spirit like they're 

3245
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:44,520
like,
they already done.

3246
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:46,440
Sent that paid three times.
Now that's bullshit.

3247
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:48,700
I got to see.
I can't do it,

3248
02:19:48,701 --> 02:19:52,840
but he was always talking about like,
these are old ladies that go to church.

3249
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:58,200
I know that old lady,
like if they go to church and they want 

3250
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:59,860
to pay money to the Jesus man and,
but even they know what this is a little

3251
02:19:59,861 --> 02:20:00,520
bit,
you know,

3252
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:04,090
the guy's not doing his end of conning 
them the right way.

3253
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:06,160
They.
They're not completely helpless.

3254
02:20:06,161 --> 02:20:06,780
They like,
oh,

3255
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:10,320
this is a bullshit.
They want that Marjoe that documentaries

3256
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:15,340
about that.
That guy that Steve Martin made his a 

3257
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:16,630
preacher,
a leap of faith is based on that and the

3258
02:20:16,631 --> 02:20:20,620
dude who doesn't believe in God and he's
making his move based on Mick Jagger and

3259
02:20:20,621 --> 02:20:22,080
he's like,
they want them to hit note.

3260
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:27,090
He's getting resentful because they 
wanted to be a hack and he wants to try 

3261
02:20:27,090 --> 02:20:28,570
out new stuff and they don't know.
That's how I took it.

3262
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,830
If you watch,
it's very interesting.

3263
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:32,410
I'm fascinated by TV preachers.

3264
02:20:32,850 --> 02:20:33,450
Oh yeah,
man.

3265
02:20:33,451 --> 02:20:35,460
I think they're amazing.
I mean,

3266
02:20:35,461 --> 02:20:37,710
some of them are so blatantly 
ridiculous.

3267
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:39,660
Did you ever see the ones that were put 
together?

3268
02:20:39,661 --> 02:20:44,661
The Jim Baker,
who was the dude who made a bunch of 

3269
02:20:44,661 --> 02:20:47,940
ducks friend,
makes a bunch of really funny videos 

3270
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:48,930
with Jim Baker using all of that 
survival stuff.

3271
02:20:49,050 --> 02:20:54,050
He had just had incredible edits of real
moments with Jim Breaker talking about 

3272
02:20:54,271 --> 02:20:59,271
his survival food and like how you can 
use the buckets of survival food as like

3273
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:06,320
a bottom of a table.
So you eat there and you lift it up and 

3274
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:09,501
the survival food,
that's where you store it is survival 

3275
02:21:09,501 --> 02:21:09,501
cit.
That is,

3276
02:21:09,501 --> 02:21:10,590
you have people sitting on it like it 
makes a good chair.

3277
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:16,230
You're sitting on a chair fill with 
survival sales video.

3278
02:21:16,231 --> 02:21:17,970
This video,
there's this guy put together.

3279
02:21:17,971 --> 02:21:22,971
It's fucking hilarious because it's all 
like some of the most ridiculous things 

3280
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:24,660
that he says spliced together because 
they kind of run out by.

3281
02:21:24,661 --> 02:21:25,620
Um,
yeah,

3282
02:21:25,621 --> 02:21:27,000
because of Jessica Hahn.

3283
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:27,480
Well,
no,

3284
02:21:27,481 --> 02:21:28,350
I know,
but he goes,

3285
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:29,880
set up.
It was a power grab.

3286
02:21:30,450 --> 02:21:33,490
Maybe it's in the eyes of Tammy Faye.
That documentary because they were,

3287
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:38,520
they were con artists that also got 
conned by that fucking guy who was from 

3288
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:39,770
the faith coalition or something.
It's a,

3289
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:42,420
I lived down south that will not live in
Statesville,

3290
02:21:42,421 --> 02:21:44,190
North Carolina at that time when he was 
big.

3291
02:21:44,191 --> 02:21:45,380
That's not like this is south.

3292
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:48,200
There's like a certain melody to get 
people to say like,

3293
02:21:48,201 --> 02:21:49,730
yeah,
like Farah Khan does it.

3294
02:21:50,140 --> 02:21:54,290
Where is that going to America?
America sucks.

3295
02:21:54,350 --> 02:21:55,730
Basta.
Yeah.

3296
02:21:55,731 --> 02:21:59,180
Well I,
I don't know how you're different now.

3297
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:00,950
Now he's all bald.
What does that mean?

3298
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:07,010
Why does saying Boston?
Italian,

3299
02:22:07,170 --> 02:22:12,170
they speaking in tongues and Italian.
He's got a bunch of videos on Jim Baker.

3300
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:16,970
He's got a ton of videos on him.
I think he might homeboy my test,

3301
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:21,230
but he puts together these ridiculous 
edits of the Jim Baker show.

3302
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:22,950
Preparedness and survival.
The.

3303
02:22:22,951 --> 02:22:25,060
Here it is.
This is like is

3304
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:29,400
good.
I love when rednecks adopt Hebrew shit.

3305
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:31,620
Like it's their shit.
Oh yeah.

3306
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,650
I'm going to blow his chauffer now and 
like,

3307
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:35,250
like dude,
my religion,

3308
02:22:35,251 --> 02:22:37,170
we had all these words.
We didn't know what to say.

3309
02:22:37,171 --> 02:22:42,171
And then I dated a girl who spoke Hebrew
and didn't understand how off all my 

3310
02:22:42,171 --> 02:22:43,330
pronunciations were of everything.
Oh,

3311
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:45,090
that's hilarious.
So you're was.

3312
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:47,190
Yours was straight from the Jehovah's 
Witnesses.

3313
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,310
I had a my book of Bible stories where 
guys reading the tape,

3314
02:22:50,311 --> 02:22:53,430
so I pronounce these words.
It just how Americans pronounce,

3315
02:22:53,830 --> 02:22:54,910
you know,
Bible words.

3316
02:22:55,410 --> 02:23:00,410
The Shit's not free for us.
It's for the people that likes to say 

3317
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:00,410
who pronounces it.
Right.

3318
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:03,030
I mean there's a lot of these words.
Well,

3319
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:05,790
Hebrew though that they recreated it 
when the nation.

3320
02:23:05,791 --> 02:23:07,930
Israel is kind of interesting.
They had to re re.

3321
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:10,500
It was like a lost language that had to 
be rebuilt.

3322
02:23:11,220 --> 02:23:14,890
Rebuilt it from the ground up.
Well,

3323
02:23:14,891 --> 02:23:16,430
I guess not from the ground up.
I don't know.

3324
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:21,590
They had to put it there,
but it now it's a fluently spoken 

3325
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:21,880
language and it was like dead for 
awhile.

3326
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:23,580
There's two different Hebrews,
right?

3327
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:24,960
There's ancient Hebrew.
It's different,

3328
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:26,190
right?
I guess.

3329
02:23:26,191 --> 02:23:28,410
Yeah.
Ancient Hebrew with the letters are also

3330
02:23:28,411 --> 02:23:31,260
a numbers.
Numbers in ancient Hebrew were weird.

3331
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:33,090
Yeah.
I don't think they use it anymore,

3332
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:38,360
but that's like the original Bible.
I mean like how many people use ancient 

3333
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:40,570
Hebrew teak cv can find a video.
What ancient Hebrew sounds like?

3334
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:42,690
Well,
my ex's parents are Hebrew scholars,

3335
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:46,110
so they went to that shit.
I want to hear what it sounds like.

3336
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:48,000
Like keep.
It sounds like phlegm noises.

3337
02:23:48,001 --> 02:23:51,240
It all sounds like a weird fucking sad.
There's an example of that,

3338
02:23:51,241 --> 02:23:53,710
about that sound.
It's just a,

3339
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:56,190
you know,
but I mean think about it like Chinese.

3340
02:23:56,340 --> 02:23:57,860
It's a very specific sound.
German,

3341
02:23:58,790 --> 02:24:00,170
Italian.
Have you been to China?

3342
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:02,280
I've never been to China,
but Japan though.

3343
02:24:02,310 --> 02:24:04,800
It's worth going.
It's a lot like she sounds.

3344
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:07,000
Let me hear that Shit.
Me,

3345
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:08,990
aerosmith,
Macbeth.

3346
02:24:09,130 --> 02:24:14,130
I will.
That sounds like a little heme.

3347
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:20,430
Like wow.
Little crazy.

3348
02:24:21,631 --> 02:24:26,520
It looks like Lord of the Rings Elf.
Elf language doesn't.

3349
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:31,800
Ancient languages like Sanskrit looks so
crazy.

3350
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:34,140
Know like if this was like on a 
spaceship,

3351
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:36,090
you would think would like that.
Look at that.

3352
02:24:36,091 --> 02:24:38,960
If that was on a spaceship etched into 
the side of the spaceship,

3353
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:39,930
you'd be like,
Holy Shit.

3354
02:24:39,931 --> 02:24:41,720
It's a fucking alien language.
I mean,

3355
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:43,560
I don't know what any of those things 
are.

3356
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:45,600
I don't know what one of those numbers 
is.

3357
02:24:45,601 --> 02:24:47,490
I don't know what the fuck those words 
are.

3358
02:24:47,491 --> 02:24:49,800
Those letters.
That's an alien language.

3359
02:24:49,801 --> 02:24:54,801
That's,
to me almost more alien than a lot of 

3360
02:24:54,801 --> 02:24:54,801
Asian languages.

3361
02:24:54,801 --> 02:24:56,380
That looks crazy.
Well,

3362
02:24:56,390 --> 02:25:01,390
that's,
that's a reason to kind of doubt that 

3363
02:25:01,390 --> 02:25:01,390
somebody translating it,
right?

3364
02:25:01,390 --> 02:25:02,430
It's just like,
oh,

3365
02:25:02,431 --> 02:25:04,600
you looked at that jibberish and you saw
well,

3366
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:05,790
scholars,
you know,

3367
02:25:05,791 --> 02:25:08,190
the whole thing with that is that these 
ancient,

3368
02:25:08,191 --> 02:25:09,380
ancient,
ancient languages,

3369
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:12,750
like all these stories came from these 
ancient languages.

3370
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:13,620
Like if you go way,
way,

3371
02:25:13,621 --> 02:25:14,630
way back.
Shit.

3372
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:17,130
So Mer,
like the epic of Gilgamesh.

3373
02:25:17,131 --> 02:25:19,380
There's all these Noah's Ark 
similarities.

3374
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:22,600
There's a lot of stuff and all these 
ancient stories,

3375
02:25:22,601 --> 02:25:26,710
that's all probably points to some real 
shit that happened for sure.

3376
02:25:26,711 --> 02:25:29,170
It along the way.
Just like what you're talking about with

3377
02:25:29,230 --> 02:25:32,740
social justice warriors and how they 
behave like it's a religion.

3378
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:38,040
There's like a natural compulsion for 
people to be on a group and have that 

3379
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:42,871
group have a very clear ideology the way
up to atheism if they want it because 

3380
02:25:42,871 --> 02:25:43,090
that's like almost a luxury I think.

3381
02:25:43,150 --> 02:25:44,200
Yeah,
I think you're right.

3382
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:47,070
And I don't know how to just,
uh,

3383
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:50,050
about thinking what I will say the DMT 
shape.

3384
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:53,300
Uh,
I did get like more of a,

3385
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,000
Oh yeah,
there's more than,

3386
02:25:55,350 --> 02:26:00,350
oh,
there's something else there and it's 

3387
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:01,810
crazy because when know I read about 
that shit in high school.

3388
02:26:01,811 --> 02:26:04,900
I read some more about that guy that,
that is the big DMT guy.

3389
02:26:05,050 --> 02:26:06,520
Terence Mckenna.
Yeah,

3390
02:26:06,521 --> 02:26:08,650
because I think he projects a lot of his
own horseshit into it,

3391
02:26:08,651 --> 02:26:12,270
but that stuff that Karen does or the 
agenda,

3392
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:16,450
just let me tell you when I,
I never felt a thing that felt so much,

3393
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:21,451
like not making me hallucinate,
but like he was taking away a 

3394
02:26:21,451 --> 02:26:24,271
hallucination and that is such,
there's something so terrifying about 

3395
02:26:24,271 --> 02:26:24,271
that.
But it also like,

3396
02:26:24,271 --> 02:26:24,560
wow,
that's great.

3397
02:26:24,590 --> 02:26:29,350
Like you just,
you feel like there has to be just based

3398
02:26:29,351 --> 02:26:31,030
on the shit you would say.

3399
02:26:31,090 --> 02:26:32,380
Even if it's just shaking your head,
you're like,

3400
02:26:32,381 --> 02:26:36,070
why would that even be in my head?
It's entirely possible that whatever the

3401
02:26:36,071 --> 02:26:40,120
fuck consciousness is can pass from this
stage into another stage.

3402
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:45,480
And the only reason why I would hesitate
to say that's exactly what happens is 

3403
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:46,090
because there's no proof one way or 
another,

3404
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:49,150
but it's the pineal gland.
Shit is not proven.

3405
02:26:49,151 --> 02:26:54,151
They don't know that dmt comes the 
cottonwood research foundation.

3406
02:26:56,230 --> 02:27:01,230
They did a series of tests with rats and
they proved that live rats have a dmt 

3407
02:27:01,541 --> 02:27:06,541
produced by the pineal gland.
It doesn't necessarily mean that humans 

3408
02:27:06,541 --> 02:27:06,541
do too,
but they're pretty sure they did.

3409
02:27:06,541 --> 02:27:11,401
You like to know that your,
your lungs producer and your liver 

3410
02:27:11,401 --> 02:27:11,401
produces it.
That's a fact.

3411
02:27:11,401 --> 02:27:16,050
Yeah.
So your body's producing dmt 100 

3412
02:27:16,050 --> 02:27:16,050
percent.
Did you know that?

3413
02:27:16,050 --> 02:27:16,050
Or did you like,
uh,

3414
02:27:16,050 --> 02:27:18,490
like those hp lovecraft kind of horror 
stories.

3415
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:23,550
I love those.
And there's a movie made out of one of 

3416
02:27:23,550 --> 02:27:23,550
them.
It's all about his pineal gland.

3417
02:27:23,550 --> 02:27:23,890
He's taking something,
mixes pineal gland swelling up.

3418
02:27:23,891 --> 02:27:25,680
Which one is that?
Movies on stars.

3419
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:28,150
The guy from reanimator.
It's not,

3420
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:33,320
it's not reanimator I'm feeling it now.
I kind of remember what you're talking 

3421
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:34,890
about.
I'll tell you that creepy.

3422
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:38,440
The DNP has a creepy creepy because I 
was totally worth doing.

3423
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:40,660
But the thing that's,
you know,

3424
02:27:40,661 --> 02:27:42,850
whatever people say they meet entities,
right?

3425
02:27:42,851 --> 02:27:45,040
But I don't know if that shit is meeting
entity,

3426
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:47,410
but I'll tell you the thing that just 
sticks with me that I'm like,

3427
02:27:47,770 --> 02:27:50,440
how in the fuck is that possible is the 
shapes that you,

3428
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:55,580
that I could say I was well aware that 
they were a bit more than three 

3429
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:59,971
dimensional shapes and it's so crazy to 
look at that and perceive it.

3430
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:05,600
And I'm like,
how on earth could I perceive this 

3431
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:05,600
shape?
And when I came and you can't break,

3432
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:05,970
come back with it.
Like,

3433
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:07,450
you know,
you see it though.

3434
02:28:07,451 --> 02:28:12,451
And someone's like,
have you ever seen Alex grades aren't 

3435
02:28:12,451 --> 02:28:12,451
awesome?
No.

3436
02:28:12,451 --> 02:28:14,050
You haven't seen it.
Pull up Alex Gray.

3437
02:28:14,051 --> 02:28:19,051
He's a psychedelic artists.
I mean all of this stuff is basically 

3438
02:28:19,051 --> 02:28:20,890
just to mean based art because 
sometimes.

3439
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:21,470
Oh No,
no,

3440
02:28:21,471 --> 02:28:21,800
no,
no,

3441
02:28:21,801 --> 02:28:21,980
no.

3442
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,430
He's brilliant.
His stuff's something.

3443
02:28:24,460 --> 02:28:28,730
If it's fucking amazing for two,
one of them,

3444
02:28:28,731 --> 02:28:29,150
but let.
Yeah,

3445
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:32,060
he draws a,
the covers for tool albums.

3446
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:36,630
There's a ton of like that one.
That one specific DMT DMT.

3447
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:39,110
That is dmt.
That is hardcore dmt.

3448
02:28:39,111 --> 02:28:41,000
Hardcore dmt.
When you do Dmt,

3449
02:28:41,001 --> 02:28:46,001
you see that and you see that in a way 
where it's so much more spectacular than

3450
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:47,990
any.
Anything you ever seen.

3451
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:50,810
Normal consciousness is your body.
They're like,

3452
02:28:50,811 --> 02:28:53,830
are you saying you're not thinking of 
your.

3453
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:56,530
You're.
You look around you.

3454
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:58,340
You're stupid.
If you're opening your eyes.

3455
02:28:58,520 --> 02:28:59,860
Here's what's crazy because you can 
sort.

3456
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:04,870
If you close your eyes,
it's like they're open somewhere else 

3457
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:07,210
and then you open your eyes.
You see reality overlaid over to tell me

3458
02:29:07,211 --> 02:29:10,130
this can influence the Egyptians.
Click on the one your cursors on.

3459
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:12,710
Tell me that didn't influence the 
Egyptians.

3460
02:29:12,810 --> 02:29:14,050
What?
This painting or this,

3461
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:15,460
this,
these kind of trips.

3462
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:17,980
Images.
DMT.

3463
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:18,890
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

3464
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:20,690
There was.
One of the things that John Anthony West

3465
02:29:20,691 --> 02:29:25,691
did was he was going over that temple in
the temple and man is one of the 

3466
02:29:26,031 --> 02:29:26,510
structures.

3467
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:30,070
It's in,
in Egypt and it,

3468
02:29:30,090 --> 02:29:35,090
it shows different parts of it are 
supposed to represent different 

3469
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:38,630
corridors of the body,
like different Chakras of the body and 

3470
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:42,171
that there was some evidence that the 
eye of horus is really the pineal gland 

3471
02:29:43,230 --> 02:29:45,180
and that's what that.
That symbol is like.

3472
02:29:45,181 --> 02:29:49,470
See if Google,
a pineal gland,

3473
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:52,970
eye of Horus,
they think that they're.

3474
02:29:52,971 --> 02:29:55,440
They're so similar in the way they're 
shaped.

3475
02:29:55,650 --> 02:29:58,860
It's entirely possible that that's what.
That's a very alternative thing,

3476
02:29:58,980 --> 02:30:01,230
but look how it looks,
how the thing looks on the right,

3477
02:30:01,231 --> 02:30:03,600
the actual pineal gland,
and look at the eye and the left.

3478
02:30:03,970 --> 02:30:05,070
Well,
yeah,

3479
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:09,240
see that wing off the side and the way 
it drops down right from the eyeball.

3480
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:10,980
Boy,
that's fucking similar.

3481
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:16,880
It's entirely possible that they figured
that out somewhere along the line that 

3482
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:20,970
through yoga breathing methods or some 
sort of psychedelic drugs,

3483
02:30:20,971 --> 02:30:25,971
they found that they were achieving a 
hallucinogenic state and they were able 

3484
02:30:25,971 --> 02:30:29,421
to somehow or another isolate where that
state is being initiated and if it's 

3485
02:30:30,211 --> 02:30:32,640
being initiated in dodgy,
honestly by your body,

3486
02:30:32,641 --> 02:30:37,641
like through psychedelic breathing.
That's probably where it's being 

3487
02:30:37,641 --> 02:30:37,641
produced.

3488
02:30:37,641 --> 02:30:41,930
Well,
I don't want to sound like Schumer 

3489
02:30:41,930 --> 02:30:41,930
defender,
but that look,

3490
02:30:41,930 --> 02:30:44,730
coincidentally parallel thought certain 
patterns over and over again that,

3491
02:30:46,531 --> 02:30:48,600
but that pattern is pretty fucking 
close.

3492
02:30:48,601 --> 02:30:50,550
You might be right,
it might be coincidental,

3493
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:53,400
but the fact that it dropped a straight 
line drops down right before the.

3494
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:56,100
I showed again,
straight line drops down right below the

3495
02:30:56,101 --> 02:30:59,220
eye and the left Egypt.
That's the thing they did.

3496
02:30:59,310 --> 02:31:02,420
They did surgery on people in Egypt,
right?

3497
02:31:02,970 --> 02:31:07,970
First of all,
I thought Egypt thought the mind was in 

3498
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:08,580
the heart and that's why they pulled the
useless brain out through the nose.

3499
02:31:08,581 --> 02:31:12,330
When they mummified you like you're 
telling me what their intent.

3500
02:31:12,510 --> 02:31:15,030
You know what I mean?
Like embalming techniques we have,

3501
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:17,310
but that doesn't mean that in respect to
brain kept.

3502
02:31:17,610 --> 02:31:19,050
No,
they didn't look well.

3503
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:20,100
I'm looking at it.
They didn't

3504
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:25,100
know everything about the human body.
The way they attach significance to 

3505
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:29,121
something in the brain if they don't 
think that's what I think through 

3506
02:31:29,121 --> 02:31:29,121
psychedelic drugs.
I think when they were doing these heavy

3507
02:31:29,121 --> 02:31:30,420
psychedelic drugs,
which by the way,

3508
02:31:30,421 --> 02:31:34,200
we're absolutely being used by them by 
tons and tons.

3509
02:31:34,201 --> 02:31:39,201
I could listen to the dude.
This is the thing that really blew my 

3510
02:31:39,201 --> 02:31:40,680
mind because I was looking.
You don't want to even believe rumors.

3511
02:31:40,681 --> 02:31:41,670
That's what's going on.
Again,

3512
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:42,940
I saw.
I looked.

3513
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:44,790
You ever look at somebody while you're 
on trip?

3514
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:47,310
No,
I've always kept my eyes closed.

3515
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:52,970
I closed my eyes and one time I opened 
my eyes and look at somebody and they 

3516
02:31:52,970 --> 02:31:53,820
had six arms,
like a Hindu.

3517
02:31:54,130 --> 02:31:59,130
Somebody was just saying,
I might have been telling you this at 

3518
02:31:59,130 --> 02:32:01,731
the economy store told me at the time,
perception gets broken down and that's 

3519
02:32:02,131 --> 02:32:02,940
the craziness.

3520
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,660
And so then motion looks like sick.
Like Shiva.

3521
02:32:06,970 --> 02:32:08,370
It looked like a Hindu thing and I'm 
like,

3522
02:32:08,371 --> 02:32:13,371
wow,
I imagine beyond that stuff and you see 

3523
02:32:13,371 --> 02:32:13,371
something.
I mean,

3524
02:32:13,371 --> 02:32:13,371
it looked,
it looked to me so much,

3525
02:32:13,371 --> 02:32:17,280
like a vision from the intake.
Those six rm Kinda got collect that kind

3526
02:32:17,281 --> 02:32:19,110
of art like Buddhists and shit like 
that.

3527
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:22,080
Like this kind of shit because I saw 
this,

3528
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:25,020
I saw this image,
this exact image.

3529
02:32:25,021 --> 02:32:27,600
I mean this has a third eye and 
everything.

3530
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:30,630
The sculptor made this for me.
I don't remember his name.

3531
02:32:30,631 --> 02:32:31,980
Yeah.
I wish I could remember right now,

3532
02:32:31,981 --> 02:32:33,010
but I don't.
Um,

3533
02:32:33,390 --> 02:32:38,390
but yeah,
sculptor made that for me based on this 

3534
02:32:38,390 --> 02:32:40,620
vision that I had high on dmt.
I saw an infinite number of those really

3535
02:32:40,621 --> 02:32:44,760
saw one hovering here and then in every 
direction out from him.

3536
02:32:44,761 --> 02:32:48,270
There was an infinite number of those 
and they were all hovering and vibrating

3537
02:32:48,271 --> 02:32:49,800
around me,
so it's like a fractal.

3538
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:52,680
Is there like fractals,
100 percent fact geometric?

3539
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:55,980
What do you think?
What do you think having done it?

3540
02:32:55,981 --> 02:32:57,150
Like what do you think like,
uh,

3541
02:32:58,290 --> 02:33:00,610
what do you think now with the empty 
after la?

3542
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:01,260
You know,
I,

3543
02:33:01,261 --> 02:33:03,360
I,
I think I saw just a couple things,

3544
02:33:03,361 --> 02:33:06,210
but I don't know how long ago they were 
talking about it with people,

3545
02:33:06,211 --> 02:33:09,200
but you have,
what's your opinion of it now as like a,

3546
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:10,380
you know,
what you're seeing?

3547
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:12,270
Well,
it could be anything.

3548
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:17,810
It definitely could be some sort of a,
an insane hijacking of your sensory 

3549
02:33:17,810 --> 02:33:22,641
nervous system produces this spectacular
psych duck effect that's so profound.

3550
02:33:22,981 --> 02:33:27,981
The solution to Jane,
a hallucinogenic effect that's so 

3551
02:33:27,981 --> 02:33:29,130
profound that it literally is like a 
transcendent experience and changes your

3552
02:33:29,131 --> 02:33:30,780
life.
It's totally popped out to me.

3553
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,700
It's totally possible that it's just a 
chemical thing.

3554
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:35,760
What's also,
but that's also a salsa possibles,

3555
02:33:35,761 --> 02:33:40,761
that life itself,
that whatever the fuck life is and 

3556
02:33:40,761 --> 02:33:43,281
especially whatever the fuck intelligent
life is not understood what 

3557
02:33:43,281 --> 02:33:46,611
consciousness is not understood and the 
this idea that things can only exist in 

3558
02:33:46,611 --> 02:33:46,890
this realm.

3559
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:52,100
That's not proven.
Also the fact that when those quantum 

3560
02:33:52,100 --> 02:33:54,330
physicists guys start breaking down the 
nature of reality and they come up with,

3561
02:33:54,390 --> 02:33:56,580
I don't know how the fuck they do this,
I'm just talking out my ass,

3562
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:59,430
but they come up with the idea that 
there's 11 dimensions.

3563
02:33:59,630 --> 02:34:00,780
Right?
And that they literally,

3564
02:34:00,781 --> 02:34:05,781
I mean,
and this is all changing and constantly 

3565
02:34:05,781 --> 02:34:05,970
evolving and moving and they're 
constantly adding to this.

3566
02:34:06,390 --> 02:34:10,200
It is entirely possible that there's a 
bunch of other shit that's around us all

3567
02:34:10,201 --> 02:34:15,201
the time.
That's just not here and we have access 

3568
02:34:15,201 --> 02:34:15,740
to it.
And when you do DMT womp,

3569
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,680
you go into that other place.
It's entirely

3570
02:34:18,290 --> 02:34:19,600
settling dude.
It's like,

3571
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:21,970
it's not like you're going,
it's like the shit's here.

3572
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:24,220
Well,
that's why you as a skeptic,

3573
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:26,700
it's very important to hear from you.
Like a guy.

3574
02:34:26,701 --> 02:34:28,060
Like,
I'll tell you what,

3575
02:34:28,061 --> 02:34:29,840
I'll.
Because I drew a shitty diagram of it,

3576
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:31,810
his wife felt this is what it feels 
like.

3577
02:34:31,811 --> 02:34:34,180
If you ever do it like this little 
point,

3578
02:34:34,181 --> 02:34:37,420
let's say a little point is you.
This is what I felt like and these these

3579
02:34:37,421 --> 02:34:39,760
lines I drew.
That's like space and you're this little

3580
02:34:39,761 --> 02:34:42,550
point that could stabbed into space time
and all this shit.

3581
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:44,410
This is all the shit that makes you 
like.

3582
02:34:44,411 --> 02:34:49,411
It forms a point.
It's like closing your eyes and looking 

3583
02:34:49,411 --> 02:34:50,840
at all of all of this shit is fucking 
cross section of your being.

3584
02:34:51,010 --> 02:34:54,960
Everything being focused into making.
If you could just reverse look at it.

3585
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:59,410
It feel like it's lessons.
I always feel like it's lessons.

3586
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:00,970
I always feel right.
It's time to go to school,

3587
02:35:00,971 --> 02:35:02,350
sit down,
sit down.

3588
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:04,600
Here's what's going on.
The one of the last ones,

3589
02:35:04,601 --> 02:35:09,601
more profound ones was a bunch of 
gestures that were all giving me the 

3590
02:35:09,601 --> 02:35:09,601
finger.
Really.

3591
02:35:09,601 --> 02:35:13,681
They were all circling around me like 
giving me the finger like who he named 

3592
02:35:13,681 --> 02:35:16,581
you.
Twitter is going to teach you about 

3593
02:35:16,581 --> 02:35:16,581
twitter.

3594
02:35:17,180 --> 02:35:21,340
If you're tense.
60 residents all negatively gesture.

3595
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:23,740
Giving you the finger.
Like how do you feel of yourself?

3596
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:28,410
Are you in constant defensive mode?
And then when I sort of relaxed myself,

3597
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:31,060
they they started wagging their finger 
back and forth like,

3598
02:35:31,061 --> 02:35:31,980
Yep,
that's it.

3599
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:33,390
That's it.
That's cool.

3600
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:35,200
Very,
very strange that the,

3601
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:40,320
the,
these things that you see but you can't 

3602
02:35:40,320 --> 02:35:41,890
define are constantly changing.
So if you try to like say it looked like

3603
02:35:41,891 --> 02:35:46,891
a gesture,
it probably did for a few seconds for a 

3604
02:35:46,891 --> 02:35:50,620
few seconds that lived like a gesture 
and then it imploded and became stars 

3605
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:53,880
and then it sucked in and became 
geometric patterns and it became neon 

3606
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:57,841
colored worms that we're making love to 
each other and a giant infinite bundle 

3607
02:35:57,841 --> 02:35:59,650
of yarn.
Like it becomes weirder and weirder shit

3608
02:35:59,651 --> 02:36:01,780
all the time.
It's hard to remember when you're done.

3609
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:06,840
It's almost impossible.
Even me saying I kind of feel of having 

3610
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:08,020
kind of a fellowship because I don't 
totally remember what I saw.

3611
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:11,590
I remember what I remember to write down
or remember what I repeated.

3612
02:36:11,591 --> 02:36:16,591
So I'm like going back on like my 
repeated versions of what I saw,

3613
02:36:16,661 --> 02:36:21,661
but I just,
I remember like flashes of the intense 

3614
02:36:21,661 --> 02:36:22,400
profound nature of the experience,
their emotions to it.

3615
02:36:22,410 --> 02:36:27,410
Like I,
when I came out of it the first time 

3616
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:29,760
that this on New Year's,
the first time I did it and I fucking,

3617
02:36:30,130 --> 02:36:35,130
I guess I was like weeping,
but when I came out of it because you 

3618
02:36:35,130 --> 02:36:36,010
just suddenly are awake and I had like,
I was so out of it,

3619
02:36:36,011 --> 02:36:37,510
it was like not.
I went,

3620
02:36:37,610 --> 02:36:39,340
I went from weeping like Oh hey,
what's up?

3621
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:45,120
And it.
Because I had been staring some crazy 

3622
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:45,120
thing that we're like,
look so beautiful to me.

3623
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:45,350
But.
But it was that.

3624
02:36:45,410 --> 02:36:50,410
It was like coming out of a dream.
I guess almost that mechanic quote that 

3625
02:36:50,410 --> 02:36:51,370
I think what I'd be scared of is 
unearned wisdom.

3626
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,140
I think we kind of said something like,
be,

3627
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:55,710
be,
be wary of unearned wisdom where I don't

3628
02:36:55,711 --> 02:36:58,120
know if I can handle looking at 
something that intense.

3629
02:36:58,420 --> 02:37:01,930
I was really a low feeling state when I 
did it and I didn't give a fuck.

3630
02:37:01,931 --> 02:37:05,050
So I wanted to do it.
You pick up the slack,

3631
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:07,540
you know,
that unearned wisdom thing.

3632
02:37:07,541 --> 02:37:10,630
I think I know what he's saying and I 
think there's a real problem with people

3633
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:15,770
acting profound when they just learned 
something an hour ago saying I'm not a

3634
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:22,370
qualified Sharman is a thing that people
enjoy doing and it's like,

3635
02:37:23,390 --> 02:37:28,390
like jizzing out their knowledge and a 
lot of that is on her knowledge.

3636
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:33,260
Like there's a lot of people that don't 
really have a full and including me,

3637
02:37:33,310 --> 02:37:38,310
I've done it many times are so full of 
not having a full understanding of the 

3638
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:40,160
topic at hand life.
Jesus judges it out.

3639
02:37:41,690 --> 02:37:46,690
But you look for sure you learned a lot 
about yourself when you do those 

3640
02:37:46,690 --> 02:37:46,690
experiences.
I learned a lot about myself,

3641
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:49,490
learned a lot about how I interact with 
people.

3642
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:54,760
I saw negative thoughts like expressed 
as like this dark green and black 

3643
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:59,540
twisted sort of pattern.
And then when my thoughts went positive,

3644
02:37:59,541 --> 02:38:02,300
it blossom like the most beautiful 
flowers you can imagine.

3645
02:38:02,450 --> 02:38:07,010
It was crazy.
It was a lesson in thinking toxic Lee.

3646
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:10,400
And then.
And this is probably like 2008 ish,

3647
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:15,550
somewhere around the end that that was 
this particular experience that 

3648
02:38:15,550 --> 02:38:20,080
literally changed who I am,
literally changed how I talked to 

3649
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:20,930
people,
literally change how I feel about people

3650
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:25,070
watching a negative thought being 
expresses his dark patterns and then the

3651
02:38:25,071 --> 02:38:27,020
positive thought,
just I just let it go.

3652
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:27,500
Like,
oh,

3653
02:38:27,501 --> 02:38:28,800
I see,
I see I'm doing it to myself.

3654
02:38:28,801 --> 02:38:31,990
And then boom.
And then he just relax and enjoy.

3655
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:34,790
This is so beautiful and because you're 
looking at something so beautiful,

3656
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:39,340
that feeling of seeing beauty makes it 
more beautiful and just getting more and

3657
02:38:39,370 --> 02:38:41,050
like tears were rolling down my eyes and
Mrs.

3658
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:42,840
Stunning,
stunning experience.

3659
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:46,750
It's easier to do that now besides that.
But I,

3660
02:38:46,751 --> 02:38:51,751
I know what you mean.
Like wish I could remember seeing it 

3661
02:38:51,751 --> 02:38:54,061
though.
I remember it happened and I remember 

3662
02:38:54,061 --> 02:38:54,061
the dark green and black,
but it's so.

3663
02:38:54,061 --> 02:38:55,880
I remember so little of what I actually 
saw.

3664
02:38:55,881 --> 02:39:00,200
It's a total recreation in my mind,
which is a real problem with memory.

3665
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:05,440
So real problem with regular memory.
Forget about something spectacularly 

3666
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:06,380
unique and odd as a psychedelic 
experience,

3667
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:07,690
but just regular memory.
I mean,

3668
02:39:07,730 --> 02:39:09,380
I try to think of what I did yesterday.

3669
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:14,500
I know what I.
Did you ever get the information like 

3670
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:17,530
the last time I did it,
this is what really blew me away is 

3671
02:39:17,530 --> 02:39:18,890
because my girl was saying I was going.
I won't forget by the way.

3672
02:39:18,891 --> 02:39:21,080
I forgot immediately.
It's like a joke joke.

3673
02:39:21,081 --> 02:39:23,960
You have to write it down.
I'm supposed to talk into a microphone,

3674
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:29,410
talk into a recorder like right away 
when you get out and then try to 

3675
02:39:29,410 --> 02:39:32,180
decipher that because usually I feel 
like I can't talk.

3676
02:39:32,290 --> 02:39:37,290
As soon as you can know,
which you to do is use the voice app on 

3677
02:39:37,290 --> 02:39:39,230
your phone and as soon as you can talk,
hit record and just ramble.

3678
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:40,070
First of all,
you're going to go,

3679
02:39:40,071 --> 02:39:45,071
oh my God,
I'm a fucking moron because it's going 

3680
02:39:45,071 --> 02:39:45,071
to stop.
If you're sober,

3681
02:39:45,071 --> 02:39:47,870
it's going to sound so stupid.
Like I lost the inner journey and better

3682
02:39:47,871 --> 02:39:52,871
like on the inside.
On the outside you're just puking and 

3683
02:39:52,871 --> 02:39:53,330
projectile shitting.
Shivering like an idiot.

3684
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:58,570
That's a metaphor for twitter.
There shouldn't be a which will be on 

3685
02:39:58,570 --> 02:40:01,930
that shit,
like not being on fucking social media 

3686
02:40:01,930 --> 02:40:03,560
the level.
Because at one point I was,

3687
02:40:03,710 --> 02:40:07,610
I remember I would read like salon.com
to fucking be annoyed.

3688
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:11,210
I didn't notice it like you're doing it 
on purpose.

3689
02:40:12,010 --> 02:40:14,190
I didn't even realize how much I was 
like,

3690
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:14,820
uh,
my leg.

3691
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:20,320
It's like a conflict addiction and it 
becomes like some weird Russia people 

3692
02:40:20,320 --> 02:40:22,830
get journal masochism no,
it's just a fucking thing of.

3693
02:40:23,790 --> 02:40:26,490
Especially if you have a mannequin kind 
of personalities,

3694
02:40:27,530 --> 02:40:30,580
it's why is why you to share.
You share this,

3695
02:40:30,581 --> 02:40:31,810
you,
you've overcome this.

3696
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:36,960
He's in the grips of it.
He's in the grips of doing battle 

3697
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:36,960
everyday,
puts on his fucking twitter.

3698
02:40:36,970 --> 02:40:41,140
I can't believe the amount of energy 
spent on there,

3699
02:40:41,410 --> 02:40:44,710
but I'm not saying don't pull that shit 
on twitter,

3700
02:40:44,711 --> 02:40:47,620
but don't look who gives a shit what 
anybody says he has.

3701
02:40:47,650 --> 02:40:48,940
You've,
you've had issues with it.

3702
02:40:48,970 --> 02:40:53,970
Like you and I talked about it.
Were you like you would get in these 

3703
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:53,970
twitter beefs and you won't be able to 
sleep cortisol.

3704
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:58,771
It's the same thing that addicts,
he had a gambling is actually losing to 

3705
02:40:58,771 --> 02:40:58,771
die.
Don't know.

3706
02:40:58,771 --> 02:41:00,340
I can't.
That's not a smart thing to do with your

3707
02:41:00,341 --> 02:41:05,341
time.
I can't see why that would be good for 

3708
02:41:05,341 --> 02:41:05,341
you.
I know you think like you'd come come up

3709
02:41:05,341 --> 02:41:07,680
with materials sometimes with battling 
that with people.

3710
02:41:08,030 --> 02:41:13,030
It would show me how to like this.
Like it could show you like use twitter 

3711
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:17,731
to represent who you are.
It's just fucking hard to represent who 

3712
02:41:17,731 --> 02:41:17,740
you are.
It's hard in print.

3713
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:21,340
It's very to.
Because my tone is so key with jokes.

3714
02:41:21,430 --> 02:41:23,100
Yes,
and most people don't.

3715
02:41:23,170 --> 02:41:24,020
It's not like your car.

3716
02:41:24,110 --> 02:41:27,600
The writing jokes going on there.
It's promote where I'm going to be made.

3717
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:29,630
People will fucking buy a ticket if they
want to hear you.

3718
02:41:29,631 --> 02:41:30,920
A little insight though.
Angry.

3719
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:34,340
Do I keep living an idiot?
I was coming strong.

3720
02:41:34,370 --> 02:41:39,370
Come on.
I thought I thought it was like I was 

3721
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:39,370
working.
I remember my ex would be like,

3722
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:39,800
well you fucking get on fucking 
facebook.

3723
02:41:39,810 --> 02:41:40,980
I'm like,
this is my job.

3724
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:42,510
Okay.
Oh Wow.

3725
02:41:42,690 --> 02:41:45,550
Like in my head that's like productive 
and see.

3726
02:41:45,570 --> 02:41:50,570
Sometimes I do write with it though,
like I won't go through my twitter and 

3727
02:41:50,570 --> 02:41:50,570
just be like,
okay,

3728
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:52,500
it's not copyrighted,
just so you know.

3729
02:41:52,501 --> 02:41:54,160
And also,
yeah.

3730
02:41:54,161 --> 02:41:58,020
Also you're just giving people become 
accustomed.

3731
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:01,740
See all this insight,
baseball shit they do with standup.

3732
02:42:02,010 --> 02:42:05,490
Is making civilians like you've never 
heard that inside baseball?

3733
02:42:05,491 --> 02:42:07,820
Like the insiders terms?
No,

3734
02:42:08,550 --> 02:42:09,750
I wasn't working on a pilot.
They go,

3735
02:42:09,751 --> 02:42:12,660
we need more inside baseball on like in 
like,

3736
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:16,290
like Pete Holmes,
a show on HBO is about being a standup.

3737
02:42:16,350 --> 02:42:19,060
So it's like an insider's,
right?

3738
02:42:19,230 --> 02:42:24,230
Like that's how it's put out there,
which I'm against this showing the 

3739
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:24,990
process shit everybody does and that's 
what I would do on.

3740
02:42:25,170 --> 02:42:28,290
I looked at facebook almost like a dye,
like I'm showing you.

3741
02:42:28,410 --> 02:42:31,290
I'll go very clearly.
Nine out of 10 of these will suck.

3742
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:36,770
Okay.
Not Be worth reading it all and one in 

3743
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:36,770
10 will be funny maybe,
but you're not paying me for this,

3744
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:39,090
so I'm just allowing you to see my 
process.

3745
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:41,550
You know what I mean?
I'm thinking like it's a diary,

3746
02:42:41,551 --> 02:42:46,380
but you don't put your diary like Anne 
Frank even had to be dead for a diary to

3747
02:42:46,381 --> 02:42:51,381
come out.
You keep just have your shit up like 

3748
02:42:51,381 --> 02:42:53,181
that and I'm giving it away for free and
then people are entitled to it and how 

3749
02:42:53,181 --> 02:42:54,360
these little shitheads a little entitled
foodies.

3750
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:59,600
So you're like,
how is this nothing writing about Dave 

3751
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:02,390
Chappelle's our that.
It's Ho hum because I was reading some 

3752
02:43:02,390 --> 02:43:02,390
dickhead rainbow back,
Chappelle and I'm like,

3753
02:43:02,390 --> 02:43:04,230
where do you get the balls?
And it's because they're,

3754
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:05,940
they're being made to feel like an 
insider.

3755
02:43:06,090 --> 02:43:09,240
The same as trump is like an every man 
fucking dipshit,

3756
02:43:09,570 --> 02:43:12,340
you know Joe Joe bag of donuts.

3757
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:17,110
Like dom called.
That guy is a guy like me to talk to me.

3758
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:19,360
Finally.
Everybody's about that.

3759
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:22,750
Now there are.
They hate like an elite or an expert.

3760
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:25,230
Experts of what I do.
People over there.

3761
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:28,280
We went on several times.
Let's,

3762
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:30,610
let's bring it back to the people that 
are writing.

3763
02:43:30,820 --> 02:43:32,260
So these people that are writing these 
things,

3764
02:43:32,261 --> 02:43:37,261
a lot of them when they're in their 
twenties and we would all have done the 

3765
02:43:37,261 --> 02:43:37,261
same thing,
the exact same thing when you're in your

3766
02:43:37,261 --> 02:43:38,950
twenties.
That's right.

3767
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:42,920
You thought just like that when you hold
on when you were a writer and you,

3768
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:46,180
you know,
if you were writing a blog for some sort

3769
02:43:46,181 --> 02:43:48,970
of online publication and you decided to
take an angle,

3770
02:43:49,240 --> 02:43:51,100
you know,
this Dave Chappelle specials,

3771
02:43:51,101 --> 02:43:53,860
not that big a deal,
and then just go run with that.

3772
02:43:53,861 --> 02:43:55,630
You would probably do the exact fucking 
same thing.

3773
02:43:55,900 --> 02:43:57,430
There's a lot of people that do that.
Well,

3774
02:43:57,431 --> 02:43:58,810
no fathers review.
Like I told you,

3775
02:43:58,811 --> 02:44:03,811
I'm a sucker.
So I would review it and say what I 

3776
02:44:03,811 --> 02:44:04,540
thought about the hour.
So that's not what's done.

3777
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:06,520
And I know for a fact that's not how 
these people do.

3778
02:44:06,521 --> 02:44:07,540
And if you've talked to them,
they go,

3779
02:44:07,570 --> 02:44:10,780
I got to say I don't like somebody 
because I liked the political reason.

3780
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:11,770
Uh,
yeah,

3781
02:44:11,771 --> 02:44:13,160
I know what you're saying.
It's not.

3782
02:44:13,170 --> 02:44:15,130
Nothing is based on funny.
I mean,

3783
02:44:15,131 --> 02:44:20,131
it was always like that,
but now there's an added political 

3784
02:44:20,131 --> 02:44:21,790
element of not funny.
Here's a whole la La land section of it.

3785
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:26,850
There's a whole section where up is down
and right is left and whatever the fuck 

3786
02:44:26,850 --> 02:44:31,081
you say becomes doctrine.
People like to make Dane Cook a 

3787
02:44:31,081 --> 02:44:32,230
punchline that I have half the people 
that would do that.

3788
02:44:32,231 --> 02:44:37,231
I haven't.
They haven't made me laugh even a 

3789
02:44:37,231 --> 02:44:37,231
little,
as much as they can cook,

3790
02:44:37,231 --> 02:44:37,231
so I'm wondering.

3791
02:44:37,231 --> 02:44:41,900
It's a free shot.
It's like carrot top people will take a 

3792
02:44:41,900 --> 02:44:44,401
free shot at carrot top.
I don't even see these fucking punk 

3793
02:44:44,401 --> 02:44:46,720
millennials now doing the work and built
those props.

3794
02:44:46,750 --> 02:44:48,430
Yeah,
carrot top is a funny guy.

3795
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:50,770
He's funny.
Like he's a good comic.

3796
02:44:50,830 --> 02:44:53,350
Like you could go see a show.
It's a silly funny show,

3797
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:58,440
but it has punchline sample.
Think they literally just a new kind of 

3798
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:00,130
comedy that doesn't have sort of punch 
set up.

3799
02:45:00,131 --> 02:45:05,131
Punch line is not only good.
It's postmodern building block of the 

3800
02:45:05,131 --> 02:45:06,520
universe.
Everything is that.

3801
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:09,130
If we fix post modern comedy,
well you know what it is.

3802
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:10,480
It's.
We just aren't good at it.

3803
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:15,540
Right.
That's the new way are press or like 

3804
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:16,060
every of activist by the way will tell 
you they're a comedian,

3805
02:45:16,090 --> 02:45:17,260
but here's the thing.
Every single one,

3806
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:20,920
if they like that style and they go,
it's like,

3807
02:45:21,180 --> 02:45:23,440
it's like someone saying to a jazz 
guitarist,

3808
02:45:23,441 --> 02:45:24,000
dude,
you,

3809
02:45:24,001 --> 02:45:27,100
you can't play for shit because you 
can't play like Hendrix.

3810
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:27,780
Right.
You know,

3811
02:45:27,781 --> 02:45:31,090
but they don't want to go to do this and
I understand that,

3812
02:45:31,091 --> 02:45:34,570
but I understand because I don't 
appreciate music or whatever,

3813
02:45:34,571 --> 02:45:36,430
how I should appreciate it.
I totally get that,

3814
02:45:36,431 --> 02:45:39,430
but I don't think I could just walk and 
play guitar.

3815
02:45:39,630 --> 02:45:41,380
Well,
it's just a different genre though,

3816
02:45:41,381 --> 02:45:43,090
because the whole thing is,
according to me,

3817
02:45:43,091 --> 02:45:46,390
it's other lowercase igeneration like 
right out of apple products.

3818
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:51,420
Well,
there's also an applied snobbishness 

3819
02:45:51,420 --> 02:45:53,791
were the people that are not doing the 
punchlines feel like what they're doing 

3820
02:45:53,791 --> 02:45:56,340
is somehow or another better than 
someone who does classic setup,

3821
02:45:56,350 --> 02:45:59,530
punchline sort of joke writing.
That's ridiculous.

3822
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:01,900
It's ridiculous because it's not better 
or worse and you know,

3823
02:46:01,901 --> 02:46:05,620
you don't get Brownie points just 
because you're eclectic or just because.

3824
02:46:05,621 --> 02:46:08,860
Because you didn't know your alternative
shit was old Steve Martin bits.

3825
02:46:08,870 --> 02:46:10,070
Well,
Dennis Miller,

3826
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:11,660
that's where it gets really funny.

3827
02:46:11,810 --> 02:46:16,810
Like Dennis Miller,
Dennis Miller was super alton a lot of 

3828
02:46:16,810 --> 02:46:19,451
ways he would be telling these set of 
punch punchlines about shit that you 

3829
02:46:19,451 --> 02:46:23,381
definitely didn't know what the fuck he 
was talking about and you would laugh 

3830
02:46:23,381 --> 02:46:23,750
anyway because you didn't want to be 
thought of as stupid.

3831
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:26,340
There was a bunch of people that laughed
at Dennis Miller's jokes.

3832
02:46:26,350 --> 02:46:28,850
They didn't have a fucking clue as to 
what he was saying.

3833
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:33,880
Mark Twain had cancer.
Just Mark Twain wrote a whole book as a 

3834
02:46:35,361 --> 02:46:37,100
joke.
Which book was that?

3835
02:46:37,130 --> 02:46:38,590
I can't remember.
I remember this.

3836
02:46:38,650 --> 02:46:40,490
I remember it was like having everybody,
uh,

3837
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:45,520
review it and stuff,
like it was real and he was just 

3838
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:45,620
laughing his ass off.
I think if you write the book,

3839
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:48,210
it says a joke at that point.
It sounds like you wrote a book.

3840
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:50,090
It's almost like you bang a guy's a 
joke.

3841
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:54,020
He wrote it as a satire and people took 
it as fact.

3842
02:46:55,270 --> 02:46:57,880
Postmodern comedy.
I was one of my first jokes in colleges.

3843
02:46:57,890 --> 02:46:59,150
I knock,
knock.

3844
02:46:59,151 --> 02:47:00,620
Who's there?
Pineapple.

3845
02:47:00,650 --> 02:47:03,540
Who are you to say what funny is?
Oh God,

3846
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:05,740
because it's true.
It's like a.in

3847
02:47:05,741 --> 02:47:06,770
a,
like a painting.

3848
02:47:06,771 --> 02:47:09,700
It's like childhood.
You listen,

3849
02:47:09,701 --> 02:47:14,701
if you pay it to see me,
you can determine if I did my job and 

3850
02:47:14,701 --> 02:47:14,701
not,
you know,

3851
02:47:14,701 --> 02:47:16,310
you have your take on it and people have
their take on it.

3852
02:47:16,311 --> 02:47:18,500
But like there's certain guys that,
you know,

3853
02:47:18,590 --> 02:47:19,790
they're just funny.
Right.

3854
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:22,130
And you could,
you could see someone saying,

3855
02:47:22,131 --> 02:47:23,330
okay,
like perfect example,

3856
02:47:23,331 --> 02:47:24,890
setup punchline,
Mitch Hedberg.

3857
02:47:25,070 --> 02:47:27,640
If you say that's not funny,
fuck you,

3858
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:29,090
you're lying.
Just fuck you.

3859
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:31,580
Okay.
Because he's clever.

3860
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:33,410
It's set up.
It's weird.

3861
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:37,990
It's eight minutes for reasons outside 
of the.

3862
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:43,360
When people tell you someone who's funny
and they say they own funny or vice 

3863
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:47,621
versa,
it's because they're judging for things 

3864
02:47:47,621 --> 02:47:47,820
that have nothing to do with the 
material or the funding.

3865
02:47:48,460 --> 02:47:53,460
Like I've heard people say like,
oh don't like a guy that stands Julie 

3866
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:54,320
had a fair.
That's a fair critique,

3867
02:47:54,660 --> 02:47:55,190
you know?
Or.

3868
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:57,080
Sure.
But that's the case with music too,

3869
02:47:57,081 --> 02:48:02,081
right?
Like you might not like Bob Dylan's 

3870
02:48:02,081 --> 02:48:02,081
voice.
Like,

3871
02:48:02,081 --> 02:48:02,081
oh,
I don't want to hear it,

3872
02:48:02,081 --> 02:48:03,830
and that's a legit concern.
That's a legit concern.

3873
02:48:04,430 --> 02:48:06,480
Can have their thing.
I've got no issue with that.

3874
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:09,990
Comedy is not just what you're saying.
It's how you're saying it's now.

3875
02:48:09,991 --> 02:48:13,030
It sounds to people,
but why destroy cities?

3876
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,860
What I was saying like if you don't like
somebody's fucking coming into,

3877
02:48:15,861 --> 02:48:17,400
that's fine,
but they don't.

3878
02:48:17,410 --> 02:48:20,420
People do that with bands though.
There's groups out that need to destroy.

3879
02:48:20,480 --> 02:48:25,480
They're like,
but I can't trust for you to enjoy it 

3880
02:48:25,480 --> 02:48:25,480
because I don't know how,
you know people want to take,

3881
02:48:25,790 --> 02:48:30,790
but how is it different than shit and on
people like nickelback don't shit on 

3882
02:48:30,790 --> 02:48:31,580
people like nickelback will.

3883
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:33,430
You're a beautiful person but it's not 
real.

3884
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:36,070
That's kind of the same sense.
Cool.

3885
02:48:36,071 --> 02:48:37,990
It seems like we just decided this up a 
little bit.

3886
02:48:38,030 --> 02:48:41,520
Feel like I just,
I was pretending to enjoy the show.

3887
02:48:42,770 --> 02:48:45,320
I'm like,
are you bragging that you have that week

3888
02:48:45,321 --> 02:48:50,321
of a person that you were just going 
with the crowd and like a thing you 

3889
02:48:50,321 --> 02:48:50,321
didn't enjoy too trying to hurt your 
feelings?

3890
02:48:50,321 --> 02:48:51,720
And I think you know that as well as I 
do that.

3891
02:48:52,220 --> 02:48:57,220
I'm just reading what.
It's not so much you're arguing with a 

3892
02:48:57,220 --> 02:49:00,071
nonsense person.
That's why I don't go on social media 

3893
02:49:00,071 --> 02:49:00,530
too.
It's just as these arguments with people

3894
02:49:00,531 --> 02:49:05,531
that aren't even fucking say to me.
You don't even understand what I'm.

3895
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:12,320
This is my point.
I don't say I read the Shingo.

3896
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,400
Nothing like I save it for the Rogan 
show,

3897
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:16,770
but beautiful.
That's the way to go.

3898
02:49:16,940 --> 02:49:18,660
Great.
I'd say bring it to the Rogan show.

3899
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:20,370
That's always a good move.
I love it.

3900
02:49:20,371 --> 02:49:21,800
I just listened.
It's,

3901
02:49:21,810 --> 02:49:26,810
you know,
it's fun as long as you don't get too 

3902
02:49:26,810 --> 02:49:27,330
caught up in it.
But the reality is if I had a friend who

3903
02:49:27,331 --> 02:49:32,331
got into something online and uh,
it went sideways and my advice was,

3904
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:37,970
okay,
you know what happens when it goes 

3905
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:37,970
sideways,
right?

3906
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:41,750
So if there's a situation where you feel
like it's going sideways and a bunch of 

3907
02:49:41,750 --> 02:49:41,750
people are gonna attack you for no 
reason,

3908
02:49:41,750 --> 02:49:45,310
step away,
just step away because if you engage you

3909
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:50,360
essentially trusting your emotional 
state to a bunch of people that have no 

3910
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:54,681
concern for your wellbeing,
like they want to attack you and hurt 

3911
02:49:54,681 --> 02:49:54,681
your feelings.

3912
02:49:54,681 --> 02:49:56,430
You're not going to like plead it down 
to like,

3913
02:49:56,431 --> 02:50:01,431
well mildly upset with you.
Now they have this idea and you are the 

3914
02:50:01,431 --> 02:50:03,750
target and you as a person who's in the 
public eye as a celebrity,

3915
02:50:04,050 --> 02:50:09,050
you know this person is you.
You are thought of as someone who 

3916
02:50:09,050 --> 02:50:13,730
already has some extra privilege.
You're thought of as someone who's 

3917
02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:15,330
already already stealing something from 
the rest of us.

3918
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:19,440
You already get some easy free ride 
because of your talent or your notoriety

3919
02:50:19,441 --> 02:50:22,880
or whatever the fuck it is.
So they feel like there's extra licensed

3920
02:50:22,881 --> 02:50:25,410
to fuck with you.
Do that too.

3921
02:50:25,411 --> 02:50:27,480
Where I feel like someone is so big and 
powerful,

3922
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:28,650
like I'm not talking to him,

3923
02:50:28,890 --> 02:50:32,840
ah,
is

3924
02:50:32,870 --> 02:50:34,750
successful enough.
In my mind I'm like,

3925
02:50:34,900 --> 02:50:37,420
it's not even engaging with the person.
It's like,

3926
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:40,390
I dunno,
I want you to send all your tweets to me

3927
02:50:40,391 --> 02:50:43,530
first before you tweet.
Delay is the delay.

3928
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:48,540
You send them to me,
I'll give you the thumbs up and thumbs 

3929
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:48,540
down.
No more tweeting.

3930
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:53,530
Just texts.
Just saying shit to Barry crimmins 

3931
02:50:53,530 --> 02:50:53,530
directly for awhile.
Oh,

3932
02:50:53,530 --> 02:50:55,660
that's hilarious.
Same thing what I'm saying from power of

3933
02:50:55,661 --> 02:50:59,100
attorney over like only he has my 
password.

3934
02:50:59,101 --> 02:51:01,150
Like I don't even know listening.
We're friends.

3935
02:51:01,151 --> 02:51:06,151
I don't want your password,
but I do want you to send all your 

3936
02:51:06,151 --> 02:51:06,240
tweets to me for it.
We should try that.

3937
02:51:06,260 --> 02:51:07,230
That'd be so funny.

3938
02:51:09,310 --> 02:51:14,310
Let me tell you something about Barry,
because Barry was responsible for the 

3939
02:51:14,310 --> 02:51:14,310
environment I came up in.
I came up in Boston,

3940
02:51:14,310 --> 02:51:15,360
Barry Crimmins,
he created.

3941
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,070
He didn't create it.
He set a tone.

3942
02:51:18,250 --> 02:51:18,880
He said,
uh,

3943
02:51:18,881 --> 02:51:21,100
no hacks,
good writing,

3944
02:51:21,430 --> 02:51:26,430
no thieves.
He set a tone and that tone was fucking 

3945
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:29,500
rock solid.
And they were all these big fucking men.

3946
02:51:29,501 --> 02:51:33,290
Like Lenny Clarke is a big guy.
Kevin Knox was a big guy.

3947
02:51:33,291 --> 02:51:35,800
There were a manly men.
They weren't like these neat,

3948
02:51:35,980 --> 02:51:39,130
like nerdy type,
skinny little comedians.

3949
02:51:39,131 --> 02:51:44,131
They were fucking savages.
They did coke and they were punching 

3950
02:51:44,131 --> 02:51:44,131
each other all the time.
They never paid taxes.

3951
02:51:44,131 --> 02:51:48,960
These fucking guys were animals and 
Barry crimmins started the whole thing 

3952
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:52,981
off.
He was so good and so smart and so well 

3953
02:51:52,981 --> 02:51:53,410
read and so aware of what's going on in 
the world.

3954
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:56,200
He set a tone for the entire and 
everyone's scared of him.

3955
02:51:56,290 --> 02:52:00,550
I was terrified of him when that guy 
started reaching out to me and we became

3956
02:52:00,551 --> 02:52:05,551
friends online.
It was like way after I'd already been 

3957
02:52:05,551 --> 02:52:05,551
on television,
everything.

3958
02:52:05,551 --> 02:52:06,100
I was so happy.
I like Barry crimmins

3959
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:07,760
likes me.
Oh yes.

3960
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:12,840
I think you're one of the good guys and 
I think you're a hero and he's telling 

3961
02:52:12,840 --> 02:52:15,391
me all this shit.
To me it was like that was the dawn of 

3962
02:52:15,391 --> 02:52:18,370
comedy.
He was the fucking main guy that started

3963
02:52:18,371 --> 02:52:19,510
it off.
Yeah.

3964
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:24,600
Do you have that with people?
I felt that way when you wrote to me 

3965
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:24,600
Matt.
Oh,

3966
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:25,630
that's nice.
Well,

3967
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:28,390
yeah,
he was terrible.

3968
02:52:29,050 --> 02:52:34,050
He was so smart and so he was so well 
versed in politics and what was going 

3969
02:52:34,050 --> 02:52:38,791
on,
making dared not bring up Guatemala or 

3970
02:52:38,791 --> 02:52:40,090
Nicaragua around him.
They don't talk about the conscious,

3971
02:52:40,091 --> 02:52:45,091
the Sandinistas,
and he was like the last progressive 

3972
02:52:45,091 --> 02:52:45,091
like bay.
He was a left wing dude.

3973
02:52:45,350 --> 02:52:48,340
Believe say there's no because America 
doesn't have that.

3974
02:52:48,341 --> 02:52:50,650
We have just reactionaries and that is 
what America is.

3975
02:52:50,651 --> 02:52:54,370
It's all reactionary.
He was a masculine progressive,

3976
02:52:54,500 --> 02:52:55,280
right man.

3977
02:52:55,300 --> 02:53:00,300
He was a masculine progressive,
like an aggressive fuck you masculine 

3978
02:53:00,431 --> 02:53:04,000
progressive guy who was anti racist and 
anti sexual harassment,

3979
02:53:04,001 --> 02:53:08,020
anti obviously anti-sex abuse because of
what's happened to him to protect her.

3980
02:53:08,050 --> 02:53:10,780
He would go on stage and he would ever 
like a fucking,

3981
02:53:10,781 --> 02:53:15,781
like a professor's jacket on.
He had reached into it and pull out a 

3982
02:53:15,781 --> 02:53:18,721
budweiser.
Every time he had a budweiser in his 

3983
02:53:18,721 --> 02:53:20,710
pocket that was like half a shtick,
drink American beer and he put that shit

3984
02:53:20,711 --> 02:53:22,330
right on the counter.
Like right in front of you.

3985
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:27,360
It was like half of what he did was he 
was this guy that was sick of all this 

3986
02:53:28,961 --> 02:53:32,030
fucking nonsense around him and you 
know,

3987
02:53:32,220 --> 02:53:37,220
he had like this real clear intention of
like this is what's going to be 

3988
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:38,640
tolerated and this end his actors like 
that too.

3989
02:53:38,641 --> 02:53:39,730
And you'd go to watch him.

3990
02:53:39,970 --> 02:53:43,180
You would literally like.
He was so powerful that you would change

3991
02:53:43,181 --> 02:53:44,580
like your politically.
Yes,

3992
02:53:44,830 --> 02:53:49,830
if you were in any way liked about him.
Is that because I don't mind anybody's 

3993
02:53:49,890 --> 02:53:54,890
beliefs if they're like,
well thought out if you have so much of 

3994
02:53:54,890 --> 02:53:57,991
a trend of terrain devoted to something 
and if it's disgusting to you,

3995
02:54:00,941 --> 02:54:01,900
and I'm like,
I should.

3996
02:54:01,960 --> 02:54:06,960
Like when you said that privileged thing
you're talking about like where people 

3997
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:06,960
are taking it,
acknowledging their privilege.

3998
02:54:07,060 --> 02:54:12,060
Did anybody read.
I'll go read your scriptures when you 

3999
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:13,090
tell me about these ideas.
So the privileged checklist.

4000
02:54:13,210 --> 02:54:16,580
Have you ever read that?
The Peggy Mcintosh privilege was.

4001
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:21,600
Who's Peggy Mcintosh?
The one that kicked off this fucking 

4002
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:24,091
amazing privilege concept of white 
privilege based on her ideas on male 

4003
02:54:24,311 --> 02:54:25,450
privilege.
Oh yeah.

4004
02:54:25,740 --> 02:54:28,150
The what it's called,
the unpacking,

4005
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:30,610
the invisible,
a white privileged knapsack.

4006
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:33,430
I love when they say unpacking,
I can unpack that for you.

4007
02:54:33,460 --> 02:54:35,110
First of all,
the first white privilege is you call it

4008
02:54:35,111 --> 02:54:36,850
a knapsack.
That's step one,

4009
02:54:37,510 --> 02:54:42,510
but it's clearly just this rich college 
ladies privileges that she just saw 

4010
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:46,090
white privilege unpacking the invisible 
backpack.

4011
02:54:46,510 --> 02:54:48,400
Every fucking thing that when I used to 
go,

4012
02:54:48,401 --> 02:54:50,770
please go,
go and educate yourself.

4013
02:54:50,800 --> 02:54:51,430
Look,
hold on,

4014
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:54,640
hold on please.
Through the work to bring materials from

4015
02:54:54,641 --> 02:54:57,190
women's studies into the rest of the 
curriculum.

4016
02:54:57,580 --> 02:55:02,580
I have often noticed men's unwillingness
to grant that they are overprivileged 

4017
02:55:02,580 --> 02:55:05,210
even though they may grant that women 
are disadvantaged.

4018
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:07,400
It's almost like she hates women in a 
way.

4019
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:09,320
Well,
this is a weird thing,

4020
02:55:09,370 --> 02:55:12,110
like see,
this is the thing is very important.

4021
02:55:12,350 --> 02:55:16,520
This kind of person thinks that your 
rights are fucking privileges.

4022
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:21,640
Okay,
so most of the list is going to be 

4023
02:55:21,640 --> 02:55:21,640
things that are your basic human right 
and that if,

4024
02:55:21,640 --> 02:55:22,670
let's say you're not getting because 
you're not white,

4025
02:55:22,730 --> 02:55:23,780
you should be getting that.

4026
02:55:23,810 --> 02:55:26,600
It's not that I shouldn't be able to 
move into a neighborhood I want.

4027
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:29,810
It's that you should be able to also,
but they're framing it as,

4028
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:35,200
no,
you have undue privilege needs to be 

4029
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:35,200
taken away.
Like these are my store.

4030
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:36,950
Did way of looking at an actual problem.
The actual problem is real racism.

4031
02:55:37,130 --> 02:55:40,010
The actual problem is real sexism,
but instead of looking at that,

4032
02:55:40,100 --> 02:55:43,960
look at the people that are lucky that 
they're not discriminated against.

4033
02:55:44,030 --> 02:55:47,630
A real hauling them somehow or another 
somehow know perpetrators.

4034
02:55:47,650 --> 02:55:52,650
Yeah.
It's a real fat check way of looking at 

4035
02:55:52,650 --> 02:55:54,401
life everyday.
It's just a real young,

4036
02:55:54,801 --> 02:55:57,350
shitty young girl way to look at the 
world.

4037
02:55:58,730 --> 02:56:03,730
As long as you're not happy.
Well there's a great quote that 

4038
02:56:03,730 --> 02:56:04,310
socialist don't love the poor.
They hate the rich.

4039
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:08,980
That's a good quote and it's also.
It's also some people I'd be look buried

4040
02:56:08,981 --> 02:56:12,450
to me was a sincere dude and I would 
listen to and he didn't have.

4041
02:56:12,470 --> 02:56:17,470
He would give you the shirt.
That was the other thing of that scene 

4042
02:56:17,470 --> 02:56:19,891
as barry would not really have a lot of 
money because he be paying into the 

4043
02:56:19,891 --> 02:56:20,000
comics and he really was a guy who was 
generous,

4044
02:56:20,060 --> 02:56:21,270
generous,
generous guy.

4045
02:56:21,271 --> 02:56:23,930
You know what?
I mean legitimately generous with his,

4046
02:56:23,931 --> 02:56:26,000
uh,
his adoration,

4047
02:56:26,030 --> 02:56:31,030
generous with the way promoted other 
comics the way generously help people 

4048
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:35,260
but generous like,
you know what he did for that scene on 

4049
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:35,480
real.
He made that scene.

4050
02:56:35,481 --> 02:56:38,570
I mean everybody will admit that there 
was a lot of great comics back then.

4051
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:39,300
I mean,
there.

4052
02:56:39,330 --> 02:56:40,310
Steven Wright,
of course,

4053
02:56:40,311 --> 02:56:42,170
there was a lot of great guy,
Don Gavin,

4054
02:56:42,190 --> 02:56:44,900
who's one of the all time,
my all time greatest.

4055
02:56:45,350 --> 02:56:47,360
There was all these great guys that were
in that area,

4056
02:56:47,361 --> 02:56:52,361
but this guy had something special and 
he was by far the most well read out of 

4057
02:56:52,731 --> 02:56:53,180
all of them.

4058
02:56:53,650 --> 02:56:55,940
And I think like abused kids have two 
roads.

4059
02:56:55,970 --> 02:56:59,150
You either want other people to hurt or 
you want to protect people.

4060
02:56:59,210 --> 02:57:00,110
Yeah,
I think you're right.

4061
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:05,140
And I think that sometimes early trauma 
can make you like just so protective of 

4062
02:57:05,140 --> 02:57:07,790
the week where you hate when someone 
takes advantage of vulnerability.

4063
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:09,790
Very high was just prince.
He had principles.

4064
02:57:09,791 --> 02:57:14,791
This is the thing.
It's like somebody have a fucking 

4065
02:57:14,791 --> 02:57:14,791
principle.
The Jamie Kilstein thing.

4066
02:57:14,791 --> 02:57:15,110
I had people write,
write and shit.

4067
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:20,160
This is like right around the time,
like ceased all facebook ads because 

4068
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:20,160
people are like,
well,

4069
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:20,240
I guess you're happy Jamie.
I'm like,

4070
02:57:20,241 --> 02:57:23,160
why would I be happy?
Do you think there's like,

4071
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:28,540
I wouldn't wish that shit on anybody 
fucking evil shit here to keep me from 

4072
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:28,540
killing myself.
Very.

4073
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:30,020
Clements,
he had to talk me down.

4074
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:33,290
I was going to do the shit that I had 
coming out on me.

4075
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:35,870
You can't even believe.
Okay.

4076
02:57:36,360 --> 02:57:37,790
And,
and what?

4077
02:57:38,500 --> 02:57:43,500
I'm not,
I'm not fucking getting into all the 

4078
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:43,500
particulars ever again with people that 
publicly.

4079
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:45,890
But if I say barely fucking saved my 
fucking life.

4080
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:48,710
He saved you with perspective.
It gives you a better perspective.

4081
02:57:48,950 --> 02:57:50,300
Yeah.
I'm lucky I talked to him.

4082
02:57:50,301 --> 02:57:52,670
I am because I was in a fucking bad 
dude.

4083
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:54,260
When you're ready to do it,
it's like,

4084
02:57:54,270 --> 02:57:59,270
no,
this is my ignorance because I thought 

4085
02:57:59,270 --> 02:58:00,940
that you were brushing it off like 
nothing while I was freight.

4086
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:02,880
Dude,
you can't even podcast about it.

4087
02:58:02,900 --> 02:58:05,100
I heard you talking on a podcast will go
away.

4088
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:06,240
I don't remember.
Um,

4089
02:58:06,270 --> 02:58:11,270
it was a long time ago,
a long time to ways that I couldn't even

4090
02:58:11,461 --> 02:58:12,720
believe.
Okay.

4091
02:58:12,721 --> 02:58:15,240
And he was becoming maddening and then 
it was becoming like,

4092
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:16,650
it's just crazy,
dude.

4093
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:18,210
And uh,
you know,

4094
02:58:18,510 --> 02:58:20,400
I still can't get.
I had to go through a book.

4095
02:58:20,430 --> 02:58:21,750
Me,
I'd be tickled to have an agent.

4096
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:22,770
I,
I don't know where they went,

4097
02:58:22,830 --> 02:58:26,580
but it was like I was off the fucking 
uh,

4098
02:58:26,820 --> 02:58:28,140
you know,
I just had no,

4099
02:58:28,141 --> 02:58:29,040
nothing.
I know work.

4100
02:58:29,041 --> 02:58:30,570
I had a job lined up that supposed to 
get.

4101
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:32,190
I fucking couldn't.

4102
02:58:34,470 --> 02:58:35,730
I mean,
uh,

4103
02:58:36,300 --> 02:58:39,030
I would just like taking it to work for 
shy anyway because I like my job,

4104
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:44,040
but it was crazy.
I couldn't believe the amount of shit 

4105
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:44,670
for something.
I don't think it's controversial,

4106
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:50,180
but it doesn't matter.
Once it's a slow day and somebody picks 

4107
02:58:50,180 --> 02:58:51,090
up and grabbed it,
I can't believe it's a soft target.

4108
02:58:51,091 --> 02:58:56,091
Someone would bring amy into it.
I can't believe that's why do you say 

4109
02:58:56,091 --> 02:58:58,440
that?
That's ridiculous because for her,

4110
02:58:58,470 --> 02:59:03,470
but I didn't know.
There was no show show while the show 

4111
02:59:03,470 --> 02:59:04,170
was going on.
You work for this show is done,

4112
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:06,330
but you hadn't announced.
It wasn't stop,

4113
02:59:06,540 --> 02:59:07,650
stop,
but it just happened.

4114
02:59:08,030 --> 02:59:13,030
Show just ended.
So all that time before then you were 

4115
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:13,030
writing for,
you know,

4116
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:14,070
why they would connect you to her.
It's crazy to think you don't.

4117
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,410
What I don't get is why that would be.

4118
02:59:15,560 --> 02:59:20,560
No,
I get why these fucking social jihadis 

4119
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:23,720
do it.
I don't get why normal people validated 

4120
02:59:23,720 --> 02:59:24,280
ever normal people.
It's outrageous to validate that people.

4121
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:27,540
What do you mean with the fucking.
Anybody fucking uh,

4122
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:28,340
uh,
can we.

4123
02:59:28,341 --> 02:59:29,520
Yes.
This needs to be addressed.

4124
02:59:29,521 --> 02:59:34,521
Amy,
will you please take the floor and 

4125
02:59:34,521 --> 02:59:34,521
address this adult man,
that's not your child.

4126
02:59:34,521 --> 02:59:38,160
I think they have to do that because 
she's thought of as a feminist and she's

4127
02:59:38,161 --> 02:59:41,490
thought of as a powerful woman,
a guy working for her.

4128
02:59:41,530 --> 02:59:46,530
I mean,
that's what the difference is because 

4129
02:59:46,530 --> 02:59:49,980
Jay was talking about,
I was talking about to Jay because he's 

4130
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:51,891
like,
I never get any because we sell like I 

4131
02:59:51,891 --> 02:59:54,100
was in.
Now I'm in the jurisdiction of them 

4132
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:54,750
because um,
because you were on these fucking people

4133
02:59:54,751 --> 02:59:58,170
in this religion,
but like they believe that's their,

4134
02:59:58,440 --> 03:00:03,440
like you serve at our pleasure and they,
and they get validated whenever someone 

4135
03:00:03,601 --> 03:00:05,430
and all these fucking dipshit liberals.

4136
03:00:05,970 --> 03:00:10,970
Okay,
because I'm a liberal dude or I don't 

4137
03:00:10,970 --> 03:00:10,970
know if I'm like the last of a fucking 
whatever,

4138
03:00:10,970 --> 03:00:12,960
but they all just pandered.
They're like,

4139
03:00:12,961 --> 03:00:13,740
well,
it's for the best.

4140
03:00:13,741 --> 03:00:15,570
Don't stumble.
Your brother just,

4141
03:00:15,780 --> 03:00:16,740
you're not sweating.
Yeah.

4142
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:18,930
There's a lot of people that are 
liberals feel the exact same way.

4143
03:00:18,931 --> 03:00:22,410
I don't feel like they're really 
liberals anymore because of the far left

4144
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:27,590
has taken over.
Like this space of what you can and 

4145
03:00:27,590 --> 03:00:27,590
can't say to the point where you're 
like,

4146
03:00:27,590 --> 03:00:31,610
really on the outs.
I don't get how they don't see trump as 

4147
03:00:31,610 --> 03:00:32,490
their guy.
Like at that part baffles me.

4148
03:00:32,840 --> 03:00:37,840
Like how do you even like just the 
stench be just based on these small 

4149
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:42,351
hands and pettiness and like,
well I think it's hilarious that as 

4150
03:00:42,351 --> 03:00:46,320
president I didn't tell you not to body 
shame shit on the hands.

4151
03:00:46,650 --> 03:00:51,650
It's one of the most ridiculous body 
shamings ever because they're not even 

4152
03:00:51,650 --> 03:00:51,650
that small.

4153
03:00:51,650 --> 03:00:53,160
I mean they're not like outrageously 
small hands,

4154
03:00:53,250 --> 03:00:55,140
so like when they say it over and over 
again,

4155
03:00:55,141 --> 03:00:57,780
just to fuck with them.
Clearly body shaming.

4156
03:00:57,960 --> 03:01:00,130
It's not like you're making fun of his 
hair.

4157
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:02,110
That's an obvious joke.
Every.

4158
03:01:02,170 --> 03:01:07,170
You can't ignore it,
but the hands like you're really going 

4159
03:01:07,170 --> 03:01:07,420
after him if you're making fun of his 
hand.

4160
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:11,090
People,
its location of course.

4161
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:12,580
That's the whole thing.
That's all it is.

4162
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,420
The hypocrisy.
But like if you see what like why scene?

4163
03:01:15,430 --> 03:01:17,590
It's like all these people were his best
pal.

4164
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:18,880
Oh yeah,
he is God.

4165
03:01:19,090 --> 03:01:22,580
And then he was like,
am I supposed to fall for this puppet?

4166
03:01:22,990 --> 03:01:25,570
I'm sorry,
Punch beat Judy this time people crying.

4167
03:01:25,571 --> 03:01:28,150
But like do you fall?
You cry pro wrestling.

4168
03:01:28,510 --> 03:01:30,520
This couldn't be more of.
They don't care though.

4169
03:01:30,521 --> 03:01:32,100
It's about power.
That's the thing that I had.

4170
03:01:32,130 --> 03:01:37,130
I had to figure out where it's like you 
can prove a contradiction and be like 

4171
03:01:37,130 --> 03:01:37,130
male strip just called them.

4172
03:01:37,130 --> 03:01:39,600
God don't you do that?
You,

4173
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:42,760
you engage with people online like 
crazy.

4174
03:01:42,761 --> 03:01:45,670
You go after people online and insult 
them like crazy.

4175
03:01:45,850 --> 03:01:47,470
You just did it.
We just started though.

4176
03:01:48,270 --> 03:01:51,010
Do you feel like you want to or if 
someone blocks you?

4177
03:01:51,190 --> 03:01:52,690
Yeah,
if somebody blocks you on twitter,

4178
03:01:52,691 --> 03:01:57,691
that's not an assault on you,
but you just go for and have enough 

4179
03:01:57,691 --> 03:02:00,451
information,
but think about what your saying people 

4180
03:02:00,451 --> 03:02:02,620
shouldn't do and then think about what 
you do and they very similar,

4181
03:02:02,830 --> 03:02:07,830
right?
You want to take his work or say he's a 

4182
03:02:07,830 --> 03:02:10,711
bad comic.
You can't be above it and in it that's 

4183
03:02:10,711 --> 03:02:10,711
just bottom line.
Can't be.

4184
03:02:10,711 --> 03:02:11,740
Yeah,
it's the same thing.

4185
03:02:11,741 --> 03:02:13,900
Everybody is just fucking attacking 
everybody.

4186
03:02:14,710 --> 03:02:17,860
Social War,
cannibalism going on.

4187
03:02:17,861 --> 03:02:22,861
There they are.
They allowed to speak to me out like you

4188
03:02:23,681 --> 03:02:28,681
can't look.
They went after her fucking Bruno Mars 

4189
03:02:28,681 --> 03:02:32,070
cultural appropriation,
Bruno Mars quotation appropriation 

4190
03:02:32,070 --> 03:02:33,250
because they're saying he's a 
cooperating black music.

4191
03:02:33,640 --> 03:02:38,640
He's half Filipino.
That was one of the biggest on the going

4192
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:44,800
and be plainly know Bruno Mars.
They're tagging Bruno Mars for cultural 

4193
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:46,840
appropriation and a bunch of black 
artists are defending him.

4194
03:02:46,841 --> 03:02:47,890
Like,
what in the fuck?

4195
03:02:48,670 --> 03:02:52,150
He's brown hair,
Jesus Christ.

4196
03:02:53,560 --> 03:02:58,560
The whole thing is so ridiculous.
It's not like he's a brown guy getting 

4197
03:02:58,560 --> 03:02:59,560
that dude.
It's a new thing.

4198
03:02:59,590 --> 03:03:01,780
He's not brown enough.
He's not dark enough.

4199
03:03:01,810 --> 03:03:03,460
Not from Africa.
Whatever the fuck it is.

4200
03:03:03,640 --> 03:03:06,040
If you do,
you can't be liberal enough.

4201
03:03:06,250 --> 03:03:09,670
We're going to get to like one state 
where some gender fluid,

4202
03:03:09,671 --> 03:03:14,671
transgender like half black 
Hermaphrodite,

4203
03:03:15,910 --> 03:03:20,910
but they're not left handed,
right handed privileged or the other guy

4204
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:28,200
brought in my head on race wars who was 
like very funny and get on the show and 

4205
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:29,160
like hit the worst philosophy I heard on
gnomes podcast.

4206
03:03:29,620 --> 03:03:34,620
I saw me out of the seller's like some 
white male club and it's not the most 

4207
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:35,320
diverse.
You know,

4208
03:03:35,321 --> 03:03:37,180
like if I had a riding in cars to 
comics,

4209
03:03:37,181 --> 03:03:39,580
it would be very diverse because that's 
just who you hang out with.

4210
03:03:39,610 --> 03:03:44,610
I think that dude just talks a lot.
He says some shit that doesn't make any 

4211
03:03:44,610 --> 03:03:47,791
sense.
He went after me and who the fuck was 

4212
03:03:47,791 --> 03:03:47,791
it?
Something he was seeing?

4213
03:03:47,791 --> 03:03:50,770
Very nice conversation.
Totally out of context.

4214
03:03:50,980 --> 03:03:53,190
We were talking about how many,
um,

4215
03:03:53,350 --> 03:03:58,350
when kids get molested,
how many of those kids become molesters 

4216
03:03:58,350 --> 03:03:58,350
and we were trying to figure

4217
03:03:58,350 --> 03:03:59,930
out like that is a real thing that does 
happen.

4218
03:03:59,931 --> 03:04:04,931
Also where you get ingrained somehow or 
another into a homosexual being aroused 

4219
03:04:06,770 --> 03:04:11,770
homosexual rights,
what would you call it?

4220
03:04:12,950 --> 03:04:15,890
A boner boyfriend know that people get 
like,

4221
03:04:16,220 --> 03:04:18,160
it's not the same as what you're talking
about.

4222
03:04:18,161 --> 03:04:21,380
Like young people when young people are 
going through their development,

4223
03:04:21,381 --> 03:04:26,381
if they get arrested,
it is entirely possible or $300 but not 

4224
03:04:26,381 --> 03:04:31,241
even molested.
If they just have a sexual experience 

4225
03:04:31,241 --> 03:04:31,610
with a guy,
maybe if you can shape somebody's entire

4226
03:04:31,611 --> 03:04:36,611
fucking shit gets printed out that he 
said a bunch of tweets about like us 

4227
03:04:36,770 --> 03:04:41,770
wondering like two straight guys 
wondering how many gay guys became gay 

4228
03:04:41,770 --> 03:04:42,320
because they got fucked when they were 
kids.

4229
03:04:42,770 --> 03:04:44,630
Like,
well that's not what we said,

4230
03:04:44,930 --> 03:04:49,930
but that is a study and I saw it printed
that I copy and pasted the url for an 

4231
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:52,970
actual study on that.

4232
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Like how many times people are molested 
and they wind up becoming homosexual or 

4233
03:04:59,451 --> 03:05:04,451
becoming a molester themselves.
Those are two real distinct 

4234
03:05:04,451 --> 03:05:06,770
possibilities when you completely 
disrupt a child's sexual cycle,

4235
03:05:06,920 --> 03:05:11,920
who's saying it's bad or they're not 
making a judgment call a off of your 

4236
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:15,830
desk.
It's exactly because there's something 

4237
03:05:15,830 --> 03:05:18,760
that happens to people when they get 
sexually molested and most of it's 

4238
03:05:18,760 --> 03:05:20,240
really bad and hypersexuality is another
one.

4239
03:05:20,241 --> 03:05:22,340
People become very sexual.
There's a lot of weird,

4240
03:05:22,400 --> 03:05:27,290
so we weren't in any way saying that gay
people are only gay because of that.

4241
03:05:27,330 --> 03:05:30,620
I wonder is it all.
It's been studied by scientists,

4242
03:05:31,030 --> 03:05:36,030
the shit about that.
It's just as good as name attached to 

4243
03:05:36,030 --> 03:05:36,030
get it,
so that's why the seller thing,

4244
03:05:36,030 --> 03:05:38,300
but I gladly would have.
Mom makes me.

4245
03:05:38,301 --> 03:05:41,720
It makes me more careful with what I say
though and I think that's the good thing

4246
03:05:41,721 --> 03:05:46,721
about it,
so to leave it in the past had been way 

4247
03:05:46,721 --> 03:05:46,721
more careless with how I say thanks.

4248
03:05:46,820 --> 03:05:49,190
To think that it wouldn't be 
misconstrued,

4249
03:05:49,191 --> 03:05:54,191
especially not weaponized.
Well due to apologies are not to the 

4250
03:05:54,191 --> 03:05:56,090
people that hate you because they want 
you dead and there's no.

4251
03:05:56,390 --> 03:06:00,140
It's for people that like you don't 
understand.

4252
03:06:00,380 --> 03:06:05,380
That's what you apologized for.
The people that are against you or 

4253
03:06:05,380 --> 03:06:06,260
they're not comedy fans are learning 
too,

4254
03:06:06,261 --> 03:06:11,261
right?
So through this whole dark journey that 

4255
03:06:11,261 --> 03:06:11,300
you went on with all this bullshit,
you did learn that though.

4256
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:13,430
So it's very valuable.
Yeah.

4257
03:06:13,431 --> 03:06:15,380
No dues.
Barry Barry is very helpful to me.

4258
03:06:15,381 --> 03:06:20,381
I know.
But you going through all this and 

4259
03:06:20,381 --> 03:06:21,110
coming out on the other side,
the experience of doing it.

4260
03:06:21,290 --> 03:06:21,950
Yeah,
dude,

4261
03:06:22,420 --> 03:06:27,420
uh,
made a lot of things that I kinda was 

4262
03:06:27,420 --> 03:06:27,560
told earlier that never made sense to 
me.

4263
03:06:27,561 --> 03:06:30,710
Make a lot of like,
I remember last time we hung out Patrice

4264
03:06:30,710 --> 03:06:35,710
Shit.
He said to me that I didn't understand 

4265
03:06:35,710 --> 03:06:37,901
the magnitude of what he was saying to 
me until then how so like what kind of 

4266
03:06:37,901 --> 03:06:39,830
stuff.
Just know what a devil businesses is and

4267
03:06:39,831 --> 03:06:42,110
how easy you get fooled into the brass 
ring.

4268
03:06:42,111 --> 03:06:44,660
It makes you a coward when they give you
stuff to,

4269
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:47,000
to let you know that that's true.
But here's the thing,

4270
03:06:47,060 --> 03:06:50,090
I think that's less the case now.
And this is my case,

4271
03:06:50,240 --> 03:06:55,240
I think because of the Internet,
I think comics essentially have created 

4272
03:06:55,240 --> 03:06:55,750
a network of each other.
That's exactly right.

4273
03:06:55,830 --> 03:06:59,970
Think of the network of race wars or 
skeptic tank or family.

4274
03:06:59,971 --> 03:07:02,700
Our Joey Diaz is a church of what's 
happening now.

4275
03:07:03,330 --> 03:07:04,860
We're all in a network together.

4276
03:07:05,190 --> 03:07:05,580
Dude,
I,

4277
03:07:05,581 --> 03:07:10,581
I learned a lot.
The main thing is that because I only 

4278
03:07:10,581 --> 03:07:11,170
really got work in his business because 
of comics,

4279
03:07:11,171 --> 03:07:11,670
there was not the

4280
03:07:11,880 --> 03:07:15,890
history now,
which is really important,

4281
03:07:15,891 --> 03:07:18,290
more so than ever.
You can filter down thing,

4282
03:07:18,460 --> 03:07:23,460
but the network is an organic network.
Instead of someone owning you or having 

4283
03:07:23,460 --> 03:07:24,030
a contract with you,
great.

4284
03:07:24,110 --> 03:07:24,820
They're like,
oh,

4285
03:07:24,830 --> 03:07:26,480
it's fucking funny.
Be like,

4286
03:07:26,481 --> 03:07:27,620
go see him.
Oh,

4287
03:07:27,670 --> 03:07:29,240
Gertz hilarious.
Go see him,

4288
03:07:29,390 --> 03:07:30,020
you know,
make us.

4289
03:07:30,770 --> 03:07:35,770
And so then people listen to your 
podcast or to listen to your specialty 

4290
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:35,770
of,
Oh,

4291
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:39,851
this guy's fucking hilarious.
And we've told them the truth so many 

4292
03:07:39,851 --> 03:07:43,151
times that they believe.
And then the other thing about podcasts 

4293
03:07:43,151 --> 03:07:46,541
that I think is amazing and then just 
the Internet in general with comics 

4294
03:07:46,541 --> 03:07:49,301
today,
is it everybody supportive of each 

4295
03:07:49,301 --> 03:07:49,301
other?
When someone has a special coming out,

4296
03:07:49,301 --> 03:07:50,270
I see other people tweeting,
go check this out.

4297
03:07:50,820 --> 03:07:53,870
Yeah,
all the time was great about that.

4298
03:07:53,871 --> 03:07:55,370
So it was Ari,
but these people are,

4299
03:07:55,371 --> 03:07:57,080
you know,
nobody ever did that in the past.

4300
03:07:58,570 --> 03:08:01,930
I feel like if I like somebody,
should I go out of my way to compliment

4301
03:08:02,400 --> 03:08:04,990
out there.
It's like bitcoin.

4302
03:08:05,050 --> 03:08:07,360
It's a decentralized currency now.
A little bit.

4303
03:08:07,380 --> 03:08:08,320
Yeah,
it's a little bit.

4304
03:08:08,321 --> 03:08:13,321
And there's less of this golden ring.
So that golden ring is just fucking 

4305
03:08:13,321 --> 03:08:13,321
acting.
Okay.

4306
03:08:13,321 --> 03:08:15,460
That's what it is.
And it was not acting.

4307
03:08:15,461 --> 03:08:20,461
It's writing about acting.
It's like reading the scripts about 

4308
03:08:20,461 --> 03:08:21,340
complaints or casting complaints.
Not Stand up.

4309
03:08:21,350 --> 03:08:22,600
Complaints.
Not Our world,

4310
03:08:22,601 --> 03:08:24,400
man.
The problem is we fuck up.

4311
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:27,340
We go to that world.
Our world is inappropriate.

4312
03:08:27,341 --> 03:08:29,800
Shit said behind closed doors making 
each other laugh.

4313
03:08:29,801 --> 03:08:32,380
I'm not a teacher.
Terrible class.

4314
03:08:32,470 --> 03:08:34,410
I'm not here to help the class.
We're,

4315
03:08:34,460 --> 03:08:37,090
we're in the green room doing mushrooms,
smoking pot,

4316
03:08:37,360 --> 03:08:42,360
drinking whiskey,
and then we go on stage and talk crazy 

4317
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:42,580
shit because this is our world.
Our world is not the casting couch.

4318
03:08:42,700 --> 03:08:47,700
Our world is nothing to do with 
auditions or this whole fucking acting 

4319
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:52,090
like the way actors talk to each other 
and actor speak.

4320
03:08:52,210 --> 03:08:53,460
That's not our world.
Now.

4321
03:08:53,650 --> 03:08:55,090
We're not doing it.
We're not.

4322
03:08:55,300 --> 03:08:56,190
This is,
this is it.

4323
03:08:56,210 --> 03:08:59,590
It's a different world.
We're trying to come up with shit.

4324
03:08:59,591 --> 03:09:02,560
That's funny so that people laugh 
because we liked that

4325
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:07,740
because I believe the last thing is 
barry said to me because they wanted to 

4326
03:09:07,740 --> 03:09:10,021
take his special awful Louis site,
which you wouldn't do because Barry's 

4327
03:09:10,021 --> 03:09:11,920
like a stand up dude.
I wouldn't like go with the crowds.

4328
03:09:11,921 --> 03:09:13,190
Trendy horseshit.
Like He.

4329
03:09:13,191 --> 03:09:15,040
He had principles,
but he's like,

4330
03:09:15,041 --> 03:09:20,041
I'm so sick of the untalented hijacking 
of very real trauma to a lot of people 

4331
03:09:20,141 --> 03:09:23,080
to further their dump Korea.
He's dead on about that.

4332
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:25,540
It's people.
It's like people.

4333
03:09:25,570 --> 03:09:26,680
Because you know,
by the way,

4334
03:09:27,300 --> 03:09:29,740
the stats when they go one in five 
people are rapes.

4335
03:09:29,741 --> 03:09:31,030
Okay.
Or women are raped.

4336
03:09:31,390 --> 03:09:34,330
I think that's probably just the amount 
of men that are raped and women could be

4337
03:09:34,331 --> 03:09:35,350
double that.
Okay.

4338
03:09:35,351 --> 03:09:40,351
I think it's so prevalent,
but just based on the people I know in 

4339
03:09:40,351 --> 03:09:40,351
my life.
Okay.

4340
03:09:40,351 --> 03:09:44,491
That's something happened to.
It's weird for something not to what 

4341
03:09:44,491 --> 03:09:44,491
happen to you.

4342
03:09:44,491 --> 03:09:47,040
You see what Tim Dillon wrote about all 
this after the whole Louis thing.

4343
03:09:47,200 --> 03:09:51,570
When Tim Dillon wrote a brilliant piece,
I think he wrote it on facebook,

4344
03:09:51,810 --> 03:09:54,370
but then he put it on instagram and 
broke it up into pages

4345
03:09:54,370 --> 03:09:59,370
so that you can keep turning through it,
but he's explaining how this is an 

4346
03:09:59,370 --> 03:10:02,191
opportunity for truly mediocre talent to
chop down someone who was head and 

4347
03:10:02,191 --> 03:10:06,961
shoulders far better than that and they 
do so by claiming the moral high ground 

4348
03:10:06,961 --> 03:10:11,640
by virtue signaling,
by like going after him and attacking 

4349
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:11,640
him,
breaking down what he did.

4350
03:10:11,650 --> 03:10:13,980
Or you can tell people's character by 
who wanted to get there.

4351
03:10:13,981 --> 03:10:17,620
A little kick in.
The same thing happen to me it was.

4352
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:19,210
I was,
but you know,

4353
03:10:19,211 --> 03:10:20,680
a lot of my friends are my friends,
man.

4354
03:10:20,681 --> 03:10:21,790
I'm lucky.
Like I'm not.

4355
03:10:21,880 --> 03:10:26,880
I lost respect for a lot of people 
during this whole thing and I'll tell 

4356
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:26,880
you who they are as soon as we shut this
fucking show down.

4357
03:10:27,210 --> 03:10:28,780
It's already 3:19.
Oh Shit.

4358
03:10:29,490 --> 03:10:30,570
You Fuck?
Yeah.

4359
03:10:30,580 --> 03:10:32,290
Oh and Benjamin.
As long as you promise.

4360
03:10:32,350 --> 03:10:37,350
Leave Anthony Jeselnik alone.
Son of a bitch get pluggy special.

4361
03:10:39,240 --> 03:10:41,220
A huge penis to Dotcom.
It's called,

4362
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:43,720
how dare me.
It pns like he plays the piano.

4363
03:10:44,040 --> 03:10:45,320
Yes.
All right.

4364
03:10:45,340 --> 03:10:45,930
Sorry,
go ahead.

4365
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:48,860
Oh,
oh,

4366
03:10:48,880 --> 03:10:51,010
it's my website.
Huge pns to.com.

4367
03:10:51,011 --> 03:10:52,100
The name of it is,
um,

4368
03:10:52,470 --> 03:10:53,800
uh,
how dare me shot.

4369
03:10:53,801 --> 03:10:56,000
And uh,
in my town that I live in your gut,

4370
03:10:56,040 --> 03:10:56,860
in our call,
white,

4371
03:10:56,900 --> 03:10:58,720
fresher than comedy central I made a 
while ago.

4372
03:10:59,020 --> 03:11:01,420
People just now we've seen so far I 
haven't seen it.

4373
03:11:01,430 --> 03:11:02,680
See it.
I want to see it now.

4374
03:11:02,730 --> 03:11:03,260
Where,
uh,

4375
03:11:03,310 --> 03:11:08,310
when did they film this?
She was like fucking 2015 and it's on 

4376
03:11:08,310 --> 03:11:10,240
comedy central.
Is it on Netflix or any of those places?

4377
03:11:10,360 --> 03:11:11,680
It's on Netflix.
It's a,

4378
03:11:12,390 --> 03:11:14,720
it's probably pirated.
Go pirate it.

4379
03:11:14,790 --> 03:11:16,600
It's too,
it's a CD.

4380
03:11:16,601 --> 03:11:17,290
Like,
dude,

4381
03:11:17,291 --> 03:11:22,291
I just realize you're like the Doug 
Stanhope of upstate New York who do 

4382
03:11:22,291 --> 03:11:22,480
stand up in your town?
I do.

4383
03:11:22,810 --> 03:11:23,950
That's what Doug does.

4384
03:11:23,950 --> 03:11:28,540
That's a duck does down in Brisbane due 
to third of the whole booking Yakov.

4385
03:11:28,541 --> 03:11:33,541
SMIRNOFF is his grandson.
There's a big Doug Paul Bunyan,

4386
03:11:35,950 --> 03:11:40,950
crazy checkered plaid.
Arizona did one and three people came to

4387
03:11:41,411 --> 03:11:42,970
the taping.
Like that's a lot.

4388
03:11:43,030 --> 03:11:47,530
That's an amazing story.
I do because I moved here to la,

4389
03:11:47,531 --> 03:11:49,120
so I'm doing race where?
West Coast.

4390
03:11:49,180 --> 03:11:52,380
Oh Shit.
We just got to know you.

4391
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:54,220
Totally moved here.
When did you totally move here?

4392
03:11:54,250 --> 03:11:55,990
Don't tell anybody what you live for a 
few months ago.

4393
03:11:56,340 --> 03:11:59,640
You still going to storm the fucking 
Improv main room.

4394
03:11:59,670 --> 03:12:00,490
All right,
that's it.

4395
03:12:00,700 --> 03:12:03,730
Goodbye everybody.
Thanks everybody came out this weekend.

4396
03:12:03,731 --> 03:12:04,910
We had a great time.
Bye.
