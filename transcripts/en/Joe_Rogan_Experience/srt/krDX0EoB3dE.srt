00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,700
That's why my whole
thing grow your own shit.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,241
You know,

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:06,661
and not,

5
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:07,291
you don't have an end.

6
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:07,710
Like you said,

7
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,690
you don't have to grow
everything yourself.

8
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,900
Right.

9
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,390
But if you do it collectively
with your neighbors,

10
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,160
that's what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,380
It's like where you
growing the apples and the,

12
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:20,140
and the carrots and Sally down the
street is going some chart and rhubarb or

13
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:20,974
whatever the hell.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So now you can trade food and I can send
my son to Yo spot until Yo give me some

15
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,550
carrots do from Joe's house and that's,

16
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,550
and vice versa.

17
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:29,821
You know,

18
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,890
you can send them over to my
house and get some onions.

19
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,180
That's what I see,

20
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:33,510
man.

21
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,771
That's,

22
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:34,471
that's what it was.

23
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:38,850
So you have eliminated a couple of systems
there and you've created community,

24
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,470
you created partnerships,

25
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,940
you create a business without,

26
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,850
without the money exchange and to,

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,470
and you've created safety,

28
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,371
you know,

29
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,090
so,

30
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,020
so that's,

31
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,430
and it's so damn simple to me and I
guess it's going take me while it's so

32
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,420
simple that it's like,

33
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,220
but you guys know this,

34
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,054
right?

35
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:57,991
You know?

36
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,170
Yeah.

37
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,003
That's what's cool.

38
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,190
You're not talking about
something that's like,

39
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,990
just been discovered,

40
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,560
some new technology that has
recently been released to the public.

41
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,360
Yes,

42
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,841
yes,

43
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:09,201
yes.

44
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,034
And that's,

45
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,420
that's why as to me,

46
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:11,750
it's,

47
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,390
it's still somewhat mind boggling.

48
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,890
You know,

49
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,360
it's 100% mind boggling.

50
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,560
And what you said about community as
giant because I think people live in this

51
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,230
weird place now where we
barely even know our neighbors.

52
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:23,920
You know?

53
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,050
And the more populated the areas are,

54
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,850
the less likely you are to know your name.

55
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,711
And that's what I'm saying.

56
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,060
That's where the safety comes in.

57
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,780
Cause I know,

58
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,990
I know your son and I know he shouldn't
be doing that and I know he should wait.

59
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,730
Yo Dude.

60
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,450
So I know,

61
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,050
you know,

62
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,890
so that's what,

63
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,330
that's where the safety comes in.

64
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,471
Right.

65
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,030
And that's where,

66
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,890
that's where the neighbor hood and that's
where community comes in and that's

67
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,260
what caring for one another comes in.

68
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,190
And um,

69
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,040
it's,

70
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,360
it's,

71
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,761
to me,

72
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:48,920
it's,

73
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,320
it's,

74
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,160
we can do it,

75
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,851
it can happen.

76
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,301
I mean it's,

77
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:52,170
there's too many,

78
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,880
there's too many examples
of this happening.

79
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,450
Now.

80
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,970
I've been talking about this on stage.

81
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,380
I think that once they
develop artificial men,

82
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,450
like artificial human beings,

83
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,500
like blade runner style,

84
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,383
it's going to come.

85
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,030
There's going to be women that have sex
robots in their house and we're going to

86
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,280
find out what women really like when,

87
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:08,611
when,

88
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:13,611
when you can actually buy a person that
is an artificial person that was created

89
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,760
entirely in a lab and you
could manufacture their
personality and get it to

90
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:25,470
exactly where you want it to be and have
them do anything you want them to do.

91
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,240
They're essentially robot sex slaves.

92
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,900
You're going to go over your grandma's
house and she's going to have five,

93
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,530
seven foot tall Zulu warriors
had just throw decoder all day.

94
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,780
That's going to be the reality.

95
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,921
That's what it's going to be.

96
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:40,980
You're going to go over your mom's
house and everyone is going to look like

97
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,220
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime and
they're all going to be walking around

98
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,550
with like Whitey tighties on
a giant hogs at black Arnold.

99
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,360
Maybe.

100
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,830
Maybe she likes them all mixed up.

101
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,210
Maybe she likes Arnold.

102
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:51,821
Maybe it'll,

103
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,530
it'll be Arnold.

104
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,500
I mean they'll going to be
able to recreate celebrities.

105
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,131
I mean,

106
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,980
Jennifer Lawrence is not just
going to be on the cloud.

107
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,850
You're going to have her
in your fucking dungeon.

108
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,290
You're going to have her locked up.

109
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,120
That's going to be real.

110
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:04,541
Look,

111
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,040
it's not that difficult to do.

112
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,920
If they can make a three d
representation of her right now,

113
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,090
which is pretty accurate.

114
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,430
I mean the graphics that they can do
right now in video games are fucking

115
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:18,160
credible and the CGI that
can do is incredible.

116
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,250
And then you've seen that robot Japanese
face where it's getting pretty creepy.

117
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,420
It's getting pretty creepy.

118
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,580
They're getting really
close to human beings.

119
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,630
Well you went from uh,

120
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,510
having the Porsche Rs,

121
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,440
the 4.0

122
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,353
and then you went,

123
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,231
did you get a five,

124
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:34,441
nine,

125
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:35,270
nine,

126
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,640
$5?

127
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,230
I mean that's not goes down in history,

128
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,660
doesn't it as possibly the
worst financial move ever.

129
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,010
I couldn't believe you did that.

130
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:41,670
First of all.

131
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,151
First of all,

132
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:45,060
get rid of like one of the
greatest Porsche's ever.

133
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,320
We agreed we weren't
going to talk about that.

134
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,400
It's just not fair.

135
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,031
It's just not fair.

136
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:48,990
You can't remind me of that.

137
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:49,760
That's like saying,

138
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,830
it's like me saying you had a,

139
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,091
you know,

140
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:52,840
you'll go from was
Heidi Klum or something,

141
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,350
isn't it?

142
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,720
I think they remind me of that.

143
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,590
You got rid of one of the greatest cars
ever that's worth so much money now.

144
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,180
That's the crazy thing,

145
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:00,990
right?

146
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,070
How much are they worth now?

147
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,280
I saw one for sale for 275,000 American.

148
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,731
Oh,

149
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:06,810
that with much more than that.

150
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,231
Yeah.

151
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:07,771
And the UK,

152
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,890
they're worth well over $350,000.

153
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,850
Wow.

154
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,091
Um,

155
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:13,740
so I did a right out of mine.

156
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,041
Hey,

157
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:14,241
look,

158
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:14,420
I,

159
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,710
I take a very philosophical
view about this stuff.

160
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,390
I got to own a fully TRS.

161
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,940
I did things with it that not
many people that own $40 is,

162
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:22,351
I've done,

163
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:23,340
I did big journeys.

164
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:24,120
I used it a lot.

165
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,870
There's a video of it stood up on youtube
of it being driven in a completely

166
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:28,704
ludicrous manner.

167
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,783
That was my car.

168
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,750
Um,

169
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,680
it made me money.

170
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,460
Um,

171
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,290
that was a pretty nice thing to happen.

172
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,850
And at the time I didn't have any money.

173
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,180
You know,

174
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,890
I bet the House on that thing,

175
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,690
I used the last bit of cash,

176
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,040
I had to put the deposit down.

177
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,380
I didn't meet the financial
criteria from Porsche,

178
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,430
so I had to beg,

179
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,230
steal and borrow to get
them to lend me the money.

180
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,700
And then the payments were well over
£1,000 a month and I wasn't earning much

181
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,534
money at the time,

182
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,770
so I couldn't really afford it.

183
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,030
I sort of kept going for,

184
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,160
I think we had it for a year and a bit,

185
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,720
and then I just had the set age.

186
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,340
It was just basic economics.

187
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,360
I couldn't afford the finance.

188
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,620
But then after that,

189
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,240
about six months after that,

190
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,470
I started earning a bit more money.

191
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,510
I had a couple of contracts
that were quite good.

192
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,591
I had a bit of money.

193
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:10,200
And of course the medical condition
means the moment you've got money,

194
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,490
you go straight out and buy a car,

195
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,030
don't you?

196
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,930
I didn't need a five,

197
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:13,171
nine,

198
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:13,830
nine.

199
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,630
It was absolute nonsense.

200
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,800
It costs me a fortune.

201
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:17,700
I lost a load of money.

202
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm probably lost half the money
I'd made on the port in it,

203
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,600
but I'd always wanted a five nine nine I,

204
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,130
I'm,

205
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,160
I view life as a series of boxes to tick.

206
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

207
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,040
And it's quite binary.

208
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,790
It's just a series of ones and
noughts and that's what I want to do.

209
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,190
And the 42 box had been ticked.

210
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:35,580
You know,

211
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:35,740
I,

212
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,573
I don't,

213
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,260
I don't really derive any pleasure
from sitting and telling a room full of

214
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,760
people that I've got a 42 IRS.

215
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,660
I wouldn't,

216
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,280
I derive pleasure from driving it.

217
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,050
But once I had driven it quite a bit,

218
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,120
I can't kind of done it,

219
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,610
you know,

220
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,170
and I'm,

221
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,090
I'm lucky in that I can
kind of use them to the,

222
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,740
to the full extent of their abilities.

223
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:55,260
That's a nice thing to
know that you can do that.

224
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:58,490
You've driven a 42 rest to 100 of
his ability as a nice thing to know.

225
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,593
And I'd done that.

226
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,160
And then I thought I quite like a five,

227
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,341
nine,

228
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,450
nine and the nine had the five nine,

229
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,180
nine for a year and realized that
it was actually just too big.

230
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,320
And too fast for UK rose,

231
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,980
but I tick that box and then the next
box to tick was probably a five 12 tr or

232
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,814
something like that,

233
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,150
or m three or there's
just so much out there.

234
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,590
It's a bit like walking into a bookshop.

235
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,670
You need to know where to start.

236
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,710
D and I love that about the subjects
I've got caught endlessly fascinating and

237
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,780
looking for the next thing
that I want to enjoy it.

238
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,231
Yeah,

239
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,130
it is amazing.

240
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,160
And I think that when the f the football
players have all demonstrated this

241
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,130
consistent pattern of brain trauma,

242
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,431
you know,

243
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,010
if they kissed each other all the time
and they're trying to figure out how to

244
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:37,641
mitigate that,

245
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,140
but along the way,

246
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,610
the data becomes undeniable.

247
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,080
So now they're at that same
spot where they're like,

248
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,000
the tobacco companies were okay,

249
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,170
cigarettes cause cancer,

250
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,340
but we still want it to be legal,

251
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,611
you know?

252
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:46,851
Okay,

253
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:47,181
okay.

254
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,830
Football causes brain damage,

255
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,910
but we still want to play it.

256
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,230
Do you guys still want to play football?

257
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,250
Who wants to make money?

258
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,300
Make money,

259
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,451
right?

260
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,100
You're worried about getting
hit and had a couple of times,

261
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,401
okay,

262
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,380
we're going to do my best
to not hit heads together,

263
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,990
but we're playing fucking
football because when man,

264
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,541
right,

265
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,540
that's what happens and dudes
will fucking march out there,

266
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,374
bro.

267
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,570
I'll fucking keep banging heads.

268
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,680
I'll still bang heads.

269
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm going to fucking bang heads
and get penalized for animals.

270
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,574
We're savages.

271
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Especially like when you
are just a complete stud
athlete and you're involved in

272
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:24,690
this ultra competitive world of trying
to dominate other stud athletes and spike

273
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:29,390
balls in their face and
they're just fucking out there.

274
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,603
They're going to play.

275
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,630
I got gotta admit,

276
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:37,010
I just visualize this super stud athletes
spiking the ball and I got a little

277
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,410
turned off so I can
understand why they do it.

278
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,930
I can understand you.

279
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,400
Imagine that's you when you see what,

280
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,570
I don't watch as much football,

281
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,710
but I love highlight reels.

282
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,410
I love watching ESPN because
they'll show like the best shit.

283
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,790
I don't have time to.

284
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,080
I don't understand the downs.

285
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:51,711
I really don't.

286
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,670
I don't even know the rules.

287
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
I don't know the rules of football.

288
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,711
Neither do I.

289
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,790
So we're on the same boat twos.

290
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,780
You're calling flags.

291
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:56,991
I'm like,

292
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,100
what is all this rest?

293
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,450
Why is everybody resting?

294
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,490
There should be just constant chaos.

295
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,210
I would want to see it like an MMA bow.

296
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,930
Just fucking five guys on this side.

297
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:07,430
Five guys on that side moved the ball,

298
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,990
go chaos,

299
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:09,824
craziness.

300
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,880
No breaks.

301
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,110
When you get it across,

302
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,780
you fucking march it back the
other way and do it that way.

303
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:15,800
And no breaks,

304
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,490
no breaks,

305
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,080
no this whistle blowing.

306
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,030
And that white guy off the fucking field,

307
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,190
that little tiny white
guy with the white outfit,

308
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,390
he's going to get killed.

309
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,330
So he's going to accidentally run over
that fucker and he's going to die.

310
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,710
This 300 pound men on who knows God,

311
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:35,240
what kind of concoctions that are made
in laboratories that have allowed them to

312
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,170
grow so big.

313
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:36,660
Okay.
