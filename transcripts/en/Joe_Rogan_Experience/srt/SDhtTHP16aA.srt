1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,340
Fighting the nonsense of the world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,020
the Godfather's back high.
Then anybody can get to see you.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,390
What's going on?
What's going on?

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,310
I'm here in southern California,
shaped.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,570
I escaped minus 30 with windshield last
week.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,890
Didn't leave the house from Friday to
Monday with the wind chill factors minus

7
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,620
30 or it's actually minus 30 with the
Windchill,

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,470
so I'd say it's minus 15.
Would windshield minus 30?

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,790
You guys have become too soft and
southern California.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,120
One hundred percent.
What do you mean become been too soft?

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,160
Yeah.
This is a ridiculous place to live.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,860
Well,
I don't know about that.

13
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,630
Is this is like a lottery winner place
to live.

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,360
It's like the weather lottery and these
people,

15
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,790
they don't understand what weather is.
They're just running around.

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,220
I swear to God.
If it gets 50 here,

17
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,730
people start complaining that I've seen
weather advisories when I used to live

18
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:57,550
here,
whether it'd be a 10 minute spell of

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,190
rain and they'd be endless warnings.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,170
Be careful.
Careful,

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,440
careful.
Be careful.

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,700
You know we go through blizzards.
There is one reason for that though.

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,330
The oil slick on.
Yeah.

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,580
When it doesn't rain for a long time,
all the oil from people's cars,

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,940
the residue gets on the road and as soon
as just a little bit of water gets on

26
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:19,210
that it gets really slippery and that
that is reality,

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,920
but still before we start,
before we said last time when I was

28
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:27,010
here,
it was on your birthday and some guy

29
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,910
wrote in a very non Semitic way,
here it goes,

30
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:34,870
God being a Jew not giving Joe Rogan a
gift on his birthday.

31
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:39,871
So I thought that I would correct that
by giving you a signed copy of one of my

32
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:42,400
books.
So there you go.

33
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,220
There you go.
To consuming instinct.

34
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:47,020
Now you can grow.
What?

35
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,070
Juicy Burgers,
Ferrari's pornography and gift giving

36
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,050
reveal about human nature.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,830
There you go,
buddy,

38
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,830
by and signed by the Godfather.
So very exciting.

39
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,600
Yeah,
well you can't read those.

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,850
Those things that people say those mean
things.

41
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,820
I try to avoid them,
but once in awhile I get sucked in and

42
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,430
they can piss me off.
Well,

43
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,930
I always equate it to snake venom.
It's like a.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,320
If you get a little bit of snake venom,
you get you get immune to it and get

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,960
accustomed to it.
Whereas if you get a big burst of it,

46
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,330
it can poison you,
so if you just get a little bit of it

47
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:24,520
every now and then when a big burst
comes your way,

48
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:27,030
like someone calling you,
achieved you until you go,

49
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,620
you motherfucker,
it doesn't work anymore.

50
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,080
You know,
he just realize there's a lot of people

51
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,440
out there that a lot of the reason why
they're saying these mean things because

52
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:38,710
they're trying to find something that
they can say that will get you to

53
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:39,370
respond.

54
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,210
Exactly.
Right.

55
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,800
That's a big part of it.
So what.

56
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,380
So recently,
the latest one is.

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,280
So somebody trolls you endlessly in a
very polite manner.

58
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,180
Right?
Okay.

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,160
Usually I,
sometimes I try to engage them,

60
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,070
but I find them really.
I know it's ridiculous,

61
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,480
man.
You're again,

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,930
you're an actual professor.
I am in the legitimate university.

63
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,180
I'm indeed.
Isn't it crazy that I would even

64
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,510
entertain their Saturday.
So once in a while I get sucked into the

65
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,350
trap there and polite.
So after awhile I blocked them.

66
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,110
So these guys then,
because I've blocked them,

67
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,060
start going around saying,
well,

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,690
you know,
he,

69
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,420
he's a supposedly a proponent of freedom
of speech,

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
yet he blocks me as though I'm the
purveyor of freedom of speech,

71
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,874
right?
I mean,

72
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,690
I'm not allowed to come to your house,
breaking into your house and start

73
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,560
calling you names and if you stopped me,
I accuse you of not supporting free

74
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:29,950
speech.

75
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,240
Right?
But in their minds,

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,120
if I block them simply because I no
longer want to engage them,

77
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,690
I am going,
I am being a hypocrite because I'm not

78
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,990
supporting their freedom to insult me.
See,

79
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,910
again,
I have to go back to what I said

80
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,970
earlier,
why you're so smart.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,833
Like what,
what,

82
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,900
how is this even getting into your mind?
Can I tell you what it is?

83
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,580
Oftentimes,
yes.

84
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,610
I find that galling that somebody could
be so insulting calling.

85
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,550
Does that word mean like a,
right?

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,910
Yes.
Right.

87
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:05,080
I mean we interact.
You and I with a million people a day

88
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,240
with most of the people.
They're lovely.

89
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,490
They're sweet,
they're polite.

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
They might.
Vast majority.

91
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,630
Right?
So.

92
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,630
So when you get this individual who
simply can't modulate his behavior to

93
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,700
even sort of adhere to the most basic
social norms,

94
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:22,150
once in a while I just get pissed off,
but usually I'm able to avoid it.

95
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Well,
you shouldn't even once in a while,

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,790
look,
first of all,

97
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,820
you got to realize that an anonymity is
a really confusing thing for people,

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,190
right?
It's the ability to communicate with

99
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,080
people.
Anonymous has never existed before,

100
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,140
right?
Other than some serial killer,

101
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:42,070
making some note by cutting out little
pieces of paper or the newspaper and you

102
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,330
know,
using the words from that,

103
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,240
there's no anonymity man.
It doesn't.

104
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,590
It doesn't exist.
Right?

105
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,260
So when you have anonymity in the form
of like you have a twitter account and

106
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:56,470
it's just an egg and you call yourself
fuck mcgee and you just start trolling.

107
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,540
The Godfather makes no sense.
It's,

108
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,100
well it's,
you know,

109
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,900
that's not a normal interaction.
It's the,

110
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,950
there shouldn't be a method or someone
could just contact you like that because

111
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,620
our,
our bodies and our minds and our,

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,820
all our systems,
our social systems,

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,230
they're just not set up for that.

114
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,600
So it's,
it's saying rude things without

115
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:17,470
consequence,
you're,

116
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,670
you're basically,
you're offering,

117
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,960
by the way,
an evolutionary argument.

118
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,130
Yes,
that's exactly right.

119
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,310
But it's a completely new thing that we
really just don't have the mechanisms

120
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,960
for which we're not.
We're not accustomed to it.

121
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,270
We don't really have a long history of
it.

122
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,550
I mean we have a history of just doing
this.

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,020
The realistic history at the extreme
level is 20 years,

124
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,010
94 dash 96 ish,
somewhere around then when it started.

125
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,850
Right.
But the real history is probably less

126
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:49,750
than 10 of it really being incredibly
pervasive the way it is today.

127
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:53,680
Like with twitter and facebook and all
this instagram comments and things along

128
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:55,060
those lines.
Go ahead.

129
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,450
No,
no.

130
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,830
I was just saying it's,
it's a new thing that we have to work

131
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:01,910
out because it is a massive,
massive part of our culture.

132
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,930
There was some statistic recently about
the amount of data that people produce

133
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:10,220
in a day
worldwide and the most of the data is

134
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,570
lol fuck you,
you know,

135
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,150
bullshit.
But it is ones and zero's,

136
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,290
binary code,
it's all,

137
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,830
all that data.
There's more produced in a day,

138
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,940
then it's some staggering statistics
than the rest of human history.

139
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,170
It's something crazy.
You hear it.

140
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,190
Here it goes every day,
two point five quintillion bytes of data

141
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:36,050
created daily.
What in the fuck is that?

142
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,290
Ninety percent of the world's data today
has been created in the last two years

143
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,440
alone.
Wow.

144
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,900
By the way,
a lot of business schools now have

145
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,530
programs and data analytics or big data
where they try to teach students how to

146
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,340
navigate through the complexity of this
type of big data sets.

147
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,290
So it's a really hot field in business
schools.

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,550
Well,
it's impossible.

149
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,930
I mean the real navigate,
I mean what,

150
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,230
what it is,
is there's a pattern,

151
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:11,231
a very clear pattern emerging and that
pattern is of anyone being able to

152
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:17,801
access any information at any time and
it's getting closer and closer to that

153
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,110
all the time and some of that means
communication doesn't just mean being

154
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,350
able to access,
you know,

155
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:27,050
googling some facts or some,
some knowledge.

156
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,990
It also,
it's being able to communicate with

157
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,650
people.
Right.

158
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,290
And it's got.
It's gotten to this really crazy place.

159
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,700
Speaking of Information,
my doctoral dissertation more than 20

160
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:42,701
years ago was about how do people decide
when to stop acquiring additional

161
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:47,360
information and commit to a choice.
So I suppose I'm choosing between cars

162
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,220
or between mates or between job
applicants or between jobs to take

163
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,490
whatever the decision is.
You just say between mates mates.

164
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,080
Yeah know.
So you've got like a gang of bitches for

165
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,390
the.
You should see.

166
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,300
I did.
I did look at some of the comments right

167
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,340
after I appeared.
Right then I lose interest in.

168
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,020
I don't,
but there was one guy who wrote

169
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:09,410
something like,
this guy is swimming in pussy.

170
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,520
Well,
and then everybody starts ganging up on

171
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,230
that comment.
So you know what it is,

172
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,330
man,
it's a beer commercial.

173
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,740
The most interesting man in the world is
that I looked like what it is like that

174
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,260
look like it's become a thing now,
you know,

175
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,090
got the beautiful white beard and a man
of wisdom and years of.

176
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,953
Thank you.
Uh,

177
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,620
so anyway,
so in that,

178
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,540
in my doctoral dissertation I had looked
at,

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,880
well I think I'm better looking at this
guy knew that,

180
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,670
you know,
that guy's Canadian too.

181
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,690
Has He?
He's not even really Spanish and he's

182
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,180
much older than me.
Do you think so?

183
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,161
What do you mean?
Yeah,

184
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,340
I think so.
He's like 70,

185
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,930
51.
I don't know how old the guy goes.

186
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.
So anyways,

187
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:51,834
so,
so,

188
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,630
so the whole psychology of decision
making,

189
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,230
I've,
I've addressed that in my research.

190
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,510
Very interesting stuff.
Yeah.

191
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,450
Well what is the.
Well this is a different sort of a

192
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,710
decision making thing because I,
I think you,

193
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,400
you definitely can get lost where you
can just go online and you know,

194
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,520
one of the things that youtube does now
that makes it really difficult is you

195
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,240
watch a video.

196
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,240
So if I was watching some video today on
a rhino slamming into a car,

197
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,860
it was,
it was removed though some copyright

198
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,170
infringement.
It's fucking crazy.

199
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:25,110
This rhino charge this car and slams
into it.

200
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,040
The problem is once you watch a video,
immediately after that it offers up

201
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,950
another video and it starts playing,
it'll give you like 10 seconds and then

202
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,680
it starts playing again and then you
look on the side and there's all these

203
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:40,680
suggestions.
It's not as simple as one video.

204
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,560
It's an endless web.
That's why by the way,

205
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,830
Internet pornography for men,
it's such an alluring trap,

206
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,430
right?
Because our visual system and our need

207
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:55,431
for variety seeking is there and now you
mean I can say she ate this by going

208
00:09:55,891 --> 00:10:00,891
online,
having endless different new bile ready

209
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:04,440
to meet women.
So it's easy for our computational

210
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:07,410
system to be personalized by,
by the Internet.

211
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,453
Well,
it's also,

212
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,840
it's probably really not.
We're not really set up to watch people.

213
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,830
Fuck,
you know,

214
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,710
it seems like the brain just doesn't
know what to do with,

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,900
you know,
especially if you're by yourself close

216
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,420
the door,
what's going on here?

217
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,370
Yeah,
I mean there's people that just will

218
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,880
watch pornography 10,
12 hours a day and it's not just a few.

219
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,360
I bet if you could highlight,
I bet if you were in a plane and you're

220
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,930
flying over the United States and there
was a light bulb that went off over

221
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,600
everyone's head that jerks off 12 hours
a day,

222
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,510
you can be done.
You'd be stunned.

223
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,240
He'd be able to read by.
You'd be able to hold a magazine up to

224
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,980
the window and read.
I,

225
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,510
I'm not joking.
I think.

226
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,990
I think there's a lot of people out
there that get it.

227
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,770
They get overwhelmed by the
possibilities of doing that.

228
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,670
Like the the choice.
Yeah,

229
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,650
it's they don't have the discipline to
handle that and I was actually a

230
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:02,070
conversation that I was having with my
friend Duncan the other day about

231
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,660
discipline and how important discipline
is to living a good healthy life and

232
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:10,440
that getting the things that you need to
get done will allow you to actually

233
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:13,500
enjoy your free time.
Whereas if you don't get those things

234
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,200
done,
the free time in those pursuits,

235
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:19,280
these things,
they almost become obsessions and you,

236
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:23,700
you kind of dive into them to avoid the
pressure of getting those things done

237
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,230
and it becomes sort of counterintuitive.
I counterproductive.

238
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,100
Yeah.
Going back to the pornography I had on

239
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:33,210
my youtube channel,
a genuine Mercedes careeredge sure.

240
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,110
Yeah.
I've met her.

241
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,820
Have you?
Yeah,

242
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,160
yeah,
yeah.

243
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,180
She came to one of my shows with a,
I guess I guess her husband or boyfriend

244
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:39,990
or something like that.

245
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,610
Very nice guy.
He's very smart girl,

246
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,930
but I'd seen her on,
um,

247
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,940
Gavin McInnes his podcasts and she's
very smart.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,833
She,
well,

249
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,630
of course otherwise.
I mean,

250
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
what would we have to talk about?
Right.

251
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,520
She's an engineer's an engineer.
She's very,

252
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:59,521
very heavily vested into the whole
social justice warrior bullshit and the

253
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,130
other way we were fighting against.
Exactly.

254
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,650
So I'd seen her on a few,
you know,

255
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:08,080
popular podcasts and I thought,
I mean she's just normally sheep,

256
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,921
of course.
Beautiful.

257
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:13,170
But so well spoken and so I had her on
the show and we've communicated since

258
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:15,580
several time and so that's been really
fun.

259
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:18,130
I mean when,
I mean sort of to mimic what you do with

260
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:21,610
your podcast of bringing in so many
interesting people and my youtube

261
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:24,160
channel,
I've had people from guys who fight

262
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,270
Islam to porn stars who used to be
former engineers,

263
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,040
so it's been really fun to meet all
these people.

264
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah.
There's a cool movement going on now

265
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,210
where there's a lot of very intelligent
people that are resisting nonsense where

266
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,030
they're just going to come on,
you're wasting time,

267
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:43,270
you're wasting effort.
And also there's a lot of people that

268
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:46,570
are attaching themselves to these
ridiculous movements just because they

269
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,980
have an identity in that movement and
then they.

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,360
They filled the void.
Whatever social void they have in their

271
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:57,030
life with this new thing,
this new being an sjw.

272
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm a social justice warrior.
There was an article recently about

273
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,710
Yale,
about students at Yale having a hard

274
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:07,150
time balancing out their social
responsibilities with.

275
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm like,
what fucking activism?

276
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,860
This is an activity.
You're just holding up signs and

277
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:12,700
complaining,
right?

278
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,570
I mean,
this isn't,

279
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,100
does not activism.
You're not.

280
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,100
You're not changing a goddamn thing
other than people's opinions about you.

281
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,260
Have you seen the one with the site?

282
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,580
I did a lecture at University of Ottawa
on the thought police and political

283
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:25,181
correctness.
I'm not.

284
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,620
I'm not sure if you saw it,
if not,

285
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,690
you know.
Yeah.

286
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,670
It's really,
it kind of covers the,

287
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,990
the safe spaces at the microaggressions
and the,

288
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,080
the trigger warnings.
And one of the examples that I picked,

289
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,110
I really tried to pick some really
outlandish examples that should only

290
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:42,280
belong in the onion.
One of the examples was some,

291
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,030
I think it was some students at
University of Oregon wanted to take down

292
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,140
the classic quote by Martin Luther King,
you know,

293
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:51,130
the,
I have a dream stuff.

294
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Yes.
Because it was insufficiently inclusive

295
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,570
by him,
you know,

296
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,440
focusing his Ayer on racism and not
looking at whatever it is,

297
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,870
transgenderism and so on.
Uh,

298
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,580
he was,
he was being divisive.

299
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,480
So when Martin Luther King can draw the
ire of these guys,

300
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,050
none of us are safe.
No one is safe.

301
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,890
Yeah.
Well,

302
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,380
they're not safe either.
I mean they're eating themselves,

303
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:20,680
they're attacking ourselves.
We had this a podcast where we went over

304
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:24,340
the story about this woman who joined
Wellesley College,

305
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,240
which is an all girls college I've
spoken.

306
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,430
I've spoken there.
You Do,

307
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:31,030
you know the story,
but the woman joined Wellesley college

308
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:32,860
and then once you joined the Wellesley
College,

309
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:37,570
she decided that she's going to identify
as a man masculine of center,

310
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,550
Gender Queer is what?
Her distinction.

311
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,070
Your stick on it cracked egg up in my
house.

312
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,390
I was crying,
laughing.

313
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:47,440
I was screaming,
laughing because then she voted to be.

314
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,650
She wanted to be the head person of
diversity,

315
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,010
Chairman Deborah,
whatever the fuck

316
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,900
this the title was,
but it had something to do with

317
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:58,550
diversity and they were boycotting her
because now she was a white man.

318
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,400
Like this is glorious.
This is glorious there.

319
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,460
They're literally eating themselves.
They're.

320
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,940
They're so ridiculous.
They've spun around in circles and

321
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,120
they're biting their own assets.
It's what's going on,

322
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,790
but I.
I truly feel though that they've sort of

323
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,940
reached a zenith and it's going to start
decaying.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,410
No,
it's crazy that he's going to get worse,

325
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,360
crazier and crazier,
and then there's going to be.

326
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,520
There's a culture war,
right?

327
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,150
Yeah.
I don't think they've stopped.

328
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:26,090
I don't even think they've started.
I think they're just there right now.

329
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,250
Scrambling.
I think they don't.

330
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,340
They don't hold weight amongst rational
people anymore,

331
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,140
but that's not gonna stop their
movement.

332
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,510
Their movement will continue to be
irrational at a frenzied pace and they

333
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:39,560
were literally going to cannibalize each
other.

334
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,570
So what do you think is the end
trajectory?

335
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,400
I mean at some point it has to crash,
right?

336
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,090
Well,
it's gonna like it's almost like a civil

337
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:47,870
war,
right?

338
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,820
It's almost like a preposterous civil
war.

339
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,821
Like I think in a sense our politics in
this country have always been a civil

340
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:59,921
war just by nature of having only two
choices just by the dual party system in

341
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,890
this ridiculous idea that there's
independent parties.

342
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:04,171
They're,
they're,

343
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,720
they're not,
they're not independent.

344
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,840
Unless trump decided to go independent,
he's going to win.

345
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,190
You think is going to win the to win?
Yeah.

346
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,370
He's gonna win to Hidden Hillary.
Can't beat him.

347
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:14,700
I don't think she could beat him.
I,

348
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,620
I would like to see Bernie Sanders when
not,

349
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,330
not because of his financial policies,
which I think are ridiculous,

350
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,260
but I think his social policies are
interesting and what I should clarify

351
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,760
this is,
well,

352
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,960
here's what's ridiculous about his
financial policies.

353
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,120
Don't make more taxes because more taxes
just means more government,

354
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,520
more government is not when we fucking
need right now.

355
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,200
If you want to organize charitable
institutions that will legitimately help

356
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:43,430
people and have people donate money and
have people work towards,

357
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,201
uh,
you know,

358
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:47,240
like these donations will actually take
away from your taxes.

359
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,520
Let's quit.
Let's figure out some way where we make

360
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,640
it beneficial for people to be
charitable where we set up community

361
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,500
programs.
It takes some of the money that we're

362
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,550
spending on shit that we really don't
need to spend money on,

363
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,830
some subsidies that we probably don't
need that there are benefiting gigantic

364
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:04,520
corporations and instead use those to
help the education systems in poor

365
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,220
communities.
Use those to try to provide jobs and

366
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:09,290
industry and poor communities.
That's.

367
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,820
These are all really good ideas.
So I'm,

368
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,120
I'm in favor of that kind of socialism.

369
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,480
I'm absolutely in favor of free
universities,

370
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,270
right?
I don't think that people should get out

371
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,670
of school and be a quarter million
dollars in debt.

372
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:26,030
I think that's madness.
I think if you're going to make $50,000

373
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:26,541
a year,
okay,

374
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,940
if you've got a really good job,
you make $50,000 a year,

375
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:29,960
right?
You get out of school,

376
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,910
if you,
if you could ask school and you make 50

377
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,500
grand a year,
you're fucking kicking ass,

378
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,270
right?
Everything is going great for you.

379
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,060
You're not really making 50 grand.
You make it about 34,

380
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,350
right?
And then you've got taxes,

381
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,960
you got sales taxes.
If you live in a place like California,

382
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,620
you've got state taxes,
so you're living off of somewhere in the

383
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:47,780
late twenties,
thirties,

384
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:52,650
something like that.
And you've got $250,000 of debt you've

385
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,500
got to deal with.
And you've studied women's studies,

386
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,890
which is a very actionable,
a set of skills.

387
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,110
Well,
how many people study that?

388
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,670
Wellesley?
There's a couple.

389
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,923
I mean,
there's,

390
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,460
I just think that it's an insane burden
to put on young people,

391
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,900
to have them enter into the free market,
enter into the world and be already

392
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:17,280
saddled down by insane amounts of debt.
I think there's gotta be a way around

393
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:21,030
that and I don't think that it's a
terrible idea to have publicly funded

394
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,190
universities.
I just don't think it's a terrible idea.

395
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,800
I don't think it's an insurmountable
idea.

396
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,960
So I like Bernie Sanders and a lot of
ways.

397
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:31,440
I think he's a compassionate guy.
I think he's an open minded guy.

398
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,690
I think he says a lot of really radical
things.

399
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,070
I love the fact that he goes out on a
limb with this black lives matter stuff.

400
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,940
I've liked that he's making a big deal
about these cops shooting these young

401
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:44,220
black kids and then it's got to fucking
stop.

402
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,900
It's gotTa stop.
It's madness.

403
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,160
How many videos have to come out before
you after a while you're like,

404
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,230
well,
there's obviously some clear problem.

405
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,450
How is,
how is trump not handling this?

406
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,930
How is Hillary not handling this?
Like,

407
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:59,760
this is a real problem in our culture,
in our society,

408
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,410
there's a divisiveness,
there's this separation between these

409
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,290
people that live in these communities
that are terrified of the police and

410
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,010
they're really worried about being shot
all the time and then everybody else is

411
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,720
on the outside looking in and saying,
well,

412
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:15,360
if you just follow the law,
you wouldn't have those problems.

413
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,000
Like,
well,

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
try being born there,
try being raised there.

415
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,314
These are,
these are not.

416
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,170
We're not on an even playing field.
You know,

417
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:27,030
and I think he's one of the few guys
that's addressing this imbalance,

418
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,030
this social imbalance is cultural
imbalance.

419
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,210
This is economic imbalance that we have
in this country in a really radical way.

420
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,980
So I liked him for that.
I think that would be a good thing for

421
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:39,630
this country.
For a guy like that,

422
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,970
you know,
would just,

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,140
would it,
would it really happen?

424
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,870
I don't know.
I mean I take him over the others,

425
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,260
I'd take him over the other ones,
I think trump is just,

426
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,070
he says too much crazy shit.
This shit he said about Mexico,

427
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,090
like they're going to pay for that wall,
and they called me up and they said,

428
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,750
what do you think about this and how
could you say that?

429
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,450
You know what?
The Wall just got 10 feet higher.

430
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,370
That's not what we need.
I mean,

431
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:04,480
he's not very presidential in his,
uh,

432
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,240
oh man.
His mannerisms,

433
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,090
you know,
I think he's a real successful guy and I

434
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:13,800
think what he's doing is he's tapping
into this real frustration that a lot of

435
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:18,180
people have and that's,
there's a lot of people that don't like

436
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:21,300
the bullshit that's involved in politics
or people aren't seeing what they're

437
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,080
really think.

438
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,810
So here's this guy who comes along,
he doesn't need anybody's money.

439
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,120
He's insanely wealthy.
Yeah.

440
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,790
He's a multibillionaire.
And he could say whatever the fuck he

441
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,500
wants.
And he's used to say whatever the fuck

442
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,880
he wants.
And every time he does it,

443
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,040
people cheer.
So that's good too.

444
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,270
It's good too because finally we've got.
It's almost like we've got an insane

445
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,000
Ross Perot.
Remember Ross Perot,

446
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,030
Ross Perot fucked up the election for
Georgia to,

447
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:48,250
with the big ears.
He fucked it up for George Bush's Dad.

448
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,140
Yeah.
The older Bush,

449
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:50,760
you know,
they,

450
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,500
they slated him for a second term.
A lot of people thought he was going to.

451
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,010
When Ross Perot came along and explained
on television,

452
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:01,060
he bought a half an hour prime time tv
Pre-internet,

453
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,640
ladies and gentlemen.
He bought a half an hour prime time TV

454
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:06,880
and explained to the Federal Reserve to
people and explain how you're getting

455
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:10,180
fucked.
And I remember there was no internet

456
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:10,750
back then.

457
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,190
So I remember me and some friends we got
together afterwards and we were,

458
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,660
we were going,
did you fucking see you then?

459
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,553
Like,
is that right?

460
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,230
Is what he's seeing true.
I kind of had to make any sense.

461
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,550
And then he was talking about how his
children were being threatened and he

462
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,110
was worried they were going to get
kidnapped.

463
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:30,580
There's all this crazy shit and it got
me down a lot of rabbit holes,

464
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,380
you know,
like conspiracy theory,

465
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,390
rabbit holes,
watching that guy do that.

466
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,720
But I think that what Donald Trump is,
is like a more rabid informed version of

467
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:44,200
that and more informed,
meaning our culture is more informed,

468
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:44,741
more.
I mean,

469
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:45,574
you know,
we're,

470
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,570
we're hearing the,
the age of the Internet where it's,

471
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,550
if you go up on television,
say something about the Federal Reserve,

472
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,570
people understand that you're talking
about an insane institution now.

473
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,130
Whereas back then people are like,
what?

474
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,800
What is he saying?
The Federal Reserve is not a part of the

475
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,820
government,
you know,

476
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,130
like nobody knew that.
Nobody knew that federal bank was it.

477
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,290
Why is it called a Federal Bank of.
It's not federal,

478
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,300
you know,
it's so confusing.

479
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,830
You know,
I think

480
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,660
the main thing about trump that people
are tapping into is rightly or wrongly,

481
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:16,900
that he comes across as authentic.
So if you look on the,

482
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,910
on some metric of authenticity between
Hillary,

483
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,960
Hillary Clinton could not be any more
inauthentic,

484
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,680
right?
I mean,

485
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,340
she,
she,

486
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,010
she freaks you out,
right?

487
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,280
She,
she spooky in her inability to convey,

488
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,460
even if she tried to fake genuine
emotions.

489
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,530
Whereas on the other hand,
uh,

490
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,390
whether you like him or don't,
trump seems to speak from the heart to

491
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:43,210
the extent that a lot of people are
disillusioned with politicians.

492
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,500
Then this guy comes along and I can at
least tap into that and,

493
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,210
and hang on that element of his
personality.

494
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:52,060
So I think that's what explains his
success.

495
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,800
Yeah.
And also white men,

496
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,300
meaning,
yeah,

497
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,760
there's a lot of white men out there
excited to have this,

498
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,450
this really bold white man as a contrast
effect.

499
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,740
You mean to,
to Obama?

500
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,330
Yeah.
As a contrast to Obama.

501
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,280
Definitely a contrast to Hillary and
Bernie Sanders is chumming up with the

502
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:10,810
black folks,
you know.

503
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,840
Have you seen,
have you followed our politics in

504
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,830
Canada?
Yeah.

505
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,420
You're trudeau guy.
I like that guy.

506
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,470
You do?
I do.

507
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,580
I liked that guy because he's young and
he seemed smart and he has nice hair.

508
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,910
He's got beautiful hair.
He,

509
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,020
he boxed.
He did do that.

510
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,600
But what's bad about them?
Uh,

511
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,910
to the extent that I think we both
despise social justice warriors,

512
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:38,290
the ostrich brigade,
the regressive left explained the

513
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,170
ostrich burger is a term that I
popularized,

514
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:45,620
which basically refers to folks who have
their head in the sand so that they

515
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:48,920
can't really,
except some of the most basic

516
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,810
regularities in the world,
right?

517
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,040
Uh,
you know,

518
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,930
there is no link between Islam and any
terrorist act anywhere in the world to

519
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,970
suggest otherwise it'd be Islamophobia.

520
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,290
Exactly.
So somebody who,

521
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,130
who exhibits this type of behavior as a,
as an exhibiting ostrich logic,

522
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
right?
So Justin Trudeau is the kingpin of the

523
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,330
Ostrich Brigade.
Dammit.

524
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,210
Yeah.
Handsome.

525
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,110
So he,
he,

526
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,110
he basically his dad,
his dad instituted as part of our

527
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,770
Canadian he multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism means two different

528
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:22,760
things.
Multiculturalism.

529
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,330
When it's used in everyday language,
it means that many cultures,

530
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,550
right?
La is multicultural,

531
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,550
meaning it's pluralistic,
but multiculturalism as a political

532
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:34,400
philosophy is actually a very dangerous
idea,

533
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,340
right?
It basically says that when immigrants

534
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:41,030
come into your land,
they don't have to assimilate within

535
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,370
your cultural values.
Rather,

536
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,490
you allow everybody to get ghettoize
because who are we to judge the values

537
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,150
of another ghettoized?
Yeah.

538
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:52,810
Like you mean like a Dominican
community?

539
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,670
The Muslims are here to.
North Korea is on here here,

540
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,420
but ghettos like poor.
No,

541
00:24:59,421 --> 00:24:59,950
no,
no,

542
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,210
no.
Ghettoize in the sense that everybody

543
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,820
who is of the same background lives in
that space.

544
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,960
It doesn't,
that's not a ghetto.

545
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,510
I mean the term is used in different
ways.

546
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:11,890
It's not ghetto in the,
in the sense of hip hop gets zero.

547
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,620
A term ghetto.
Yeah.

548
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,490
What does that mean?
Because I've always,

549
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:20,480
I mean,
I'm just saying ghetto in this country

550
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,850
is always referred to as a poor
community.

551
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,170
Uh,
no,

552
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,690
I think it has a broader meaning at
least as I understand that.

553
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,480
So for example,
if you say you'll get to realizing

554
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:33,550
people into different areas of the city.
I've never even heard it as a verb.

555
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,280
Well,
that's why I'm here to get toe eyes.

556
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,160
There you go.
Yeah.

557
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,260
Here we go.
New immigrants still tended to get a

558
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,530
wise in the cities.
Is that.

559
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:46,870
I mean it's exactly what I just defined.
Yeah.

560
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,090
What's the origin of ghetto a?
I don't know that it.

561
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,590
Is it,
is it actually based on the word ghetto,

562
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,550
I'm guessing?

563
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,750
Or is it totally.
Is it like.

564
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:55,070
No,
I like read,

565
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,330
read,
brace yourself folks.

566
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,640
I'm going to say a word that's
confusing.

567
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,620
Niggardly and it has nothing to do with
the n word.

568
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,120
Yes.
It has to do with like find the origins

569
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,280
of that word because I think it has to
do.

570
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:13,340
It's,
it's about being miserly or cheap.

571
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,120
Yes.
But it has nothing to do with black

572
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,150
history whatsoever.
Reluctant to give or spend stingy and

573
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,070
miserly.
Um,

574
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,160
and the origin.
What's the origin of it?

575
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,340
Whereas this say,
does it say no?

576
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,070
Doesn't have an origin.
But let me,

577
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,120
if I could finish my point about
Jessica,

578
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,550
please do.
So.

579
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,650
Uh,
so Justin Trudeau,

580
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:39,230
at one point when he was a member of
parliament,

581
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,030
someone had said that things like a fem
female genital mutilation

582
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
and child brides and honored killings
was the type of barbers and that we

583
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:52,110
don't need in Canada.
And Justin Trudeau's position at the

584
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:56,100
time was,
how dare you use the word barbarism and

585
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:58,080
describing other people's cultures.
Right?

586
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,070
So he wasn't offended by having women's
clitoral says cut.

587
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,970
He was offended by people who describe
that behavior as barbaric.

588
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,150
So he is the king of the ostriches.
So he's not a fan of the godfathers.

589
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,740
Oh No.
Or I'm not a fan of his rather.

590
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
Oh,
Canada.

591
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,530
Have you followed some of our debates
regarding,

592
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,360
uh,
allowing the,

593
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:25,020
a sort of open.
Well,

594
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,110
not the open door,
but allowing massive number of Syrian

595
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:29,700
immigrants.
No,

596
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:32,550
I haven't followed.
You see what's going on in other

597
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,220
countries.
So of course in Europe they look at our

598
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,860
issue and they sort of say,
come on,

599
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:42,180
are you serious?
We have 800,000 migrants coming through

600
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,260
to Germany.

601
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,440
You're complaining about 25,000,
but we'll look what happened with

602
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:47,210
Cologne.
Yeah.

603
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,890
Because the mayor of Cologne,
after these attacks on New Year's Eve

604
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:52,020
was telling women to dress difference.
Right?

605
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:56,160
And stay away from men hostage brigade.
That's fucking insane.

606
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:01,161
I mean that that is a very culturally
diverse area that has existed in a very

607
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:06,930
peaceful way for a long time until all
the sudden they let in all these

608
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:10,440
immigrants and they're having a massive
problem with women being sexually

609
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:13,050
assaulted.
So instead of protecting these women and

610
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:17,490
trying to do their best to ramp up the
police force or do something to stop it

611
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,830
or make sure that people are safe or
really put it,

612
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,710
put it out there that look,
you're in a new fucking place and if you

613
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,100
want to simulate in our culture,
you've got,

614
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,520
leave these fucking women alone or we're
going to get rid of you.

615
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,950
Everyone who does anything to women in
our country,

616
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,530
we're going to get rid of you.
You can't be here and make people feel

617
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,630
unsafe instead of doing that.
But see,

618
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:37,710
that's so one of the reasons why I'm
very concerned about the $25,000 coming

619
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,030
in and people say,
well come on.

620
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,190
How many of them are likely to be Isis
members?

621
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,990
But the danger is not only people only
think of Isis members is the danger.

622
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,360
Right?
But when you've got 25,000 people,

623
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:53,430
of whom a very large majority will
adhere to certain values that are

624
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,980
perfectly antithetical to ours.
Right.

625
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,090
What are your views on homosexuals?
What are your views on religious

626
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:03,810
minorities and Jews?
If we live in 25,000 Syrians at

627
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,130
statistically speaking,
will they are the more likely or less

628
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:11,730
likely that they'd be antisemitism?
I mean that's an empirical statement

629
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,810
that we could test,
right?

630
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,940
So it's not only about the fact that how
many of these 25,000 are isis members,

631
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:22,941
it's how many of these 25,000 people
will hold values that are perfectly

632
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,830
congruent with ours.
And so we have every right.

633
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,720
Without having the threat of being
called racist and Islamophobia over our

634
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:35,550
head to engage in a discussion on how do
we vet these people?

635
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:38,790
I mean,
how do you find out what percentage of

636
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,890
those are going to hold views that are
grotesque to us

637
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,010
and then should we be letting them in,
but what are the.

638
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,230
What are the options mean?
What?

639
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,470
How could you possibly find out what
their views are?

640
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,460
You would have to sit down with each one
individually and quiz them,

641
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,550
and then you would have to verify their
claims or their answers.

642
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,660
Well,
at the very least,

643
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:03,661
I would argue that you should never be
allowed under the guise of your

644
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,320
religious practice to a spouse,
you know,

645
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,960
hateful things,
right?

646
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,170
I mean,
uh,

647
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,910
if,
if you go to a house of worship and that

648
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:20,911
house of worship is
praising certain things that you and I

649
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:26,341
would consider genocidal hatred,
then my right to be free of the

650
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:32,320
genocidal hatred that's coming my way
supersedes your right to practice your

651
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:34,680
religion of genocidally hating me.
Right?

652
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,580
So that,
that's simply has to be the rule.

653
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:40,420
And if we don't wake up to that reality,
we're going to have problems.

654
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,630
Yeah,
I would say that that's a very

655
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:47,320
reasonable statement and I think that
there's a lot of people in this country

656
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:50,020
that liked to say things like what you
were claiming.

657
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:53,770
Trudeau said about culture.
Like how dare you criticize their

658
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,230
culture.
Their culture is a bullshit word.

659
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,750
It's human behavior and you're looking
at human behavior.

660
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:02,080
Some human behavior is acceptable,
is not,

661
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,480
and if it's acceptable in other
countries to eat people,

662
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,400
guess what?
It's not acceptable here.

663
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,050
You can't cook people,
you can't eat them.

664
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:09,000
We don't allow it.
Right.

665
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,331
Well,
I'll let me,

666
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:14,080
let me add to that.
The part of multiculturalism is this

667
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,520
idea that all cultures are unique,
distinct and equal in their own right,

668
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,390
and actually that is a truly profoundly
incorrect statements.

669
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,670
Cultures are not equal,
but different cultures are

670
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,380
differentially able to engender
happiness to more or less people,

671
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:32,650
right?

672
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,280
Yeah.
So,

673
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,610
so if you are part of whatever it means,
Tali bond culture,

674
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:41,910
you couldn't on average predict that
women in that culture will be less

675
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,440
self-actualized than in western
countries.

676
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,680
That isn't empirically demonstrable
fact.

677
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:49,990
Yes,
and so the idea that who are we to judge

678
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,270
other cultures,
this idea of cultural relativism which

679
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:54,430
has part which is endemic of
multiculturalism,

680
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,610
is profoundly incorrect and it has to go
well.

681
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,500
It's a,
it's a blind statement.

682
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,830
It's not a real.
It's not a real statement.

683
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,310
You can't really say that.
It's not.

684
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,830
I mean,
you could look at it economically,

685
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,290
you could look at it socially,
you look at in terms of,

686
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,060
you know,
there's a real good argument that in

687
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,670
this country there's less free freedom
and there is another country's because

688
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:14,010
more people are in jail,
right?

689
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,630
You could look at it that way.
You can look at the disproportionate

690
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:20,530
amount of people that are in jail for
nonviolent drug offenses in this country

691
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,521
and say,
well,

692
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:23,890
this country is obviously a fucked up
place,

693
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,990
and that's,
um,

694
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,560
that's a legit claim as well.
But the idea of numerical value equal

695
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,970
making it equal,
we're all cultures are equal.

696
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,950
That's foolishness.
That's not true.

697
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,410
Not only that,
there's a very real thing going in the

698
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,070
world

699
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,430
where as the age of information washes
upon us,

700
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:47,300
and I think this is the new age of
information that the age of pure

701
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,300
information as this wash is upon us.
We're seeing massive changes in our own

702
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:56,000
country and we're seeing massive changes
in our political system.

703
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:59,780
We're seeing massive changes socially.
And I think this is social justice

704
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:03,860
warrior thing is sort of a side effect
of that were these disenfranchised

705
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,020
people than some of them may be mentally
ill.

706
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,910
They have a voice,
you know,

707
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:08,561
some of them,
oh,

708
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:13,520
let's not say ill imbalanced.
Maybe they're radical because they're

709
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:17,210
young and idealist and they haven't
looked at all the right ways.

710
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:21,290
And then one day they'll balance out
like many people have as many young

711
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,600
radicals.
It'd become very rational people in

712
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,960
their fifties and sixties and whatever.
But this,

713
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,820
this thing is taking place here.
And it's also taking place all over the

714
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:32,140
world.

715
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,790
Well,
where information is being resisted.

716
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,220
That's where we have problems in the
world,

717
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,170
right?
Where fundamental religious values are

718
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,430
superseding the age of information
there.

719
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,590
They're squashing people's ability to
express themselves,

720
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,590
people's ability to try new things,
exploring new things,

721
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,170
um,
their sexual values,

722
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,741
their,
their,

723
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,840
their identities,
all those things.

724
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,880
Like,
as soon as you have like an ancient

725
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,540
fucking scripture,
some shit that was written on animal

726
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,450
skins a thousand years ago.
Like as soon as that is,

727
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,740
is at the head.
And that takes precedent over everything

728
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:13,550
else because it was supposedly the word
of God or who else?

729
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,790
Someone who talked to God,
whatever the fuck it is that you've got

730
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,180
a problem,
a real problem there because religion,

731
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,930
religion in and of itself is an idea and
it's an idea that is the only one of the

732
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:32,060
very few ideas that we accept that
literally has no basis in reality.

733
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,280
There's no bay.
It has no basis.

734
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:37,100
In fact,
it has no basis in anything provable.

735
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,320
And that's why we have this concept of
faith.

736
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,320
Well,
as soon as you have religion that's

737
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:46,190
dominating information you have,
you have a problem,

738
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:50,450
you've got a bottleneck.
You got to put up a wall that's put up

739
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,800
for progress.
Now when people develop in that

740
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,370
environment,
you have stifled people just like I have

741
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:03,371
a friend and him and his wife,
they were Mormons until they were like

742
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:06,320
40.
And then they decided to slowly.

743
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:10,490
They literally lived overseas for a bit
and they kind of experienced the world

744
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,324
and they,
oh,

745
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,790
it opened their eyes to a lot of
different things and they decided to

746
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,370
move away from the church.
They're fucking lost,

747
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:17,690
man.
They're lost.

748
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,740
Like,
they're almost like grownup children.

749
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:22,550
I think you might've told me.
They're wonderful people.

750
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,700
They're great people,
but the wife is really interesting.

751
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:28,910
She's very self aware and she even talks
about it.

752
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:32,870
She says,
I growing up in this really

753
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,470
fundamentalist religion,
I think I developed a really bad way of

754
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,250
looking at things

755
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,880
where I'm easily confused,
easily confused and easily lead,

756
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,610
right?
Like with like a charlatan could,

757
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,770
could take her over or uh,
a cult member could.

758
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,220
Chapter eight of the book I just gave
you,

759
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,740
it's called marketing hope by selling
lies.

760
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,910
And basically what I argued there is
that they are different peddlers of hope

761
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:01,410
that are successful precisely because
they could sell you hope and the areas

762
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,950
that are most important in sort of
Darwinian insecurities right now to be a

763
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:08,730
better lover.
How to live forever to be a better

764
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,350
parent.
Right?

765
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:09,930
Right.
So,

766
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,070
so all of the key Darwinian pursuits
that keep us and keep us up at night,

767
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,730
there is a peddler out there who can
give you the recipe,

768
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:21,180
whether he be a self help guru,
whether he be a medical quack,

769
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,740
whether he be religion,
and so that's why those products are so

770
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:28,470
successful because they peddle us hope.

771
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,870
Yes,
but growing up in with religion,

772
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:33,060
especially fundamentalist religion that
cannot be questioned,

773
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,510
it becomes a real problem because
there's these rigid areas where you're

774
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:40,440
only allowed to think one way right now.
You develop these patterns in your mind.

775
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:43,680
Then when you move to a new place,
it doesn't support those ideas and you

776
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:47,850
want to use genital mutilation.
You want to wrap women up and fucking

777
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:52,200
mummy cloth and make sure they can't
drive like you want to do that same shit

778
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,140
in Canada that you're doing in Saudi
Arabia,

779
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,020
you got real fucking problem.
That's a real problem.

780
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,140
And Justin Trudeau would say,
who are we to judge their practices?

781
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:07,170
Whereas what you're saying is you're
against multiculturalism because you are

782
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:09,960
taking a position against it.
So you don't like Justin Trudeau.

783
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,610
Well,
I'm definitely not against

784
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:13,770
multiculturalism.
I'm against,

785
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,050
I'm against religious fundamentalism on
a,

786
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:20,670
on a global scale because I'm not
against God and this is what people have

787
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,210
to understand.

788
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,210
Like I would be the last person to tell
you I have any idea about something that

789
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:31,200
I have never experienced.
What I've experienced is the afterlife.

790
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,270
I have never.
I am open to the idea that this life is

791
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,300
one stage and an infinite fractal,
like a gigantic,

792
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,980
infinite number of experiences that are
our energy can,

793
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,500
can go through,
answer Jack.

794
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,990
Could that simply be the fact that you
are finding an alternate way,

795
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:59,430
not through religion,
but through some alternate means to live

796
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,211
on forever?
Well,

797
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,650
exactly right now,
so I could.

798
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,010
I could take this pill called religion
that will grant me a mortality or I

799
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:10,011
could do your fractal Mumbo jumbo stuff
and it's no disrespect and that could

800
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:12,480
still get me through it.
Whereas the reality of the

801
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:17,250
intellectually honest position is that
we really have absolutely no evidence.

802
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:20,730
This is a very small party that will
last if you're lucky,

803
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:25,731
85 years and it's profoundly fear
inducing because I want to be coming

804
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:28,170
back on this podcast for the next 4,000
years,

805
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,630
but I.
It really worries me that I won't,

806
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,820
but it's honest.
It's honest.

807
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:36,010
To know that you've got 85 years in a
sense it's

808
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,010
liberating because it forces me and you.
If you're an atheist to really carpet dm

809
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:44,020
at right,
you really have to seize the day because

810
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,930
there are no do overs,
there is no eternity,

811
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:49,360
there is no afterlife.
It's all right here.

812
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:53,740
What we do,
and so in a sense there is a a glory to

813
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:57,160
the finiteness that is afforded by
atheism.

814
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,070
You can certainly look at it that way.
My,

815
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,730
my perspective though is that we really
just don't know and that energy

816
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,490
continues to move forward in a lot of
different ways.

817
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:10,480
We see this throughout all of nature.
Whereas things die.

818
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,920
They get reabsorbed into the ground.
The very energy and the essence that

819
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:19,750
they had when they were alive fuels all
these different microbes and bacteria

820
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:22,450
and the ground that it makes.
The soil richer,

821
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,600
grows more plants.
Animals eat those plants that nourishes

822
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,080
them.

823
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,470
They all,
they literally the cells and the carbon

824
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,910
from every fucking human being on this
planet came from a star that exploded.

825
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,970
Death becomes life and some sort of
strange way,

826
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,660
but I don't think that it's impossible
that that could be the same thing with

827
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,370
consciousness,
with energy,

828
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,100
with,
with whatever the fuck it is inside of

829
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:50,101
us that makes us alive and aware and
makes our minds tune in to all of the

830
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:52,810
possibilities in the wonders of the
world.

831
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:55,150
I don't know if this is the end,
but you don't either.

832
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,020
I don't.
Well,

833
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,010
no one does,
right?

834
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,140
That's the point.
And then as soon as someone comes along

835
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:00,370
and tells you,
they do know,

836
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,080
and this is the only way to the
afterlife,

837
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:04,630
this is the only way to heaven.
You got a real problem.

838
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,410
You got a real problem because human
beings are malleable and you can guide

839
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:12,100
them and you can direct them and you can
mold them and you could turn them into

840
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:13,210
religious slaves.

841
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,100
You could turn them into ideological
slaves and we should recognize that from

842
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,670
a psychological perspective,
from an educated perspective,

843
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,760
from a perspective of recognizing cult
behavioral.

844
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,610
I was watching this thing on this guy,
Steve Hassan,

845
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,220
the guy who was on our podcast before
was a cult expert.

846
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,020
He sent me an email today and I watched
this,

847
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,360
this piece on on cults and cult behavior
and cults on the Internet and it's so

848
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,330
fucking.
It's terrifying how malleable people's

849
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:44,680
minds are and how someone who's an
unscrupulous person or unscrupulous

850
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:49,681
person or someone who has nefarious
ideas can convince people to blow

851
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,180
themselves up to get virgins in the
afterlife.

852
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,000
I mean,
that's a reality.

853
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,890
Very earthly Darwinian things in her
life,

854
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:57,401
right?
Well,

855
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:02,401
it's the people don't know and that's my
point and when someone comes along and

856
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,530
says,
I do know and this is the truth,

857
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,750
it becomes a real problem because you
can't fucking prove it.

858
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,520
You can't prove it.
You don't have any facts,

859
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,530
you don't have any data.
There's nothing you can measure.

860
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:14,470
There's nothing you could way and you're
not saying you think you're saying,

861
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,900
you know,
and if you think one thing,

862
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:18,450
if you think,
I think this is it,

863
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,960
Carpe Diem,
live for the day.

864
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:22,150
This is our only shot here.
You might be right,

865
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,560
or this guy who's done a fucking pound
of mushrooms might've come back from the

866
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,060
other side and say,
listen,

867
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:32,830
I have this idea and I think that love
is eternal and it goes on forever,

868
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:33,980
and then what we really are

869
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,330
here we are this being that's trying to
figure itself out in this very brief

870
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,630
amount of time and the best we can do is
leave behind information.

871
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,540
We have this wonderful thing called
communication and language.

872
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,900
We store this information.
The next generation comes along and

873
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:50,690
tries to pick up where the last
generation left off,

874
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,260
gather up as much data as they can and
then move it forward a little bit before

875
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:58,010
they expire and we keep doing it and
doing it and doing it and doing it until

876
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,040
hopefully we move towards some level of
enlightenment as a species.

877
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,861
See,
I can.

878
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,720
I can repackage that in slightly more
earthly and less esoteric terms.

879
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,740
I think that we can achieve immortality
and quilts in two ways,

880
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,310
right through genetic propagation.
That's why you and I have children.

881
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,080
I mean literally we are extending our
genes and also through mimetic

882
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:23,870
propagation and mimetic propagation is,
you know,

883
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,960
you read this book and now infects your
brains.

884
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,970
I'm not reading it now.
You're not effecting me man.

885
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,050
By the way,
next time I come,

886
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,450
there's a 100 percent final exam on this
book.

887
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,720
So you better professor made exams right
here,

888
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,200
like a cheat sheet or so.
So I'm the medic.

889
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:43,610
Propagation is basically anything that
can be part if you like,

890
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,690
of your legacy.
Right?

891
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:49,691
So the collection of stuff that people
can go and and watch about you as part

892
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:53,570
of Joe Rogan's,
mimetic propagation and long after you

893
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,690
may be gone,
people will be able to consume Joe

894
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,230
Rogan's ideas and all of the wonderful
things that he's done for many,

895
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:02,270
many years to come.
And so in that sense,

896
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,750
I think either through genetic
propagation or mimetic propagation,

897
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,120
we,
we can be immortal and that's why it is

898
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:11,060
really important to do all the wonderful
things that people do.

899
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,580
Because that is your ticket to
immortality.

900
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,683
I don't.
I mean,

901
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,411
again,
you might say,

902
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:16,244
well,
how do you know?

903
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,220
I don't know,
but until I have any evidence of

904
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,080
otherwise,
I'm going to take the intellectually

905
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,480
honest position and say the party is
going to end.

906
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,310
Well,
it really,

907
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,370
let's get further than that because
immortality is nonsense.

908
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,550
This fucking son doesn't have an
immortal life.

909
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,270
Yeah,
we got it for 4 billion years,

910
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:34,730
right?
If we're lucky,

911
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,810
and that's assuming that we don't get
hit by one of these gigantic fucking

912
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:41,450
rocks and keeps flying around.
You hear about that one that went off

913
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:43,330
over the Atlantic Ocean the other day?
No.

914
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Oh my God.
The fucking media exploded over the

915
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,480
Atlantic Ocean.
Nobody knew about it.

916
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:52,340
Nobody heard about it.
Nobody knew is coming.

917
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,870
Will pull this up,
Jamie,

918
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,770
because the amount of energy.
So if we hit,

919
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,930
let's say New York,
what would have happened?

920
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,280
Everyone like Hiroshima,
bigger than here.

921
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,000
Here it is,
a media exposure over the Atlantic.

922
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:07,130
Like pull up the amount of power that
had had.

923
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,880
I had it on my,
um,

924
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,680
I had it on my twitter where it talked
about in relationship to a Hiroshima,

925
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,420
like how big of it was,
um,

926
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,450
due to do 500,000 tons of TNT.
Jesus fucking Christ.

927
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,820
It's insane.
That was the one over Russia.

928
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,770
Oh,
this is what the one who thousand tons

929
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:33,510
of TNT.
Okay.

930
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,000
Oh,
the Russian one I remember from a few

931
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,833
years ago.
Yes.

932
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,840
But what's the,
what's the Atlantic Ocean one will pull

933
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,840
up the one that compared it to a pull up
the article that I had on my,

934
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:44,760
um,
on my twitter because it's,

935
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,550
it compared it to a,
a nuclear bomb.

936
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,550
Wow,
yeah,

937
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,740
well these are really common,
you know,

938
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:54,960
and I had this guy,
Randall Carlson on the podcast a few

939
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:59,961
times and he's dedicated his life to
paying attention to the signs of

940
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,720
asteroidal impacts all throughout
history and all throughout the world.

941
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:04,550
And astronomer.
Yeah,

942
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,130
and he believes that what's happened is
all throughout human history,

943
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:12,870
there's been these resets where people
accumulated a lot of data,

944
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:16,320
they learned a lot,
society move forward and then boom,

945
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,190
we got hit and then a lot of people died
and then they had to regroup,

946
00:45:20,191 --> 00:45:22,320
start all over again.
And there's a lot of evidence in the

947
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:23,870
physical form.
This stuff called [inaudible],

948
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,160
I think it's called Triton night.
It's called new,

949
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,600
its nuclear glass,
they call it.

950
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,700
It's the same substance that they find
when they do nuclear tests in the desert

951
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:36,510
and stuff and they found it all
throughout Europe and Asia and they find

952
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:39,600
it when they do core samples between
like 10 and 12,000 years.

953
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,980
So it's exactly the same time as the end
of the ice age coincides with the end of

954
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:48,981
the ice age and with these these like
puzzling moments in civilization where

955
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:52,030
you have,
they'll find things like go Beckley

956
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,420
tappy,
these beautiful structures that are

957
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,640
really complex that are 14,000 years
old,

958
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:57,780
12,000 years old.
They're like,

959
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,840
who the fuck was building this stuff
back then when we thought people were

960
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,660
hunter gatherers and then right after
that,

961
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,480
boom,
we get hit by rocks.

962
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,540
Most people die,
a lot of people die and then they have

963
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:13,800
to regroup again.
And I think that that that's most likely

964
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:17,790
going to be the end of humanity just
like it was the end of the dinosaurs 65

965
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:22,790
million years ago.
It's much more common then we would then

966
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:26,940
we really would like to think about.
So definitely don't sweat it.

967
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,350
Don't sweat the small stuff.
Yeah.

968
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,470
There's no and mortality as far as this
dimension.

969
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,970
It's just,
it's not gonna happen.

970
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,010
So if you want to,
you want me to tell you a bit about the

971
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,410
evolutionary roots of religion,
how,

972
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,830
how you would study religion as an
evolutionist.

973
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:41,723
Okay.
You Ready?

974
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,190
Yeah.
So one argument is based on,

975
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,720
it's an adaptive argument,
right?

976
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,250
So the idea is if religion exists,
does that confer an adaptive advantage

977
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:53,130
to people?
And so there was some work done by a

978
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:55,710
good friend of Mine,
David Wilson and evolutionary biologist

979
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,320
where he argues using a group selection,
it's argument that that groups that are

980
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:05,970
religious out survive groups that are
not by virtue of them being more

981
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:07,590
communal,
more cohesive,

982
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,460
more abandoned.
So that argument is an adaptive argument

983
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,030
for why religion exists.
There's another argument by other

984
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:17,910
evolutionists that is based on an
exaltation arguing.

985
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,940
Have you ever heard that term except
acceptation.

986
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,520
What does that mean?
So that's a byproduct of evolution.

987
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,430
In other words,
it's something that evolved not because

988
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,160
itself,
it confers an adaptive advantage.

989
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,850
Rather it's piggybacking.
So for example,

990
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,670
the fact that your skeletal system is
the color that it is,

991
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,630
that itself is not adaptive.
It is a byproduct of other evolutionary

992
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:39,910
processes.
So from that perspective,

993
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:45,370
religion piggybacks on computational
systems in our brains that evolved for

994
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:46,740
other things.
You follow me,

995
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,520
for example,
coalitional thinking,

996
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,550
the idea of viewing the world as US
versus them,

997
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,690
blue team versus red team.
That is an innate part of our psychology

998
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,750
now.
Now religion piggybacks on that,

999
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,760
right?
It takes that computational system that

1000
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:04,210
already exists in us and it,
it puts it on steroids,

1001
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:05,560
right?
So you think about the Abrahamic

1002
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:06,394
religions,
right?

1003
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,180
Every one of them has us versus them.
They are the Jews,

1004
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,010
the gentiles,
the believers,

1005
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:13,000
the preferred,
right?

1006
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:18,350
And so at agency detection,
detecting agency and things is something

1007
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,570
that is innate to us.

1008
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,360
Religion plays on that.
The agent becomes God,

1009
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,440
and so that's an argument that was
proposed by Pascal where he's basically

1010
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:30,370
saying that religion did not
specifically evolve because itself self,

1011
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:33,160
it is adaptive,
but it piggybacks on other things that

1012
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:37,210
have evolved.
And then a third way to study religion

1013
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,220
is to just do a content analysis of the
the,

1014
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,050
the narratives within religions.
So there's a great study done by a

1015
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:49,051
Darwinian historian where she looked at
in the old testament how many women are

1016
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:54,781
ascribed to a different male in the old
testament as a function of a status.

1017
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,430
So the higher the status of the male,
the more sexual partners you had,

1018
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,940
which is exactly what you would predict
from an evolutionary perspective.

1019
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,080
High status to men confers reproductive
success.

1020
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,480
So there are different ways that
evolution is.

1021
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:15,070
And there are several other ways that
can study religion from an evolutionary

1022
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:15,904
perspective.

1023
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,990
That's pretty fascinating.
Well,

1024
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:23,070
I also think that we've always,
as cultures have sort of tried to stay

1025
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:28,531
alive and have tried to maintain order.
We've always tried to establish sets of

1026
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:34,570
rules and boundaries and things and it
only makes sense that you would say,

1027
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,501
hey,
you know,

1028
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:38,290
there's a real reason why you can't kill
people.

1029
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:41,050
And it's not because it makes everybody
upset.

1030
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,070
It's because you're gonna go to hell,
right?

1031
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,980
So listen,
you don't want to go to hell.

1032
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,810
So don't kill people.
All these,

1033
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,750
all these things that people have done
throughout history.

1034
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,290
I mean,
if you look at religion on a global

1035
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:56,740
scale,
there are some key components to almost

1036
00:49:56,741 --> 00:50:01,741
all religions and those seem to.
They seem to benefit order.

1037
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:06,670
They seem to benefit culture and like
you were saying that the idea of people

1038
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,010
living longer and being more successful
as a.

1039
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,240
As a culture,
yeah,

1040
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,790
we'll senses of community.
If you have a sense of community,

1041
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,430
if you,
if you established community and

1042
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:19,450
establish a bond between people and a
higher good or a higher reason to exist.

1043
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,470
I'll give you another example.
A kosher laws actually have discussed

1044
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:24,700
this in this book,
right?

1045
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,070
So I try to offer a biological

1046
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:33,070
explanation that is not rooted in
religious narratives for why kosher laws

1047
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:34,400
would have evolved.
Right?

1048
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,530
So think about the kosher edict that you
shouldn't eat shellfish.

1049
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,440
Well,
so I did a lot of research when I was

1050
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,700
writing the book on this issue.
It turns out that when you have

1051
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,760
shellfish that is infected with a
particular pathogen,

1052
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,960
red tie,
that's good.

1053
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:51,860
That could kill you,
right?

1054
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,400
Yes.
The one that is infected versus the one

1055
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:57,920
that is uninformed,
not infected.

1056
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,760
You can't really tell the difference
either through smell,

1057
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,010
either through site,
so number one,

1058
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:05,990
number two,
it's not as though the one that's coming

1059
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:08,690
from an infected lives in mercury or
water,

1060
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,320
so there was.
There is nothing that you could use in

1061
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:17,060
terms of observational learning that can
offer you some statistical regularity of

1062
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,060
if I do a,
b will happen once in a while.

1063
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,550
Somebody eats a shellfish,
they dropped that.

1064
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:27,080
I don't have a means.
I'm thinking as a Bronze Age guy running

1065
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:31,370
around the Middle East to ever learn
from this mal addiction.

1066
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:36,560
Therefore the only thing that I can do
is then say it is a edict from God.

1067
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,850
Boom,
don't do it.

1068
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,140
Of course.
So they are very,

1069
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:43,190
very easy earthly biological reasons to
take food,

1070
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:45,740
taboos,
religious taboos and demonstrate that

1071
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:48,110
they have nothing.
But of course when I say this in a

1072
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:51,050
classroom where there are people who
might otherwise be religious,

1073
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,350
they see it.
Yet they can't completely follow you

1074
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,213
because.
Yeah,

1075
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:55,730
yeah.
Well,

1076
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,420
because they have this doctrine in their
mind that is just the word of God will

1077
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:01,250
also pigs eating pig.
Exactly.

1078
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,560
I mean,
we all know that pigs contained trick of

1079
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:05,870
gnosis and exactly bears as well,
you know,

1080
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:08,510
it's supposed to eat bears.
There's a lot of reasons why kosher

1081
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:09,890
living in,
you know,

1082
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,320
a thousand,
5,000 years ago or whatever was really

1083
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:13,670
smart,
smart way to go.

1084
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,260
Have you.
Have you ever read.

1085
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,630
I'm giving him here a,
a,

1086
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,711
a,
a,

1087
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:19,880
a thumbs up.
Maybe it'll help his book.

1088
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,350
The Paleo manifesto by John Durant.
Uh,

1089
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,970
no I haven't,
but John and I have been talking back

1090
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:28,310
and forth on twitter and where he's
moving here.

1091
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,800
So when he moves here,
he's dead to me.

1092
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,380
You just said he's moving here.
I want to be in southern California.

1093
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:38,381
Is that I now see my hair.
You were here for like three months,

1094
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:40,400
right?
Weren't you here for a bunch of money

1095
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:42,890
all the time.
But if you move here because I need a

1096
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:46,810
professorship job here.
You're a smart guy selling books.

1097
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,340
You're doing well.
But anyways,

1098
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:52,760
and I think in his book he talks about,
I don't remember the exact number,

1099
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:57,761
but he looked at the 613 commandments in
Jewish law and some outlandish number,

1100
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:04,490
say something like 20 percent of them
deal with purity rituals.

1101
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:10,270
And those purity rituals are ultimately
means very earthly means to try to

1102
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:14,690
remove the possibility that you've been
exposed to dangerous pathogens.

1103
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,861
Right?
So again,

1104
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:20,450
you see how something that is cloaked
and the in the robe of religion is

1105
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:23,810
ultimately solving a very basic earthly
biological problem.

1106
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,100
Well also if you talk about

1107
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,220
sexual
promiscuity,

1108
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,280
right?
Controlling that controls sexually

1109
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:36,150
transmitted diseases which like syphilis
and a lot of the really terminal ones

1110
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,160
before they had medication for those
things,

1111
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,120
they killed a lot of people.
A lot of people died from having sex,

1112
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,500
which is just a ruthless,
cruel thank and you got to assume that

1113
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:49,650
that's probably nature.
Trying to strike some sort of a balance,

1114
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,750
right?
We don't want to think about it that

1115
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:55,500
way,
but that's exists all throughout nature.

1116
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:59,250
When animals become overpopulated,
all of a sudden they start developing

1117
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:02,520
diseases and they fall off.
I mean that's the rabbit cycle,

1118
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,380
if you're not aware of people that
aren't aware of rabbits go in a seven

1119
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:11,670
year cycle,
so if you're around and you see a lot of

1120
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:16,470
rabbits see rabbits all over the place
and then like three years later there's

1121
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,980
no rabbits.
What happens is rabbits get to a high

1122
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:24,900
population level and then they'll
develop a disease and they die off and

1123
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:28,810
then there's only a few rabbits and then
it takes seven years until they reach

1124
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:32,230
this peak and then they die off again in
a natural setting,

1125
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:37,320
natural constant seven year cycle to
regulate the population of rabbits

1126
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:40,890
because we all know that rabbits fuck
like rabbits and they,

1127
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,980
they make a lot of babies and they don't
have that.

1128
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,690
Unfortunately with pigs,
pigs are so hardy and so ruthless that

1129
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,600
they.
They will have litters three,

1130
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:55,230
four times a year.
I think a female pig can have a litter

1131
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,330
as soon as like,
look this up,

1132
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,340
Jamie,
but I want to say it's like within six

1133
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:02,370
months,
within six months of being born she can

1134
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:04,410
give birth,
which is crazy,

1135
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:09,690
and they can just have piglets three
times a year and each time they do it

1136
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:12,930
they'll have a bunch of them and they'll
just overtake places.

1137
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:15,840
They got a problem in San Jose.
There was a news story on the other day

1138
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,550
where these people were in their house
and the pigs were knocking over the

1139
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:25,140
garbage can and eating up their lawn in
a normal residential neighborhood.

1140
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,420
Like I mean a pretty crowded
neighborhood.

1141
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,210
And these wild pigs are just roaming
through the streets now.

1142
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:31,620
They're everywhere.
Have you.

1143
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,840
Have you ever heard the term our case
selected?

1144
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,310
Does that ring a bell?
Yes,

1145
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,760
but I don't remember what it means.
So basically it's the idea that some

1146
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:43,761
species produce many offspring with the
hope that very few will survive until

1147
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,910
sexual maturity alligator frog,
right?

1148
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,960
Many fish pigs,
right.

1149
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:56,090
Versus a little on that scale,
they would be less so versus a elephant.

1150
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,520
Humans where,
you know,

1151
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,240
the gestational period,
the,

1152
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:02,070
the,
the length of parental investment that

1153
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:04,770
is required before you reach sexual
maturity as much.

1154
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,480
So it's either a lot of quantity hoping
that if you survive or much less

1155
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:12,410
quantitative but heavily parental
investment and,

1156
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,300
and just that right,
whether you are a species that is our

1157
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,180
case,
like the,

1158
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,380
the,
the reason for the arcade room doesn't

1159
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:20,400
matter,
uh,

1160
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,220
has a profound effect on the
evolutionary trajectory

1161
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,480
of that species.
Right?

1162
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:30,160
So thanks for example,
like a humans are a bike rental species,

1163
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:33,040
right?
So even though you males invest

1164
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,860
parentally less than females in the
human context,

1165
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,170
we are really championed that.
I mean in the,

1166
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,610
in the,
in the greater context of,

1167
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,120
of mammals.
Human dads are just outlandish,

1168
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,970
but there's no one like us,
nothing like us except for example,

1169
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:48,040
penguins.
That's of course you're not mammals.

1170
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:51,640
So,
and the human context then because we

1171
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,520
are by parental species,
you would expect the evolution of a few

1172
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,870
things.
One of which,

1173
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,110
and I actually recently,
I discussed this in one of my lectures

1174
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,880
because somebody asked that exact
question.

1175
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:06,180
So the evolution of romantic love is if
you like a solution to this very

1176
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:09,220
important problem,
which is you and I,

1177
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,400
male,
female have to pair bond for a certain

1178
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:15,310
period of time.
We have to be able to stand one another

1179
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:19,860
for a sufficiently large enough period
of time to get our child to sexual

1180
00:57:19,861 --> 00:57:24,861
maturity and hence they are selection
pressures for us to evolve the aspect of

1181
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:27,580
system that we call romantic love.

1182
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,010
Uh,
so,

1183
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,040
so this shows you how the pending on the
particular history of the species.

1184
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,570
You get completely different.
Interesting trajectories,

1185
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,340
Dennis.
Fascinating.

1186
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,370
And it completely makes sense if you
think about it.

1187
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,160
And there are certain animals like rats
or mice,

1188
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:48,790
they're constantly being preyed upon.
They have to develop large litters.

1189
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,010
Right?
Here's another one here at coping with

1190
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:52,030
feral hogs.
Oh,

1191
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:54,460
nice.
Five and six pigs per litter sounds of

1192
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:56,920
approximately one point five liters per
year.

1193
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:57,521
Yeah.
But when,

1194
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,890
when can they get pregnant?
They get to the first litter when

1195
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:03,940
they're 13 months of age.
It can be sexually mature at six months.

1196
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,760
What's their life expectancy?
That's a good question.

1197
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,370
I'd say 48 years of age,
that's if they don't get killed by a

1198
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:13,540
cougar series.
Another one.

1199
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:16,840
You Ready?
Check this out.

1200
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,600
So if you don't know what sexual
dimorphism is.

1201
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,530
Yes.
So right,

1202
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,470
so humans are sexually dimorphic.
But take for example,

1203
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,790
why don't you explain it to people that
don't know.

1204
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,510
Sorry.
Yes.

1205
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,540
So where,
where there is an innate sex difference.

1206
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,430
Typically we talk about,
for example,

1207
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,860
you're a sexist sex.
I realized,

1208
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,960
you know,
sexual dimorphism is just a cultural,

1209
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,260
it's a cultural construct.
It's not real.

1210
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,290
And I like how you say it with the
affectations person.

1211
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:46,210
I watch a woman in a video explained
that women are not inherently weaker

1212
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:49,190
than men and just engage in less
strength based activities.

1213
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,130
I've heard the exact same thing.
That's hilarious.

1214
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,160
Well actually at [inaudible] even been
linked to the fact that little boys are

1215
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:03,810
encouraged to play rough and tumble,
whereas little girls are dissuaded from

1216
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:06,910
doing so and that's what sets them on
their trajectory.

1217
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,880
So that Baba who plays center for
University of Nebraska can bench press

1218
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,390
500 pounds.
It's completely social construction has

1219
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:15,520
nothing to do with muscle mass.
Nothing to do with testosterone,

1220
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,850
but anyways,
so going back to differences across

1221
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,770
species,
so sexual dimorphism species are very

1222
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:22,130
sexually

1223
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,650
dimorphic.
See Elephant seals.

1224
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,390
You have a male who's massive 44 times
the size of a female or a mountain

1225
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:30,350
gorillas,
right?

1226
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:35,450
So if you look at the extent to which
there is or isn't sexual dimorphism with

1227
00:59:35,451 --> 00:59:40,070
the species,
that itself perfectly predicts the

1228
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:45,071
mating system within that species,
meaning if there is a huge sexual

1229
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:47,840
dimorphism,
typically the males are bigger than the

1230
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:50,270
females,
but sometimes you have sex reversal

1231
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:53,060
species.
Then you have privilege in this meeting,

1232
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:58,061
meaning what one male monopolizes sexual
access to many females,

1233
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:02,210
and the reason why they develop that
size is because that's the combat that

1234
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:05,450
they engage in where the winner then
gets the genetic lottery,

1235
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:06,500
right?
On the other hand,

1236
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:10,760
when you have species where the two
sexes are equal sized,

1237
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,490
then you have typically monogamous
mating,

1238
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,610
like in the case of some bird species,
but even there,

1239
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:17,840
by the way,
even though they're supposed to be

1240
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:19,190
monogamous,
once in a while,

1241
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:21,440
they go behind the bush.
Genetic tests have shown,

1242
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,960
well,
birds are really only male.

1243
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,830
Penguins are a big one that people
bring.

1244
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,660
Exactly.
Throwing monogamous for a year,

1245
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,390
right?
But even even within what you consider

1246
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:33,380
to be a monogamist window,
there are some tests that show that once

1247
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:36,110
in a while we do go behind the bushes,
that it's behind.

1248
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:38,120
That Bush did not win the game.

1249
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,650
I tried to,
once in a while,

1250
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,380
uh,
use my evolutionary stuff on my wife to

1251
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:48,890
explain why it might be okay to do this.
She hasn't really bought into the whole

1252
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:49,724
thing.
Read more,

1253
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,200
get her head out of the bushes.
Exactly sand wherever.

1254
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,820
By the way,
incidentally,

1255
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,770
this whole idea of taking an
evolutionary explanation and then people

1256
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:05,240
thinking that that then justifies or
condones the behavior as a classic

1257
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:07,010
reason why people hate evolutionary
psychology,

1258
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,420
right?
So if you explain,

1259
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:09,910
you know,
here's a,

1260
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,080
here's an evolutionary explanation for
rape,

1261
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,200
here's an evolution explanation for wild
child abuse happens.

1262
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:19,850
If there's a step parent in the family,
here's why people might have difficulty

1263
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,440
staying true to their monogamous unions,
then people will get very upset at you

1264
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:28,850
because they somehow conflate the fact
that you are explaining the phenomenon

1265
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,290
using science as meaning that you are
saying it clears your moral judgment and

1266
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,600
of course it doesn't,
but that's one of the places where

1267
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:39,020
people get really upset at you and we'll
send you hate mail in that moral

1268
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:42,020
judgment is also cultural,
which gets really strange when you look

1269
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:44,330
at certain religions like the Mormons,
right?

1270
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:49,950
The whole reason why the Mormons a setup
this compound in Mexico while they moved

1271
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:55,280
to Mexico,
is when polygamy was made illegal in the

1272
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,040
United States.
Will we're just going to go to Mexico.

1273
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,980
And that's where Mitt Romney's family
came around.

1274
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:04,070
Which is really bizarre.
Isn't it amazing how whenever there are

1275
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:04,904
these,
uh,

1276
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,900
polygynous rulings from God,
it's always that.

1277
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:12,380
It's one man with multiple women.
It's never been a polyandrous thing.

1278
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:15,230
It's never been the other way around.
Don't want to get a gang bang.

1279
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,700
I didn't want a bunch of dudes.
You know,

1280
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:20,940
there is one place in the world where
there is polyandry.

1281
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,500
Do you know where it is?
Somewhere?

1282
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:24,840
That sucks.
It's called Tibetan.

1283
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,870
Polyandry told you it's safe.
It's fraternal to Beth and polyandry.

1284
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,230
Eternal.
Yeah.

1285
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:33,960
Which means b means brothers and
sisters.

1286
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:38,580
No meaning at a frat together,
meaning that the woman who is being

1287
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:43,581
shared across many men,
those men are brothers.

1288
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:46,620
That's crazy.
But here's the evolutionary explanation,

1289
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,420
right?
Imagine where you have a system for

1290
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:50,990
whatever reason,
we're not every man could be mated.

1291
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,300
That's not a good thing because you have
a lot of men who are going to be

1292
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:55,400
sexually frustrated,
right?

1293
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:56,670
China,
right?

1294
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,650
Exactly.
You know,

1295
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:01,970
so therefore by creating a system where,
okay,

1296
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,060
not everybody could be guaranteed that
their reproductive fitness is going to

1297
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:09,270
be assured,
but at least they're kin selection will

1298
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:10,180
be assured.
Meaning what?

1299
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,620
I share half of my genes on average from
my brother.

1300
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,130
So either I will impregnate the woman,
in which case great.

1301
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:22,260
Or my brother will impregnate her,
in which case I'm still indirectly not

1302
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:25,110
through direct reproductive fitness,
but through kin selection,

1303
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:29,850
I'm still extending my jeans.
So even in cases where men share a

1304
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,910
woman,
it has to be in the context of all in

1305
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:33,744
the family.

1306
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:36,480
Whoa,
I'm blowing your mind.

1307
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,490
That's,
that's an intense thing and that's.

1308
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,330
That must be just a reaction to the fact
that there is much more men than there

1309
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:44,610
are women.
And why would that be?

1310
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,360
Why are there more men than there?
So sometimes it could be.

1311
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,150
That's called by the way and operational
sex ratio.

1312
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:56,280
If there are imbalances between males
and females within a particular niche,

1313
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:01,970
sometimes it could be because of certain
inheritance structures where it's only

1314
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:07,200
the eldest who can have enough money
through inheritance so the other guys

1315
01:04:07,201 --> 01:04:11,040
can't really afford a what.
So there are all sorts of institutional

1316
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:16,041
reasons beyond sex,
racial reasons where some men may

1317
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:20,970
otherwise be out of the mating market
and we know that societies were.

1318
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:25,050
A lot of men are sitting around sexually
frustrated is not going to be societies

1319
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,530
that are conducive to quiet and so
therefore.

1320
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,990
So therefore,
even in the context where you have

1321
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:33,210
something like polyandry,
which is something that typically

1322
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:34,770
evolutionary speaking,
you wouldn't expect.

1323
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:39,360
When it arises,
it arises as a response to a real

1324
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:40,920
evolutionary problem,
so,

1325
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,440
so every,
I mean most things that you could think

1326
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:47,220
of ultimately have some evolutionary
expansion to them and that's why I fell

1327
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:51,570
in love with evolution because the
explanatory power that is afforded once

1328
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:56,571
you have that key to understand things
via evolutionary thinking,

1329
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:02,450
it becomes incredibly powerful and once
the parameters and the variables change,

1330
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,910
the behavior changes to adapt to those
parameters.

1331
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:07,380
Variables.
Exactly right.

1332
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:09,870
A perfect example that is fighter
pilots,

1333
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,930
fighter pilots are classically wife
swappers.

1334
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,250
Is that true?
Yeah.

1335
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:18,280
There's a lot of that goes on in those
communities because these people

1336
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,210
are swingers,
you mean?

1337
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,110
Yeah,
well sort of.

1338
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:20,860
Yeah.
Well it's.

1339
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,380
You know what it is.
They know that they're probably going to

1340
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:26,800
die and if they love their wife,
they want someone else to love their

1341
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:30,520
wife as much as they do.
And the idea is that if they all just

1342
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:32,830
shit like life is,
it's different.

1343
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:37,210
It's much more fleeting.
It's much more fragile than it is in the

1344
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:39,820
world of the Accountant,
you know?

1345
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:45,150
So I think it makes sense that that's
very prevalent in those communities.

1346
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,173
So the,
the,

1347
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:46,781
the,
if you like,

1348
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:49,780
the sexual risk taking is a form of
insurance policy.

1349
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:51,300
Say it like if you,
uh,

1350
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,620
you,
you were married and Jamie was married

1351
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,060
and you were both fighter pilots and uh,
you both would do missions together,

1352
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,720
like an intense bond between you guys
and you know,

1353
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,940
you would just swap wives who would just
say,

1354
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:04,660
look,
you know,

1355
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,870
the idea is like if you die,
if you get shot down and you die,

1356
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,910
you know,
you want your wife to be taken care of

1357
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:10,840
by someone who loves her.

1358
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,000
Right?
As long as they had a smaller penis in

1359
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:15,830
me,
Jamie's got a hog tell you it's got a

1360
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:19,030
hard on the kid.
But by going,

1361
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,130
going good luck with that.
Going back to,

1362
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:25,900
by the way,
I'll send you the link to the global,

1363
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,960
a penis sizes around the world and I'll
just point you to where Lebanon scores

1364
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,520
on that.
Whereas how's it go?

1365
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,410
Pretty good.
Top is it,

1366
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:37,920
is it like where people are like,
we're,

1367
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,670
there's more danger,
dicks or bigger?

1368
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,130
I've never heard that this is the first
time,

1369
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,610
well isn't been like so danger.
One of the most dangerous places,

1370
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:49,150
right?
They danger and in terms of violence and

1371
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,680
crime and like,
look,

1372
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:54,360
if you classically,
let's all,

1373
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:57,850
let's put away all pretenses of racism.
Right?

1374
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:59,800
Back.
Black guys supposedly have the biggest

1375
01:06:59,801 --> 01:07:00,581
dicks.
Right?

1376
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:03,100
Why is that?
Do they have um,

1377
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,050
more athleticism too.

1378
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,000
That's a lot of things that people
connect to it.

1379
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:11,410
So drone system scientifically,
has that been absolutely proven?

1380
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:14,140
You know it.
And I let it go.

1381
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,300
I know that anecdotally we hear that.
You're like,

1382
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:16,481
no,
no,

1383
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:20,140
no Lebanese.
If you just check it's a Lebanese people

1384
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:23,110
know mean it's always know it's a
stereotype,

1385
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:25,040
but I truly don't know whether it's
scientists.

1386
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,940
I mean there's certain stereotypes that
are just,

1387
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:33,330
there's a reason there and that's a,
that's one that is acceptable when you

1388
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:34,660
talk about black people.
Yeah.

1389
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,470
Because it's got the venture that it's
complementary.

1390
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:37,240
Right,
right.

1391
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,430
Uh,
I'll tell you a great story about racial

1392
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,340
differences.
So in 1995,

1393
01:07:42,341 --> 01:07:43,960
I think it was 1995,
[inaudible] 96.

1394
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,330
I'm giving a talk.
So this is shortly after my phd,

1395
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:48,340
I just started as a young assistant
professor.

1396
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:52,690
I'm giving a talk at this big
international psychology conference and

1397
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:56,290
is maybe a thousand 500 people in this
room and that that's quite a big size

1398
01:07:56,291 --> 01:08:00,490
for academic conference and there's a
real buzz in the room as if there's

1399
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,560
tension and I'm not exactly sure why.

1400
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,350
They're certainly not 10 set me at that
point.

1401
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:07,190
I was just a young guy.
Nobody knew who the hell I was

1402
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,250
immediately before I get up to present.
So the guy who was immediately before me

1403
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,380
is a gentleman by the name of Phillip
Rushton.

1404
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:15,470
Have you ever know,
you know him?

1405
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,100
Phil oppression is a,
uh,

1406
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,920
was he recently passed away.
He was a Canadian based psychologist who

1407
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:26,921
is probably the preeminent psychologist
who studied racial differences and

1408
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:31,940
offered evolutionary explanations for
why these racial differences might

1409
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,150
exist.
And most notably he had looked at a

1410
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,850
suppose that racial differences,
racial differences in intelligence using

1411
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,090
a postmortem cranial size.
Right.

1412
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:49,091
So the fact is that if the carrying
capacity cavities bigger or smaller than

1413
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:52,730
you assume that that means the person
from this race is more intelligent than

1414
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:54,650
that race,
this controversial research.

1415
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:56,510
Very,
very spicy research.

1416
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:59,990
So anyways,
so this guy gets up to present his stuff

1417
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:02,780
and he starts putting up slides of black
male,

1418
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:04,100
black female,
white male,

1419
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:05,680
white female,
and you see the,

1420
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,310
I mean the crowd is like,
you know,

1421
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,340
sharpening their knives to lynch the sky
and I have to get up and present right

1422
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:16,280
after him and I'm thinking that just by
proxy,

1423
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,620
just by,
by being close to him,

1424
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,060
I'm going to get killed.

1425
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,650
Now the good news is that immediately
after he finished his presentation,

1426
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,310
out of the 1,500 people who were there,
about 1000,

1427
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:32,320
425 left the room to find him really.
So.

1428
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,870
So there was nearly no one left to
listen to my talk.

1429
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:40,670
And that was one of the few times where
I was actually very pleased to have very

1430
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:43,220
few people listening to me.
So they left the room.

1431
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,800
And what do they do that I think they
wanted to sort of,

1432
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,090
uh,
you know,

1433
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,160
challenge him and confront him and so
on.

1434
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,340
Does when a guy does a speech like that,
does he allow a question?

1435
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:54,050
Answer period is very,
very good question.

1436
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:57,020
So usually you would leave depending on
the size of the.

1437
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:00,920
I mean let's say you have 25 minutes,
so you might do 20 minutes leaving five

1438
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:05,240
minutes for q and a,
he went to the last second so that there

1439
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:09,830
was no opportunity for questions and
then he sort of was whisked out.

1440
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:12,320
Uh,
and so I was really,

1441
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,350
really pleased that almost nobody stayed
from my talk.

1442
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:20,930
What's interesting about that is there a
certain truths that you're not allowed

1443
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:25,931
to explore and you're not allowed to
explore the possibility that some human

1444
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:31,151
beings may be not as intelligent as
other human beings on an individual

1445
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:34,160
level or as a group level.
What I was going to.

1446
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:34,770
Oh,
sorry,

1447
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,280
go ahead.
As on an individual level,

1448
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,430
we accept that,
but on a group level we're not willing

1449
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:43,640
to on an individual level,
at the individual level,

1450
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:44,820
even while they're retarded.
I,

1451
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,980
well that's why it's proof,
but,

1452
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:52,730
but it's interesting that like there's
certain genetic variables that will

1453
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:57,260
accept that are a product of the
environment in which these people

1454
01:10:57,261 --> 01:10:58,880
develop.
Like for instance,

1455
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:03,530
inuits are much more adapted to cold.
Their hands don't get numb.

1456
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:06,440
They don't get frostbite nearly as easy.
They can operate.

1457
01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:09,290
They have been much better circulation
in cold weather and their hands and

1458
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:11,630
their feet and let's,
because they've been living up there for

1459
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:14,190
generation after generation there.
There's certain

1460
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,510
things that we don't accept though and
one of the big ones is intelligence.

1461
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,230
We don't accept that some people could
live in a soft world where things are

1462
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:25,650
easy and they develop like a slow,
lazy mind.

1463
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:29,280
Whereas some people develop in a very
tricky world with this constant

1464
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:31,500
innovation going on and they develop a
sharper mind.

1465
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:32,471
You know,
we,

1466
01:11:32,471 --> 01:11:34,590
we were,
we resist that because we don't want

1467
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,480
anyone thinking that they're dumber than
other people.

1468
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,770
Right.
Well,

1469
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:38,391
um,
the,

1470
01:11:38,391 --> 01:11:40,170
the,
the point though is that I'm not sure

1471
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:45,171
that anybody has offered compelling
explanation for why they would be

1472
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:49,370
selection pressures in environment a
versus environment,

1473
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:54,360
be for there to be greater intelligence.
So I think there is some evidence that,

1474
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:59,361
especially European Jews who have more
Nobel prize awards than anyone else.

1475
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:03,090
Why do you have to dis me by saying
European Jews?

1476
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:04,470
Why don't you answer the Arab Jews?

1477
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,363
Well,
it's true though.

1478
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:08,460
It's just because you're a very
intelligent man,

1479
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,740
obviously,
but I'm neither your,

1480
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,920
well,
I'm sort of European,

1481
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,410
Italian.
Um,

1482
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,470
you know,
there's something fascinating about that

1483
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:18,120
to me.
And I wonder if that's cultural.

1484
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,040
I wonder if that's educational.
I mean,

1485
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:20,671
what,
what is that?

1486
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,330
So,
so I can certainly definitively point to

1487
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:27,040
the cultural elements,
like the genetic element is,

1488
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,280
is debatable,
right?

1489
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,400
Uh,
and so it's neither,

1490
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:30,810
yes or no,
it's unclear.

1491
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,200
But the cultural element that I'll share
with you a personal anecdote,

1492
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:35,620
I don't,
I don't think I've ever shared it on the

1493
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:38,280
show before or if I have,
it's still worth repeating.

1494
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,130
Uh,
after I finished my Mba.

1495
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,400
I mean,
I knew I was going to go on and do my

1496
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:47,580
phd and become a professor,
but at one point I had a brother who

1497
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:50,640
lives in southern California.
It was a very successful businessman and

1498
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:54,570
I was coming out here to see whether I
want it to go and do my phd at Uc

1499
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,460
Irvine,
uh,

1500
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,420
versus other schools where I had been
accepted.

1501
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,651
And he said,
hey,

1502
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:00,630
you know what,
why don't you put on the proverbial

1503
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:05,100
sooth and maybe work with me for a few
years before you go on to get your phd.

1504
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:08,130
It might be a nice thing for you to get
some work experience outside of

1505
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:11,340
academia.
I wasn't really entertaining it.

1506
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,940
Buy My mother a herd of this
possibility.

1507
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,530
And so when I went back to Montreal,
she,

1508
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,470
she took me aside to one of the rooms
and very,

1509
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:20,700
very concerned.
She said to me,

1510
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,870
remember if you,
if you don't go on to get your phd,

1511
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:26,310
I mean,
do you want people to remember you as

1512
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:30,150
somebody who's dropped out of school?
So from her perspective,

1513
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:34,100
from the standards that we're expected,
somebody who had,

1514
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,170
you know,
I've got an Undergrad in mathematics and

1515
01:13:37,171 --> 01:13:39,800
computer science and I've gotten an MBA.
Uh,

1516
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:42,720
if I stopped at that point,
I will drop out.

1517
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:47,040
I'm a dropout from school.
I have an MBA from a top school right

1518
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,890
now.
Of course I didn't do a phd from my

1519
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:53,280
parents' approval,
but it just gives you the sense of the

1520
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,690
type of expectations.
Then the,

1521
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,460
the,
the,

1522
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,390
the imparting of love for learning,
for knowledge,

1523
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:05,190
for wisdom and achievement and
achievement that is inbred in you from

1524
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:08,400
the minute you come out of the womb.
So whether there is a genetic component

1525
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:09,240
or not,
I don't know,

1526
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:13,060
but I can certainly say that the
component is very alluring

1527
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:16,330
cultural components.
It exists very strongly in the Korean

1528
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:19,180
community.
It was a good buddy of mine when I was a

1529
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:22,480
kid who's Korean,
who was on the US national taekwondo

1530
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:25,720
team while he was in his residency as a
doctor.

1531
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,570
I mean,
he was a fucking animal.

1532
01:14:28,571 --> 01:14:30,220
This kid,
I mean,

1533
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,230
he,
I've never met anybody who worked

1534
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,090
harder.
He slept like three or four hours a

1535
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:35,350
night.
He was always exhausted.

1536
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:38,110
Every time you look at me,
a giant bags under his eyes and he

1537
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:40,510
couldn't possibly have physically worked
harder than he did.

1538
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:40,991
I mean,
did.

1539
01:14:40,991 --> 01:14:45,180
He did everything he possibly could.
One the US national title went on to

1540
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:49,300
compete in international competitions
all while he was going to medical school

1541
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:53,470
instead of a madness.
And the way he described it to me,

1542
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,640
you know,
it was,

1543
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:57,460
it was more of a prison.
The way he described it,

1544
01:14:57,461 --> 01:15:01,050
he was just burdened.
He was always tired and he,

1545
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:03,670
it was just expected of him.
He was really upset by it.

1546
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,320
Yeah.
It's not quite as.

1547
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,940
I wouldn't,
I don't know what the right term is.

1548
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:11,800
Autocratic or dictatorial.
I think it's more a,

1549
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,530
the Baiting,
right?

1550
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:15,600
I mean,
thinking about,

1551
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,050
for example,
the Talmudic tradition,

1552
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,750
when you sit down and you debate,
you discuss you the bay.

1553
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:24,910
So there's this,
there's this endless inculcation of the

1554
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:29,911
pursuit of knowledge just for the sake
of knowledge that is endemic to all

1555
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,590
Jewish homes.
Uh,

1556
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,380
and to,
to the extent that some of my family

1557
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:38,740
members did not have that particular
orientation,

1558
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,050
frankly,
I didn't get along with them as well

1559
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,310
because I have some family members who
are quite mercantile in their approach.

1560
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:49,150
They just care about money and I was
always maybe to a fault,

1561
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:52,150
somebody who cared more about ideas than
I did about money.

1562
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:54,750
What could be a fault?
How could there be a fault there and,

1563
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,330
and,
and,

1564
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,110
and not pursuing it.

1565
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,060
Well in the sense,
for example,

1566
01:15:58,061 --> 01:16:01,210
that I'm not a careerist in other words,
I do things out of purity.

1567
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,280
I don't strategize.
I don't.

1568
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:04,690
Sounds like an awesome dude.
Well,

1569
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,800
thank you.
All right,

1570
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,630
well,
I'll give you an example.

1571
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,100
I'll give you a very concrete example,
right?

1572
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,630
You were asking earlier,
you know,

1573
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,840
well,
why don't you get a job here?

1574
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:14,320
Well,
listen,

1575
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,490
by me taking very open positions on
topics that are quote politically

1576
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,700
incorrect,
I'm not being a careerist.

1577
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,530
If I would shut my mouth about all
these,

1578
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:26,500
these issues,
maybe some university that might

1579
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:29,860
otherwise be very impressed with my
scientific dossier might say,

1580
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:30,430
Hey,
this is,

1581
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,320
this guy's good.
But if he's a shitster,

1582
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,890
if he appears on Joe Rogan and makes fun
of trigger warnings and talks about

1583
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,830
Islam,
well he's a bit of a loose cannon.

1584
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:43,950
This is why I disagree.
The amount of input that you can have on

1585
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:48,820
a culture based out of teaching a
classroom of 100 people or more whatever

1586
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:52,480
it is in comparison to what you're doing
already on your youtube videos.

1587
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,650
Thank you.
It's.

1588
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:56,830
It's phenomenal.
The reach that you have right now.

1589
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:59,800
I'm going to send this to some of the
universities that are supposed to hire

1590
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:00,320
me.
Well,

1591
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,320
they don't look.
They're all in the past.

1592
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,930
These people did understand what's going
on right now.

1593
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:06,530
Right now.
There's.

1594
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,130
There's a podcast that you're doing
right now

1595
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,330
that will be heard and watched by more
than a million people for sure.

1596
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,430
Without a doubt.
Not only that,

1597
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,110
it'll exist in perpetuity as long as we
have digital content,

1598
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,900
it'll exist.
So there's people listening to this

1599
01:17:23,901 --> 01:17:25,610
right now,
50 years from now,

1600
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,770
100 years from now,
if they're still alive,

1601
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:31,920
if there's still a world to live in 100
years now people are going to be living

1602
01:17:31,921 --> 01:17:34,760
in listening to this.
You are literally,

1603
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,100
you know,
music to my ears what you're saying

1604
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:41,090
because I just had this conversation
recently where I was talking to a

1605
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:44,440
university about the importance actually
to,

1606
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:49,280
to a dean when I was talking about the
importance of how do we judge academics.

1607
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:51,710
I mean academics are meme creators,
right?

1608
01:17:51,711 --> 01:17:56,000
We create memes through our science,
but we're also a meme propagators now.

1609
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,520
To me,
one of the highlights of coming to

1610
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:00,080
southern California and that's saying a
lot,

1611
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,460
given how much I love southern
California,

1612
01:18:01,461 --> 01:18:06,290
is to appear on your show because I know
that the platform that you have,

1613
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:11,470
it'll take me 16,000 years to be able to
even come close to achieving that type

1614
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:12,410
of.

1615
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,970
And it's not because of a narcissist
thing.

1616
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:17,350
I want to be famous because ultimately
I'm about spreading ideas and that's

1617
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,400
exactly what you said.
I mean a million people are going to

1618
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:22,340
listen to,
so if I can get one percent of that

1619
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:25,670
million to be interested in evolutionary
theory after what we've discussed,

1620
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:29,300
how does that compare to having 25
students in my classroom,

1621
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,800
but most universities,
you're exactly right.

1622
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,240
Haven't caught up with the times.
No one has the university itself.

1623
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,820
Okay.
This is not the only way you can learn

1624
01:18:37,821 --> 01:18:42,170
these ideas,
that the only way to get an education is

1625
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:45,050
to get a degree.
To go to sit in class,

1626
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,860
to do all the work.
The teacher prescribes all this stuff

1627
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:52,100
that you have to turn in and all the
papers that you have to do.

1628
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,230
That's not the only way to get an
education.

1629
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,810
That's nonsense.
This is a human construct and we're

1630
01:18:56,811 --> 01:18:59,210
living in a world where that doesn't
make much sense anymore.

1631
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:04,280
You're gonna have in the future,
a primary education is going to be

1632
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,170
online.
It's without a doubt.

1633
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:09,620
Why travel somewhere white go somewhere.
Especially when you dealing with all

1634
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:13,280
these fucking assholes in these campuses
that are instituting all these

1635
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:17,840
ridiculous rules of social behavior and
all these social misfits that want to

1636
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:21,200
level the playing field and all this
nonsense that's going on.

1637
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:25,460
That's really it.
It stifles a lot of open discussion.

1638
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:29,930
It stifles a lot of,
of exchanges of information because of

1639
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,300
these ideas.
These people have that these are these

1640
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:37,301
rigid ideas that cannot be breached.
I think we're living in a world now

1641
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:42,371
where you have instant access to
information to go to a physical place to

1642
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:45,920
learn.
Seems to me to be kind of archaic.

1643
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,950
It's kind of retro isn't ours.
Just recently asked.

1644
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,080
Maybe I shouldn't be commenting
publicly,

1645
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:52,580
but I go ahead and do it.
Uh,

1646
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,370
there's a company called great courses.
Have you heard of it?

1647
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:57,080
Yeah.
They were a sponsor of the podcast in

1648
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:57,880
the beginning.
No kidding.

1649
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

1650
01:19:58,401 --> 01:20:00,200
I have one of them at home on
psychology,

1651
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:04,400
so I was honored to be asked to.
It hasn't yet.

1652
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,380
We haven't signed a contract.
They're still looking into it,

1653
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,040
but the mere fact that they

1654
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,120
contacted me as one of the perspective
people to put together a course for

1655
01:20:12,121 --> 01:20:15,090
them,
a great courses course on evolutionary

1656
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:16,670
psychology and so awesome.
Thank you.

1657
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:17,400
So,
I mean,

1658
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:22,230
imagine the number of people that I can
potentially reach by putting together

1659
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:23,400
that course.
Look,

1660
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,290
there's this guy.
You should check him out.

1661
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:28,050
Robert Sapolsky or you know,
very well known.

1662
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,460
Yeah,
from Stanford.

1663
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:31,200
I'm not loving you more and more by the
second.

1664
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:35,130
I work on toxoplasmosis.
I've been studying him for years.

1665
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,520
Look at this stuff on baboons.
Isn't it mind going,

1666
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:42,270
oh my God.
So I need to spend like months every

1667
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,450
year in Africa.
Youtube clips.

1668
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,900
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of that.

1669
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:47,250
So anyway,
so I wrote to him,

1670
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:49,350
by the way,
maybe I shouldn't be advertising a

1671
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:50,850
failure,
but it's okay.

1672
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,180
So I wrote to him because I really
wanted him on my show and he was very

1673
01:20:56,611 --> 01:20:57,030
gracious.

1674
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,960
He responded right away,
said,

1675
01:20:57,961 --> 01:20:58,794
look,
I'd love to.

1676
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,090
So on.
I'm just,

1677
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,180
I'm working on two books.
I'm shutting down everything.

1678
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,060
I'm saying no to everybody.
Maybe some point in the future,

1679
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:09,270
which of course I completely understand,
but you know,

1680
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:11,550
look at this guy.
I mean you go to his youtube,

1681
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,490
whatever,
900,000 views,

1682
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:17,190
one point,
1 million of a lecture that typically

1683
01:21:17,191 --> 01:21:19,530
would have been viewed by 80 people.
Right?

1684
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,680
I Bet I sent a couple of hundred
thousand people to those things.

1685
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,470
Just no kidding.
Big Fan of that guy been sending people

1686
01:21:25,471 --> 01:21:28,380
to is his videos and his lectures for
years.

1687
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,260
So let's talk about what are the
findings from his drone to do that.

1688
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,870
Sure.
So he's got research,

1689
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,870
because you mentioned baboons showing
that in a,

1690
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,990
in a,
in a sort of a hierarchical society of

1691
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:44,400
baboons,
the lower ranked baboons will have

1692
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:48,960
higher cortisol levels,
will have more stress hormones.

1693
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,570
While you intuitively you might think
the opposite.

1694
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:54,380
You might think that the higher the rank
of the baboon,

1695
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,230
the more stressed he is because he's.
He asked to defend against all the other

1696
01:21:58,231 --> 01:22:00,540
dangers and maintain his position and so
on.

1697
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:06,140
So people took this exact study and
applied it in an organizational context

1698
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:12,050
where they looked at an organizational
hierarchy and took cortisol levels of

1699
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,140
people in a big organization.
I think it was a the public health

1700
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:20,250
system in Britain,
the higher the rank of the employee,

1701
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,930
the lower his or her cortisol level and
the argument.

1702
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:25,801
So you might say,
well,

1703
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:28,200
why would that be?
Wouldn't the person who is higher rank

1704
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:31,380
be more stressed?
I mean a CEO has to have more stress

1705
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,603
than,
you know,

1706
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:36,210
the janitor.
And one of the arguments at least that

1707
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:41,211
they proposed was the idea of freedom.
The guy who was at the lowest rung of

1708
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:46,110
the hierarchy has to be told when he
could go and relieve himself with his

1709
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,100
bodily functions.
Right?

1710
01:22:47,101 --> 01:22:47,910
I mean,
his,

1711
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:52,320
the amount of free destiny that he has
in his daily life is very limited.

1712
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,740
Whereas at least the CEO,
even though he's working very hard,

1713
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:59,050
he's more master of his,
uh,

1714
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,360
of his daily life.
So for example,

1715
01:23:00,361 --> 01:23:02,040
I work all the time.
I can work 10,

1716
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:02,731
12,
15,

1717
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,500
18 hour days,
but yet I still am.

1718
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,040
I feel like I'm always free because
there's

1719
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,880
nobody who's telling me what to do with
when at any time and apparently just

1720
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:13,930
that has a profound effect on your
cortisol levels and the origins of that

1721
01:23:13,931 --> 01:23:17,830
whole study were originally due to
Polsky's work with baboons.

1722
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,120
If I believe,
if I'm correct,

1723
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:24,180
well you know that the finding is
mirrored in a special ops guys versus

1724
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:29,200
versus enlisted men versus your average
soldier.

1725
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:34,201
Like one of the big issues that people
have today is ptsd and one of the

1726
01:23:34,961 --> 01:23:39,961
factors in ptsd is people who are
waiting for things to happen versus

1727
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:43,150
people who are making things happen.
Whereas seals,

1728
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,270
rangers,
people that they send in to go and kick

1729
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,930
ass and take names.
Those guys have way less stress,

1730
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:55,540
which is kind of crazy.
Way less incidences of PTSD and you

1731
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,900
know,
obviously still tremendously stressful

1732
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:01,870
and still a lot of instances of ptsd but
less.

1733
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,680
And the more guys that I talked to that
have served will tell you that the

1734
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:08,290
reason is that they're active and that
they're.

1735
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:10,540
They're proactive.
They're the ones who are moving in and

1736
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:14,260
doing these things and they're going
after these bad guys and hunting them

1737
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:17,260
down essentially.
Whereas the other people are sitting

1738
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:20,490
around the base worrying they're going
to get attacked or you know,

1739
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:24,370
saying on their post or driving a car,
worrying they're going to hit an IED.

1740
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,590
Very interesting.
So let's,

1741
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,750
let's propose it.
And another hypothesis was maybe

1742
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:33,780
somebody who's a graduate student might
test a coaches versus players.

1743
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,930
So based on your logic of the findings
that you just said,

1744
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:43,260
the coach should probably have much
higher cortisol levels because he writes

1745
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:49,030
out of his control and that's why you
see them on the sidelines going freaking

1746
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:50,500
out,
going crazy because you really can't

1747
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:52,480
affect much influence on the game.

1748
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,380
I mean you can add the margins that in
terms of the strategies and so on.

1749
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:58,810
But the guys that are in the battle,
I mean,

1750
01:24:58,811 --> 01:24:59,181
I,
you know,

1751
01:24:59,181 --> 01:25:02,620
I was a competitive soccer player and of
course you are not the few minutes

1752
01:25:02,621 --> 01:25:05,170
before you've got butterflies.
Once you're in the thick of things,

1753
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,330
you're not stressed,
you're focused.

1754
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:08,260
I mean,
you're in the flow,

1755
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,750
but the coaches,
they're the ones who are about to have a

1756
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:11,840
heart attack,
so I thank you.

1757
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:15,130
The intestine,
that is probably also a big factor why

1758
01:25:15,131 --> 01:25:20,131
it's so difficult to beat a champion in,
in combat sports because the champion is

1759
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:23,170
the one who's in control and the
champion is one has been dominating.

1760
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:26,560
He has fear and intimidation on his side
and therefore he has less stress.

1761
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,700
Right?
He's been,

1762
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:29,410
I mean,
it's going to have stress no matter what

1763
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:32,710
if you're entering into a fight,
but the person who's trying to overcome

1764
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:35,890
the psychological barrier that is the
champion in front of them,

1765
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:36,820
like this is big.

1766
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,910
There's a persona that's attached to
like a good example is like Mike Tyson,

1767
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:45,640
when he was in his prime,
nobody wanted to believe that he can be

1768
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:49,060
beaten and men would lose before they
ever got into the ring that he.

1769
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:50,790
Buster Douglas case.
Yeah.

1770
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,730
You did.
Yeah.

1771
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:55,720
So have you ever seen the study,
and I don't know if we've mentioned it

1772
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:57,100
here before,
uh,

1773
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:00,280
I think it was published in the journal
called a motion where they looked at,

1774
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:04,400
I think it was mma fighters,
whether they smiled or not before the

1775
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,750
contest.
Have you seen this before?

1776
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:06,740
No.
Okay.

1777
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,470
You just send me a private message and
I'll look for it.

1778
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:14,330
I can't remember the exact details,
but there was some nonverbal cues that

1779
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:17,470
were studied prior to a fight that if,
if,

1780
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:21,890
if I remember the study correctly,
were highly predictive of the eventual

1781
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:22,910
outcome.
Wow.

1782
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:23,470
That's fast.

1783
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,500
And is that cool?
Well,

1784
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:27,590
I bet they're highly predictive of the
amount of focus at the fighters entering

1785
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:30,740
to the octagon with here he goes,
smiles are for losers.

1786
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:35,720
I love how you come up.
Studies show that MMA fighters who smile

1787
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:37,170
before fights don't do well.
Well,

1788
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:40,950
this is at a way in which I doubt you
could really tell and that was published

1789
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:42,980
that what they're saying,
the pre-fight stare down.

1790
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:45,020
Okay.
So the preflight steered on that.

1791
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,400
Well,
that makes sense because if you're

1792
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,230
smiling,
it,

1793
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,900
it most likely means that you're not
really in the game.

1794
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:52,490
Right.
As expected,

1795
01:26:52,491 --> 01:26:56,180
smile intensity predicted both the
outcomes of fights as well as the more

1796
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:59,600
detailed measures of inflight hostility.
Interestingly,

1797
01:26:59,601 --> 01:27:04,280
the smiles predicted both reduced
hostility from the smiler as well as

1798
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,640
increased hostility from his opponent.
In other words,

1799
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:10,520
it seemed that both fighters were
attuned to the information being

1800
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:12,710
communicated in the preflight smile.

1801
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:17,900
These results held even when controlling
for existing differences in skill.

1802
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:20,510
I e the betting odds of the fight and
strength,

1803
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:25,010
height and weight though don't go.
Don't go drastically altering your

1804
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:28,040
gambling strategy just yet.
The betting lines still did a better job

1805
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,560
overall in predicting fights compared to
just smile intensity.

1806
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:31,813
Yeah.
Huh.

1807
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:35,030
Have you.
Have we talked here about a ratio?

1808
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,681
Yes.
No,

1809
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:37,490
but I,
I've,

1810
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:40,660
I know what you're talking about.
They're like the size of fingers at one

1811
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:41,090
of the,
uh,

1812
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:44,320
the,
the length of a digital always.

1813
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:47,030
I've actually,
I think I've thought about at some point

1814
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:52,031
either asking you or my nephew to get
access to mma fighters to take some

1815
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:58,070
measures that capture how androgen highs
they are,

1816
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,090
how much exposure to testosterone at
whether it be,

1817
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,390
for example,
through certain facial features or

1818
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:06,740
through A.
Well,

1819
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,030
they're two d,
four d ratio,

1820
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:12,750
which is a measure of how much
testosterone you've been exposed to in

1821
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:15,470
utero.
And so I actually have a study right now

1822
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:18,000
with one of my graduate students without
a Rumiyah,

1823
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,880
uh,
where we're looking at the links between

1824
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:23,270
testosterone and extreme sports using
the exact same idea.

1825
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,380
And so,
um,

1826
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:29,380
of course an obvious hypothesis might be
that on average and then they fighters

1827
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,930
compared to a control,
normal population,

1828
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,900
non non fighters,
uh,

1829
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,580
will be more androgens.
You would think that that has to be

1830
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:38,414
true,
right?

1831
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,500
I don't know.
Okay.

1832
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:45,980
Because I would wonder what are the,
I would say maybe probably successful

1833
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:49,720
ones I see we've moderated by whether
they are,

1834
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,560
what their trajectory in their career
was.

1835
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:56,180
I think there are a lot of people who
enter into mixed martial arts or martial

1836
01:28:56,181 --> 01:29:01,181
arts in general because they recognize
there's a lot of benefit in trying

1837
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,060
to overcome extreme challenges and that
they're attracted to these things

1838
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:09,900
because they get addicted to the rush,
the adrenaline rush of a challenge and

1839
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,220
it's very few challenges that are
intense as one on one competition with

1840
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:15,870
another person.
Um,

1841
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,600
and I think there's a lot of people who
gravitate towards those,

1842
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:21,840
not necessarily even,
it seems counterintuitive,

1843
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:25,740
but you would think that they would be
the most violent people or the most

1844
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:29,160
angry people and they're doing that
because they want to dominate.

1845
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,740
Well,
mixed martial arts is different in a lot

1846
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:32,670
of ways,
first of all,

1847
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:36,570
because in boxing,
a lot of times you're seeing people that

1848
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:40,410
are searching for a way out there
searching for a way out of poverty.

1849
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:44,490
They're searching for a way out of bad
neighborhoods and crime and they do so

1850
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:45,780
through fighting.
It's a classic,

1851
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,980
it's a classic trope,
but I think there's something going on

1852
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,390
with MMA fighters.

1853
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:56,390
It's very different in that martial arts
seem to be something that costs money

1854
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:01,740
and so to join these classes and get
proficient,

1855
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:06,770
you have to be able to afford them.
And so you're getting people that enter

1856
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:09,060
into martial arts from two different
venues,

1857
01:30:09,061 --> 01:30:13,020
right?
You get wrestlers who classically get it

1858
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:14,930
from school that you get it from high
school.

1859
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,050
Rico,
Roman wrestlers,

1860
01:30:16,051 --> 01:30:18,460
you mean freestyle or Greco Roman,
you know,

1861
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,040
depending on.
It doesn't matter.

1862
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:22,440
There's,
there's successful examples of both.

1863
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,250
And wrestling is probably one of the
most important skills to have,

1864
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:29,460
if not the most important in mma because
the fighter can dictate where the fight

1865
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:31,650
takes place.
If a really strong wrestler takes you

1866
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:34,620
down,
he can control you were as if you're a

1867
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:36,930
really good kick boxer.
Your kickboxing can't really be

1868
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,490
effective.
Someone can take you down at will.

1869
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,920
So there's,
there's that,

1870
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:44,500
there's the wrestling which they get in
college and they get in high school in

1871
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:45,343
which is,
you know,

1872
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:49,110
at least fairly free college if they
have a scholarship and get it for free.

1873
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:51,300
Um,
but martial arts,

1874
01:30:51,301 --> 01:30:54,600
like Jujitsu and kickboxing and things
along those lines,

1875
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:56,070
taekwondo,
karate,

1876
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,320
traditional martial arts,
it costs money to take those things.

1877
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:00,360
Right?
So you're seeing a lot of very educated

1878
01:31:00,361 --> 01:31:03,660
people that are getting into mma.
There's a lot of MMA fighters that are

1879
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:06,090
extremely articulate.
Isn't there a guy who was a biology

1880
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:08,070
teacher,
math teacher,

1881
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:11,010
rich Franklin math teacher who was a
former champion.

1882
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,270
Yeah,
he was UFC champion,

1883
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:14,370
very smart guy,
very smart guy.

1884
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:17,820
And there's a lot of other very,
very intelligent guys speak multiple

1885
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:18,870
languages,
you know,

1886
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:21,170
really brilliant people.
Um,

1887
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,570
so you get a different style of fighter,
you know,

1888
01:31:27,121 --> 01:31:30,630
I think there's people out there that
are fighting because they were abused as

1889
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:33,180
a child.
They were bullied and then they have

1890
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:35,100
this anger inside of them and they want
to express it.

1891
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:38,250
So you get a lot of that,
but you also get people that just,

1892
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:40,020
you know,
they're just tough.

1893
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:43,310
It's just tough and they want to
overcome challenges and they,

1894
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:48,030
they get some sort of benefit out of
these extreme challenges.

1895
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:50,490
So I would,
I would wonder,

1896
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,620
I would wonder what the results of that
would be.

1897
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,570
What about this,
this,

1898
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:55,650
I think this is probably an obvious
hypothesis,

1899
01:31:55,651 --> 01:31:59,860
but do you think that if we,
if one were to a

1900
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,250
salivary assays to measure testosterone
levels,

1901
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:08,650
pre-fight post fight and post fight,
you're looking at the winner and the

1902
01:32:08,651 --> 01:32:12,640
loser,
clearly the testosterone scores would

1903
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:17,290
assort along whether I won or lost exam
will also dependent upon how much brain

1904
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:22,240
damage they acquire during the fight.
That has a pretty significant effect on

1905
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:25,390
your pituitary gland.
Primarily I had,

1906
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:26,224
by the way,
uh,

1907
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,720
since you're a standup professional
stand up comedian,

1908
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:32,590
one of my former students of postdoc who
had,

1909
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,640
I think I'm going to mention,
he,

1910
01:32:33,650 --> 01:32:36,280
he,
he studied the evolutionary roots of

1911
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:38,320
humor.
And so one of the things that we wanted

1912
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:39,970
to study when he was doing his post doc
with me,

1913
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,480
but then he ended up leaving after a
year to take a position anyways,

1914
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:47,550
uh,
was to use the Montreal just for laughs

1915
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:52,210
festivals to study that.
The Stasi responses of Comedians,

1916
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:53,523
uh,
you know,

1917
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:58,030
prior to getting on stage.
And then after finishing and to see

1918
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:03,031
whether their testosterone response
would be moderated by whether

1919
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:06,790
objectively speaking it was a successful
set or not.

1920
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,320
Right.
I mean sometimes you get up and you just

1921
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:10,560
killed the house.
Other Times it's.

1922
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:14,620
It's dead silence.
So will my endocrinological system

1923
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:19,870
response track that reality.
And so that's something that I still

1924
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:22,330
hopefully we'll test with some future
students.

1925
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,730
What do you think?
You think that's a viable?

1926
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,280
Definitely.
I think with bombing especially,

1927
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,490
it comes down.
Yeah,

1928
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:32,030
definitely.
It's a horrible feeling.

1929
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:36,080
I can't imagine there would be any
benefit to bombing.

1930
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,600
Right?
Other than maybe your testosterone would

1931
01:33:38,601 --> 01:33:40,790
spike because you need the energy to run
away from them.

1932
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,210
Do you?
Let's say when you,

1933
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:49,040
when you're like you are doing a show
and you feel as though it's not going

1934
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:53,180
well.
Are you ever able to redirect the ship

1935
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:56,600
or do you.
Or is there a point where there's no

1936
01:33:56,601 --> 01:33:58,850
return?
I'm going to suck today.

1937
01:33:58,851 --> 01:34:00,500
It's just not working.
I'm not connecting.

1938
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,940
There's both.
There's,

1939
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,510
there's definitely times where you're
not getting out of the hole.

1940
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:06,280
You know,
you can dig yourself into a hole that

1941
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:07,990
you can't get out of it.
What determines that?

1942
01:34:07,991 --> 01:34:11,860
Is it that your delivery that day is not
working or is it there's something

1943
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:14,200
endemic to the crowd that for whatever
reason,

1944
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:18,370
they're just not digging your style.
It's all the above.

1945
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:20,710
There's a.
It could be your delivery,

1946
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:23,020
it could be your subject matter.
It could be an event,

1947
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:24,850
something that went on with the
audience.

1948
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:30,400
It could be the way you are reacting to
them that you chose a path that was

1949
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:34,030
ineffective.
It could be making fun of them,

1950
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:37,180
but that got them to get more on you.
It could certainly be that.

1951
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:41,380
It could cause a lot of variables
involved in whether or not you go down

1952
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:44,290
with the ship,
but also it could be that you didn't

1953
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:45,124
address it.

1954
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:47,470
You know,
sometimes things are going bad and a guy

1955
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:49,380
will address that.
It's going bad and they pulled

1956
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:51,460
themselves out of it and then it becomes
great again.

1957
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,290
I've seen that.
I've done that.

1958
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,160
I've had like bad moments.
We address that bad moment and things

1959
01:34:57,161 --> 01:34:59,930
snap back or you,
you know,

1960
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:03,110
you just,
you reassess your approach.

1961
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:06,110
It does a lot of variables involved in
standup comedy,

1962
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:10,250
but ultimately what's going on.
I've tried to explain this and I've gone

1963
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:12,620
over this with many,
many comedian friends of mine and we all

1964
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:15,350
seem to agree on this.
So there's a moment when things are

1965
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:18,470
going really well with the audience is
laughing and you're in the zone and

1966
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,230
you're delivering your jokes that you
prepared for a long time.

1967
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,660
Everything's done right.
And it's a lot of great timing and

1968
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:24,660
everything.
It's a,

1969
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:28,310
it's a mass hypnosis.
It's like when I watch a really funny

1970
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:33,311
comedian firewatch a bill burr for say,
um,

1971
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,810
when,
when he's on stage and he's killing and

1972
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:37,820
I'm watching and I'm laughing my ass
off,

1973
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:40,310
what I am doing is allowing him to think
for me.

1974
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:43,370
Right?
So I'm allowing him to,

1975
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,560
you know,
if he's talking about having a female

1976
01:35:45,561 --> 01:35:48,860
president or something like that,
he's going through his thought process

1977
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:50,730
of what it would be like Bubba,
Bubba,

1978
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:52,250
Bubba,
and as he's going through it,

1979
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,460
I am.
I'm not really doing any calculations,

1980
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,650
I'm allowing him to do all those
calculations.

1981
01:35:57,830 --> 01:36:02,680
I'm allowing him to take up all of my
thought process with his sentences and

1982
01:36:02,681 --> 01:36:03,200
the the,
the,

1983
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,430
the images that he's depicting and
that's what makes it really funny and

1984
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:09,320
the whole audience,
we're all in it together,

1985
01:36:09,321 --> 01:36:12,470
so there's this community effect of this
group hypnosis,

1986
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:17,000
so we're all laughing because we're all
on the same page and we're all like

1987
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:20,690
these thoughts that he's saying are so
funny and we're all going along with it,

1988
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,650
but when someone's bad or when the joke
doesn't work,

1989
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,550
then everybody's like,
Oh,

1990
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:27,170
Christ,
oh no,

1991
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:28,040
this isn't working.

1992
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,900
Oh No.
And you'll look around and see everybody

1993
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:32,870
else's uncomfortable and then you see
he's uncomfortable and I'm like,

1994
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:33,900
oh Jesus,
he's,

1995
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:35,210
he's,
he's bombing right now.

1996
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:39,110
And when someone's bombing,
then you're forced to completely out of

1997
01:36:39,111 --> 01:36:41,540
the spell and now you have to do all
these calculations.

1998
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:43,210
You have to think,
you have to do all this,

1999
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:45,890
all this consideration,
considerations going on.

2000
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:49,850
There's a lot happening that wouldn't be
happening if a guy was just killing,

2001
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:52,160
but someone's killing.
It's effortless to watch.

2002
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:55,550
Just laughing it off and then you leave.
You feel great.

2003
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,120
So it's when it goes bad,
it's uncomfortable for everybody.

2004
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:02,720
It's uncomfortable for the audience.
It's uncomfortable for the comedian.

2005
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:07,750
It's just because you're forced to
consider his process,

2006
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:13,280
his failures or her failures and her bad
jokes or all those things.

2007
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:17,060
Do you think there are certain elements
of humor?

2008
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:21,890
I mean clearly they are culture specific
manifestations of you are maybe physical

2009
01:37:21,891 --> 01:37:24,140
comedy is more appreciated and culture,
Asian culture be,

2010
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:29,470
but are there specific umer mechanisms
that are not mechanism but you know,

2011
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:34,940
whatever bueller content that would be
universally successful?

2012
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:35,900
No.
Oh,

2013
01:37:35,901 --> 01:37:38,030
so you think it's always culture
dependent,

2014
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:41,930
culture dependent,
culture dependent,

2015
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:44,720
taste dependent.
There's certain styles of humor that

2016
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:47,420
some people really enjoy and other
people hate.

2017
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:50,390
You know,
some people like all tumor,

2018
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:54,390
which is like keep the mic in the stand,
don't move dead.

2019
01:37:54,391 --> 01:37:58,140
Pan Delivery,
put very little effort forth.

2020
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,570
Some people like that.
That's what they prefer.

2021
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:04,710
The balding guy with the curly hair,
balding guy with the curly found like 20

2022
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:06,600
years ago.
He speaks with a very low steven,

2023
01:38:06,601 --> 01:38:07,434
right?
Yeah.

2024
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,840
Well he's an absurdist.
What does that all absurd?

2025
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:13,260
Yeah,
he's like a used to work at a fire

2026
01:38:13,261 --> 01:38:18,150
hydrant factory.
Couldn't park anywhere near the place.

2027
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,073
You know,
it's like,

2028
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:20,510
that's,
that's the thing,

2029
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:20,980
right,
you know,

2030
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,320
is that kind of comedy.
It's like,

2031
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:25,770
it's all like really bizarre and I
observed one liners.

2032
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,790
Um,
so that's not all that's just really

2033
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:33,900
funny and original and all it is a lot
of times really bad,

2034
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,760
you know,
unfortunately.

2035
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,500
And it really,
super supportive crowds that gather

2036
01:38:38,501 --> 01:38:41,520
together,
it's almost like they got kicked out of

2037
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:46,020
the cool playground so they made their
own playground and there's a comedy

2038
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,650
festival that's going on right now are
supposed to be going on some somewhere

2039
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:52,910
in New York where somebody sent me this
thing and I looked at it for a couple of

2040
01:38:52,911 --> 01:38:54,060
seconds.
I have throw it away.

2041
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,680
I just like,
I can't,

2042
01:38:55,740 --> 01:39:00,740
I can't even get into this where they're
charging different amounts for different

2043
01:39:01,681 --> 01:39:05,470
access to people who are white males.
They,

2044
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,570
they want to have as few white males as
possible,

2045
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:11,580
so they want to make it as diverse as
possible.

2046
01:39:11,581 --> 01:39:14,490
So they're opening it up to people of
color,

2047
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:17,650
Lbgtq x,
Y,

2048
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,470
Z,
and,

2049
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,980
and this is like,
this is their solution.

2050
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:26,850
Their solution is to not just have the
funniest people that they think are

2051
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:28,770
there regardless of race,
color,

2052
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:29,670
creed,
ethnicity.

2053
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,750
Nope.
Nope.

2054
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:35,160
Exclude the white man and token white
bearded men is one of the things that

2055
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:36,540
they discussed.
And by the way,

2056
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:38,010
the people that run the group were all
women.

2057
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:39,690
So hilarious.
I mean,

2058
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,960
if you want to run a festival,
you should be able to do whatever the

2059
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:46,530
fuck you want,
but the idea that you want to run an art

2060
01:39:46,531 --> 01:39:49,620
festival,
but you want to exclude certain people

2061
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:53,130
like pick the best ones.
How about pick the best ones,

2062
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,440
the best ones.
Turn out to be white men with beards.

2063
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,770
Go with that information and try to
figure out why that's the case.

2064
01:39:58,771 --> 01:40:02,040
So from that perspective,
are we to assume that I now know what

2065
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:04,650
your position is on affirmative action?
Well,

2066
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:07,650
my position on affirmative action is,
um,

2067
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:12,420
I think it has good intentions.
I think the idea is to try to stop

2068
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:13,200
racism.

2069
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,960
However,
if you're getting someone in there,

2070
01:40:15,961 --> 01:40:19,110
they become a firefighter,
but they're less physically fit and less

2071
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:21,720
intelligent than someone who could have
gotten the job,

2072
01:40:21,721 --> 01:40:24,870
but unfortunately the,
the other guy was from Croatian descent,

2073
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:26,580
you know,
and you know,

2074
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:29,250
he looks like a white man who is
privileged,

2075
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:31,410
you know,
but meanwhile this guy came from a

2076
01:40:31,411 --> 01:40:36,240
family of very poor immigrants who
struggled and scratched and scraped and,

2077
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:37,530
you know,
people could look at him as the

2078
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,610
oppressor,
which is fucking preposterous.

2079
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,490
You know,
there's a lot of that going on.

2080
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:42,241
Yeah.
And,

2081
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:43,620
um,
I think that's ridiculous.

2082
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,880
So I think that.
I agree with that.

2083
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:49,260
Yeah.
I think this idea of people who are all

2084
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:52,800
have a certain amount of melanin in
their skin that they should get a job

2085
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,970
versus people who don't have melanin in
their skin.

2086
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:56,330
That's stupid,
right?

2087
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,470
I think we should address the core
problem,

2088
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:04,360
which is why,
why is it harder for people who grow up

2089
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:08,230
in African American communities or
Mexican American communities?

2090
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:11,020
Why is it harder for them to get a
better education?

2091
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,220
Why is it harder for them to succeed?
Why is it hard for them to resist crime?

2092
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:18,550
Why are they in involved in these
impoverished areas?

2093
01:41:18,551 --> 01:41:19,930
And how do we fix that?
So,

2094
01:41:19,931 --> 01:41:21,310
you know what Larry,
and we bounced that,

2095
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:25,230
you know who larry elder's to sage,
have you ever had them on the show?

2096
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,060
But I will.
He's,

2097
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,760
he and I had been going back and forth
through twitter.

2098
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,260
Uh,
of course,

2099
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:31,750
you know what his answer would be.
So he's an African American.

2100
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:33,040
He's also,
let's say,

2101
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,900
what is the reason for all of the things
that you said,

2102
01:41:34,901 --> 01:41:39,270
why this,
why that father absence he at now,

2103
01:41:39,271 --> 01:41:42,850
I don't know whether he is a overusing
that,

2104
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,610
uh,
that causal factor,

2105
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:50,350
but he certainly seems to be quoting a
lot of data that suggests that many of

2106
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:55,351
these sort of delirious downstream
effects are due to nothing more than

2107
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:56,290
father absence.

2108
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:59,290
Solve that problem and many of these
issues would go away.

2109
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:01,180
Well,
I think that's a little simplistic

2110
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:04,180
because your dad's a fucking piece of
shit and lives in your house,

2111
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,430
you've got a real problem,
right?

2112
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:07,060
You know,
I don't think that's necessarily the

2113
01:42:07,061 --> 01:42:08,420
only way to do it.
Um,

2114
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:12,640
and I think you can't just blame,
I think one of the things that we were

2115
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:16,420
talking about earlier that I think is
really important is that cultures become

2116
01:42:16,421 --> 01:42:21,421
patterns and patterns repeat and these
patterns that these people are born

2117
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:23,530
into,
it's not their choice.

2118
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:27,640
And we recognize it as someone who
wasn't born in that pattern.

2119
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:30,190
You look at a bad pattern of someone
being born say,

2120
01:42:30,191 --> 01:42:33,520
like in Baltimore and extremely
impoverished community is filled with

2121
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:36,370
crime and gang violence and you go,
God,

2122
01:42:36,371 --> 01:42:38,830
how do we,
how does this get corrected?

2123
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,980
How do we.
I had Michael Wood on who's an

2124
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:44,800
interesting guy who was a former cop in
Baltimore and really,

2125
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:48,790
really interesting dude and I think he's
trying to run for like he's trying to be

2126
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:49,670
a police commissioner.

2127
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:50,520
CHICAGO,
right?

2128
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:54,520
I applied for it and you know,
I think he would be a great person for

2129
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:56,230
that job.
Um,

2130
01:42:56,410 --> 01:43:00,400
he's got a lot of information and a lot
of really,

2131
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:01,550
he's very smart,
right?

2132
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:04,900
Law Common Sense when it comes to this.
But one of the things that Michael Wood

2133
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:09,010
was talking about when he was on the
podcast was that they had found a,

2134
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:12,550
I guess a directive from the 19
seventies when they were going through

2135
01:43:12,551 --> 01:43:14,980
the archives and all the shit that they
have in Baltimore.

2136
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:20,790
The police director from the 19
seventies was exactly the same as what

2137
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:24,970
he was dealing with in the two thousands
as far as the neighborhoods that had

2138
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:27,220
drugs and neighborhoods where crime.
He's like,

2139
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:30,490
it's the same pattern,
repeating the same patterns over and

2140
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:33,730
over and over again,
and no one has done anything to try to

2141
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:38,170
socially engineer some beneficial change
in these communities.

2142
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:40,840
Instead they just continue to lock up
the same people.

2143
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:44,590
And I agree with him that that is
essentially at that point it becomes

2144
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:46,360
institutionalized racism.
Right?

2145
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,930
And that's a real issue.
And I think that that's the issue that

2146
01:43:49,931 --> 01:43:52,070
needs to be addressed.
And I don't think

2147
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:57,020
that affirmative action is the best way
to do it because I think that also it,

2148
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:02,380
it starts to produce this feeling of
resentment from people that are more

2149
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:06,020
qualified,
that don't get the jobs well.

2150
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:08,210
And I would think,
let's say for the,

2151
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:13,190
for the black applicant who,
let's say goes to law school,

2152
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,110
uh,
they,

2153
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:20,380
they will never know whether they went
through the whole process simply on

2154
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:23,420
their merit or whether they were helped
in some way.

2155
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:27,290
And I think that itself won't know.
They'll be if they graduate.

2156
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:27,610
No,
no,

2157
01:44:27,610 --> 01:44:27,771
no,
no.

2158
01:44:27,771 --> 01:44:30,290
What I mean is when you got it,
did you,

2159
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,830
did you get in strictly on the merits of
your Dosha?

2160
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,710
Let's suppose I actually don't want a,
I'm a,

2161
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:41,800
I'm a person of color and I don't want
anything to be effecting the decision

2162
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:45,470
other than purely the merits of my dose
here.

2163
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:49,040
So now I go through the process at the
end of that process,

2164
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:53,840
I won't absolutely know for sure whether
it was strictly based on what I wanted,

2165
01:44:53,841 --> 01:44:55,010
which is the murder of my,
those here,

2166
01:44:55,011 --> 01:44:56,490
whether there was some,
uh,

2167
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:59,840
something that helped me along the way
because of this institutionalized

2168
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:02,930
affirmative action.
So there's not a bit problematic.

2169
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:05,480
I guess it could be,
but I would assume that by the time

2170
01:45:05,481 --> 01:45:07,520
you've gone through university,
you know,

2171
01:45:07,521 --> 01:45:09,470
you're,
you're now you're talking about a much

2172
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:13,100
higher level of education and it should
be pretty.

2173
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:16,430
I hate to use the term black and white,
but it should be right there.

2174
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:18,670
I mean,
you should see their grades and you see,

2175
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:23,570
so are our professors are hired as a
function of these things.

2176
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:27,320
What I once applied for real say this
here publicly,

2177
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:29,570
I once applied,
so this is,

2178
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:32,720
I was coming out on the market finishing
my phd,

2179
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,340
uh,
on the market like a cow or since the

2180
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:37,183
academic market.

2181
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,550
And the academic market works is you,
you,

2182
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:43,730
you interview round one and then route
in one place.

2183
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:46,760
All the schools come there.
And then in round two they invite you

2184
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:48,800
for a campus visit.
And so I had been,

2185
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:52,460
I was interviewing at one of the most
prestigious places that you could ever

2186
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,430
hope to imagine.
It's actually from your neck of the

2187
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:58,040
woods in Boston,
Harvard,

2188
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,280
right?
Uh,

2189
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,300
maybe I shouldn't have said that and I
don't think you said that.

2190
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:04,550
I did.
They have right salt kittings I'm not

2191
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:08,000
admitting whether that's true or not,
but apparently I was one of the

2192
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:13,001
finalists and at least I had heard from
some people who are maybe on the inside,

2193
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:16,100
uh,
that they were really looking for a

2194
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:20,660
woman and that to the extent that I
might not be able to articulate a might

2195
01:46:20,661 --> 01:46:23,000
be a problem.
So I don't know if that ended up being

2196
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:24,320
the main reason why I think that the
job,

2197
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,570
but I've often heard that,
uh,

2198
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,760
you know,
you are not have the right race.

2199
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:31,670
We need more diversity,
we need more gender diversity,

2200
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:35,180
we need more racial diversity and make
it fair.

2201
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,350
And even though,
I mean,

2202
01:46:36,351 --> 01:46:37,610
how has that ever achieved?
Well,

2203
01:46:37,611 --> 01:46:38,300
frankly,
it's good.

2204
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,040
I think it's grotesque.
Look,

2205
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,690
there was a,
I don't know if you saw,

2206
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:46,430
I had a sad truth clip where I,
I titled it the All Time Greatest social

2207
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:49,830
justice warriors.
It was based on a group of Dartmouth

2208
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:53,790
students that had occupied,
I think the president's office with a

2209
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:54,890
set of.
Have you seen,

2210
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,670
have you seen this?
It's about the freedom project.

2211
01:46:56,671 --> 01:47:00,270
Maybe you can put it up.
So the Dartmouth freedom project where

2212
01:47:00,271 --> 01:47:02,460
they,
they had sort of like a manifesto,

2213
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:07,760
here are the things that we absolutely
expect dartmouth to implement.

2214
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,840
If you saw that list and I go through
some of that on my youtube channel,

2215
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,480
it's simply baffling.
You know,

2216
01:47:15,481 --> 01:47:20,130
we have to have a,
a professor of Color Speaker series.

2217
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:21,390
I mean think about that,
right?

2218
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:22,140
I mean,
so if,

2219
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:22,920
if,
if I'm,

2220
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:25,020
if I'm a number theorist,
I'm a mathematician,

2221
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:30,410
does the amount of melanin that I have
determined how I study the distribution

2222
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:34,440
of prime numbers.
The idea that you would have students

2223
01:47:34,441 --> 01:47:39,240
demanding that there be a person of
color speaker series.

2224
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:41,580
I mean it's grotesque,
right?

2225
01:47:41,581 --> 01:47:43,620
I mean we,
nobody's denying the fact that racism

2226
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:46,680
has existed and to some extent continues
to exist,

2227
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:51,870
but to have these types of demands to me
seems problematic.

2228
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:53,000
Well,
I,

2229
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,710
I definitely don't think it's the most
intellectual approach to the issue at

2230
01:47:57,711 --> 01:47:59,840
hand,
which is combating racism,

2231
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:01,340
right?
I don't think it's making.

2232
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:05,780
Instead of having an even playing field
for all and considering all with equal

2233
01:48:05,781 --> 01:48:10,130
merit to change the level of the playing
field and boost people up that aren't

2234
01:48:10,131 --> 01:48:11,080
qualified.
Right.

2235
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,820
I think that's where you're talking also
about the end result.

2236
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:16,970
You're talking about the finished
product of an education,

2237
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:19,340
you know,
I mean literally at the highest level of

2238
01:48:19,341 --> 01:48:22,250
professor,
so I think that if you're looking at

2239
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:24,350
that,
it really,

2240
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:29,410
it all comes down to what is it that's
making certain people have less

2241
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:35,771
opportunity and that needs to be
engineered from a societal level and

2242
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:38,370
from a cultural level,
and it's.

2243
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,820
I've said this many,
many times at the,

2244
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:44,750
the biggest issue with any culture is
the weakest link,

2245
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:45,370
right?

2246
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:48,140
But what's the best way to have a more
successful country?

2247
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:51,410
What's the best way to have a more
successful union will less losers?

2248
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:53,360
Well,
how do you have less losers here?

2249
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:56,450
We give more people education,
more people chances,

2250
01:48:56,451 --> 01:49:01,310
and more people who are disenfranchised
and we're stuck in these bad situations.

2251
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:04,940
Give them an opportunity to get out some
way or another.

2252
01:49:04,941 --> 01:49:07,400
Whether it's through continued
education,

2253
01:49:07,401 --> 01:49:10,460
whether it's through community centers,
whether it's through combat,

2254
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:13,280
I mean what will Larry elders talking
about better not having fathers?

2255
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,350
Boy,
well we can't just say fuck them,

2256
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:17,440
they should have a dad.
The Dad should get involved that,

2257
01:49:17,441 --> 01:49:19,370
that you're not going to fix people like
that.

2258
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:23,480
The children are the ones that there are
still malleable and still have

2259
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:26,060
potential.
So we have to figure out a way to

2260
01:49:26,061 --> 01:49:28,590
provide them with some sort of
resources.

2261
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:33,440
I'm sort of some sort of
some sort of mentorship,

2262
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:34,400
you know,
some,

2263
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,920
some hope.
You know what I mean?

2264
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:38,770
Let me,
let me just read through this carefully

2265
01:49:38,771 --> 01:49:43,060
because it's a thorny topic.
Earlier we spoke about the,

2266
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:47,980
the culture of achievement that

2267
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,310
we find that is that make within Jewish
homes.

2268
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:53,380
Yes.
By the same token,

2269
01:49:53,381 --> 01:49:57,730
do you think that other cultures might
be creating environments that are

2270
01:49:57,850 --> 01:50:00,310
exactly the opposite of that?
In other words,

2271
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:02,400
yes,
there might be some endemic

2272
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:04,930
institutional reasons why people don't
succeed,

2273
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:09,220
but there are also individual
responsibility or collective

2274
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:11,200
responsibility within the family or the
culture.

2275
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:15,440
I think just eluding to that.
We'll let.

2276
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:20,200
We'll will cause people to level an
accusation of racism against you,

2277
01:50:20,201 --> 01:50:20,501
right?
I mean,

2278
01:50:20,501 --> 01:50:22,570
think about Bill Cosby,
Bill Cosby,

2279
01:50:22,571 --> 01:50:25,450
I know he's not popular now,
but at one point he was walking around

2280
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,410
and saying exactly that,
right?

2281
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:27,930
That,
that,

2282
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:32,930
that blacks have to take responsibility
for some of their failures and he was

2283
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,950
that that message was not very well
received.

2284
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:36,451
Well,
he,

2285
01:50:36,451 --> 01:50:39,060
you know,
he's saying it from an easy place saying

2286
01:50:39,090 --> 01:50:41,180
it from someone who's very successful,
right?

2287
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:44,530
I think.
I think people imitate their atmosphere.

2288
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:49,420
I think culture's exists because it's
easy to pattern yourself around what's

2289
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:54,020
around you and that's.
That exists in a religious sense and it

2290
01:50:54,021 --> 01:50:56,200
exists in a behavioral sense.
You,

2291
01:50:56,201 --> 01:50:59,440
you become a lot like the people that
you surround yourself with.

2292
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:02,140
That's why it's so important to surround
yourself with positive people.

2293
01:51:02,141 --> 01:51:04,780
It's one of the most important lessons
you could ever learn as a human being.

2294
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:07,420
The more positive people you surround
yourself with,

2295
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:12,421
the more you'll aspire to be like them.
The more you you have a high standard

2296
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,330
that exists all around you.
Well,

2297
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:19,320
if you're fucked and you grow up in a
place without,

2298
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:22,210
with no hope and a lot of despair.
I mean,

2299
01:51:22,211 --> 01:51:27,211
I remember when I first moved to New
York when I was in my early twenties and

2300
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:29,440
uh,
I didn't really have that many friends

2301
01:51:29,441 --> 01:51:32,270
at first and it was,
and I had a few friends that I just,

2302
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:36,820
I was really disappointed with them and
one of them because he just would say so

2303
01:51:36,821 --> 01:51:40,840
much racist shit,
it would drive me crazy and I just,

2304
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:43,770
I wasn't,
I was almost like God damn it.

2305
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:46,390
Like I can't find friends like I had in
Boston,

2306
01:51:46,710 --> 01:51:47,231
you know,
I was,

2307
01:51:47,231 --> 01:51:49,300
I was,
I had a bunch of knuckleheads that I

2308
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,820
wish that I knew and I needed to
establish,

2309
01:51:51,821 --> 01:51:53,170
you know,
it takes a while when,

2310
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,550
especially when you're young and by the
way,

2311
01:51:54,551 --> 01:51:59,551
no Internet back then.
So you're trying to find good friends

2312
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:03,820
and friends that were like in my
profession as standup comics.

2313
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,620
So I had to like,
you know,

2314
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:08,470
get closer to a few people that are in
these communities.

2315
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:11,140
And it took a long time.
But I remember feeling really depressed

2316
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:16,240
when I first moved there and it was,
it was a cause for me to reconsider

2317
01:52:16,241 --> 01:52:18,280
moving back to Boston.
There was one point in time,

2318
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:23,440
even though I had just signed with this
new manager that's still my manager to

2319
01:52:23,441 --> 01:52:26,230
this day and there's all this hope and
promise that like,

2320
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:28,120
wow,
I'm actually going to have a career now.

2321
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:31,870
I was so bummed out by the people that I
was around with that I would go back to

2322
01:52:31,871 --> 01:52:33,730
Boston and do gigs and I'd be like,
fuck,

2323
01:52:33,731 --> 01:52:38,560
I want to move back here man.
Because I was like Boston for all of its

2324
01:52:38,561 --> 01:52:42,190
faults and you know,
is a very smart place.

2325
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:43,450
And as,
as New York.

2326
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:47,210
But I had just,
I had infiltrated into a really great

2327
01:52:47,211 --> 01:52:50,030
community in Boston and I hadn't done
that yet in New York.

2328
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,530
So there's a very small,
you know,

2329
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:54,410
obviously a couple of years later I was
fine.

2330
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:58,400
But it was when you're not around
positive people,

2331
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:00,890
it doesn't feel good.
I was living in North New Jersey when I

2332
01:53:00,891 --> 01:53:04,730
first moved there because that's where
my grandfather lived and I didn't have

2333
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:06,830
any money,
so I stayed with him for awhile and he

2334
01:53:06,831 --> 01:53:10,940
was in a terrible neighborhood and he
had bought a house there a long time ago

2335
01:53:10,941 --> 01:53:14,360
and the community had changed several
times and gotten worse and worse and the

2336
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:18,290
kid next door before I had moved in,
I think somewhere around the time that I

2337
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:21,130
was living there,
his door got broken down by the cops and

2338
01:53:21,131 --> 01:53:23,570
they was selling crack and it was,
it was,

2339
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:24,543
it was real bad.

2340
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,010
Right.
You know,

2341
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:30,010
so I've felt depressed living there and
the environment that I've found myself

2342
01:53:30,201 --> 01:53:32,870
in my,
my grandmother had had a stroke so she

2343
01:53:32,871 --> 01:53:36,030
would moan.
And the grandmother who's a Mafia.

2344
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,110
I runner,
yeah.

2345
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:39,950
Yeah.
That was earlier in her life when she

2346
01:53:39,951 --> 01:53:41,610
was mobile,
but she had a,

2347
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,690
she had a stroke and she,
she gave her 70,

2348
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:49,790
like 72 hours to live.
She lived for 12 years and they were

2349
01:53:49,791 --> 01:53:51,140
like,
she's probably going to die.

2350
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:52,730
Like she.
She had a really bad stroke,

2351
01:53:52,731 --> 01:53:56,600
but somehow she hung on by a thread for
a long time and you know,

2352
01:53:56,601 --> 01:54:00,260
my grandfather used to have to change
your sheets and she had bed sores

2353
01:54:00,261 --> 01:54:02,780
because she would just lay in one place.
She couldn't really move.

2354
01:54:02,781 --> 01:54:04,130
It was awful.
It was awful.

2355
01:54:04,131 --> 01:54:07,610
So that environment of being in this
really poor neighborhood,

2356
01:54:07,611 --> 01:54:10,760
being poor myself,
I had no fucking money being around bad,

2357
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:12,500
like didn't have good friends.

2358
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,690
It's depressing.
It's depressing now.

2359
01:54:14,691 --> 01:54:17,750
Obviously I had opportunity,
I had a career.

2360
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:20,360
There's a way to get out of that,
but I got a taste.

2361
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,430
I think even though the tiniest,
tiniest,

2362
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:26,990
tiniest taste of despair,
what it's like to be stuck in a shit

2363
01:54:26,991 --> 01:54:30,500
situation now,
imagine being born in that situation

2364
01:54:30,501 --> 01:54:31,161
because I,
you know,

2365
01:54:31,161 --> 01:54:33,980
I moved there when I was in my twenties.
I was like 23 or something like that.

2366
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:38,180
Imagine if I was there my whole life and
I just been around fucked up.

2367
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:41,990
People had been sexually abused or
physically abused or you know,

2368
01:54:41,991 --> 01:54:45,920
my mother was selling crack or you know,
my brother was in jail or who knows,

2369
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,930
he.
There's a lot of variables that can lead

2370
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:52,931
to a terrible state of mind and it's
insanely hard to overcome the patterns

2371
01:54:53,571 --> 01:54:58,160
of the past and the patterns of your
environment and until we address that,

2372
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:00,560
this idea of pulling yourself up by your
bootstraps,

2373
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:01,910
it's fucking ridiculous.

2374
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:03,140
The idea of,
well,

2375
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:05,570
the cops wouldn't be shooting these
young black kids if they just didn't

2376
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:07,340
commit crimes.
That's crazy.

2377
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:10,940
That's crazy because it's not even.
It's not an even playing field.

2378
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:15,360
It's not even for me,
comparing myself of 23 to myself,

2379
01:55:15,361 --> 01:55:17,540
a 48,
it's not that I have way more

2380
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:19,280
opportunity now.
It's way easier.

2381
01:55:19,281 --> 01:55:20,630
Life.
It's way easier and way,

2382
01:55:20,631 --> 01:55:22,230
way,
way better friends way.

2383
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:24,650
I've established a nice community with
my friends.

2384
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:29,090
Do you still a form of a lot of new
friendships or do you have.

2385
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,330
Yeah,
yeah.

2386
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:31,310
I have new friendships.
Yeah,

2387
01:55:31,311 --> 01:55:32,790
I definitely sent you.
Well,

2388
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:35,600
thank you.
I'm honored to be amongst that group

2389
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:39,380
because of doing this podcast.
It's allowed me to communicate with some

2390
01:55:39,381 --> 01:55:42,350
really fascinating people and that
that's definitely allowed me to

2391
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:47,351
formulate some new and it's allowed me
to evolve my perspective to examine my

2392
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:50,220
own ideas and to,
you know,

2393
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:53,370
I think all of us that,
that I'm friends with,

2394
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:57,870
we've all experienced that sort of same
similar growth pattern because,

2395
01:55:57,871 --> 01:55:59,760
you know,
as you take in more information,

2396
01:55:59,761 --> 01:56:01,470
you communicate with each other about
things,

2397
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:03,000
you kind of evolve ideas.
And

2398
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:07,670
so there was a study done I think a
longitudinal study and I believe I

2399
01:56:07,671 --> 01:56:09,600
mentioned it in the book,
uh,

2400
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:11,860
at Harvard,
I think the,

2401
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:13,490
the,
the lead investigator,

2402
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:17,360
I think his name is George French would
say I guess viola or Vegan,

2403
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:21,770
I think that's his name.
And out of 75 years of research in terms

2404
01:56:21,771 --> 01:56:25,070
of what is sort of the number one
predictor that makes people happy or

2405
01:56:25,071 --> 01:56:26,630
content.
I can't remember the exact dependent

2406
01:56:26,631 --> 01:56:30,230
measure.
The number one thing was establishing

2407
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:35,500
meaningful connections with others.
I mean 75 years of research out of a

2408
01:56:36,591 --> 01:56:40,040
million possible causal factors were
distilled to that.

2409
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:40,874
One fact.

2410
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:42,300
I would agree with that.
Exactly.

2411
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:43,590
I would agree with that.
The mother's status.

2412
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,190
People I know are lonely.
Exactly.

2413
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:46,740
Your saddest people I know,
you know,

2414
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:47,600
I know.
Um,

2415
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:51,610
I know a few comedians don't have
comedian friends too,

2416
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,860
which is really weird.
They're sort of ostracized by the

2417
01:56:53,861 --> 01:56:57,940
community in some weird way and those
people are really sad,

2418
01:56:58,390 --> 01:57:00,130
really sad or really lonely and really

2419
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:00,921
weird.
Well,

2420
01:57:00,921 --> 01:57:02,660
I mean,
I don't know if we've ever mentioned

2421
01:57:02,661 --> 01:57:05,170
this and this on this podcast,
but uh,

2422
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:09,980
if you take prisoners,
many of them will prefer to be in

2423
01:57:09,981 --> 01:57:14,240
general population where they might be
jumped and stabbed then raped than to be

2424
01:57:14,241 --> 01:57:17,420
put in solitary.
Precisely because solitary confinement

2425
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:20,870
is the ultimate of punishments to a
social species,

2426
01:57:20,871 --> 01:57:21,160
right?

2427
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,650
Yeah.
We need each other and these,

2428
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:28,770
these biological requirements that we
don't consider because we meet them on a

2429
01:57:28,991 --> 01:57:30,610
daily basis,
you know,

2430
01:57:30,611 --> 01:57:33,190
that's one of them is getting outside
and you know,

2431
01:57:33,191 --> 01:57:33,880
I,
I,

2432
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:34,450
I feel it

2433
01:57:34,450 --> 01:57:38,590
often because of course in my career
there are two parts of me,

2434
01:57:38,591 --> 01:57:43,591
there is the cocoon and my study.
I'm working on a book and for the next

2435
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:49,540
16 months I'm pretty much focused on
that and I become sort of a cave dweller

2436
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:53,500
and of course there's the public side of
me which is very extroverted and social

2437
01:57:53,501 --> 01:57:56,770
and so on.
Once in a while when I've spent several

2438
01:57:56,770 --> 01:58:01,060
days very much cocooned and then I go
out even to me to graduate students to

2439
01:58:01,061 --> 01:58:04,810
discuss ideas or a friend,
I literally come back

2440
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:10,030
refreshed in a way that is akin to
satiating a thirst or hunger or sexual

2441
01:58:12,321 --> 01:58:12,741
need.
Right.

2442
01:58:12,741 --> 01:58:15,500
I mean,
you genuinely feel that I went out with

2443
01:58:15,501 --> 01:58:18,560
Joe and we had coffee and I really
needed that.

2444
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:21,050
Right,
that exactly that.

2445
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:21,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

2446
01:58:21,831 --> 01:58:25,070
I think I feel like that all the time
when I see my friends,

2447
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:26,170
you know,
I work with um,

2448
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:31,300
my good friend Joey Diaz last night at
the comedy store and when I saw him,

2449
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:34,220
you know,
I hadn't seen him a couple of days or

2450
01:58:34,221 --> 01:58:35,210
so.
I may see them all the time,

2451
01:58:35,211 --> 01:58:38,410
but I hadn't seen him and he gave me a
big hug and I'm hugging them.

2452
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:39,171
I'm like,
ah,

2453
01:58:39,171 --> 01:58:40,520
so good to see this guy,
by the way,

2454
01:58:40,521 --> 01:58:41,980
you know,
what is hormonal marker

2455
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,170
of hugging,
Lux release of oxytocin.

2456
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:46,070
Makes Sense.
Makes Sense.

2457
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:50,030
I mean,
a friend that I genuinely love and he

2458
01:58:50,031 --> 01:58:52,520
genuinely loves me.
We see each other big smiles,

2459
01:58:52,521 --> 01:58:54,890
big hug.
It's warm and it's awesome,

2460
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,690
you know,
and when you don't have that in life,

2461
01:58:56,810 --> 01:59:01,070
you suffer.
When I first moved to La I had gone here

2462
01:59:01,071 --> 01:59:05,540
to uh,
to do some acting and I was here for a

2463
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,070
couple of weeks and I didn't have any
friends again,

2464
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:10,930
same sort of situation and I had gone,
you know,

2465
01:59:10,931 --> 01:59:14,420
like,
like maybe like two weeks being here and

2466
01:59:14,421 --> 01:59:19,130
really not really knowing anybody.
And this girl that I was working with on

2467
01:59:19,131 --> 01:59:24,131
the set gave me a hug and I remember
that hug felt so good and it didn't feel

2468
01:59:24,921 --> 01:59:26,150
good.
Like I wanted to fuck her.

2469
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,200
Right.
It felt good,

2470
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:29,180
like,
like warm,

2471
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:32,450
like love,
like an actual person being kind to me,

2472
01:59:32,630 --> 01:59:35,360
you know?
Or else like I was so weirded out by

2473
01:59:35,361 --> 01:59:40,361
being in this strange place and living
in La and like I'd just gotten

2474
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:43,550
accustomed to,
I just established like a community in

2475
01:59:43,551 --> 01:59:44,230
New York,
you know,

2476
01:59:44,230 --> 01:59:47,480
established some friends and I was just
starting to be happy in New York and all

2477
01:59:47,481 --> 01:59:48,350
something out in La.

2478
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:51,500
Well,
so in Darwinian Psychiatry,

2479
01:59:51,501 --> 01:59:54,800
which is a field of psychiatry that
applies evolutionary principles,

2480
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,440
there's this idea of.
So for example,

2481
01:59:57,441 --> 02:00:01,460
we've evolved in bands of about up to
150 people,

2482
02:00:01,461 --> 02:00:03,410
right?
Do you might've heard of raw robin

2483
02:00:03,411 --> 02:00:04,730
Dunbar's number?
Yes.

2484
02:00:04,731 --> 02:00:07,220
Yeah.
So the idea is a hundred and 50 people

2485
02:00:07,221 --> 02:00:09,830
you can keep in your social memory
exactly right,

2486
02:00:09,831 --> 02:00:14,831
because computationally you want to be
able to mark who's trustworthy,

2487
02:00:14,871 --> 02:00:16,640
who's not.
This guy reciprocated.

2488
02:00:16,641 --> 02:00:19,910
This guy doesn't once you get past one,
because it's very difficult to maintain

2489
02:00:19,911 --> 02:00:21,590
all these in your head.
Well,

2490
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:25,310
so in the context of the environments in
which we've evolved,

2491
02:00:25,490 --> 02:00:28,490
small groups,
repeat interactions,

2492
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:31,880
our need for social interaction is
certainly met.

2493
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,620
On the other hand,
you could live in New York,

2494
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:37,040
you're surrounded by 8 million people.
You think,

2495
02:00:37,041 --> 02:00:42,041
how could somebody be lonely when you
step outside and you bump into 17,000

2496
02:00:42,081 --> 02:00:46,700
people yet the rates of depression in
this very lonely place,

2497
02:00:46,701 --> 02:00:49,180
but yet very filled place as much
greater than 150.

2498
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:52,970
Precisely because there is a mismatch
between the environment in which we've

2499
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,570
evolved and the contemporary environment
and so that's in the field of

2500
02:00:56,571 --> 02:00:59,480
evolutionary psychiatry.
You study these types of things.

2501
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:02,300
That's fascinating.
The mismatch is true and also there's an

2502
02:01:02,301 --> 02:01:05,780
intimacy wall that people put up because
there's too many folks,

2503
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:07,760
right?
There's too many people and when there's

2504
02:01:07,761 --> 02:01:10,100
too many people,
you can't make friends with everybody.

2505
02:01:10,290 --> 02:01:13,580
Whereas if you're in a small town,
you wave to people as you're driving by,

2506
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:15,710
you don't wave to people.
In New York you'd be.

2507
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:18,950
You'd go fucking crazy.
Imagine if you had to wave to every cab

2508
02:01:18,951 --> 02:01:19,880
that passed you.
In New York,

2509
02:01:19,881 --> 02:01:20,870
if you're driving,
you just.

2510
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:23,750
It's not possible so,
but in your case,

2511
02:01:23,751 --> 02:01:26,150
as somebody who obviously is as well
known and so on,

2512
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:28,810
a lot of people are trying to be
friends.

2513
02:01:28,811 --> 02:01:33,811
You does that result in you having a bit
more of a precautionary approach with

2514
02:01:35,241 --> 02:01:37,910
people because you always think that
there might be some.

2515
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:40,070
That doesn't have to be angle Aj,
I just want

2516
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:41,160
to be,
you know,

2517
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:45,110
friends with this famous person.
Does that ever come into play in your

2518
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:46,310
interactions?
Yeah,

2519
02:01:46,311 --> 02:01:48,560
you definitely going to have that,
but you know,

2520
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:53,470
you just find other likeminded people.
Just find people that are like you or

2521
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:54,520
similar.
Similar.

2522
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:56,150
Yeah.
You get to be picky,

2523
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:57,180
you know,
and also there's,

2524
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:59,320
there's a lot of weight to it,
you know,

2525
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:02,240
if you like for you,
for example,

2526
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:05,300
perfect example like you,
you start doing this podcast,

2527
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:08,150
your podcast has taken off,
your youtube series is taken off and

2528
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:11,840
then people want to become friends with
you because they think that they can get

2529
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:14,810
on your show or piggy back on your
success and they,

2530
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:17,090
they calculate and they look at you and
they say,

2531
02:02:17,091 --> 02:02:18,740
if I could just get in with the
Godfather,

2532
02:02:18,741 --> 02:02:21,230
I will be.
I'll be in and then I'll,

2533
02:02:21,231 --> 02:02:22,670
I'll get a youtube following.

2534
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:24,650
Then I'll get a little twitter following
that I can get a career.

2535
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:27,920
Like there's people that do calculate
things like that and I've met people

2536
02:02:27,921 --> 02:02:30,440
like that in the world of standup where
people have said,

2537
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:31,281
hey,
you know,

2538
02:02:31,281 --> 02:02:32,210
take me under your wing.
Like,

2539
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,430
what are you fucking crazy.
There's no wing.

2540
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,300
Go,
go get your own way.

2541
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,790
Yeah,
I don't have time.

2542
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:42,970
I barely have time to do what I'm doing
right now and continue my own stuff like

2543
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:45,080
you,
you see funny like,

2544
02:02:45,190 --> 02:02:48,770
but there's certain comics will see them
and I know they're really good and

2545
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:51,620
they're working really hard and then
I'll take them on the road with me.

2546
02:02:51,621 --> 02:02:53,900
Like Tony Hinchcliffe is a perfect
example.

2547
02:02:53,901 --> 02:02:57,050
I think he was opening for you in
Montreal when you

2548
02:02:59,230 --> 02:03:02,180
take them with me everywhere.
And then there's other ones like that

2549
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:06,010
where I meet them and they're,
they're working hard and they're,

2550
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,060
they're hustling and then I can help
them,

2551
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:08,960
you know?

2552
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,420
But some people don't.
They don't want to work hard.

2553
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:16,490
They just want to sort of cling on to
you like a lamprey and then they think

2554
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:19,460
somehow know that'll take them to.
And you got to know who those people are

2555
02:03:19,461 --> 02:03:22,010
and some people don't.
And I have friends that don't,

2556
02:03:22,370 --> 02:03:24,560
they don't know,
so I'll be hanging around with them

2557
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:25,730
like,
who the fuck is this guy?

2558
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:26,691
And like,
oh,

2559
02:03:26,691 --> 02:03:27,650
he's a good guy.
He's a good guy.

2560
02:03:27,651 --> 02:03:28,670
I'm like,
wow,

2561
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,540
what are you doing man?
What are you doing?

2562
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:32,510
Like they'll bring these guys on the
road with them and they're.

2563
02:03:32,511 --> 02:03:35,090
They're terrible comedians.
But what they do is they know how to

2564
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:40,070
stroke their ego and kiss their ass and
they've become a part of their system.

2565
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:43,190
And the they,
a lot of my friends who have had this,

2566
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:47,480
they had real problems with these people
where there's a deep resentment that

2567
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:50,690
gets established when the person's
career doesn't take off.

2568
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,500
Right?
You know,

2569
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,720
it doesn't happen because they really
don't have that much talent.

2570
02:03:53,721 --> 02:03:56,030
They're just really good at kissing ass
and they get upset.

2571
02:03:56,031 --> 02:03:57,320
This person's not helping them.
Like,

2572
02:03:57,321 --> 02:04:00,650
what the fuck have you done?
You've let this knuckle head into your

2573
02:04:00,651 --> 02:04:04,010
life because they figured out a way how
to woo you and beginning.

2574
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:07,190
So you have to be careful,
but you also have to be careful with

2575
02:04:07,191 --> 02:04:09,080
yourself.
You have to be careful with your own

2576
02:04:09,081 --> 02:04:10,130
behavior.
You have to,

2577
02:04:10,430 --> 02:04:15,230
you have to objectively monitor your own
thinking and you have to spend time

2578
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:20,420
alone just thinking and that's something
that people don't like to do.

2579
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:23,570
Right,
and that's something I think is

2580
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:27,680
absolutely critical.
It's one of the most critical things for

2581
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:32,710
a grown person to do is to spend some
time and just think alone,

2582
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:38,400
just thinking and monitor your thoughts,
monitor your life,

2583
02:04:38,401 --> 02:04:41,610
and then go forth from that with some
directives,

2584
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:44,030
with some ideas,
with some guidelines of what you want to

2585
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,210
do and what you want to accomplish.

2586
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:47,400
Because if you don't do that,
you sort of live life,

2587
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:51,030
untethered,
untethered to your dreams or your ideas

2588
02:04:51,031 --> 02:04:54,450
or mean even dreams as far as like
community and family.

2589
02:04:54,451 --> 02:04:58,440
Like those aren't like lofty aspirations
and sent in the sense of like

2590
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:01,560
unachievable things like climbing
everest in your underwear.

2591
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:05,880
We're talking about things that can be
done but oftentimes aren't because you

2592
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:08,790
don't pursue them.
With that director of like my directive

2593
02:05:08,791 --> 02:05:12,630
to establish a happy family,
to be a good friend,

2594
02:05:12,631 --> 02:05:14,820
to be a good neighbor,
to all these things,

2595
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:18,690
people don't.
You oftentimes don't consider how much

2596
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:22,620
of a factor those things play in your
overall happiness and the happiness of

2597
02:05:22,621 --> 02:05:24,240
the people around you.
You know,

2598
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:26,910
and you can do that,
but you always have to think about it

2599
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,580
earlier for,
of course your viewers don't know.

2600
02:05:29,581 --> 02:05:32,310
We I introduced you to.
One of my friends was an FBI special

2601
02:05:32,311 --> 02:05:35,520
agent and we were chatting.
I've been here for a few days,

2602
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:40,350
so we had gone out together and I was
telling him that oftentimes I get an

2603
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:44,790
itch for like a man's man,
companionship.

2604
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:45,860
You know what I mean?
Yes.

2605
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:50,910
Because I mean not not to stereotype,
but sometimes the intellectual types

2606
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:53,610
with whom I can go out who are part of
my world,

2607
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:58,140
who are my colleagues will will satisfy
a particular itch,

2608
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:00,920
but of course I used to be a soccer
player and I'm,

2609
02:06:01,420 --> 02:06:03,440
I'm a guy's guy and I eat right.
I mean,

2610
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:06,990
we need to be able to talk about certain
things that are not necessarily within

2611
02:06:06,991 --> 02:06:11,580
the confines need fellow sexist say it
fellow sexist,

2612
02:06:11,581 --> 02:06:12,414
but,
but,

2613
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:16,040
but fellow guys who can sort of let,
let let the hair down.

2614
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:18,390
Right?
But you're allowed to be yourself and,

2615
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,910
and I mean not,
not that I'm not myself and the other

2616
02:06:20,911 --> 02:06:23,340
guy,
but they are different sort of rules of

2617
02:06:23,341 --> 02:06:24,750
conduct and different settings,
right?

2618
02:06:24,751 --> 02:06:27,300
The way you act in way.
And uh,

2619
02:06:27,620 --> 02:06:32,220
and I find that recently maybe because
of course I think we both have young

2620
02:06:32,221 --> 02:06:35,160
children.
Were you somewhat cocoon?

2621
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:40,880
I've lost a bit of the male bonding and
comradery that comes with playing in a

2622
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:45,960
soccer team or under many,
many professional athletes as you know,

2623
02:06:45,961 --> 02:06:49,380
when they retire they will always say,
you know,

2624
02:06:49,381 --> 02:06:52,440
they don't miss playing in front of
100,000 people or the adulation,

2625
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:57,441
but they miss the Camaraderie.
The Brotherhood would there and that,

2626
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:02,760
that element of male male bonding is
something that sometimes I Miss Because

2627
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:04,530
of how busy my life is.

2628
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:06,710
Yes.
I completely agree.

2629
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:11,060
And I've found that the most potent form
of that is hunting camps.

2630
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:12,680
Okay.
That hunting camps,

2631
02:07:12,681 --> 02:07:15,520
when you go hunting and camping out and
you have a.

2632
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:18,340
well,
you're focused on one thing and all

2633
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:22,760
you're surrounded by these men and
everyone is allowed to be themselves and

2634
02:07:22,761 --> 02:07:23,720
you.
You were also,

2635
02:07:23,721 --> 02:07:28,010
you were in engaging in this intensely
quote unquote manly activity,

2636
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:30,710
right?
That is almost the polar opposite of

2637
02:07:30,711 --> 02:07:32,950
raising children and coddling little
girls.

2638
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:37,060
It,
it becomes this manly pursuit and it's

2639
02:07:37,061 --> 02:07:38,530
very satisfying.
Right?

2640
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:40,720
Deep genetic level.
Exactly.

2641
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:45,370
Because I think there's these reward
systems that are established thousands

2642
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:46,350
of years ago in our DNA,
right?

2643
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,610
It's like why you like being around a
campfire,

2644
02:07:48,611 --> 02:07:50,950
like why is that?
Because it's super beneficial to have a

2645
02:07:50,951 --> 02:07:55,270
fire wards off predators keeps you warm,
it cooks you off the mosquitoes,

2646
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:58,090
the mosquitoes.
So many benefits to having this fire

2647
02:07:58,330 --> 02:08:01,730
that when you have one,
it's like naturally satisfying.

2648
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:02,290
Ooh,
well,

2649
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:04,660
you know,
we all huddled around it and you know,

2650
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:06,310
it's odd to leave it,
you know,

2651
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:10,960
it's.
I think that being around other men is

2652
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:13,570
a.
it's oftentimes thought that these men

2653
02:08:13,571 --> 02:08:17,230
are going to get together and I think
men things come back and be sexist,

2654
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,990
patriarchal,
and gonna come back and ruin all this

2655
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:23,710
progress that we've had and there is
that idea that somehow or another that

2656
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:28,711
manly is anti progressive and anti anti
equal anti equal rights and equal

2657
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:32,164
values.

2658
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:36,750
It's funny by the way,
that when you ask a lot of women what

2659
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:41,751
types of Ben they want,
they will typically point to the male

2660
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:47,030
archetype that is most viewed with the
stain by the current wave of third wave

2661
02:08:49,111 --> 02:08:49,944
feminism.
Right.

2662
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:53,340
Talk to those women when they're being
honest and alone.

2663
02:08:53,700 --> 02:08:55,920
Yeah.
If they got called out by.

2664
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:56,610
Yeah.
I mean,

2665
02:08:56,610 --> 02:08:58,530
so I,
I was wanting to communicating with the.

2666
02:08:58,830 --> 02:09:01,200
I think she was either Swedish or
Danish,

2667
02:09:01,590 --> 02:09:04,860
what she was saying that especially I
think she was Swedish where in Sweden

2668
02:09:04,861 --> 02:09:09,300
they had this sort of longstanding
experiment where they try to remove

2669
02:09:09,301 --> 02:09:10,670
gender pronouns.
Right.

2670
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,470
Why don't you explain that?
Because it's very bizarre people.

2671
02:09:14,610 --> 02:09:16,950
Well,
the idea is that they're trying to,

2672
02:09:16,951 --> 02:09:21,951
as much as they can remove any gender
markers in any setting.

2673
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:27,930
And so the idea is that we should be
gender neutral in every possible way.

2674
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:30,150
Incidentally,
there was a study on toy preferences

2675
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:31,740
done in Sweden,
right?

2676
02:09:31,741 --> 02:09:32,150
The,
the,

2677
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:35,190
the Mecca of gender neutrality.
And guess what?

2678
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:40,130
Little Boys and little girls gravitate
to exactly the same sex specific voices

2679
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:43,650
everywhere else on earth core,
despite 40 years of a social

2680
02:09:43,651 --> 02:09:45,240
engineering.
It hasn't done anything,

2681
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:46,770
but anyways.
And so,

2682
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:51,980
so the men there have been so ravaged by
third wave feminism that,

2683
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:55,070
I mean literally they're there,
they're there,

2684
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:57,900
they have no testicles a lot,
metaphorically,

2685
02:09:57,901 --> 02:09:59,130
not literally,
uh,

2686
02:09:59,310 --> 02:10:01,370
and uh,
and so we were chatting on it,

2687
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:01,921
whatever.
And she,

2688
02:10:01,921 --> 02:10:06,630
and she was saying that she misses the,
the pursuit.

2689
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:09,540
I eman courting her.
I mean,

2690
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:13,820
not sexually harassing her but,
but there is a sense that happens.

2691
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,440
Well,
it's actually harassing

2692
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,450
when you're not attracted to that man.
Exactly.

2693
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:19,280
That's where it gets confusing,
right?

2694
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:21,290
Because it's the right man,
you know,

2695
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,740
Johnny Depp or something is,
is pursuing you.

2696
02:10:24,890 --> 02:10:25,820
It's,
it's hot.

2697
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:29,930
If,
if some fat slob with dirty breath is

2698
02:10:29,931 --> 02:10:32,150
pursuing you harassment.
Exactly.

2699
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:33,740
Yeah.
I mean that's

2700
02:10:34,650 --> 02:10:37,050
oftentimes and so men have become so
tentative,

2701
02:10:37,051 --> 02:10:40,280
it apparently and sweetness that
oftentimes these women,

2702
02:10:40,281 --> 02:10:41,770
the reason why they like guys,
you know,

2703
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:44,210
sort of the stereotypical Italian guy
when they go,

2704
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:46,900
it's not only of course Italian guys on
average American,

2705
02:10:46,910 --> 02:10:49,100
very stylish and good looking,
but it's because the,

2706
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:54,290
that political correctness that has
stifled natural dynamics between men and

2707
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:58,820
women hasn't fully
permeated,

2708
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:01,640
say Italian culture so that when women
pass by,

2709
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:03,560
yes,
you don't want them to be cat calling

2710
02:11:03,561 --> 02:11:05,000
them,
but guys will approach.

2711
02:11:05,001 --> 02:11:08,180
You guys will hit on.
You guys will tell you you're beautiful.

2712
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:12,320
And in the deep recesses of even the
most ardent feminist,

2713
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,160
you like that,
I mean,

2714
02:11:14,161 --> 02:11:16,460
that's part of the natural dynamics of
men and women.

2715
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:19,310
Right?
But it's so confusing now for anyone

2716
02:11:19,311 --> 02:11:20,440
because you don't know.
I mean,

2717
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:22,850
if I tell you,
you look good today at work,

2718
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:26,600
is that sexual harassment or not?
Should I only tell my male colleague

2719
02:11:26,601 --> 02:11:28,870
that he really looks good in this time,
but I shouldn't.

2720
02:11:28,930 --> 02:11:29,421
Right?
Well,

2721
02:11:29,421 --> 02:11:33,530
the problem is if you are attracted to
this man and he tells you you look good

2722
02:11:33,531 --> 02:11:35,090
and you say why thank you,
and he's like,

2723
02:11:35,091 --> 02:11:36,530
yeah,
I'd love to stick my dick in your mouth.

2724
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:37,393
Like,
okay,

2725
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:39,950
you fucked it up.
You know,

2726
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:40,790
it's

2727
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:44,930
how far do people take it if it's a
gender or a sexual neutral thing,

2728
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:46,180
like,
uh,

2729
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:47,110
hey,
uh,

2730
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:48,830
debra,
you look wonderful today.

2731
02:11:48,831 --> 02:11:50,420
I love your dress.
Look fantastic.

2732
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:52,290
Well thank you Mike.
And then you know,

2733
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:55,610
he goes to work and you go to work and
everybody's happy and you are friends.

2734
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:58,550
There's a neutrality of sexual
neutrality there,

2735
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:03,200
but that's the platonic values that
people would like to see in the

2736
02:12:03,201 --> 02:12:04,760
workplace.
Rarely exist.

2737
02:12:04,761 --> 02:12:08,210
There's always coveted sexual desires
that people,

2738
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:11,930
their unrequited love and the affairs
that take place because people were

2739
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:14,960
working together in these environments
for eight hours a day staring at each

2740
02:12:14,961 --> 02:12:17,240
other.
It's normal thoughts and ideas.

2741
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:18,630
It's an,
it's an in.

2742
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:23,150
It's an abnormal environment for men and
women to be in these,

2743
02:12:23,151 --> 02:12:26,120
in these workplaces and not have those
thoughts.

2744
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:28,340
That's abnormal.
The thoughts,

2745
02:12:28,341 --> 02:12:31,190
I mean Matt and managing those thoughts
becomes incredibly tricky,

2746
02:12:31,191 --> 02:12:36,191
which is why you need to establish very
strict behavior and know laws and rules

2747
02:12:37,341 --> 02:12:40,040
and regulations in the workforce because
you don't want women to have to deal

2748
02:12:40,041 --> 02:12:41,720
with bullshit or men,
you know,

2749
02:12:41,721 --> 02:12:42,980
I've had men that were in here.

2750
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:45,770
I had a guy,
the amazing atheist was talking about

2751
02:12:45,771 --> 02:12:50,480
this woman that he had that was like,
she was his boss and he was getting

2752
02:12:50,481 --> 02:12:52,970
sexually harassed,
like on a daily basis and it was

2753
02:12:52,971 --> 02:12:54,140
torturous.
It was brutal.

2754
02:12:54,141 --> 02:12:57,600
She would grab his ass who tried to get
him to fuck her and he didn't want to.

2755
02:12:57,601 --> 02:13:00,230
He wasn't attracted to her,
but she was an atheist.

2756
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:01,940
Was the recipient of that.
Yes.

2757
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:05,330
He's a youtube guy.
I don't have to show the drunken

2758
02:13:05,331 --> 02:13:06,164
peasants.
Yeah.

2759
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:07,393
Good Dude.
Yeah.

2760
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:08,690
Um,
and so,

2761
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:10,340
you know,
he was talking about it from his

2762
02:13:10,341 --> 02:13:15,020
perspective where people don't look at
it like that he was in any sort of a bad

2763
02:13:15,021 --> 02:13:17,890
situation at all.
They laugh it off because he's mad.

2764
02:13:18,570 --> 02:13:19,940
Know was like,
what the fuck?

2765
02:13:19,941 --> 02:13:23,630
So he's like psychologically devastated.
He's got to go to work all the time.

2766
02:13:23,631 --> 02:13:25,760
This lady's Greg grab his ass and she's
gross.

2767
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:27,320
She's above him.
Right?

2768
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:30,650
And so he's experiencing what a lot of
women experienced.

2769
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,070
Only no one

2770
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,500
cares because he's a man,
you know.

2771
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:35,363
It's like,
Oh,

2772
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:38,520
speaking of not sexual harassment,
but continuing on that train of thought,

2773
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:43,080
uh,
I had a public exchange with a woman who

2774
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:47,250
started as trying to pass a bill,
I think in New Jersey.

2775
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:49,020
Uh,
maybe in New York.

2776
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:51,810
I can't remember.
It's called the rape by fraud.

2777
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:52,800
Oh yeah,
I've seen that.

2778
02:13:52,801 --> 02:13:55,290
Yeah.
Have you seen it through me or I've seen

2779
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:57,720
that law that they're trying to pass
this whole area.

2780
02:13:57,721 --> 02:14:00,060
So I explained the law because it's.
So.

2781
02:14:00,061 --> 02:14:02,790
The basic idea is that she's arguing
that when you,

2782
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:07,710
in the same way that you enter a
contract with somebody and if you do so

2783
02:14:07,711 --> 02:14:12,480
under false pretense than you are
engaging in a fraudulent action.

2784
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:15,630
Well,
when you get somebody to go to bed with

2785
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:19,350
you under false pretense,
you lie about your background,

2786
02:14:19,351 --> 02:14:21,240
your education,
you learning about whatever,

2787
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:25,830
and you get that person to acquiesce to
your advances.

2788
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:28,760
And you have sex with them.
Well then that is a,

2789
02:14:29,110 --> 02:14:31,680
a,
an instantiation of rape by fraud,

2790
02:14:31,681 --> 02:14:32,181
right?
You,

2791
02:14:32,181 --> 02:14:34,860
you,
you were able to have sex with me under

2792
02:14:34,861 --> 02:14:37,830
false pretenses.
And so I saw this thing.

2793
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:41,250
I thought it was breathtaking how
idiotic it was.

2794
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:42,151
I said,
well,

2795
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:45,030
okay,
let me put together a sad truth youtube

2796
02:14:45,031 --> 02:14:47,880
clip.
And in the clip I didn't mention her.

2797
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:50,020
I didn't attack the woman who's trying
to move the,

2798
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,930
the,
the idea.

2799
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:57,300
But of course I linked back to her site
because I want to be judicious and link

2800
02:14:58,010 --> 02:14:59,970
show that it's a real thing.
The real thing.

2801
02:14:59,971 --> 02:15:01,310
Show them as,
as,

2802
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,420
as a scientist.
So she,

2803
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:07,110
she starts
hammering at me.

2804
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:10,320
Uh,
she puts up this website.

2805
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:13,640
I'm sure she could probably find them.
Maybe I shouldn't have given this

2806
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,410
platform for her.
Uh,

2807
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:18,330
maybe you shouldn't put it because
she'll just get more attention.

2808
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:19,433
But anyways,
up,

2809
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:23,400
she's saying that I am a rape by fraud
enabler.

2810
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:27,390
So.
And then she goes on to say that you

2811
02:15:27,391 --> 02:15:32,391
better stop critiquing my ideas because
you're going to have a lawsuit from my

2812
02:15:32,671 --> 02:15:36,780
lawyer for being live.
And the family story to me,

2813
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:40,980
so the mindset of person,
those words in roughly those words.

2814
02:15:40,981 --> 02:15:42,750
Yeah,
critiquing,

2815
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:46,350
so maybe I'm paraphrasing,
but mean the fact that I'm coming after

2816
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:50,430
her.
So this woman thought that her putting

2817
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:55,490
up an idea in the marketplace of ideas
and having somebody scrutinize that idea

2818
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:02,090
and harassment is harassment,
was a form of defamation.

2819
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:06,810
It being libelous and I thought that was
just breathtaking and I had two other

2820
02:16:06,811 --> 02:16:10,950
cases with two for both happen to be
Forbes journalist,

2821
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:14,910
female journalists where we went back
and forth it very,

2822
02:16:14,911 --> 02:16:17,340
very quickly.
This integrated on on twitter.

2823
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:21,690
They started doing this year cyber
bullying me when I had done no such

2824
02:16:21,691 --> 02:16:22,321
thing.
I was very,

2825
02:16:22,321 --> 02:16:25,590
very tepid and so on and I used against
both of them.

2826
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,880
Some.
Some people might have already heard

2827
02:16:26,881 --> 02:16:29,170
this story.
I use against both of them.

2828
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,070
The fact that I

2829
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:35,070
score higher on oppression Olympics or
victimology poker brown man from the

2830
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,520
Middle East,
jus Arab,

2831
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:39,280
overweight.
And so then I started moving on from

2832
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:41,490
tell your story is a story that you told
them.

2833
02:16:41,491 --> 02:16:43,730
This podcast that's about as presses
again.

2834
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:46,990
Exactly.
And so I turned it against them,

2835
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,220
guess what?
They disappeared.

2836
02:16:48,430 --> 02:16:50,710
So imagine how grotesque their mindset
is.

2837
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:53,270
As long as they thought they could say,
you know,

2838
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:55,090
you're a pig,
you're cyber bullying me.

2839
02:16:55,091 --> 02:16:56,930
Maybe they need eat that.
Yeah,

2840
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,880
twitter things.
Uh,

2841
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:01,300
they felt safe.
The second I started,

2842
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:04,450
I actually was satirizing saying,
why are you attacking a brown man?

2843
02:17:04,451 --> 02:17:06,550
Why are you attacking me?
Just because I'm overweight?

2844
02:17:06,551 --> 02:17:11,551
I have this beard faster than you could
say godfather because they knew that

2845
02:17:13,061 --> 02:17:14,860
they would be accused of Anti.
And I,

2846
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:16,620
you literally use those things like,
you know,

2847
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:20,600
you're an anti Semite you're in bureau
and,

2848
02:17:20,850 --> 02:17:21,700
and it works.

2849
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:24,700
It's magical.
It's so stupid.

2850
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:29,500
Why don't you just engage me in ideas
about identity politics?

2851
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:33,010
Well,
I think there's some value in some merit

2852
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:37,840
in the idea that you shouldn't be able
to lie to people and fuck them.

2853
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:40,870
Right?
I think like if you say you're a prince

2854
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:45,130
from another country and you want to
take this person to your land and they

2855
02:17:45,131 --> 02:17:49,000
will live forever in a garden of Eden,
and this woman thinks,

2856
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:50,590
oh my God,
I met the perfect guy.

2857
02:17:50,650 --> 02:17:52,270
But it's not right by fraud.
Okay.

2858
02:17:52,271 --> 02:17:53,020
Well,
what is it?

2859
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:54,400
No,
I actually in my,

2860
02:17:54,401 --> 02:17:57,790
in my clip,
I made it clear that I find that morally

2861
02:17:57,791 --> 02:18:00,970
and ethically reprehensible,
I believe that people should be

2862
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:04,780
maximally honest in their daily affairs.
Exactly.

2863
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:06,610
So,
but I don't call it rape by fraud.

2864
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:08,410
You're okay.
It's not rape,

2865
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,360
but what is it?
Duplicity.

2866
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:14,440
It's caveat emptor,
buyer beware,

2867
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:19,420
but there's something that we value very
intensely about intimacy.

2868
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:22,810
And uh,
someone who achieves intimacy through

2869
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:24,360
false pretenses.
It's,

2870
02:18:24,361 --> 02:18:28,360
it's different than someone that like,
uh,

2871
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:30,880
you know,
says they're going to pay for lunch.

2872
02:18:30,940 --> 02:18:33,490
Ninety years old,
they're going to give you a million

2873
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:34,241
dollars and they don't.
Okay.

2874
02:18:34,241 --> 02:18:35,710
But yeah,
I do.

2875
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:40,660
Ninety five percent of online dating
would be then rape.

2876
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:41,710
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2877
02:18:41,711 --> 02:18:43,530
It should be.
Should it be all rape,

2878
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:46,840
right?
Men Lie about their education,

2879
02:18:46,841 --> 02:18:48,550
about their income,
their height.

2880
02:18:48,551 --> 02:18:50,890
Women lie about their age,
about their weight.

2881
02:18:51,130 --> 02:18:54,910
They wear pushup bras at part of the
mating ritual as,

2882
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:58,300
as the testable as it might be,
is that people engage in deceptive

2883
02:18:58,301 --> 02:19:01,620
signaling.
Animals evolve deceptive signals.

2884
02:19:01,650 --> 02:19:02,470
Right?
So,

2885
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:05,560
so that's called everybody a rape.
I mean everybody is a rapist.

2886
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:08,710
Well,
under that you're getting real extreme

2887
02:19:08,910 --> 02:19:11,830
because we're,
we're talking about like what kind of

2888
02:19:11,831 --> 02:19:15,100
lies are we talking about where it would
be raped by fraud?

2889
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:18,370
Like is it established?
Do they have certain parameters that

2890
02:19:18,371 --> 02:19:20,200
would.
So I don't know that achieved that.

2891
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:21,370
This terminal.
The boundaries.

2892
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:25,880
I think in her case,
I know that she has experienced

2893
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:30,300
a very bad deception where the guy whom
she,

2894
02:19:30,301 --> 02:19:32,120
I don't know if she married him or not,
you know,

2895
02:19:32,121 --> 02:19:35,210
had said that he was ABC,
but it turned out to not be true.

2896
02:19:35,211 --> 02:19:37,070
And he had maybe,
okay,

2897
02:19:37,071 --> 02:19:39,050
it's dreadful.
It's horrible.

2898
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:41,240
But that's,
that's called life.

2899
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,310
I mean,
you learn from that.

2900
02:19:43,311 --> 02:19:44,810
I mean that happened to Cindy
[inaudible],

2901
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:46,820
Cindy Crawford,
Christie Brinkley,

2902
02:19:47,210 --> 02:19:49,880
she married some guy,
she was in a helicopter crash with,

2903
02:19:50,330 --> 02:19:54,380
turned out to be kind of a con man.
And as time went on she realized it and

2904
02:19:54,381 --> 02:19:55,550
you know,
across to a lot of money.

2905
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:59,300
Okay.
A woman who fakes an orgasm with you is

2906
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:04,100
raping you because the next time,
the next time that you have sex with her

2907
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:07,940
under the false pretense that you
received positive feedback that you're a

2908
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:10,640
great lover because you gave her an
orgasm,

2909
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:12,320
but she was faking her orgasm.

2910
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:15,830
She's raping me,
so that's ridiculous.

2911
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:21,860
So far off the beaten path because the
woman is saying like,

2912
02:20:21,861 --> 02:20:23,470
you gave her pleasure,
like it's.

2913
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:27,740
There's no loss to you like that.
It doesn't hurt you in any way.

2914
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:31,130
Like if that woman said like,
you made me come so because he made me

2915
02:20:31,131 --> 02:20:32,900
come,
I'm going to give you a million dollars

2916
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,940
and then you can quit your job,
so you quit your job.

2917
02:20:34,941 --> 02:20:36,560
You're like,
I'm the best pussy eater ever.

2918
02:20:36,561 --> 02:20:39,200
I'm going to get paid for this,
and you quit your job because of that,

2919
02:20:39,201 --> 02:20:41,430
and then it turns out that she doesn't
really have a million dollars and you'd

2920
02:20:41,450 --> 02:20:45,260
even make her have an orgasm.
Well then you fucked up.

2921
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:47,000
No,
the only reason I wanted to have sex

2922
02:20:47,001 --> 02:20:52,001
with her again is because of the
feedback I received for the great love

2923
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:57,080
of your own pleasures of secondary
nature come out on the secondary.

2924
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:59,290
I'm a very giving guy.
I'm completely all justice.

2925
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:02,330
Such as stress.
You should abandon it immediately is a

2926
02:21:02,331 --> 02:21:04,640
terrible argument.
But I think there is,

2927
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:08,510
there's a certain amount of validity to
what this woman saying like as far as

2928
02:21:08,511 --> 02:21:11,810
like someone who was like very
deceptive,

2929
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:15,260
who uses that deception to have sex with
you and you find out they're a liar.

2930
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:16,850
That feels terrible.
Yes.

2931
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:19,730
So like,
but what should it be like,

2932
02:21:19,731 --> 02:21:21,900
what if,
you know what I mean?

2933
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:22,510
What,
what,

2934
02:21:22,510 --> 02:21:25,220
what would,
what could it be mean if a guy says he's

2935
02:21:25,221 --> 02:21:27,450
a one eighth Indian,
you know,

2936
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:27,840
my,
uh,

2937
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:30,170
my mom's a patchy on my grandfather's
side,

2938
02:21:30,171 --> 02:21:31,810
no end,
but it's all bullshit when you're

2939
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:34,650
attracted to that and some sort of
strange way because you really like a

2940
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:36,260
dream catchers,
you know,

2941
02:21:36,261 --> 02:21:39,020
I've always wanted to be with a native
American and then you find out the guys

2942
02:21:39,021 --> 02:21:41,300
really like German,
Irish and you know,

2943
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:42,140
he's a liar.

2944
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:43,760
Like is that,
is that right?

2945
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:46,010
Of course not right.
Okay.

2946
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:47,660
So what is that?
That's just a liar.

2947
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:49,880
What?
But when life,

2948
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:51,400
when is it a problem?
It's a,

2949
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:54,590
it's a problem.
When someone does it in somehow or

2950
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:58,000
another,
it harms the person who's been deceived.

2951
02:21:58,001 --> 02:21:59,450
It becomes a crime,
right?

2952
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,610
I think if there is,
I mean I don't know,

2953
02:22:01,611 --> 02:22:03,140
I'd have to think about what the
parameters are,

2954
02:22:03,141 --> 02:22:04,670
but I mean if,
if you,

2955
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:08,480
if you were engaging in a repeat
interaction where you defrauded the

2956
02:22:08,481 --> 02:22:13,481
person through a misrepresentation,
but I mean the idea that to get somebody

2957
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:19,300
to date you or have sex with you and
through the pursuit of that objective,

2958
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:21,950
July as reprehensible,
that may be clear.

2959
02:22:21,951 --> 02:22:24,200
Again,
it's reprehensible and I certainly don't

2960
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:26,190
live my life that way.
Although I'm married

2961
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:28,170
now,
but I never have lived my life that way.

2962
02:22:28,410 --> 02:22:33,410
You can't criminalize a central feature
of human nature.

2963
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:37,530
It is incumbent of on each individual to
do their homework.

2964
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:41,100
I mean you do your due diligence and
find out if the guy that you're speaking

2965
02:22:41,101 --> 02:22:42,510
to is a Nigerian prince.
Right,

2966
02:22:42,511 --> 02:22:47,511
but doesn't this woman have a kind of
fairly fairly cut and dry parameters

2967
02:22:47,851 --> 02:22:49,290
that she's establishing?
I don't.

2968
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:50,860
I.
You don't know why.

2969
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,200
I don't know either.
If she did,

2970
02:22:52,201 --> 02:22:54,660
maybe that would give it more validity
of something that she's been thinking

2971
02:22:54,661 --> 02:22:57,780
about for a long time,
but I can never imagine that it would

2972
02:22:57,781 --> 02:23:01,890
ever be able to meet the standards of it
being called rape.

2973
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:03,120
You know,
what's interesting about this

2974
02:23:03,121 --> 02:23:07,320
conversation is that what we're talking
about as a person who's been fucked over

2975
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:10,890
and that person has gone out of their
way to make sure this never happens

2976
02:23:10,891 --> 02:23:13,160
again because they've been hurt,
they've been tortured.

2977
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:18,620
I think you see a lot of that with like
really radical feminism in general.

2978
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:23,670
What you see is a lot of women who their
interactions with men have not been

2979
02:23:23,671 --> 02:23:28,671
positive and unfortunately the
stereotype is that these are very

2980
02:23:28,831 --> 02:23:30,450
unattractive women.
Well,

2981
02:23:30,451 --> 02:23:34,770
if you're a very unattractive woman and
you go through life just being rejected

2982
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:37,440
by man or being treated like shit by
men,

2983
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:42,070
there's like a natural tendency to think
that men are terrible because they've

2984
02:23:42,071 --> 02:23:44,100
rejected.
Like maybe you're attracted to a man and

2985
02:23:44,101 --> 02:23:46,380
he.
He laughed at you and mocks you.

2986
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:49,390
That.
I've seen that on the male side too,

2987
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:54,060
and with a close friend.
I had a friend that I watched him evolve

2988
02:23:54,061 --> 02:23:57,660
into a woman hater.
He had aspirations and hopes,

2989
02:23:57,661 --> 02:24:00,840
find a good girl and he had this one
girl he was dating and she fucked him

2990
02:24:00,841 --> 02:24:04,330
over and then another girl fucked them
over and just women I'm working at

2991
02:24:04,331 --> 02:24:08,850
attracted to him and you know,
it just got darker and darker as he got

2992
02:24:08,851 --> 02:24:13,260
older and older to the point where he
genuinely would say like,

2993
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:16,770
just generalized terrible things about
women like women.

2994
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:18,570
They're all fucking Horace Mann.
They all just want your money.

2995
02:24:18,571 --> 02:24:19,950
They're all fucking pigs.
Fuck them.

2996
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,510
Who gives a shit?
I hope they get raped.

2997
02:24:21,630 --> 02:24:23,100
Like you would say,
crazy shit like that.

2998
02:24:23,101 --> 02:24:24,510
And you'd be like,
whoa.

2999
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:26,130
Like where did this come from?
Well,

3000
02:24:26,131 --> 02:24:30,270
it came from a lifetime of rejection and
associating women with a negative

3001
02:24:30,271 --> 02:24:31,020
feeling.
Right?

3002
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:32,730
I'm attracted to them.
I come up to them,

3003
02:24:32,731 --> 02:24:34,530
they shit on me.
I'm attracted to them.

3004
02:24:34,531 --> 02:24:36,960
I come up to them to shit on me over and
over and over again to the point where

3005
02:24:36,961 --> 02:24:38,090
he broke,
you know,

3006
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:40,620
he just,
it was easier for him to form these

3007
02:24:40,621 --> 02:24:45,600
generalizations and the act on these or
to have these in his mindset and I think

3008
02:24:45,601 --> 02:24:50,450
that this is the unfortunate reality
about sexual attraction in,

3009
02:24:50,490 --> 02:24:54,630
as it pertains to the dynamics of men
and women interacting with each other.

3010
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:59,470
There's a lot going on there when you
look at unattractive of feminist versus

3011
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:00,810
over,
over and over again,

3012
02:25:00,811 --> 02:25:02,490
you see one after the other,
after the other.

3013
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:03,870
How do we,
there's a study that was done,

3014
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:06,930
uh,
I think published in frontiers in human

3015
02:25:07,140 --> 02:25:12,140
neuroscience where they measured that
the ratio and administered a scale of

3016
02:25:13,430 --> 02:25:14,520
gender,
you know,

3017
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:16,320
how much you score and masculinity
femininity,

3018
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:19,590
if I remember correctly,
or dominance or something at a feminist

3019
02:25:19,591 --> 02:25:24,310
conference.
And the women were more masculinized at

3020
02:25:24,311 --> 02:25:27,940
that conference.
So there is empirical evidence for sort

3021
02:25:27,941 --> 02:25:31,720
of your anecdotal intuition.
It makes sense.

3022
02:25:31,721 --> 02:25:34,210
And also women that are forced to work,
you know,

3023
02:25:34,211 --> 02:25:35,320
they,
they've found that women in the

3024
02:25:35,321 --> 02:25:37,720
workplace generally develop more
testosterone,

3025
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:38,831
right?
Yes,

3026
02:25:38,831 --> 02:25:40,480
yes.
Women that are forced to fend for

3027
02:25:40,481 --> 02:25:42,790
themselves generally develop more
testosterone.

3028
02:25:43,140 --> 02:25:46,410
It it,
it literally alters the way their

3029
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:49,750
hormones,
so it's not that depending on the fields

3030
02:25:49,751 --> 02:25:52,590
that they go into,
they start off with more or less to

3031
02:25:52,591 --> 02:25:53,424
start strong.

3032
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:55,330
So you're saying that it's their
response.

3033
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:59,440
They're saying that they believe it is a
response to women being independent and

3034
02:25:59,441 --> 02:26:02,830
being forced to provide for themselves
that they develop more testosterone.

3035
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:04,420
I don't know how the fuck they prove
that.

3036
02:26:04,421 --> 02:26:07,030
I don't know how he likes to see.
The problem is you would have to have

3037
02:26:07,031 --> 02:26:10,300
the exact same person with the exact
same genetics take two completely

3038
02:26:10,301 --> 02:26:12,910
different paths,
so you'd have to do with identical twins

3039
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:15,910
with very similar input,
right?

3040
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,790
Because like your jeans,
a lot of what's going on,

3041
02:26:18,791 --> 02:26:21,310
the way they express themselves is
dependent upon your environment,

3042
02:26:21,311 --> 02:26:24,870
your experiences.
There's a lot going on that simple.

3043
02:26:25,530 --> 02:26:26,363
I,
I,

3044
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:30,520
I think my last set truth clip was on
exactly that where I was arguing that

3045
02:26:30,521 --> 02:26:34,300
the whole idea of biological determinism
as applied to evolutionary psychology is

3046
02:26:34,301 --> 02:26:37,120
complete nonsense.
And one of the examples that I give is

3047
02:26:37,121 --> 02:26:41,920
exactly the words that you use,
which is that genes are turned on or off

3048
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:44,440
as a function of environmental inputs.

3049
02:26:44,570 --> 02:26:45,300
Right?
So,

3050
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:47,540
so the idea when people levy,
he's like,

3051
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,850
Oh,
you're an evolutionary psychologist.

3052
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:50,710
Also,
you believe everything is biologically

3053
02:26:50,711 --> 02:26:53,350
determined.
Somebody who says that is effectively

3054
02:26:53,351 --> 02:26:56,080
saying,
I understand nothing about biology,

3055
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:57,550
right?
Yeah.

3056
02:26:57,850 --> 02:27:01,480
It's um,
it's very complex and only being

3057
02:27:01,481 --> 02:27:04,540
recently understood within the last
couple of decades.

3058
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:08,950
So we're talking about a fairly new
science that is,

3059
02:27:08,951 --> 02:27:12,820
or a fairly new data I should say,
that a lot of people just haven't

3060
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:16,360
accepted yet.
And it's very convenient to generalize

3061
02:27:16,361 --> 02:27:21,361
instead to not taking into account all
these incredibly complex variables that

3062
02:27:22,451 --> 02:27:26,110
determine whether a human being is this
way or that way,

3063
02:27:26,111 --> 02:27:28,720
whether they're more masculine and more.
It's like,

3064
02:27:28,990 --> 02:27:30,140
what have you had to do?
What?

3065
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:34,780
How have you had to fend for yourself?
Have you had to get through life?

3066
02:27:35,030 --> 02:27:35,620
What,
what,

3067
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:37,270
what,
what have you had to do as far as like

3068
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:38,860
who have you had to nurture and take
care of?

3069
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:42,160
You know what?
There's a lot of variables that lead to

3070
02:27:42,161 --> 02:27:46,180
a person being a person and there's a
lot of different styles of people and

3071
02:27:46,181 --> 02:27:50,500
some men like really strong dominant
mother figure wives.

3072
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:52,090
They love it.
That's what they want.

3073
02:27:52,091 --> 02:27:54,580
They want some woman to take care of
everything and tell them what to do.

3074
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:57,580
I have friends like that.
They want that woman to yell at them and

3075
02:27:57,581 --> 02:28:01,300
tell them what to do it.
It alleviates a lot of questions and

3076
02:28:01,301 --> 02:28:04,780
choices and that's what they look
forward to and then I have other friends

3077
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:08,450
that want the wife to be like some 19
fifties housewife from a,

3078
02:28:08,530 --> 02:28:11,260
from a movie where she was just leave it
to beaver.

3079
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,240
You come home,
dinner's on the table,

3080
02:28:13,241 --> 02:28:17,830
she gives you a kiss and you know,
it's like real traditional values,

3081
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:22,040
but there's feminists that we'll look at
that woman and she's an enemy

3082
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:23,570
like that.
Her life,

3083
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:25,850
although it makes her happy to exist in
this way,

3084
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:30,030
they have a really.
A cooperative relationship,

3085
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:33,350
doesn't have the right to that choice
and Amanda's never have the right to be

3086
02:28:33,351 --> 02:28:35,570
masculine.
Men Don't have a right to go on these

3087
02:28:35,571 --> 02:28:36,530
hunting camps.
First of all,

3088
02:28:36,531 --> 02:28:38,930
you should only eat vegetables,
you should be a Vegan,

3089
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,150
you know,
and then in doing so you definitely

3090
02:28:41,151 --> 02:28:43,610
shouldn't be a hunter and you definitely
shouldn't be involved in masculine

3091
02:28:43,611 --> 02:28:46,100
sports or activities.
You definitely shouldn't enjoy

3092
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:49,820
weightlifting or anything that's going
to make you more men because it'll make

3093
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:52,550
you toxic.
You're a toxic masculinity.

3094
02:28:52,551 --> 02:28:55,440
That's hilarious.
Do we want to talk about quickly or.

3095
02:28:56,010 --> 02:29:00,920
I'm not that familiar with her other
than I've seen a couple of her videos

3096
02:29:00,921 --> 02:29:04,820
about video games and I'm like,
and they've also seen thunder foot stuff

3097
02:29:04,821 --> 02:29:06,230
on her,
which is really interesting.

3098
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:09,650
Which explains that she had this
background in marketing and mass

3099
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:13,370
marketing and you know,
is obviously whether or not she's

3100
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:17,810
entirely invested in these ideas.
She's obviously aware that she's

3101
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:23,030
marketing her ideas towards a very
specific group and she's got these Beta

3102
02:29:23,031 --> 02:29:27,800
males that cling to her and are attached
to which are hilarious human beings.

3103
02:29:27,801 --> 02:29:31,430
Have you heard my theory about the.
It's actually a real top secret fucker

3104
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:32,660
strategy.
Excuse me.

3105
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:34,730
Sneaker fucker.
Sneaker fuckers.

3106
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:37,010
No,
I can't wait.

3107
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:39,230
There you go.
That's,

3108
02:29:39,231 --> 02:29:41,420
I think it's.
I'm not sure if it was a term that was

3109
02:29:41,421 --> 02:29:43,760
introduced by Richard Dawkins.
I can't remember who it was,

3110
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:47,730
but he called it speak if Dawkins called
misspeaking.

3111
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:50,300
Maybe Jamie can pull it up,
but anyways,

3112
02:29:50,330 --> 02:29:55,330
it basically refers to some species
where males come in different

3113
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:57,500
phenotypes,
in other words,

3114
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:59,960
different physical manifestations,
so there might be,

3115
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,500
say for example,
that type of fish species where the

3116
02:30:03,501 --> 02:30:06,200
typical male is a whatever,
a big big phenotype,

3117
02:30:06,201 --> 02:30:07,034
whatever that is.

3118
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:12,100
Then there are other males that mimic
the phenotype of females,

3119
02:30:12,470 --> 02:30:17,470
so when the male standing around looking
to protect his area that that male who

3120
02:30:18,531 --> 02:30:23,531
looks like a female will sneak in and
then get some quick calculations with

3121
02:30:23,991 --> 02:30:27,130
some of the females that otherwise
should be inaccessible to him and that

3122
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:32,190
became known as a sneaker fuckers
strategy in zoology and I argue I

3123
02:30:33,441 --> 02:30:35,230
haven't tested it,
but I think it it,

3124
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:36,020
it,
it would,

3125
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:39,410
it would,
it will be interesting to do so that

3126
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:42,230
some of these sort of social justice
warrior,

3127
02:30:42,231 --> 02:30:45,970
Beta males are engaging in a form of
sneaker fuckers strategies.

3128
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:47,390
What do you think?
One hundred percent,

3129
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,580
100 percent.
Without a doubt.

3130
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:51,370
I mean,
you have to do what you gotta do it.

3131
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,530
There's a desperation involved,
like if you can't be,

3132
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:58,160
you know,
this beautiful Stud Mail that all these

3133
02:30:58,161 --> 02:31:02,720
women falling.
I'm too short and too short.

3134
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:05,090
I'm not existent and give me a chance.
You know,

3135
02:31:05,091 --> 02:31:05,930
you're shorter than me.
Dude.

3136
02:31:05,931 --> 02:31:07,610
You're fucking know I'm finished.
It's done.

3137
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:11,120
But you know what?
There is research that shows this study.

3138
02:31:11,690 --> 02:31:13,260
Get ready defensive.
No,

3139
02:31:13,330 --> 02:31:14,480
not at all.
You're ready.

3140
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:15,980
You're ready.
What?

3141
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:20,820
So you bring in a guy to a room and only
thing that you manipulate is the

3142
02:31:20,821 --> 02:31:23,310
ascribed status,
academic status that you give to a guy.

3143
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,220
He comes into a room and in one,
in one version of the experiment,

3144
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:28,800
he's a assistant professor.
In the second version,

3145
02:31:28,801 --> 02:31:30,690
he's an associate professor of the third
version.

3146
02:31:30,691 --> 02:31:35,220
He's a famous world famous professor.
Then when he steps out,

3147
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:40,470
the only thing that you test is people's
perception of his height.

3148
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:46,070
His height magically becomes taller as
his ascribed academic status goes up.

3149
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:51,070
And so I always joke that I may be only
from my phone,

3150
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:54,540
but I'll tell you I'm seven foot four
baby.

3151
02:31:55,410 --> 02:31:58,620
I'll tell you that.
That's hurtful.

3152
02:31:58,740 --> 02:31:59,371
No,
it's not.

3153
02:31:59,371 --> 02:32:02,190
I feel safe.
I feel very uncomfortable.

3154
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:05,670
I mean,
on a really good day where the Harris

3155
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:10,100
Spike five,
600 actually.

3156
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:12,930
Somebody really good data.
I was in a photo.

3157
02:32:12,931 --> 02:32:15,660
You'd measure that man.
Was it a photo yesterday with Dave

3158
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:17,010
Rubin?
And I did his show and so on.

3159
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:18,360
And somebody wrote.
He goes,

3160
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:21,030
oh,
I learned something new.

3161
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:24,890
I thought the Godfather was much taller.
We gotta wear stilts.

3162
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:27,090
I got to wear stuff.
I got to wear the Rubio heels.

3163
02:32:27,091 --> 02:32:28,500
Maybe.
What's a Rubio Hill?

3164
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:29,923
Rubio.
The,

3165
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:32,480
the,
the presidential candidate has wasn't

3166
02:32:32,481 --> 02:32:34,980
he?
Wasn't there a rumor that he was patting

3167
02:32:34,981 --> 02:32:37,270
his heels?
Make himself real?

3168
02:32:37,350 --> 02:32:38,490
That's what I'd heard.
I don't know.

3169
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:42,210
I wouldn't be shocked.
When you think about political circles

3170
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:44,910
and what kind of manipulation matters.
Yeah.

3171
02:32:44,911 --> 02:32:48,990
There's so much manipulation going on
there with image and even so many

3172
02:32:48,991 --> 02:32:50,160
different consultants.

3173
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:51,840
I mean they have that on television
shows.

3174
02:32:51,841 --> 02:32:53,220
I can only imagine what it would be
like.

3175
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:53,731
Well,
when,

3176
02:32:53,731 --> 02:32:56,850
when George Bush was debating,
I don't know if it was carrie,

3177
02:32:56,851 --> 02:32:58,340
I can't remember which one,
uh,

3178
02:32:58,610 --> 02:33:01,170
his,
his camp had to come up with all sorts

3179
02:33:01,171 --> 02:33:04,110
of rules of what kind of camera shots
you can do and so on,

3180
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:09,320
so that he doesn't look at his heels.
Isn't it beautiful how everything I say

3181
02:33:10,201 --> 02:33:13,650
is validated by Jamie Jesus Christ.
It's believable.

3182
02:33:13,950 --> 02:33:16,260
Fucking four inch heels on.
I love Jamie.

3183
02:33:16,261 --> 02:33:19,560
I should have him around everywhere.
Like when I'm in class I say something

3184
02:33:19,561 --> 02:33:21,450
and he just pops this stuff up.
First of all,

3185
02:33:21,451 --> 02:33:23,220
those would be seriously uncomfortable.
Well,

3186
02:33:23,221 --> 02:33:24,080
okay.
Well hold on,

3187
02:33:24,090 --> 02:33:24,690
hold on.
Now.

3188
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:27,030
How much taller those things in like
cowboy boots,

3189
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:29,640
cowboy boots or like that?
That's at least three inches.

3190
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:31,260
Those are bigger than three inches.

3191
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:32,640
Those are.
Well maybe you're right.

3192
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:34,770
Those are giant.
So he's a short guy.

3193
02:33:34,830 --> 02:33:36,810
How tall is Rubio?
I.

3194
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:38,790
Oh yeah,
he has giant heels because look at those

3195
02:33:38,791 --> 02:33:41,040
Italian shoes.
That's not normal for those ones on the

3196
02:33:41,041 --> 02:33:43,710
left.
That's not normal that that's by design.

3197
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:45,360
Yeah,
there you go.

3198
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,270
You got to just suck it up,
man.

3199
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:50,700
Deal with the height
is five foot six.

3200
02:33:50,730 --> 02:33:52,590
He could get any woman he wants in the
world.

3201
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:54,180
Who's that guy?
Oh,

3202
02:33:54,181 --> 02:33:56,340
for the love of God.
What are you talking about?

3203
02:33:56,910 --> 02:33:58,020
Lionelle.
Messy.

3204
02:33:58,021 --> 02:33:59,270
You don't know who that is?
No.

3205
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:02,340
Who is that?
Why you're looking at me?

3206
02:34:02,341 --> 02:34:04,560
Funny.
Last time it was demetrius mighty mouse.

3207
02:34:04,561 --> 02:34:06,140
Johnson.
I don't know.

3208
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:09,430
Those tend to shut your mouth.
Greatest pound for pound fighter in

3209
02:34:09,431 --> 02:34:11,220
several lived.
Dare you?

3210
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:15,220
Leah now is the greatest soccer player
who ever lived.

3211
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,620
Oh,
soccer.

3212
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:17,680
That's okay.
Right?

3213
02:34:17,681 --> 02:34:18,160
But the godly

3214
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,920
sport he ever really.
It's just not something I'm interested

3215
02:34:20,921 --> 02:34:22,630
in.
This one is five foot six.

3216
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:23,680
He said,
you know what?

3217
02:34:23,681 --> 02:34:27,580
I saw that guy on television.
They were doing some special on his,

3218
02:34:27,581 --> 02:34:28,390
uh,
his,

3219
02:34:28,390 --> 02:34:31,150
his movement and what he can do to
balls.

3220
02:34:31,390 --> 02:34:35,200
Not like my balls but like soccer balls
and how he can manipulate them.

3221
02:34:35,201 --> 02:34:38,710
And it was fucking spectacular.
He's an incredible,

3222
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:41,290
incredible athlete,
but I didn't know what his name was.

3223
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:43,840
Yeah.
Okay.

3224
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:45,100
There you go.
Okay.

3225
02:34:45,790 --> 02:34:46,480
You should,
you should.

3226
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:48,940
You should show his wife at some point.
I'm sure she's not as fuck.

3227
02:34:49,030 --> 02:34:49,990
It's okay.
You don't show it.

3228
02:34:50,410 --> 02:34:52,440
I get it,
but um,

3229
02:34:52,810 --> 02:34:54,520
yeah,
but this guy running for president as

3230
02:34:54,521 --> 02:34:57,700
nothing to do,
like she's as Christ the guy's boring.

3231
02:34:57,880 --> 02:34:59,380
Nobody gives a fuck.
It's not a leader.

3232
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:00,760
It's like Jeb Bush.
Jeb Bush,

3233
02:35:00,761 --> 02:35:03,130
not a leader.
That's why you had to back out of it.

3234
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:05,680
You know Ted Cruz,
not a leader.

3235
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:06,151
You know,
they're,

3236
02:35:06,151 --> 02:35:09,070
they're hanging their hat on this guy
that most people see right through

3237
02:35:09,071 --> 02:35:11,110
because there's certain,
there's a,

3238
02:35:11,111 --> 02:35:13,750
there's a,
there's a thing that happens when you

3239
02:35:13,751 --> 02:35:17,260
talk to that guy where his intellect,
like Ted Cruz,

3240
02:35:17,550 --> 02:35:20,130
like maybe he's intelligent.
Maybes I don't,

3241
02:35:20,131 --> 02:35:23,200
I don't know.
Supposedly went to Harvard supposedly is

3242
02:35:23,201 --> 02:35:25,450
very wise.
The way he talks,

3243
02:35:25,451 --> 02:35:29,740
the way he establishes himself,
the way he communicates is not enough.

3244
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:32,920
It's not enough to run the world.
We all recognize it.

3245
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:34,250
He,
he's not.

3246
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:39,070
He's not powerful enough in his ideas.
Bernie sanders might be a crazy old

3247
02:35:39,071 --> 02:35:40,360
socialist.
He might be,

3248
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:44,980
but when that guy speaks with passion,
like I buy it,

3249
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:47,650
you buy it.
It doesn't exude a wind penis.

3250
02:35:47,710 --> 02:35:48,880
No,
it doesn't exude a wimp.

3251
02:35:48,881 --> 02:35:51,610
He's got terrible posture.
He's got terrible posture,

3252
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:56,230
he looks very unhealthy,
but he's willing to stand up for his

3253
02:35:56,231 --> 02:36:00,250
beliefs and he speaks with clarity and
he speaks with a certain amount of

3254
02:36:00,251 --> 02:36:01,084
force.

3255
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:03,100
And uh,
I don't think,

3256
02:36:03,220 --> 02:36:05,170
I don't think he's the king,
you know,

3257
02:36:05,171 --> 02:36:07,960
but I think we live in a time where only
assholes want to be president.

3258
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:09,730
You know,
look this,

3259
02:36:09,731 --> 02:36:12,010
this president thing is not going to
last.

3260
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:13,840
It's not,
it's not going to last.

3261
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:15,340
No,
I think it's like fucking,

3262
02:36:15,341 --> 02:36:18,220
it's like a Morse code.
It's like we need something better.

3263
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:21,760
Like this is stupid.
It's like we have Morse code and we also

3264
02:36:21,761 --> 02:36:22,571
have cell phones.
Well,

3265
02:36:22,571 --> 02:36:24,490
you're not gonna use fucking Morse code.
It's goofy.

3266
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:28,720
And this Internet thing that we have
created this way of establishing

3267
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:33,430
information or expressing information,
it is so far superior to anything that

3268
02:36:33,431 --> 02:36:36,790
existed back when they invented the
electoral college or representative

3269
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:39,590
government that,
that voting and,

3270
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:42,070
and having a leader,
one single hire,

3271
02:36:42,071 --> 02:36:44,080
primate leader,
one singer,

3272
02:36:44,140 --> 02:36:46,720
single top eight that runs all the other
apes.

3273
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:47,793
It's dumb.

3274
02:36:48,250 --> 02:36:50,560
It's dumb.
You can't one person being president.

3275
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:54,160
He's a fucking really stupid idea.
It just doesn't make any sense,

3276
02:36:54,161 --> 02:36:56,890
but who makes the decisions?
That should be a lot of people should be

3277
02:36:56,891 --> 02:36:59,890
a gigantic council of really intelligent
governance.

3278
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:01,210
Yes.
One hundred percent.

3279
02:37:01,211 --> 02:37:02,980
I think it is already.
It is already.

3280
02:37:02,981 --> 02:37:04,660
It's a figurehead more than it is
anything.

3281
02:37:04,810 --> 02:37:09,310
If that doesn't explain why Obama
shifted almost all of his policies that

3282
02:37:09,311 --> 02:37:11,110
he said that he was going to do once he
got into office,

3283
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:13,330
once he actually got into office,
change.

3284
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:17,960
So many of the things he including his
idea and stance on whistleblowers.

3285
02:37:18,050 --> 02:37:21,050
There was a big part of his hope and
change website that they had to redact.

3286
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:25,730
So who?
Who believes that the president really

3287
02:37:25,731 --> 02:37:29,270
is responsible for the entire country
really is the one guy that runs the

3288
02:37:29,271 --> 02:37:31,400
entire show,
I think almost no one now.

3289
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:35,090
Almost no one,
so it's a ridiculous figurehead position

3290
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:38,090
that I think we need to stop.
We need to stop pretending that we have

3291
02:37:38,091 --> 02:37:39,860
a king.
We need to stop.

3292
02:37:40,010 --> 02:37:43,370
We need to figure out a way to have an
effective form of government with a

3293
02:37:43,371 --> 02:37:46,370
giant group of really intelligent people
that vote on it.

3294
02:37:46,371 --> 02:37:50,090
People that have proven to be
intelligent and objective and well

3295
02:37:50,091 --> 02:37:55,091
educated and have a reasonable reason to
response to all these different various

3296
02:37:55,520 --> 02:38:00,520
the parliamentary system of the US,
Canada or Britain would probably be more

3297
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:04,640
akin to what you're talking about maybe,
but you still have trudeau.

3298
02:38:04,641 --> 02:38:06,770
I mean you still have a figurehead,
you still have a one.

3299
02:38:07,660 --> 02:38:11,270
Figurehead is a bad idea and I think
it's a bad idea because I think that

3300
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:15,380
this hope and this idea that we need a
king,

3301
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:17,810
we need a a number one primate.

3302
02:38:17,890 --> 02:38:21,560
I mean that's really what it is.
It's these are like chimpanzee hierarchy

3303
02:38:21,561 --> 02:38:25,460
systems that have existed for thousands
and millions of years,

3304
02:38:25,461 --> 02:38:28,910
but you don't think that humans succumb
to the same dominance hierarchies.

3305
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:32,720
I just don't think we need it anymore.
So I think we're moving towards this

3306
02:38:32,721 --> 02:38:36,560
idea of a global community moving
towards this idea of a,

3307
02:38:36,561 --> 02:38:41,561
of a world with the boundaries that we
have had in the past oftentimes have

3308
02:38:43,101 --> 02:38:46,280
been because we try to stay safe.
We try to establish borders.

3309
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:49,520
We want to stay safe.
I want to keep people together and to

3310
02:38:49,521 --> 02:38:51,320
keep all the outsiders out.
We need a king.

3311
02:38:51,790 --> 02:38:53,450
We need a king to king,
to the guard.

3312
02:38:53,451 --> 02:38:54,920
The border is a king to lead us into
war.

3313
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:59,390
I just think that's less and less
relevant today and that it's more and

3314
02:38:59,391 --> 02:39:03,710
more relevant to have a large group of
very informed people that can help a

3315
02:39:03,711 --> 02:39:06,770
large group of people that are
collectively calling themselves a

3316
02:39:06,771 --> 02:39:07,604
country.

3317
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:10,490
Plato talks about philosopher kicks,
right?

3318
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:14,810
He talks about that.
Those who should lead should be the wise

3319
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:17,510
philosophers and assuming you sort of an
amalgamation of those guys,

3320
02:39:17,511 --> 02:39:19,030
be the Godfather.
Maybe they,

3321
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:20,730
you were born in another country.
You're fighting,

3322
02:39:20,750 --> 02:39:22,060
but you're changing the constitution for
me.

3323
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:26,060
Ah,
we tried for Arnold Schwarzenegger until

3324
02:39:26,061 --> 02:39:27,270
he got popped.
Right.

3325
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:32,360
But what's the deal with him now doing
those video game commercials?

3326
02:39:32,361 --> 02:39:34,010
I mean,
does it not seem goodness,

3327
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:36,890
scratch paper,
I'm going to pay for that divorce.

3328
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:37,753
A lot of money.
I bought it.

3329
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:40,010
I mean he's doing movies,
doing a lot of different things.

3330
02:39:40,011 --> 02:39:42,680
So I probably came to him with a big
deal and you know,

3331
02:39:42,681 --> 02:39:44,440
it's a funny commercial and they're all
attacking.

3332
02:39:44,441 --> 02:39:46,230
I'm trying to get an iphone.
Yeah.

3333
02:39:46,570 --> 02:39:47,720
Fuck.
It doesn't bother me.

3334
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:48,860
It's a bother,
you know.

3335
02:39:48,861 --> 02:39:51,020
But I mean it seems like for former
governor.

3336
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:53,840
Yeah,
I mean maybe it's governor anymore.

3337
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:54,440
Yeah.
Okay.

3338
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:55,400
Fair enough.
Yeah.

3339
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:57,860
But I don't spend too much time thinking
about it.

3340
02:39:58,700 --> 02:40:00,860
I mean,
it would be weird if push started doing

3341
02:40:00,861 --> 02:40:03,180
one of those Bush.
The president what it.

3342
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:04,100
Yeah.
The current guy,

3343
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:05,270
you know,
the,

3344
02:40:05,271 --> 02:40:08,120
the former president,
President George W started doing a

3345
02:40:08,121 --> 02:40:11,180
commercial for a video game where he's
running away from a bunch of assassins

3346
02:40:11,190 --> 02:40:13,980
are trying to steal his phone.
It would get really weird.

3347
02:40:13,981 --> 02:40:14,814
Right.
You know,

3348
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:19,740
or if Obama left office and started
doing commercials for Shit,

3349
02:40:19,890 --> 02:40:22,110
you know,
I mean is there a law against that?

3350
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:27,570
If a black president doing commercials,
like a former president,

3351
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:29,640
like representing Pepsi Cola or
something like that.

3352
02:40:29,641 --> 02:40:32,010
And I suspect not.
What would be the law and would fall

3353
02:40:32,011 --> 02:40:33,750
under what rubric?
I don't know.

3354
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:35,190
I just.
You never seen it?

3355
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:37,800
No wonder why a violation,
if you like,

3356
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:40,170
in quotes of the presidential office.

3357
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:40,831
Right?
Well,

3358
02:40:40,831 --> 02:40:45,510
I think one thing that would hinder them
is the financial reward of being a

3359
02:40:45,511 --> 02:40:48,330
president is really about those gigantic
speeches that they give.

3360
02:40:48,980 --> 02:40:50,190
You know,
Hillary Clinton.

3361
02:40:50,191 --> 02:40:53,070
Here's,
here's a fucking a crazy one.

3362
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:58,820
Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have
made hundreds of millions of dollars in

3363
02:41:00,391 --> 02:41:04,620
speeches.
They gave their daughter a $3,000,000

3364
02:41:04,621 --> 02:41:07,880
wedding party,
$3,000,000.

3365
02:41:08,510 --> 02:41:10,580
The masses,
they're just like you and me will.

3366
02:41:10,581 --> 02:41:15,570
This just should show you how insanely
fucked up political system in this

3367
02:41:15,571 --> 02:41:17,490
country,
and that's why a president,

3368
02:41:17,491 --> 02:41:22,170
it would actually be a negative to them
if they had any mark on their record

3369
02:41:22,171 --> 02:41:24,300
like doing a pepsi commercial,
I can.

3370
02:41:24,490 --> 02:41:28,140
Whatever Pepsi would pay them,
it wouldn't be enough because like a guy

3371
02:41:28,141 --> 02:41:32,010
like Bill Clinton,
he makes unfucking believable amounts of

3372
02:41:32,011 --> 02:41:36,090
money and he was at least a partially
disgraced president,

3373
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:40,200
but it doesn't matter.
It's still didn't harm his financial.

3374
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:43,470
The financial possibilities.
Do you think it'll ever be the case

3375
02:41:43,471 --> 02:41:47,280
where a sitting US president can claim
to be an atheist?

3376
02:41:49,050 --> 02:41:53,550
I think an agnostic is more likely than
an actual atheist in the atheist is

3377
02:41:53,551 --> 02:41:55,410
someone who says,
I don't believe in God.

3378
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:56,273
No,
God,

3379
02:41:56,450 --> 02:41:58,290
no.
I think more likely someone that could

3380
02:41:58,291 --> 02:41:59,860
say,
I don't know about you know,

3381
02:41:59,910 --> 02:42:04,910
or someone who is.
Is there anybody that chooses to engage

3382
02:42:06,511 --> 02:42:10,080
in a bunch of different traditional
practices of worship but doesn't

3383
02:42:10,081 --> 02:42:13,010
necessarily believe in the God has as a
politician,

3384
02:42:13,300 --> 02:42:17,490
someone who tries to go into a Jewish
synagogue and then one day and then do

3385
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:21,900
all these trades when it's campaigning
season I put do they wear the garb and

3386
02:42:21,901 --> 02:42:23,310
do cert,
the service,

3387
02:42:23,390 --> 02:42:26,190
so I could send you a photo.
Ether police pulled them up.

3388
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:29,880
There's a bunch of photos of Justin
Trudeau being able to.

3389
02:42:30,130 --> 02:42:35,130
I'm done with that guy too to show he's.
He's in every extremist mosque in

3390
02:42:35,851 --> 02:42:39,150
Canada.
Prostrating himself as a,

3391
02:42:39,151 --> 02:42:42,160
as a,
as a sort of a Muslim that.

3392
02:42:42,170 --> 02:42:45,140
Did he do that to get into the office a
lot?

3393
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:47,700
What else would he have done then?
Once he's in office,

3394
02:42:47,701 --> 02:42:50,610
then how does he behave?
I'm not sure.

3395
02:42:50,611 --> 02:42:52,230
It's only been 100 days,
so we'll have to.

3396
02:42:52,300 --> 02:42:54,090
I reserved judgment,
but uh,

3397
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:55,950
I'm not sure that I liked that very
much.

3398
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:57,180
Yeah.
Well,

3399
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:02,960
it's problematic when you support any
ideologies that really just don't make

3400
02:43:03,661 --> 02:43:04,494
sense.
Yeah.

3401
02:43:04,650 --> 02:43:09,150
And that's,
we're not talking about like meditation

3402
02:43:09,151 --> 02:43:11,920
or anything else where you're talking
about like really strict guidelines for

3403
02:43:11,921 --> 02:43:14,200
living and they don't make sense and
they're,

3404
02:43:14,201 --> 02:43:16,240
they're ancient,
you know,

3405
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:19,960
in a lot of ways.
Those places where those guidelines were

3406
02:43:19,961 --> 02:43:23,200
established.
Where was the cradle of civilization

3407
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:27,880
where civilization first emanate in
first took off and I have this sort of

3408
02:43:27,910 --> 02:43:29,860
joke that I never,
I never really figured out how to do it

3409
02:43:29,861 --> 02:43:32,290
on stage,
but that essentially the Middle East is

3410
02:43:32,291 --> 02:43:33,970
like the townies of the world.

3411
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:35,480
Do you know what a townie?
Yes.

3412
02:43:35,510 --> 02:43:36,640
Actually,
last time we were on,

3413
02:43:36,650 --> 02:43:38,230
I didn't know that that terminal west.
Yeah.

3414
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:38,620
Yeah,
exactly.

3415
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:42,070
We talked about it last time.
It's just like think that patterns are

3416
02:43:42,071 --> 02:43:46,030
intensely hard to break and it's one of
the reasons why the United States is the

3417
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:51,031
most as far as like artistically one of
the most diverse places in the world and

3418
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:54,250
as far as our ability to express
ourselves in film,

3419
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:57,370
in music,
in standup comedy and things along those

3420
02:43:57,371 --> 02:44:01,420
lines and even in podcasting,
it's the most diverse and the most

3421
02:44:01,421 --> 02:44:05,830
potent and it's because we're the people
that escaped exactly all the other

3422
02:44:05,831 --> 02:44:06,730
spots.
You know,

3423
02:44:06,731 --> 02:44:09,400
my,
my grandparents came from Italy and

3424
02:44:09,401 --> 02:44:13,390
Ireland and they all came over on a boat
when they were young and they

3425
02:44:13,391 --> 02:44:16,600
established themselves in the east coast
and that's where my parents were born

3426
02:44:16,601 --> 02:44:20,050
and that's where I was born and it's,
these are just like cup second,

3427
02:44:20,051 --> 02:44:23,260
third generation immigrants that we're
trying to get the fuck away from the

3428
02:44:23,261 --> 02:44:27,030
horrors of Europe and they tried to find
a new place with new opportunity and the

3429
02:44:27,031 --> 02:44:27,580
escape.

3430
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:30,970
The tradition of the past and the
tradition of this new place was

3431
02:44:30,971 --> 02:44:32,170
different.
It was different.

3432
02:44:32,171 --> 02:44:34,480
It was more open,
it was more more.

3433
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:36,000
There was more hope.
There was,

3434
02:44:36,190 --> 02:44:37,850
there wasn't a caste system,
you know,

3435
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:40,570
like there is an England,
I mean there's like a very clear class

3436
02:44:40,571 --> 02:44:43,300
system that goes on in a lot of
countries throughout the world that has

3437
02:44:43,301 --> 02:44:46,570
existed back from the days when they had
kings.

3438
02:44:46,630 --> 02:44:49,630
By the way in Canada,
the Canadian government,

3439
02:44:49,631 --> 02:44:53,920
I can't remember exactly when,
specifically to avoid that caste system.

3440
02:44:53,921 --> 02:44:54,461
The,
the,

3441
02:44:54,461 --> 02:44:56,890
the royal caste system,
uh,

3442
02:44:56,920 --> 02:45:01,750
made it a law that Canadians can't be
knighted because any country that's

3443
02:45:01,751 --> 02:45:05,050
under the Commonwealth,
so you're Nigerian or you're Indian,

3444
02:45:05,051 --> 02:45:07,720
you could be knighted by the queen.
You become sir dame so on.

3445
02:45:08,050 --> 02:45:11,650
Canadians can't.
Precisely because the argument was that

3446
02:45:11,651 --> 02:45:16,480
the Canadian ethos is contrary to having
these hierarchical,

3447
02:45:16,481 --> 02:45:17,290
royal titles.

3448
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:19,570
So I could never be served godfather
good.

3449
02:45:19,660 --> 02:45:21,510
I liked that.
You don't want to be assertive.

3450
02:45:22,480 --> 02:45:27,480
I think there's real problems in a
established caste systems like that.

3451
02:45:29,261 --> 02:45:31,780
Real problems that are intensely hard to
break.

3452
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:36,400
And I think that the beauty of America
is that you can come here with nothing

3453
02:45:36,401 --> 02:45:40,390
and become somebody.
And the real lesson in that is not that

3454
02:45:40,391 --> 02:45:43,330
America is different.
It's really everybody is somebody being

3455
02:45:43,331 --> 02:45:46,510
held back by tradition and you're being
held back by these,

3456
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:49,600
these parameters and these,
these guidelines that are set in place

3457
02:45:49,810 --> 02:45:52,330
by people that had a very limited amount
of information to work with.

3458
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:54,040
They didn't,
they didn't understand the consequences

3459
02:45:54,041 --> 02:45:56,710
of these rules.
They didn't understand the consequences

3460
02:45:56,711 --> 02:45:59,440
of these,
these patterns of behavior that you're

3461
02:45:59,441 --> 02:46:03,280
forcing people to follow in.
And that's why America,

3462
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:06,400
you know,
in a lot of ways represents still like

3463
02:46:06,401 --> 02:46:09,860
the beacon of freedom to people.
I mean there's a lot of problems with

3464
02:46:09,861 --> 02:46:11,900
America,
huge amount of problems with America,

3465
02:46:11,990 --> 02:46:16,490
but that alone that it represents the
most recent of the big countries,

3466
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:20,300
the most recent of the nation.
And I don't know if it's coincidentally

3467
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:21,730
the big one,
right?

3468
02:46:21,790 --> 02:46:23,120
The super power.
I mean,

3469
02:46:23,121 --> 02:46:24,290
I don't know if that's a coincidence.

3470
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:26,530
Earlier we were talking about
friendships,

3471
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:29,560
so let me link that to some of the stuff
that you're talking about America.

3472
02:46:29,830 --> 02:46:34,830
So one of the arguments as to why
Americans seem to form more sort of

3473
02:46:36,221 --> 02:46:38,260
Ephemera,
transient friendships,

3474
02:46:38,290 --> 02:46:39,140
you know,
not as.

3475
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:40,840
I mean,
it might be a stereotype,

3476
02:46:40,841 --> 02:46:43,060
but I can tell you that when I was a
graduate student in the,

3477
02:46:43,150 --> 02:46:46,960
in the US,
all the non American students complained

3478
02:46:47,110 --> 02:46:49,360
that Americans are very quick to be
friendly with you,

3479
02:46:49,630 --> 02:46:52,000
but they don't form the same tight
bonds.

3480
02:46:52,001 --> 02:46:53,380
That's interesting.
I've never heard that before,

3481
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:55,840
but listen to the story.
So I thought about it and I thought,

3482
02:46:56,230 --> 02:46:58,810
well that can't be.
It can't be inherently that Americans

3483
02:46:58,811 --> 02:47:01,150
are more shallow.
So what might be some reasons,

3484
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:03,280
and so I actually talk about this,
not in this book,

3485
02:47:03,281 --> 02:47:08,281
but in an earlier book of mine,
2007 book that the fact that Americans

3486
02:47:08,710 --> 02:47:12,340
face greater geographic mobility today.

3487
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:16,730
I could be in Boston tomorrow.
I can be an la and socioeconomic

3488
02:47:16,750 --> 02:47:20,950
mobility.
The stratum that I was born into is not

3489
02:47:20,951 --> 02:47:25,240
necessarily the one that I might die in.
So because of these various forms of

3490
02:47:25,241 --> 02:47:29,530
mobility,
it creates a more transient,

3491
02:47:29,770 --> 02:47:33,340
a definition of friendship.
Not that Americans can form strong

3492
02:47:33,341 --> 02:47:37,120
bonds,
but there is a bit of a shallowness to

3493
02:47:37,150 --> 02:47:39,730
the original encounters because tomorrow
I might be somewhere else.

3494
02:47:40,030 --> 02:47:42,820
Whereas the guy who comes from Lebanon,
where,

3495
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:45,310
where he's born as,
where he's going to die,

3496
02:47:45,311 --> 02:47:49,420
where his word is,
as this contract is going to have a

3497
02:47:49,421 --> 02:47:54,421
different definition of friendship if
only because life is not as anonymous.

3498
02:47:54,551 --> 02:47:57,580
It's not as open to mobility as it would
be the case in say,

3499
02:47:57,620 --> 02:47:59,590
California.
That seems reasonable.

3500
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:01,270
It makes sense.
That makes sense.

3501
02:48:01,390 --> 02:48:01,841
You know,
I,

3502
02:48:01,841 --> 02:48:02,651
I think,
uh,

3503
02:48:02,651 --> 02:48:04,510
I probably saw you,
I saw you.

3504
02:48:04,511 --> 02:48:06,320
I saw you trying to poke a hole into it.

3505
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:08,450
Makes Sense.
Makes Sense.

3506
02:48:08,451 --> 02:48:13,451
I mean we are in a lot of ways.
I'm captive by the initial impulses of

3507
02:48:14,601 --> 02:48:17,630
the people who created us and the land
that they established,

3508
02:48:17,940 --> 02:48:19,690
you know,
in this place was established by people

3509
02:48:19,710 --> 02:48:20,390
that were,
were,

3510
02:48:20,390 --> 02:48:21,610
were so transient.
They,

3511
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:25,460
they got in a boat and they sailed away
before they had pictures.

3512
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:26,660
But you know,
I mean,

3513
02:48:26,690 --> 02:48:29,960
there wasn't even fucking pictures when
people came here in the 17 hundreds.

3514
02:48:29,961 --> 02:48:31,700
They had a draw things,
you know,

3515
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:34,610
you should look at this drawing.
This is what's waiting for you on the

3516
02:48:34,611 --> 02:48:36,590
other side of the ocean.
It's only going to take three months.

3517
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:38,780
Don't be a pussy and you're likely to
die.

3518
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:42,710
People don't want to get on a fucking
plane for 10 hours and go to England.

3519
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:43,580
Oh,
that's too far,

3520
02:48:43,870 --> 02:48:45,800
but people.
But that's a fucking dot.

3521
02:48:45,801 --> 02:48:48,270
Even a day.
You could wake up in,

3522
02:48:48,410 --> 02:48:50,000
in,
in Los Angeles,

3523
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:51,890
get on a plane.
You could have dinner in London.

3524
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:54,080
That's incredible.
That's insane.

3525
02:48:54,110 --> 02:48:55,580
Is it Louis?
Is it Louis Ck?

3526
02:48:55,581 --> 02:48:56,414
Is that how you pronounce it?

3527
02:48:56,960 --> 02:49:01,960
Is he the one who does the bit where he
says about how you know he's flying in a

3528
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:03,850
tube in the sky?
Yeah,

3529
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:07,120
the Wifi Joe.
Yeah.

3530
02:49:07,320 --> 02:49:08,010
Yeah.

3531
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,380
Well we.
It's all relative,

3532
02:49:10,381 --> 02:49:11,400
right?
What's,

3533
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:15,240
what's ridiculously easy to us in
comparison to our grandparents is going

3534
02:49:15,241 --> 02:49:18,420
to be a joke to our grandchildren who
could beat beam each other on the moon

3535
02:49:18,421 --> 02:49:21,080
anytime they want.
Let's just go to the base on Mars and

3536
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:23,760
your kid's going to go to Mars today.
Now there's going to fucking beam each

3537
02:49:23,761 --> 02:49:25,260
other up all over the galaxy.
I mean,

3538
02:49:25,261 --> 02:49:28,740
that's what we're.
We're dealing with a very strange and

3539
02:49:28,741 --> 02:49:31,350
ever changing world,
so very nice.

3540
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:33,210
Just a fucking bad ass podcasts,
brother.

3541
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:34,770
Man.
You already do.

3542
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:36,420
This is your thing,
man.

3543
02:49:36,670 --> 02:49:39,270
I,
I live a truly blessed life to know guys

3544
02:49:39,271 --> 02:49:41,820
like I do.
I know guys like using what makes this

3545
02:49:41,821 --> 02:49:44,620
podcast so cool to be able to have
conversations with guys like you so

3546
02:49:44,621 --> 02:49:45,960
much.
This is your future,

3547
02:49:45,961 --> 02:49:46,980
man.
This is what it is.

3548
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:52,110
He's fucking stuffy classrooms with 20
fucking kids who barely pay attention.

3549
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:54,180
Who are judging you.
Fuck those people.

3550
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:56,040
Fuck.
Fuck them.

3551
02:49:56,050 --> 02:49:59,370
I don't listen to the universities.
Don't listen to him.

3552
02:49:59,371 --> 02:50:02,310
Don't hire him.
Let him make so much more money doing

3553
02:50:02,311 --> 02:50:03,110
this.
Anyway.

3554
