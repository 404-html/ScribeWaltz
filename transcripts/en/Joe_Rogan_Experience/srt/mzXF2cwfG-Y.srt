1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,850
And Creole.
They would say Dubai

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,940
ladies and gentle man.
Darren.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,010
I was wanting to do that
to do it man,

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,640
man.
And he brought,

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:18,030
look your friend Nathan [inaudible].
Both of you guys escape the winter of

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,800
Wisconsin,
which I'm representing right now.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,840
Hunting and my teaching and Yannis
Portelos.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,140
This is their company and my tank sent
me a code for people.

9
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:32,430
If you want to use this,
if you go to hunt to eat.com and I think

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,810
it's the code word is just Joe Rogan all
in one word.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,740
I'm going to find it one second.
And if you do that I think you get 10%

12
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,551
off.
Hold on one second.

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:46,050
I'll find that real quick dude.
Do A,

14
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,940
yeah.
Joe Rogan all caps,

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,620
10% off hunting and it's what is,
some of them are licensed plates.

16
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,870
This one's the Wisconsin one.
It's just a,

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,690
a circle shows the state,
a little deer in it.

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,820
Friends,
their company and um,

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,910
great guys,
man.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,870
The best people,
they worked for Steve Rinella,

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,250
meat eater and uh,
we know the well.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Doug [inaudible] of course is my friend
from Wisconsin and he brought his friend

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,840
Nathan and yeah,
and we're gonna talk about some stuff

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,400
and we'll just,
good to see.

25
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,240
Anyway,
but,

26
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,640
uh,
we're going to talk about this one thing

27
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,470
that came out today that I tweeted that,
uh,

28
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,740
they found that there's a huge
difference,

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,650
not just a little difference because
people have always wondered like,

30
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:31,260
does it matter if you buy grass fed
food?

31
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,360
Does it matter if you bought,
I mean,

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,630
what if it does it really matter?
Well,

33
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:37,500
it apparently it does.
There's a new study that found clear

34
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:41,100
differences between organic and non
organic meat and milk.

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,220
And this is the largest study of its
kind.

36
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,170
An international team of experts led by
new castle university in the UK is shown

37
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:53,171
that both organic milk and organic meat
contains around 50% more beneficial

38
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,290
omega three fatty acids than
conventionally pro,

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,450
uh,
produce products.

40
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,410
Which is pretty fascinating because a
lot of people have speculated that it's

41
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,780
all bs,
that you go and you buy grass fed this

42
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,580
or grass fed,
that it doesn't mean anything,

43
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,710
but it means a lot.

44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,850
Well,
you know what's interesting to me about

45
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:13,900
it is so much of it for me is intuitive.
Uh,

46
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,340
I grew up with cattle and it makes sense
that a,

47
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,960
a ruminant,
a cow,

48
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,140
uh,
it eats grass,

49
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:24,160
you know,
that's what it eats.

50
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:26,260
And you start putting all this other
stuff into it.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,940
For instance,
corn,

52
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,730
soybeans and that sort of thing.
That's not what they were made to eat.

53
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,190
Um,
and so then you take that a step further

54
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:36,010
and have it be,
I think they're referring in this

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,930
organic that they're talking about
grasping.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,610
Yes.
And so they're,

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,370
they're eating what they're supposed to
eat,

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,120
not what we somehow along the way
decided,

59
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:47,230
well,
this is what they're going to eat,

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,460
corn or soybeans because I'll put on
that fat that we all liked so much

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,660
speeds up the process.
Yeah,

62
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,690
it does.
It speeds up the maturing process of the

63
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:56,524
animal.

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,930
Uh,
but not who the good way.

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,030
Yeah.
So,

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,110
so many bad things.
Yeah.

67
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,400
It makes so much sense to me that,
uh,

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,750
from it just from a common sense level
that this is going to be the best thing

69
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,160
for the animal.
And then down in the way,

70
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,060
it's going to be the best thing for us.
We're not forcing stuff on that animal

71
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,210
that,
um,

72
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,650
that,
uh,

73
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,483
they wouldn't,
you know,

74
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,480
normally normally be eating and they are
going to eat it by choice.

75
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,640
But I will tell you if I,
uh,

76
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,520
the cows,
they're not the ones that I had when you

77
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,310
were out there.
But if I go out with the cattle that I

78
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,530
have now that I bought a about a year
ago,

79
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,100
I bang two buckets together and they
come running because they know the

80
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,740
food's coming well because they used to
be fed corn.

81
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,100
Oh,
so these are animals that you purchased?

82
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,680
Yeah,
but we're already at maturity.

83
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,611
Uh,
yeah,

84
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,860
they were bred cows.
So I was looking to get,

85
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,690
uh,
those,

86
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,520
those cattle that I had when you were
there that we had when you were there.

87
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,580
I sold,
we had a drought year and he prices went

88
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,060
through the roof and I had a,
uh,

89
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,630
had a barn and shed full of Hay,
which was pretty valuable and the cattle

90
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,250
were still pretty valuable,
so I,

91
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:07,540
salt was able to sell those.
And then take the winter off and spent

92
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,360
some time in Mexico and what not.
Cause if they might be a few cattle,

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,210
but uh,
and then,

94
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,540
uh,
decided to get back into the game.

95
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,720
So now I've got her to Herford so that I
bought last year.

96
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,540
I heard of what Herford what's a
herferd.

97
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,820
Her ferg is a,
it's a breed that I think originated in

98
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,470
Britain,
um,

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,380
and wait face red animal.

100
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,140
So a lot of the ones that we had when
you were there the last time,

101
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,290
we're actually a herferd cross.
Um,

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,030
so they were Herford originally or their
original brood cows were her fridge.

103
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,780
And if we bred them to like a black
anchor,

104
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,490
sir readying cause crossbred um,
to get some hybrid vigor out of him and

105
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:46,680
that sort of thing.
Or wait,

106
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,170
what is the difference?
What's the difference of between

107
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,750
different styles of cows are different
breeds of cows.

108
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,000
Wow.
Um,

109
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,470
everything from the,
how they put on weight to how they look

110
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,240
to,
um,

111
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,500
uh,
in the nation.

112
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,400
See Holly,
I'll put weight on,

113
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,070
um,
uh,

114
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,430
if they're dairy cattle,
um,

115
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,290
some of the like guernseys and jerseys.
And that sort of thing.

116
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,210
Uh,
they won't produce as much milk,

117
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:21,010
but it'll have a real high butter fat
content that's fascinating with the same

118
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:21,430
food.

119
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,260
So at the same feeding them the same
thing.

120
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,200
Different cows produce different butter
fats.

121
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,590
Yeah.
Uh,

122
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,650
so holsteins which is the,
the,

123
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,150
the sort of the traditional dairy cow,
big black and white thing.

124
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,650
You know,
you've seen him on everything.

125
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,390
Uh,
they're a big animal,

126
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,620
big boned,
you know,

127
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,120
a really tall,
big animal.

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,120
Um,
and they sort of have the ability to

129
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:46,150
kind of eat.
They're not as picky eater.

130
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,060
They produce a lot of milk,
but it will have a lower butterfat.

131
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,720
I can't believe I'm talking about dairy.
I mean,

132
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,890
I've been out of the dairy business
since 1988,

133
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,640
but,
uh,

134
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,040
what's fascinating stuff you'll have no,
I had no

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
idea.
The different cows will produce a

136
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,020
different level of dairy fat.

137
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,851
Oh,
no,

138
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:06,970
that's exactly right.
And then butterfat is what a farmers is

139
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,330
paid on.
So a hundred pounds,

140
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:12,820
which is,
who is about eight pounds to the gallon.

141
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,173
Um,
and,

142
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,120
and in milk,
you're paid by the pound.

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm 100 pounds of 3.5%.
Butterfat for instance,

144
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:25,060
is not worth as much as a 100 pounds of
4.5% butter fat.

145
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
So there's this whole calibration system
they used to do that.

146
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:28,931
So,
you know,

147
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,640
milk's being tested all the time,
both,

148
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,310
uh,
organic grass fed,

149
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,840
uh,
manage,

150
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:39,841
pasture raised and you know,
more modern if you will.

151
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,380
Um,
the uh,

152
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,170
confined animal
facilities where they're,

153
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,400
you know,
milk,

154
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,670
I don't know,
a thousand cows in a real small area,

155
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:55,390
are very confining them to a very small
area where,

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
uh,
nate and I both grew up,

157
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,920
uh,
and use our farm,

158
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,590
a lot of pasture fields,
that sort of thing.

159
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,860
So the catalog kind of walking around
doing their thing out on pasture,

160
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:07,160
they come in at,
in the evening,

161
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,290
you,
you'd feed them,

162
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,530
uh,
sort of a supplement of it might be

163
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,850
great or it might be,
hey,

164
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,440
you know,
it might be these various things.

165
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,440
And it kind of depended.
That all evolved over time.

166
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,360
Um,
and in my lifetime,

167
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,830
and you were always sort of aiming to
get the most out of each one of those

168
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:27,730
animals.
And depending on how you looked at the

169
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,200
science,
um,

170
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,000
you know,
people spent their whole life studying

171
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,490
how to get the most out of a cow.
Um,

172
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,440
depending on how you looked at that
science,

173
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,960
um,
you made decisions about that.

174
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,410
Well,
when I was a kid it was a lot more of,

175
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,110
and I mean a kid like in the 60s and the
early sixties,

176
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:45,820
there were a lot more common sense
involved.

177
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,900
Um,
and now it's much more like in those big

178
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,460
milking operations,
that sort of thing.

179
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,100
It's more science.
It's like,

180
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,630
Hey,
here's how we can get the most out of

181
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:56,270
them.

182
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,100
So you remember this shift between what
was like normal farming,

183
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,260
normal dairy farming,
normal meat,

184
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,550
cow farming to this thing that we're
seeing now that most people have a real

185
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:12,290
big problem with this factory farming
installations where you have these cows

186
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,040
jammed into these warehouses and
chickens and the same thing with pigs

187
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,650
and the thing,
those are the things that people have a

188
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:22,090
real issue with when they see them on
television and they see youtube videos.

189
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,540
You,
do you remember this shift?

190
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,573
Oh God.
Yeah.

191
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,950
Um,
so I was 57 years old.

192
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:31,030
I was born in 1959 by the time I was old
enough to drive tractor,

193
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:32,740
which was when you're about four years
old where I'm from,

194
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,180
you're driving to check their full out.
You're sitting there steering it anyway,

195
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:38,620
and you know,
going through the field and they're

196
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,060
popping in Wisconsin.
I was sick.

197
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,130
I was six when I,
when I jumped out.

198
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,350
You remember this?
Oh yeah.

199
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,360
And so when I was a kid,
um,

200
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,590
do you remember where we shot when we
had that shooting range set up by my

201
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,930
house,
that little kind of a,

202
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,970
it was an old foundation there that was
a chicken coop.

203
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,100
We had chickens there.
There was a greenery in between the

204
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,010
little building that we finally call the
keepout shed now because it's the

205
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:04,200
security,
there's just says keep out on the door.

206
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,940
Um,
that was,

207
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,450
uh,
a facility where we raised pigs and that

208
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:14,040
we had a rolling herd of about 40 milk
cows and they were holsteins.

209
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,860
And so it was a diverse farm was a
diversity ecosystem,

210
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,230
if you will.
And I dunno,

211
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,350
uh,
during the Nixon administration,

212
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,950
uh,
Earl Butz who was the secretary of

213
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,190
agriculture then came out and said,
get big or get out.

214
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,030
And that was really the beginning of the
end of the small

215
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,730
family farm.
What do you mean?

216
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:39,820
Like he said,
he said this like,

217
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,380
was it a statement on them?
It was the halogen or what?

218
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,500
How did this go down?
Uh,

219
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,040
okay.

220
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,200
Well I'm sure it can be found somewhere,
but,

221
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,700
uh,
get bigger get,

222
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,300
and that's just the,
uh,

223
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,730
it was like part of it.
Yeah,

224
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,370
it was a r a press conference or
something to that effect

225
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,540
that was going to be the move and
agriculture,

226
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,340
you know,
and it was a long process.

227
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,450
I mean,
I remember,

228
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,760
um,
our exit,

229
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,623
if you will,
from the,

230
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,780
the dairy sector.
Um,

231
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,350
ours came in the late nineties,
so there was a big shift,

232
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
you know,
if just for example,

233
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:18,500
my grandfather was running the farm in
1977 and then the milk price was like 14

234
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:23,501
or $15 per hundred weight when my dad
was forced to sell in,

235
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,200
I think it was 98 or 99,
it was like nine bucks,

236
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,960
you know,
so you're trying to raise a family and

237
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,750
continue a legacy and you're getting
paid dirt,

238
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,390
you know?
So what caused that shift?

239
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,770
Big Agriculture,
systematic,

240
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,780
you know,
as a systematic shift to the corporate

241
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,890
and there's some sense,

242
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,823
yeah,

243
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,930
I want to say there's some sense in it,
but that's probably not a completely,

244
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,970
I mean,
you understand that efficient getting,

245
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,521
you know,
it's,

246
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:53,830
it's the American way.
You get bigger,

247
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:57,190
you get A,
there's efficiencies in the in scale.

248
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,140
Hold on.
I'm trying to understand like what was

249
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,500
the motivation?
Was it that populations were booming

250
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,720
because there's a lot more people today?
Yeah.

251
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,200
I mean,
I think we looked at it up the other

252
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,150
day.
I think in the night in 1970 there was

253
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,190
something like 150 million people in
this country.

254
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,140
Now there's 300 million.
Yeah,

255
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,060
yeah.
That's not that long ago.

256
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,030
I mean that's in my lifetime and that's
crazy.

257
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,870
That's crazy that the population has
doubled and the demand for food

258
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:24,010
obviously doubled as well.

259
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,220
You know,
something that's really interesting if

260
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,560
you look at that area where you came out
and visited,

261
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,440
exact opposite has happened in
population there.

262
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,520
There's half as many people.

263
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,690
Well,
in our areas they were as there were

264
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,800
farm area and it's a farm area.
Um,

265
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,840
so the small farm,
the family farm is what's really

266
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,310
suffering because they,
it's so hard to make ends meet with

267
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:48,640
these gigantic operations that are just,
yeah.

268
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,670
Is that,

269
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,870
well they can,
you know,

270
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,950
I mean it makes sense,
you know,

271
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:54,010
on a,
on a business you

272
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,710
can afford to sell a product cheaper if
you're doing it bigger,

273
00:11:56,711 --> 00:12:00,490
but the things you lose there are the
quality and the,

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,270
the sustainability and environmental
impact of the process.

275
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,010
You know,
you've got these big farms.

276
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,690
We're basically,
they have,

277
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,060
they got make more product.
But they also make more shit,

278
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,490
you know,
and that's a water issue.

279
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,630
Um,

280
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,450
well that was a big part of that
documentary cowspiracy where they were

281
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:19,420
trying to talk about the methane that's
produced by cows,

282
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,050
the methane and just the,
just getting rid of the actual cow shit

283
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:25,600
itself,
like you're talking about massive,

284
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,120
massive quantities.
Well,

285
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,420
and when I was,
when I was younger,

286
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:32,570
and even now the manure that's producing
on our farm,

287
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:37,400
like now in the winter where I'm feeding
hay and they're confined would be kind

288
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:39,380
of a strong word.
They stay around where the Hay is,

289
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,060
you know,
and we've got fresh water,

290
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,340
therefore him and it's spring water and
I can talk about that later,

291
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:47,330
but they stay in that area.
Um,

292
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,760
and so that's where also where they're,
you know,

293
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,380
Shit.
And,

294
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,210
and uh,
and so I ended up piling that stuff up

295
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,280
and I pile it up and I composted and I
put it on everything from a community

296
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:01,790
garden nearby to our fields to,
um,

297
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,380
people want to come by and say,
hey man,

298
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,480
can I go and I look,
get a load of shit.

299
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,400
And I'm and sure as heck I,
you know,

300
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,840
I give it to him.
Whereas for them,

301
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,010
for a big facility,
it's where do we get rid of this shit?

302
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,953
Right,
right.

303
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,980
Yeah.
What I'm one of the reasons why I wanted

304
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,530
to talk to you about this is because I
think that,

305
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,960
um,
most of us that live,

306
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,300
when I say us,
like people that live in cities have

307
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
almost no idea of how all this stuff
works and when,

308
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,430
when people examine it or where they
tried to watch a documentary on it or

309
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,090
try to figure out like,
uh,

310
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,430
how,
how cows are raised.

311
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,660
W one of the things we get confused
about is stop playing with that same

312
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:45,370
answer we get confused about is how did
it happen?

313
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Like how did these things become these
gigantic sort of operations where it

314
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,630
seems so,
so inhumane?

315
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,780
Well,
it's,

316
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,651
it,
you know,

317
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:01,790
it is,
it's a business model.

318
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,440
This business model,
like corporations,

319
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,290
banks like everything,
it's the same.

320
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,870
It's the same idea,
interestingly to me in our area and,

321
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,930
and,
and neat.

322
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,630
And some of the folks that he knows her
example.

323
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,450
I know and I am to a lesser extent,
um,

324
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,920
because it's just a little bit different
on our farm.

325
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:21,050
It's not something where I'm trying to
make a living at it,

326
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,550
you know,
um,

327
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,670
that it's starting to go the other,
it very much has gone the other way.

328
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:28,160
Things like community supported
agriculture and those sort of things are

329
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:31,010
happening that people want to know their
farmer,

330
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,903
right?
So there's like a,

331
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,360
uh,
a blowback.

332
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,630
So people are realizing that there's
something kind of crazy about these

333
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:40,230
factory farming setups.
And so now they're trying to get their

334
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:44,700
meat more form organic farms.
But how much more expensive is it say

335
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:47,790
like one of your farms?
I sell bulk.

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,960
Any,
I consider bulk anything over 50 pounds

337
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,130
for six 50

338
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,920
upon.
So like a family could come to you and

339
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,080
by directly Oh yeah,
absolutely.

340
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,750
And do you,
do you sell most of your stuff directly

341
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,480
or do you sell it to like a wholesaler
or how does that work?

342
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,270
What I try to do is,
and my whole goal with my meat

343
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,070
production,
I mean we do a lot of other things we'll

344
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,740
maybe get into later,
but um,

345
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,810
the meat production,
I try to take care of a certain amount

346
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,810
of families,
you know,

347
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,610
and when they need meet I have it.
I'm not really,

348
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,650
I don't market it.
I mean it's all,

349
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,600
I have customers and they come to me
when they want meat.

350
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,270
So it's like a word of mouth type thing.
And some people buy a quarter you don't,

351
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,980
which is like a hundred to 150 pounds
sometimes.

352
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,110
And some people will come up by 20
pounds when they need it.

353
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,410
You know,
I have a buddy who is a fireman who does

354
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,510
that.
He has like a,

355
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,730
a deal with a local rancher and he buys
like the,

356
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,400
him and a couple of the families that
he's friends with,

357
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,010
they'll go in on like a side of beef.
They'll go in on like a whole half of

358
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,860
the cow.
And you know,

359
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,694
they,
they,

360
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,450
they save money that way and then they
know they're getting like real organic

361
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,110
grass fed cows.
Like would that nice yellow fat.

362
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,040
Yeah.

363
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
Yeah.
I have to tell you this story.

364
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,930
Um,
some years ago when we were raising

365
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:00,830
beef,
uh,

366
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,900
one of the things that I did for my,
uh,

367
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,520
my ex wife and I did for my brother and
sister in law was gave them a,

368
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,780
a quarter of a beef for Christmas.
And I thought it was being real clever.

369
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,820
You know,
the steers at that time kind of all had

370
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:16,700
the same name,
the Heifer calves,

371
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,650
the female calves.
I give them different names for

372
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,360
different numbers and everything cause
we keep them around.

373
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,520
But the steers all had the same name and
that was dinner

374
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,030
and a steer for people don't know cow
that has its balls removed,

375
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,930
the male male trial.
So unique and yeah.

376
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,290
Uh,
and there's a lot of,

377
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,090
there's a lot of good reasons for doing
that.

378
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,080
Um,
and just so nobody says,

379
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,600
so you're knocking this thing down and
cutting,

380
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,301
it's nuts.
Off,

381
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:41,661
well,
yeah,

382
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:43,460
this is what we're doing.
But when we knock it down,

383
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,100
we actually sedated.
It goes to sleep,

384
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,550
it wakes up and it's singing soprano.
I mean,

385
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,140
that's how that,
how that works.

386
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,570
Jerk a little bit though when you went
well,

387
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,210
yeah.
Were to imagine,

388
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,740
I don't care what you're sedated or not,
but,

389
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:01,260
um,

390
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,940
but uh,
and so yeah,

391
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:05,880
that is what is serious.
So I'm sorry,

392
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,290
the story was that,
uh,

393
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,280
so we gave a Sarah anarchies this
quarter of beef and um,

394
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,110
we're making a presentation of it and
they had,

395
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,831
uh,
the,

396
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:19,920
the neighbors over.
Uh,

397
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,690
and so everybody's sitting around the
table and there's a couple of girls,

398
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:27,480
young women maybe tend to,
and 14,

399
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,280
something like that.
I don't remember their exact ages,

400
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,820
but I had this polaroid picture of,
of that steer and said,

401
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,630
you know,
and I had it in quotations dinner and

402
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,190
made a presentation of,
well,

403
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:40,410
we gave you this meat and here's this
wonderful steak that we're having and

404
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:43,650
everything.
And here's the before and here's the

405
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:46,230
after.
Apparently I turned one of those girls

406
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,064
into a vegetarian.

407
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,980
All right.
And I felt

408
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,900
horrible about it.
Well,

409
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,790
you're,
you've been there from the beginning,

410
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,330
from the time you were really young.
You've been there from the,

411
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,960
I mean,
it's a part of your life,

412
00:17:59,230 --> 00:17:59,710
right?
You,

413
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,110
you've always been around cows.
You always been around cattle.

414
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,540
It seems totally normal to you.
But to somebody that just is used to go

415
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,490
to the supermarket and buying a steak
that comes neatly wrapped in Saran wrap

416
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:12,190
on a nice little foam tray,
Eh,

417
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,440
you're kind of freaking them out with
reality.

418
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,680
And I learned something that day about
it.

419
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,130
But some of the folks that buy meat for
me,

420
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,120
they come out and they take a look at
the place and you know,

421
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:25,721
I mean,
you've been there,

422
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:28,510
you've been there not maybe the nicest
time of the year because it was cold

423
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:29,560
and,
and all of that.

424
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,750
And the cattle were not in a pasture.
We had them confined in the barn yard.

425
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,620
Um,
and they're not walking around.

426
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,260
They're laying on the hillside there,
chewing their cud.

427
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,094
Man.
It's just,

428
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,150
they're just happy as they can be in.
And they're looking at me and they're

429
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,450
looking at the Catalan,
so I'm going to have some of that meat.

430
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,020
And it's just like,
there's that connection,

431
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:47,410
you know,
know,

432
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,680
if I don't get anything else across here
getting this conversation,

433
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:52,900
and I encourage people to know what
their farmer,

434
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,150
no,
the guy who's raised in that,

435
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,620
uh,
whatever it is,

436
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,050
because that's the bowls or meat or
whatever for him.

437
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,180
Well,
it's very difficult for someone who is

438
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:06,040
not used to the idea of an animal being
alive and then being dead and then cut

439
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,440
up and then portioned into steaks and
then cooking it.

440
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,030
People that are,
that are used to going to the

441
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:15,031
supermarket and buying it already done.
For them to be sort of a forced to look

442
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:22,021
at that whole process as an adult is,
it's a little disconcerting for a lot of

443
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:25,660
people because we're,
we're faced with is very convenient

444
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:30,580
world where we're completely detached
from any of this stuff now as a guy

445
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:34,120
who's been around it your whole life,
that's gotta be kind of frustrating when

446
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:37,570
you see the hypocrisy of people who eat
the meat,

447
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,790
but really kind of don't want to know
where it came from.

448
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,370
Yeah.
Hypocrisy is the only sin,

449
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
you know,
in my world.

450
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,480
It's kind of the way I feel about it.
Um,

451
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,590
but I don't know the other sets
necessarily.

452
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,890
That's the hypocrisy.
Hypocrisy as much as it's just ignorance

453
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,190
and,
um,

454
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,951
and I,
you know,

455
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,870
I also want to say I don't take it
lightly at all.

456
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,830
We load up a cow or a steer or whatever.
I put him on there,

457
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:04,620
man.
It's just like when we shoot wildlife,

458
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,580
you know,
we kill wildlife.

459
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:09,350
Something like that is we did a thing,
or you're doing a,

460
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,370
this is a big thing.
There's a reverence.

461
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,830
Reverence.
There is a river,

462
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,850
that's exactly the right word there a
reverence to it that you have in these

463
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:21,600
smaller situations.
I mean,

464
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:26,280
I could see where if I had 500 steers
and I'm raising the 1,250 pounds,

465
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,510
they might not have the same reverence
to those animals.

466
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,290
But they're giving me something and I,
you know,

467
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,150
I'm taking it from him,
but that's my deal.

468
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,620
You know?

469
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,460
Well,
that's similar.

470
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:37,370
There's similar argument when you're
talking about large populations of

471
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:40,520
people that there's sort of this,
it's a fusion of responsibility that

472
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:44,390
comes with interacting with 20 million
people versus 20 people.

473
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,520
When you're around 20 people,
you have a town of 20 people,

474
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,800
you know,
you know,

475
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,330
and the relationships are kind of
important,

476
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,750
whereas 20 million people you'd give the
finger to somebody on the road was the

477
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,420
idea.
You're,

478
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,050
you're never gonna see them again.
Yeah,

479
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,741
no.
Right,

480
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:59,170
right.
But if you're in Cazenovia and you see

481
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,730
that dickhead down the street from me
and it leaves the nasty voicemail

482
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,740
messages,
you'll never forget the fucking guys

483
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,840
crazy.
You played that for us because that was

484
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:14,380
seared into our head.
But you know that you are forced into a

485
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:17,560
relationship with that person and you
have to manage that relationship when

486
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:18,820
you have,
you know,

487
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,190
how many cows you have now.

488
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,340
Uh,
well I have 20 head run it.

489
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,230
Yeah.
So if you have 20 cows,

490
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:27,120
like what?
When you have to,

491
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:27,750
and even,
you know,

492
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,680
when you do the deed,
you're not,

493
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:31,230
you're,
you're really not saying I have to kill

494
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,810
this Catholic,
but you're saying when we load went up,

495
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,040
when we do the deed,
you know,

496
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,840
there's all these euphemisms for what
you're doing.

497
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,030
You're going to kill this cow.
It's like it's a,

498
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,230
maybe that's because of the fact that
there's so many of them or there,

499
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,200
but the rather,
there's so few of them that you have

500
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:46,830
this,
you know,

501
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,600
this is like a,
it's a big moment.

502
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,260
It is a big moment.
You know,

503
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:55,030
I sold a,
a cow this fall that I'm through no

504
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:57,760
fault of her own.
They had a prolapsed cervix.

505
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,650
And if you want to know what that is,
essentially her cervix pushed out.

506
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,710
And no matter how many times you push it
back in and sew things up,

507
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,300
she's going to continue to push.
So she's not going to be productive.

508
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,060
Um,
and her productivity is to have calves.

509
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,540
Um,
and I felt terrible about it.

510
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,660
Didn't mean I didn't do it.
I mean,

511
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,523
I know,
I knew.

512
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,150
Do it mean killer?
Well,

513
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,260
I didn't kill her,
but yeah,

514
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,490
I mean,
that's what the adults do it well.

515
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:24,910
Yeah,
yeah,

516
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,540
yeah.
And,

517
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,373
and,
um,

518
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,790
and I'm not,
uh,

519
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,280
I'm not
passing that responsibility off to

520
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:35,050
somebody else from the standpoint of,
well,

521
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,580
I don't want to do it.
So I have somebody else do it.

522
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,560
I'll do it when it needs to be done.
But when were neat and I both are

523
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,710
selling,
you're selling meat to people.

524
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,990
There's regulations that go along with
it.

525
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,090
I mean,
I can't just like drop a cow in the,

526
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,981
in the barn,
you know,

527
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:51,670
in the,
in the,

528
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,980
in the driveway of the barn,
hang her up,

529
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,080
cut her up and start selling.
Joe Rogan meet.

530
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,340
Um,
there's USDA inspection and all that.

531
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:03,970
So we both send our animals to very
small,

532
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
uh,
family run.

533
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,420
Uh,
slaughterhouses butcher shops and they,

534
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,300
so you don't necessarily kill them
yourself?

535
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:10,921
No,
no,

536
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:11,754
no,
no.

537
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,970
Never.
Oh,

538
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,310
you know,
if something,

539
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,220
if you were doing one for yourself.
Yup,

540
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,860
Yup.
Um,

541
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,930
and have,

542
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,460
so if you want to sell it then you have
to go through these and it has to be

543
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,990
yup.
And it has the stamp.

544
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,440
Yup.
Um,

545
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,290
yeah.
And,

546
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,060
and there's a,
you know,

547
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:30,380
a standard to that.
Now,

548
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,820
I would confidently never sell you any
of my beef if I butchered it myself,

549
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:38,990
but I would confidently give it to you
and say this,

550
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:39,771
it says,
I mean,

551
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,120
you've seen how we do it out there.

552
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,590
Basically it just government regulations
you have to fall.

553
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,100
Yeah.
But

554
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,840
I mean there's a standardization.
I'm all,

555
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,220
I'm done with that.
There's,

556
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,960
there's a pretty cool movement going on.
The place I go to is called driftless

557
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:57,020
meets and [inaudible] and it's a,
it's a really,

558
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,830
like when they bring in a cow,
like one of the big problems with these

559
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:00,830
slaughterhouses,
Joe,

560
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,540
is,
you know,

561
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,180
a lot of them,
you bring your cow in the night before

562
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,600
and there's,
who knows how many cows jammed into a

563
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:10,910
pen and they're stressed out.
They're running around bumping each

564
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,650
other.
These guys up there,

565
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,450
I think the Max they take in on a
slaughter day is four.

566
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,510
And so these cows got their own pen
there.

567
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,030
You know,
it's very stress free.

568
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,860
It's very relaxed,
you know,

569
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,940
so the process and then that's what's so
important about all of this and the

570
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:29,210
sustainability and environmental impact.
It's all about the process.

571
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,270
You know,
it's fortunately there's a really strong

572
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:36,050
movement in that sector of the,
the processing is going on,

573
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,003
you know,

574
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,800
conscious carnivores is a place near us,
a facility near us.

575
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,620
And I just,
I think that's a very important way of

576
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:47,730
putting it.
Um,

577
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,250
you know,
the guys from a cowspiracy,

578
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:53,620
there was a lot I read wept with those
guys too.

579
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,700
Yeah,
that's

580
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,120
unfortunate.
About the exaggerations of some,

581
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,710
some of their claims.
Because I think that if they just stuck

582
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:05,970
with what's absolute and reality,
it's very disturbing that this

583
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,920
sustainability doesn't look good,
you know?

584
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:11,680
But what's,
what's interesting is here's some things

585
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,950
that you disagree with strongly.
It's one of the reasons why we got into

586
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,720
this conversation.
One thing,

587
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,540
the amount of acreage that it takes to
grow a cow.

588
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,490
I just raise a cow.
I did,

589
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,380
uh,
I,

590
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,370
I've been in looking at my own,
uh,

591
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,070
cattle one,
but and also spending some time with our

592
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,930
udw extension.
It's the egg people at the end through a

593
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:32,701
university,
you know,

594
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:37,701
Land Grant University 1.4,
1.4 to 14,

595
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,370
depending on how,
that's a big difference.

596
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,590
And that's a huge difference.
Well,

597
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,580
1.4 to 58.
Yeah,

598
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,170
no one agrees with that places.
It probably is though going to have to

599
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:50,820
be like desert,
but wasn't that guy.

600
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,370
And why we raised was from Wisconsin was
from South Dakota.

601
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,181
Didn't you tell me?
Yeah,

602
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:56,220
there was that.
He made a reference on this and you

603
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:56,761
know,
I'm not gonna,

604
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,290
I don't want to pick all their numbers
apart or,

605
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,070
and if not ranchers.
So I think what happens is someone told

606
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,020
him that that sounds great.
They went with it.

607
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,953
Yeah,
yeah.

608
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,730
You know,
and this is like,

609
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,320
look,
they made a great documentary,

610
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,070
but when you make a documentary,
you also have a great responsibility.

611
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,380
Like they have an agenda.
It's very clear,

612
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,800
their agenda is the promote veganism.
It's because they feel very strongly

613
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,240
about it.
Whether you agree with it or why you

614
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:19,800
don't agree with it,
that's their point of view.

615
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:23,100
That's what they're trying to get
through in this documentary is that if

616
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,870
you grow,
just grow vegetables and you live off

617
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:26,850
vegetables,
you don't need as many acres,

618
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,950
you could feed more people and it's a
healthier way to do it.

619
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,140
That's just their,
their perspective and their point of

620
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:32,070
view.
So they sort of,

621
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,650
they,
they lean towards that in a very strong

622
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:39,120
way while highlighting some irrefutable
facts that are very disturbing.

623
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,830
And that's,

624
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,050
that's the shame of it is because you
know,

625
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,010
they're environmentalist too.
You know,

626
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,060
that's,
that's obvious,

627
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,120
but you know,
it kind of put off the vibe that,

628
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,560
you know,
people like Doug and I aren't,

629
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,230
you know,
and that's the problem is as you look at

630
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,970
the big,
the big corporations that are,

631
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,480
you know,
feeding off of all this misinformation

632
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:59,100
really.
And the,

633
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,140
what do you mean by the big corporations
that are going well?

634
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,040
You talk about the,
you know,

635
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,050
the big farms you can talk about in any
industry,

636
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,340
you know,
um,

637
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,710
it's kind of a disjointed effort.
You know,

638
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,150
you've got these guys talking about
this,

639
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,530
you've got these guys talking about
this.

640
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,440
We're all concerned about the
environment,

641
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,230
you know,
but some of this stuff came off as an

642
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,120
attack on,
you know,

643
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,650
beef production,
cattle,

644
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,680
livestock production.
But we all agree on certain things.

645
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:26,310
I think if you really want to focus and
you want to make a change in the world,

646
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,130
find a way to work together.

647
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,290
Yeah,
but they're there.

648
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,600
Change is,
don't eat animals.

649
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,050
Oh,
I know.

650
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,760
Don't kill.
So we've got to compromise,

651
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,810
but they don't want to come.
They're not in the proper less problem.

652
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,170
There's there,
there's very strong connections between

653
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,880
veganism and religion and if you look at
a lot of their ideologies,

654
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,150
they're very similar and a lot of ways
to religious zealots,

655
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,270
like they have these ideas,
they want to promote them.

656
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,130
That and only that,
and this is,

657
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,480
this is the way they want to go about
it.

658
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,450
And you know some,
some of them say crazy shit.

659
00:27:58,451 --> 00:28:01,360
Like I've had these conversations with
people on twitter who this guy was

660
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,820
saying that human beings are not meant
to eat meat.

661
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,170
We're,
we're herbivores.

662
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,940
I'm like,
well that's just not fucking true.

663
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,240
Showing her teeth dog.
Well not only,

664
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,650
but forget about the canine teeth.
That's absolutely true.

665
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,450
But how about the fact that scientists
have done very clear studies on ancient

666
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:19,940
humans and the reason why we became
human in the first place is the

667
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:23,710
consumption of meat.
It literally changed the amount of brain

668
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:27,610
tissue we have.
And then hunting changed how crafty

669
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:30,890
people had to be.
It changed the innovation of,

670
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,250
of these lower primates,
these lower hominids.

671
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,690
They had to innovate,
they had to figure out tools.

672
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:38,410
He had to figure out weapons,
not just to defend themselves from

673
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:40,270
humans,
but in order to hunt animals.

674
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,290
This is a,
this is an irrefutable facts,

675
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,110
essential part of evolution.
It is.

676
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,750
It's so there.
I think if I could speak for them,

677
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:50,950
if I would play the devil's advocate,
their point of view is now we have

678
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:53,920
evolved to a point where we don't need
to do this anymore.

679
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:56,140
We don't need meat anymore.
We're very intelligent.

680
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,060
We are also aware,
we're also faced with this overwhelming

681
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,360
amount of evidence,
this over whelming amount of information

682
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,740
that we have now because of the
Internet,

683
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,260
because of her access to it,
but we've never had before.

684
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,560
So you can look at some of the
statistics and some of the things they

685
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:13,480
brought up and you could say,
well,

686
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,870
this is their argument for promoting a
Vegan lifestyle.

687
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,730
I see.
I can go with that.

688
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,540
It's what,
what the problem is that a lot of these

689
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:23,400
guys,
they,

690
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,560
they say things like,
human beings can't process meet.

691
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:30,070
Or we had this guy that robb wolf was
arguing on twitter who said,

692
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,110
uh,
animal fat is toxic.

693
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,610
Well,
what the fuck are you talking about?

694
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:34,910
How To inuits live?
Yeah.

695
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
How would the how they've been around
forever.

696
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:40,480
They just eat nothing but fat.
These fucking people and if you look at

697
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:41,980
their diet,
you look at what their,

698
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,180
their,
their diseases.

699
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,320
The only fucking inuits that are getting
cancer.

700
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,950
The ones that are smoking cigarettes.
That's true.

701
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,570
Nasty fucking western habit that we
passed up to these poor people.

702
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,510
That's how they're getting cancer.
And you're getting cancer in in higher

703
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:58,060
numbers than they ever have before
because they weren't getting it before

704
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:58,900
at all.
Right.

705
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,250
Cause people were eating blubber and fat
and seals and whatever fish they could

706
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:06,100
get and I can't grow a goddamn single
vegetable and they weren't getting

707
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:06,720
cancer.

708
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,010
The cancer thing,
that's a,

709
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:12,080
that's a great issue because recently,
I don't know if you've caught the whole

710
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,180
red meat and cancer thing and they,
they came out and they said,

711
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:19,040
you know definitely your smoked meats
and you're cured meats.

712
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,940
Like our meats aren't cured.
You know what you mean by cured?

713
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,630
Let's say you're talking about,
we talking about like sodium nitrite.

714
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,650
Yeah.
When you make bacon,

715
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,220
like if you took a package of my bacon
and looked at the label,

716
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,380
I think there's three or four
ingredients in mind.

717
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,100
You look at,
uh,

718
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,210
what it like,
what are those ingredients?

719
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,670
Water,
pork,

720
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,110
you know,
uh,

721
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,060
and uh,
it's like celery,

722
00:30:39,061 --> 00:30:40,230
salt,
you know,

723
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,760
which is how it should be.
Yeah.

724
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,460
So problem is your bacon.
If you sat on a shelf,

725
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:46,230
Nascar,
Oscar Meyer Bacon,

726
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,870
if you put them both on the same shelf
and sat for a week,

727
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,050
Oscar Meyer will look the same.
Years would start to fall apart.

728
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,520
Mine would need to be frozen.
Yeah.

729
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,040
You know,
that's the only thing fucking normal,

730
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,560
right?
Like why do we think it's just going to

731
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:59,610
sit around

732
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,840
and not fall apart at 39 degrees or
whatever your refrigerator is.

733
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,270
It's not going to,
that's not how it goes.

734
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,000
Then the,
so the cancer thing and that,

735
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,940
and I get done,
you know,

736
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:10,350
I mean,
that stuff was probably is linked to

737
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,870
cancer,
but they've pulled back on the red meat

738
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,730
in general.
They're not sure about it.

739
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,180
But the thing is,
and I think the study is skewed because

740
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,480
you talk about cancer and Ph.
Okay.

741
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,990
You know,
grass fed beef has a neutral Ph,

742
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
corn fed,
grain fed beef,

743
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:31,380
that Ph goes up and,
and we know that cancer thrives in an

744
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,870
acidic environment environment.
You know,

745
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:36,870
and you know,
there's other things that the cows that

746
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:40,470
have a high acid guts basically is what
it is.

747
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,900
They're more prone to acidosis,
which,

748
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,360
which needs more medication.
You need antibiotics.

749
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,770
Um,
and it's also a prime harbor for e coli.

750
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,023
The,
uh,

751
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,541
I'll,
I'll,

752
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,560
I'll find a stat for you,
but the Ecole I,

753
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,920
it's,
I think it was 6 million,

754
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:58,030
300,000,
um,

755
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,800
milligrams per,
I'll look that up.

756
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:03,330
I'll,
I'll try back here and you guys talk.

757
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:04,440
I,
that's an important,

758
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,111
yeah,
yeah.

759
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:07,660
Go ahead and look that up.
But that's a very important point I

760
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,130
think you're making about,
um,

761
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,400
about how these animals that are
unhealthy,

762
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:14,620
it's kind of unhealthy to eat an
unhealthy animal.

763
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,700
That seems logical.
That is one of the points that I found

764
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:22,810
really interesting about about the,
the documentary was how these guys spoke

765
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,850
about,
um,

766
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,240
cattle aren't intended to eat and I
couldn't agree with Martin and corn.

767
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,270
It's corn and soybeans can agree with
the more.

768
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,250
That's why mine eat grass right now.
They're eating here's taste very

769
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,180
different.
By the way,

770
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,970
you know,
you gave me a couple of rib eyes last

771
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:41,420
time I took it home.
They were damn delicious and lean and a

772
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:44,840
nice dark red meat.
And that's how account supposed to be

773
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:49,010
when you get these cows that when you
get beef from a store,

774
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,310
you're getting this really light red
meat.

775
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,410
It's very light,
almost like a pinkish meat.

776
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,440
And you compare that to like,
like someone,

777
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,720
one of the elk steaks,
I haven't back those elk steaks or like

778
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:03,080
a red like got dark,
almost like a purple,

779
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,660
you know,
it's just fucking overflowing with

780
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:08,030
testosterone and,
and you know,

781
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:10,850
and an outcome or whatever the hell they
got in about us.

782
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,130
I mean,
that's a healthy animal.

783
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,280
That's exactly right.
And that animal is choosing to eat.

784
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,620
Uh,
an elk is choosing,

785
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,980
well,
it's obviously a product of his

786
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,780
environment,
so it's eating what's available.

787
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,820
Just like a white tail deer is,
I remember when,

788
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,580
uh,
when you and Brian were out and,

789
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:28,420
uh,
I think Brian held up one of the back

790
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:30,290
straps and he goes,
oh my God,

791
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:34,850
this is like Shashimi grade.
Oh my God.

792
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,820
And we cook that on your kitchen.
Oh my God.

793
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,960
We just butter salt and garlic and we,
we,

794
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,380
we grilled up some of those and we were
all eating them going good Lord.

795
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,620
And it was from an animal that you shot
what,

796
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,460
three hours ago?
Yeah.

797
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,600
I mean,
he's incredible.

798
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,740
Yeah.
To talk about fresh.

799
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,870
Oh my God.
I do have that counter.

800
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,100
It is.
Um,

801
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,740
remember he's my numbers

802
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,520
brought Nathan here to know the flight
information.

803
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,600
What's the hotel room?
What Time's the podcast?

804
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,120
You know,
this is fun dog,

805
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,620
but come on,
I've got a family bag.

806
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:10,160
Oh yeah.

807
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,540
Ah,
so this is,

808
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,880
now we're talking cells per gram of
meat.

809
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,511
Okay.
Okay.

810
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:18,380
So in your grain fed the count of
eco-line,

811
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,350
the grain fed in the count of e coli,
6 million,

812
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,440
300,000 cells per gram and the grass fed
20,000 holy Shit.

813
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,470
Holy Shit.
And it's all about the environment that

814
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,000
you're creating by what you're putting
into this thing.

815
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,700
It's unnatural.
That is unnatural.

816
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,460
That is crazy.
Crazy numbers.

817
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,930
Oh Wow.
And so

818
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,860
these guys and I,
you know what?

819
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,350
I'd love to have them come to the farm
and talk to me

820
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,260
and just,
I don't think they want to be around

821
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,180
your house of murder.
Decker jog during house of murder.

822
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,560
Oh,
well tell him,

823
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,950
take him out around thanksgiving.
Right around that one day.

824
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,480
And they could hear the fucking war
zone.

825
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,670
We grow veggies too where Doug lives
opening day.

826
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,050
You like in the morning when we were out
in there,

827
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,230
we were out in the the

828
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,210
blind and is soon as the sun starts
peeking up over the horizon,

829
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:17,610
you hear boom,
boom.

830
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,440
Here it off in the distance.
I'm like,

831
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:20,460
dude,
are we at war?

832
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,590
Why is there a picture of me that's
gross?

833
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,480
I got to sleep.
I don't know,

834
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,370
man.
I kinda like it.

835
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,860
Thank you very much.
Um,

836
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,170
I'm sharing a room with this guy.
Yeah.

837
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,213
The,
um,

838
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,220
that's,
that was a weird experience.

839
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:38,040
It was the first time I'd ever been a
place where like when I had

840
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,550
gone hunting before it,
before that time,

841
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:46,410
it had only been in the wild in Missouri
in the breaks where there's no people

842
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,730
when we were in your area in Cazenovia,
it's like everybody is so geared up for

843
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:54,280
it.
When we stopped at that sporting good

844
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:57,210
store and got tags and got,
got some equipment,

845
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,240
like everybody was rip rare,
raw and ready to go.

846
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,220
Like tomorrow is like the opening day of
a race.

847
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,600
It's weird.
A deer per second opening day in

848
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,720
Wisconsin is shot cheese here.
Curse sex.

849
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,340
Well that's a testament to how many
there are.

850
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,001
Well,
yeah.

851
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,880
We,
we read a statistic in about Minnesota

852
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,060
about how many car accidents or in
Minnesota was a Michigan,

853
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,090
Michigan,
Michigan has 100,000 car accidents a

854
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,860
year.
It's from people hitting deer.

855
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,250
Just stop for a second,
ladies and gentlemen.

856
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,150
And you tell me you don't think they
need to kill some fucking deer.

857
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,360
There's 100,000 a year.
I'm pretty sure that's the number I

858
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:41,520
should probably like be careful if I
keep repeating it over and over a lot.

859
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:46,220
So there's always a lot
a year.

860
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,950
It was the number 50,000 I was so close.
80% of these crashes occur on two lane

861
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:58,260
roads between dusk and dawn,
50,000 what is the amount of uh,

862
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,930
animals that kill people?
Okay,

863
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,340
here the states,
2 million deer,

864
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,020
2 million deer in one fucking state.
How many people are in Michigan?

865
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,560
Maybe a million,
but not a whole lot more.

866
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,350
And I think in Wisconsin,
cattle out and other folks are dropping

867
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:18,184
by the day with them.

868
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,140
1.9 million.
Holy Shit.

869
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,380
That's insane.
So there are 20% dear.

870
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,850
So what that means is,
here's the reality.

871
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,170
You literally could feed that entire
state of the deer population.

872
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,330
That's real because one deer,
you fucking eat a deer from months and

873
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:40,280
one deer is going to make more than one
deer.

874
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,120
I think that is

875
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,050
a really interesting point and it kind
of goes along with it.

876
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:47,210
Some of my agreement with these guys,
uh,

877
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,960
we're not,
we're subsidizing the dollar meal or

878
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:51,711
whatever,
you know,

879
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:53,260
the dollar hamburger and,

880
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,560
and uh,
and that kind of like quick meet you

881
00:37:57,561 --> 00:37:59,750
drive through,
you get the Burger and off you go.

882
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,090
Um,
I'm not,

883
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,990
but I would advocate for is that I'm
okay with eating less meat.

884
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,930
Uh,
they had Michael Paul and he talked

885
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,850
about eating less meat based on the
numbers that they were using,

886
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:14,040
which I think was like,
it was,

887
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,760
I think it was 0.6 something I think is
what they said on the movie.

888
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,970
It's like a half a half a pound of meat
a day.

889
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,250
Well,
it was more than I was 0.6 something.

890
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:24,900
I don't know.
That's what,

891
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,970
that's what the average American eats
ever done.

892
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,380
Way more net balance that shit out.
You bring the average up.

893
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,380
Well,
you got to think about the guys.

894
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,100
You know,
we've

895
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,020
all seen these guys,
you know,

896
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,970
Charlie chicken fingers and slobber
mcgee,

897
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,290
you know,
eating fast food.

898
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,320
Everything is,
you've seen these guys eat right?

899
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,350
You're going to eat your finger dude.
One slow down

900
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,750
food,
man.

901
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,780
That's what we're,
that's what we're dealing with because

902
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,090
the real sickness isn't the,
that we're raising meat.

903
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,780
It's the demand,
you know,

904
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,660
so farmers are rising to meet that
demand and people aren't demanding good

905
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:03,160
meat.
They're demanding Shitty,

906
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,860
cheap meat that they can buy for 99
cents.

907
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,360
You know,

908
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,170
one of the things that these folks were
addressing in that documentary that w w

909
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:13,260
w w I think didn't get to the heart of
it all,

910
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,890
but the heart of it all really is the
amount of human beings.

911
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,770
The only reason why,
like if there was only,

912
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:22,350
if,
if Cazenovia was the world,

913
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,930
you wouldn't need a fucking factory
farm.

914
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,580
Sure it wasn't.
You wouldn't need it.

915
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,790
Cazenovia is essentially a sustainable
environment.

916
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,180
All you need is some solar power,
some windmills for electricity.

917
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,910
You got your own spring,
you got your water,

918
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:36,900
you can get from a,
well,

919
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,410
you got your cattle to graze that you
have more than enough food for you.

920
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,250
You could grow your own vegetables,
you can don't have in the winter,

921
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,920
you know,
or we don't.

922
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,850
You know what you want to last through
the winter and you're good,

923
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,470
but we have too many God damn people,

924
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,100
right?
Isn't that often comes down to people.

925
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:58,930
Keep fucking then that's fine.
I'm a fan of it.

926
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,720
Well I have three kids

927
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,340
so I should shut the fuck up because
I'm,

928
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:08,320
I'm obviously making more people than I
am.

929
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,570
Oh boys are,
they're all boys.

930
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,404
All girls.
Man.

931
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,590
My best friend Gatlin,
he's got five boys.

932
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,330
If five,
it's one thing to have five kids,

933
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,570
but to have them all be boys.
That's like you're talking to,

934
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,950
they're just going to shoot just all the
land and make more boys.

935
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,640
But the cool thing is in Doug and I were
talking about this and he mentioned

936
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,280
earlier,
like we're sitting here talking about

937
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:34,240
this really interesting stuff because we
don't want to come off on this podcast

938
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,870
is a bunch of,
you know,

939
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,920
knuckle dragging,
multiple bruiser [inaudible] not,

940
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,450
you're definitely not,
but we're,

941
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:41,830
we're talking about this,
be careful.

942
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,370
We're talking about all this stuff in
the middle of la where he got guy

943
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,680
dressed like spiderman and all these,
these women wearing,

944
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,371
you know,
well,

945
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:53,470
by the way,
that's why we're way out here in the

946
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:54,440
suburbs.
You know,

947
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,680
I don't want to be around that,
but sounded good.

948
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,280
Thank you for putting us down there and
go.

949
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,733
Yeah,
no,

950
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:01,840
no.
Yeah,

951
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,620
no,
that's perfect.

952
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,580
Well,
it's a good place to,

953
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,500
you know,
just to come here people watch.

954
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,430
But one thing we've been,
we've been talking about a lot of,

955
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,890
lot of awesome people and really digging
deeper into this,

956
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,400
but there's guys like doug can expand on
this more because he's read more of the

957
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:16,001
book.
But this guy,

958
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:18,690
Mark Sheppard and other guys,
I mean,

959
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,090
people contend that that we can raise
enough food sustainably.

960
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:24,360
But part of that equation is,
you know,

961
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,790
and that's what maybe we could unify
with these guys like guys from

962
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,350
conspiracy is,
you know,

963
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:31,810
let's not talk about ending meet.
That's an unachievable goal.

964
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,880
That's never going to happen.
Let's talk about educating people.

965
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:35,714
Say,
hey,

966
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,060
let's not eat quite so much so we can
sustain.

967
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,670
Just to play devil's advocate,
because a lot of these guys are there.

968
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,900
They love of animals,
they love animals or animal lovers.

969
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,410
They,
they,

970
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,590
they,
it's almost like that.

971
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,880
But they did,
they do it in a way where they don't

972
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:52,190
want animals to die.
They want those animals to dive all the

973
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:53,380
age only.
Um,

974
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,400
the,
the problem,

975
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,640
I think there's,
this is an ideology attached to veganism

976
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,360
where once they stop eating meat,
they want everybody else to stop to,

977
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,360
well,
you're talking about 95% of the world

978
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:07,610
that he to meet.
It's 95%.

979
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,520
Something crazy like that.
Please always check my numbers

980
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,080
off by 100% the day off to those guys.
Yeah.

981
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,430
But you know that why if,
if these guys,

982
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,580
this is to play devil's advocate,
if these guys can stop eating meat and

983
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:27,440
become vegans,
why can't the world,

984
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,080
and I think that's what a lot of people
were saying.

985
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,200
Well other things I would agree with
with them.

986
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,910
I have a garden.
Yes.

987
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,760
Grow some food on your balcony in the
city.

988
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,240
We have a couple of mutual friends who
are growing stuff on their balcony.

989
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,853
That's different.
Yeah.

990
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,000
Well I don't know.
One thing I noticed

991
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:51,620
was dudes hydroponic system on the roof.
Tile was empty robotic system or

992
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,010
homeless
picked up on.

993
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,120
It's kind of fucked up,
you know,

994
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,860
and we're not here to throw punches.
Right.

995
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:01,580
It could have started it and they set it
up by some plants and put them in there

996
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,440
for him.
It's one of my favorite stories is this

997
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:08,441
former FBI agents who were retired and
they were arrested because they were

998
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:12,740
growing hydroponic plants and vegetables
in their basement.

999
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,550
And you know,
the dea passes by houses and they scan

1000
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,470
these people bought hydroponic
equipment.

1001
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,950
When you buy hydroponic equipment,
they flag you and they follow you.

1002
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:26,951
It's so fucking insane that growing
vegetables has become a crime because so

1003
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:29,570
many people grow pot.
They assume that if you're growing a

1004
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:33,290
plant with some sort of a plant system,
that you must be going an illegal drug.

1005
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,740
So with no evidence whatsoever to
fucking former FBI agents,

1006
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,410
they break down their door,
guns a blazing,

1007
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,100
and they arrest these people and then
find out their fucking grown tomatoes.

1008
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,430
Yeah,
that's kind of a hot button deal going

1009
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:48,220
on in Reedsburg right now were my home
town.

1010
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,340
My Buddy Gatlin,
I already mentioned him,

1011
00:43:51,341 --> 00:43:54,940
but he's got a he on a whim.
I mean this dude is a,

1012
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,180
he's in a successful appraiser,
real estate appraiser,

1013
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,130
but he's always looking for that home
run,

1014
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,450
you know,
so he's making a living,

1015
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,180
but he's taken his cuts and so now his
latest venture,

1016
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:06,550
he took his whole tax return and just
turned,

1017
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:08,830
is this,
this building that he couldn't lease

1018
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,000
into a hydroponic wonderland and we'd
know,

1019
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,350
well,
when it comes legal,

1020
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,740
he's going to be ready to rock and roll
and he wants to do a cbd oil extraction.

1021
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,341
I mean,
you know,

1022
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:19,810
he's,
the government's going to have to that

1023
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:20,351
now.
Right.

1024
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,180
So,
but you get these people walking by and

1025
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,860
we got these purple lights and people
are,

1026
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,360
what are they growing in there?
You know,

1027
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,970
and everybody's,
and everybody thinks we're growing weed.

1028
00:44:27,971 --> 00:44:30,610
And it's like if we were growing weed,
the cops are at the door kicked down two

1029
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:31,740
weeks ago.
Just put a sign,

1030
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,100
we're not

1031
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,970
grown weed.
Right.

1032
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,680
Fox,
get a sign off,

1033
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,620
sign it.
And it's called that.

1034
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,970
It's called girl lucky.
You can google it does,

1035
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,400
I think it's grow lucky.
greens.com it's all pretty new.

1036
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:45,260
But I would definitely assume that kind
of under the Wheaton Rocky Greens.

1037
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,240
Yeah.
How lucky can I get

1038
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,510
for an ounce of,
you're lucky shit.

1039
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:56,640
Let's talk about this downstairs.
Come to this special room,

1040
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:58,480
the of,
uh,

1041
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,450
of growing in a garden and people taking
responsibility for their food.

1042
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,480
Um,
you know,

1043
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:05,180
it's such a big deal in those,
uh,

1044
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,210
the fellows that you had in here.
Um,

1045
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,060
that's,
you know where I'm,

1046
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,260
I'm joined at the hip with them.

1047
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,450
Yeah.
I think we're all,

1048
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:15,330
we're all in agreement with that.
And there's a guy named Ron Finley that

1049
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:19,110
I had on before who was awesome and he's
a proponent of urban gardening.

1050
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:22,520
And what he does is he takes medians,
like you know that you just see grass

1051
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:26,100
and the bullshit in an la genius.
He grows plants in them,

1052
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,000
he grows vegetables and foods and he
does it in a abandoned lots.

1053
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,370
He'll,
he'll set up gardens and abandoned lots

1054
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:34,020
and he does it all throughout south
central.

1055
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:36,810
And he has people that live in these
communities growing their own food.

1056
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,210
And he had this amazing point that I
never considered before.

1057
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,520
He's like,
you drive down this street and you see

1058
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,320
bushes,
you see trees,

1059
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,500
you see all these plants and you can't
eat none of it.

1060
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,600
He goes,
we're wasting water on shit.

1061
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,980
We can't even eat.
He goes,

1062
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:53,160
you could have food growing in the same
places.

1063
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:56,460
You have all of these trees.
Why don't we do that?

1064
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,710
And I was sitting there going,
why don't we do that?

1065
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,470
I can talk about laws two longs.
Fuck yeah,

1066
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,540
right.
An orange tree looks great.

1067
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,640
Well,
that's exactly right.

1068
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,830
That's exactly right.
Aesthetically pleasing on top of it all

1069
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,260
this said you to get him some of these
pictures.

1070
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,540
This Guy Mark Sheppard,
who's from our area and he doesn't know

1071
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,220
me from the man in the moon,
but this is his book,

1072
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:17,860
rest restoration,
agriculture.

1073
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,710
A real world per permaculture for
uh,

1074
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,050
aerial photographs of his farm art and
it looks exactly,

1075
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:29,180
it looks like a landscape architect was
involved.

1076
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,880
Um,
layering of plants starting with the

1077
00:46:31,881 --> 00:46:34,730
tallest trees down to annual.
So eventually,

1078
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,550
um,
at the same time he's pastoring through

1079
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:38,620
there,
um,

1080
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,610
three and four different kinds of
animals.

1081
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,320
Um,
they're cleaning up the,

1082
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,630
the uh,
they're cleaning up the nuts that,

1083
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,693
uh,
they didn't,

1084
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,630
they didn't hard,
which is good enough.

1085
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,733
Clean.
You're nuts.

1086
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,670
That's bar none.
Molson pub.

1087
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,750
Unless you're in a weird shit.
Some people like dirty things.

1088
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,440
Three get minerals.
All right.

1089
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,590
I'm not buddy.
What was this is done.

1090
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,520
So check that out.
That's amazing.

1091
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,750
Cool.
That's gorgeous.

1092
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:08,950
And so this is a,
it says new forest farm Mark Sheppard

1093
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,830
permit culture.
What does it say the words abbreviated

1094
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:13,390
there?
Permacultural a pup pup.

1095
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,210
Hipaa apprenticeship program.
I think he does his classes and stuff.

1096
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,440
Oh,
that's cool.

1097
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,570
And the amount of food he can pull off
that Joe.

1098
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:20,141
And that's,
and,

1099
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,910
and they graze that then.
So,

1100
00:47:21,911 --> 00:47:26,620
and he talks about what you mean.
Cows graze that V and pigs and chickens.

1101
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,840
Um,
and Ras in,

1102
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,183
he says

1103
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,840
any,
and maybe doug can find this,

1104
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:34,480
but I've got it.
The amount of food he can grow on there.

1105
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,580
And he talks about just how many
vegetables he's like,

1106
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:39,250
but if you're only growing vegetables,
you're gonna have to mold this stuff.

1107
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,950
So it makes sense to it's,
and that's the whole thing.

1108
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:44,380
You've got to complete the loop.
You've got to complete the cycle.

1109
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,860
You got to close that loop and,
and find that he ecological harmony.

1110
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,240
That's the,
that's the whole thing.

1111
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,400
Two photos that go jamie,
don't go through those real quick right

1112
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,000
there.
Bam.

1113
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,610
Make that bigger.
Whoa.

1114
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,920
What's,
he's got a little ponds in there too.

1115
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,160
Yeah.
And so the cattle graze in the grass

1116
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,460
area and then in between the grass,
he's got trees that grow food.

1117
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,070
Wow,
that's beautiful too.

1118
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,020
And then he brings the pigs chickens
through and this is near you.

1119
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,060
Yeah,
viola or broke the real quick and go to

1120
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,980
it.
Now it's a big fucking ice skating rink.

1121
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,050
Frozen Tundra.
Yeah,

1122
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:19,140
let's go.
Let's go and change his point

1123
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,950
being that when we grow one crop on a
farm,

1124
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:24,330
field,
corn,

1125
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,880
soybeans,
organic or otherwise,

1126
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,740
or uh,
vegetables,

1127
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,490
that sort of thing,
that in our area in the winter,

1128
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:34,110
then that's a desert.
I mean,

1129
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,060
once the corner wants the beans come
off,

1130
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,200
that's what it is.
I mean,

1131
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:38,880
you saw it,
the deer come out into the field and

1132
00:48:38,881 --> 00:48:40,230
need a little bit of this stuff and you
know,

1133
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:40,971
and all that.
And guys,

1134
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:44,370
we'll pasture out on that.
But it really does become a,

1135
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,290
you know,
sort of that one trick pony,

1136
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:49,230
which to a certain degree vegetable
gardening we'll be as well,

1137
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:52,230
although you can rotate crops through.
Um,

1138
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,530
but like on my place,
we're growing livestock,

1139
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:57,480
we're enriching the soil.
We're,

1140
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,343
um,
we're,

1141
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,650
our pastor is getting better all the
time because we're not over pasturing in

1142
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:03,490
any particular place.
Um,

1143
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,810
there's carbon sequestering going on.
What's that mean?

1144
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,100
The carbon sequestering,

1145
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,390
the carbon in the soil.
So like I'm with composting and things

1146
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:14,230
on those lines.
Yeah,

1147
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,820
there's,
there's people can see on two out of the

1148
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:20,821
APP contend that that cattle and proper
management in the pasture rotation that

1149
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,240
they can start to turn back the,
the climate change,

1150
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,750
you know,
by sequestering the carbon starting to

1151
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:29,950
pull it,
pull it out.

1152
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,000
And we're,
when we till and you know,

1153
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,110
the constant tillage is that's,
that's one of the,

1154
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:35,891
you know,
that's a no,

1155
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:36,724
no,
you know,

1156
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,820
a lot of no tilling,
lot of rotational grazing.

1157
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:41,500
That's,
that's up and up.

1158
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,700
I mean,
that's where we need to be

1159
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,960
multiple benefits from one action.
So I'm pastoring and you saw some of the

1160
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:51,800
pastures,
some of the places where you hunted,

1161
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,520
it was pasturing or there's wildlife in
there and we've got good clean water.

1162
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,680
When we,
uh,

1163
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,530
went to a point on our farm where we
weren't over pasturing and it was just

1164
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:01,730
something that we,
you know,

1165
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,030
we sort of learned the stream's real
wide.

1166
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,070
Um,
when we were over pasturing,

1167
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,420
they were,
they were really wide.

1168
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,420
Uh,
the water was shallow and it was warm.

1169
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:16,280
No trout.
As time has gone by and we weren't over

1170
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:19,550
pasturing anymore of those streams
narrow up because it's running water

1171
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:22,100
that's going to cut that and those,
it starts to fill in.

1172
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:26,470
The grass starts to grow.
Now you stepped across a creek that used

1173
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,290
to have to walk [inaudible].
Um,

1174
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,210
so there's strout in there now.
Um,

1175
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:35,300
the catalog going in there,
they're eating a certain amount of the

1176
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:36,000
grass.

1177
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,850
Um,
we keep them,

1178
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,160
we keep moving them through a certain
amount of the grass or keeping some of

1179
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:45,320
the invasive species down.
A deer are still living in,

1180
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,240
their songbirds are still living there
at game.

1181
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:50,690
Birds are still living in there.
All of those things are happening and

1182
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,200
the uh,
plants themselves are pulling the CEO

1183
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:55,641
to,
you know,

1184
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,550
the whole photosynthetic process.
Pulling that out and putting it back

1185
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:02,780
into the ground where it belongs
to counteract some of that.

1186
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:05,240
So Gee,
I think I'm getting like three or four

1187
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:10,241
different positive results from having a
pasture know hickory orchard with some

1188
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:16,070
bigger trees and that sort of thing.
This dude with permaculture starts to

1189
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:19,940
add multiple other things,
layers of,

1190
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,250
so if you think about an acre of land,
like this table,

1191
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,180
and if you're growing one crop on it,
one vegetable crop,

1192
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,820
you've got an acre of land,
43,000,

1193
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:32,870
560 square feet of that particular
vegetable or that was groups of

1194
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:33,704
vegetables.

1195
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,040
But with the idea of permaculture,
you have your upper layers,

1196
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:40,580
trees,
big trees,

1197
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,370
big oak trees and uh,
uh,

1198
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,660
you know,
you might make of Hickory for hickory

1199
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:50,420
nuts and that sort of thing.
So short things and uh,

1200
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,150
well to begin with,
with the upper level,

1201
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,230
so on that same chunk of ground,
you've got this large tree,

1202
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,310
it's producing wood,
which is,

1203
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,240
looks like a good oak table here that
we're leaning on.

1204
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:03,320
You know,
it's the same sort of thing.

1205
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,840
The next layer is the smaller trees like
app,

1206
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,520
you know,
fruit trees and that sort of thing,

1207
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:10,240
below that,
below that or are shrubs that are going

1208
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:11,390
to be,
uh,

1209
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,860
uh,
you know,

1210
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,110
uh,
service Berry,

1211
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,550
um,
chokeberry Rania,

1212
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,550
um,
some of the,

1213
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,270
some of the,
uh,

1214
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,740
antioxidant producing fruits.
Um,

1215
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,910
and then you go down to the next layer,
which is going to be things like

1216
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,240
asparagus and rhubarb and keep coming
down.

1217
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,850
So now instead of just that one plane
of,

1218
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,940
of plants growing,
you've got it on that same acre,

1219
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:39,860
you've just grown multiple acres of food
and that is just something that needs to

1220
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:43,520
be thought about in the bigger thing.
He's then rotating through four

1221
00:52:43,521 --> 00:52:45,620
different kinds of animals,
running beef through it.

1222
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,560
Um,
and they're not in there all the time

1223
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:51,740
because,
so it takes management after beef,

1224
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:54,710
he's run and it's called a leader
follower grazing system.

1225
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,360
Um,
after beef,

1226
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:59,450
he's running pigs through it because
pigs are great cleanup animal.

1227
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,570
Um,
after that comes turkeys in Turkeys or

1228
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,770
cleaning up the grubs and whatnot in the
shit from the,

1229
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,180
from the cows and the pigs.
He run sheep in it.

1230
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,120
And last might be chickens.
So the intensity,

1231
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:18,080
the intensity of,
of management is incredible.

1232
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:19,880
And the amount of,
uh,

1233
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,310
layers of food that are coming off of
that.

1234
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,980
And then layers of acreage will suddenly
we're getting,

1235
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,730
you know,
and his scenario,

1236
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:28,290
I'm getting three or four benefits out
of it.

1237
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,390
He's still getting all that carbon
sequestering and all that.

1238
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,860
Um,
but now he's built that up to 10 or 12

1239
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:37,230
different positive results from the same
thing.

1240
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,570
And one of them is from a wildlife
perspective,

1241
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,700
which is one of the things that gets
talked about all the time.

1242
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,760
You grow up,
you have your garden at home,

1243
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,250
I garden at home.
What's the one thing that every garden

1244
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:52,251
that has wildlife around it has a fence.
If you're going to grow vegetables for a

1245
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,920
profit or for fun and put your effort
into it,

1246
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,570
you can put a half,
you didn't put a fence around it,

1247
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,400
you're going to exclude wildlife from
that.

1248
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,340
Exactly.
Well,

1249
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:03,850
and that's one of the main contingents
we had when we sat down and were like,

1250
00:54:03,851 --> 00:54:05,260
okay,
there's going to be tough.

1251
00:54:05,261 --> 00:54:09,370
These guys put forth a really good
narrative and had some really

1252
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,830
irrefutable facts.
But then one of the things we talked

1253
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,180
about,
the water talked about the acreage,

1254
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,790
but the wildlife thing,
one thing that they said was,

1255
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,660
and where these livestock or are living
that is,

1256
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:24,250
that is area of void of wildlife.
I mean I look at my pasture from the

1257
00:54:24,251 --> 00:54:28,090
soil microbes and worms to the bugs and
butterflies to the,

1258
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,580
you know,
field mice and moles and we've got hawks

1259
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,740
and we've,
I mean we'd see a badger and a Fox.

1260
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:34,900
I mean that's wildlife,
you know,

1261
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:35,734
it's a,
it had a very

1262
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,070
realistic point of view.
They didn't understand the wolves,

1263
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:39,800
they didn't understand the management
roles.

1264
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,260
They didn't understand that the reason
why they're starting to open up hunting

1265
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,320
seasons on,
well they also didn't know that Idaho is

1266
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,240
one of the most wildlife rich places in
the country where people go and hunt elk

1267
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:52,620
and mule deer.
I mean,

1268
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,280
Idaho is fucking filled with animals.
And they thought that Idaho is like,

1269
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,900
you know,
it's all farms now.

1270
00:54:57,901 --> 00:54:59,070
It's devoid of,
they just,

1271
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,320
it's an idealized sort of Hippie vegan
approach,

1272
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,041
which,
you know,

1273
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,990
they're just leaning towards that.
It doesn't matter.

1274
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,670
It doesn't mean they don't have great
points.

1275
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,920
Absolutely.
No,

1276
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:11,750
that's what we're saying.
It was a tough,

1277
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,800
it was a tough,
tough thing to do to come out and,

1278
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,610
and be a counterpoint for something that
you agree with a lot of

1279
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,570
what their main bone.
And I think a lot of people,

1280
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,000
I mean it's,
it's the factory farming thing.

1281
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,260
Well,
we're talking about here.

1282
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,290
I don't think it's sustainable for the
population of Los Angeles.

1283
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,060
And we'll,
you're talking about here with this kind

1284
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:34,470
of a farm man,
you would need a giant fucking farm like

1285
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:36,660
that to feed Los Angeles.

1286
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,760
Are a lot of them.
A lot of small,

1287
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:38,950
yeah,

1288
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,130
a lot of small,
low.

1289
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:45,131
But you would mean so many of them.
I don't know how much they produce in,

1290
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:50,690
if you compared in comparison to one of
these gigantic factory farms.

1291
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,700
Well,
and you know,

1292
00:55:52,701 --> 00:55:53,960
and I'm not,
I don't know,

1293
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,060
my number guy isn't going to have those
numbers.

1294
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,051
Well,
no one is,

1295
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:58,070
I mean,
and this is the thing,

1296
00:55:58,071 --> 00:56:00,020
you know,
we can keep going deeper and deeper with

1297
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:01,580
this because people can say,
well,

1298
00:56:01,581 --> 00:56:02,420
hey,
you know,

1299
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,130
it's sustainable and Cazenovia.
Okay,

1300
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:05,570
well,
is this sustainable in Wisconsin?

1301
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,910
Yes.
This is the sustainable on the entire

1302
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,360
eastern side of the country.
Not really.

1303
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:12,830
Okay,
well what about,

1304
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,610
what if we can get the United States of
standable,

1305
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:15,820
we'll still got India.
Well,

1306
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,663
we're,
we're fucked.

1307
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,601
You know,
I mean,

1308
00:56:17,601 --> 00:56:19,130
you've got a billion people living in a
place,

1309
00:56:19,131 --> 00:56:21,950
a third the size of the United States.
What do you do then?

1310
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,470
Those numbers be wrong.

1311
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,030
The big thing here is in the bigger
conversation,

1312
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:28,930
I think is,
is,

1313
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,040
and,
and that's something that,

1314
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,870
gosh,
people that care should really,

1315
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,760
you know,
she'll veganism and,

1316
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,450
and you know,
meeting,

1317
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:36,920
eating aside and just,
let's say,

1318
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:38,260
how do we,
how do we make this work?

1319
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,180
You know,
I think it's education.

1320
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:44,380
I think people need to,
to understand that you can't just go

1321
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:46,030
around eating,
eating meat.

1322
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,030
You know,
my Mama,

1323
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,210
you know,
Charlie's chicken fingers.

1324
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,310
You can't be doing that.
And you got to have a balanced diet and

1325
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:54,660
you can't be eating pounds of me today
off,

1326
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,270
you know,
you,

1327
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,840
you probably shouldn't overeat with.
And we all agree if you've read

1328
00:56:57,841 --> 00:56:59,550
anything,
but this is um,

1329
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,830
this is a different subject I think
we're talking about,

1330
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:06,030
we're talking about sustainability and
we're talking about feeding gigantic

1331
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:07,620
swaths of people.
Yeah.

1332
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,770
And that's what these factory farms have
set up.

1333
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,440
I mean,
through the method of collecting

1334
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:15,540
nitrogen from the oxygen,
I mean,

1335
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:18,180
what,
what from the air that the hopper method

1336
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:20,910
that they invented in like the early 19
hundreds.

1337
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,550
That's how they figured out how to
extract nitrogen.

1338
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:26,370
And because of that,
a gigantic population boom and sued.

1339
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:30,180
That's the reason why there's so many
people in the world today.

1340
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:34,410
This is widely accredited with the
hopper method of collecting nitrogen

1341
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,290
because before that it was really
difficult to fertilize soil.

1342
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:41,070
Once they figured out how to extract
nitrogen from the actual Ehr itself,

1343
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,540
things got a little easier to grow food
and the population boomed.

1344
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,730
And that's part of what we're dealing
with here.

1345
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,940
What we're dealing with here is kind of,
um,

1346
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,140
in,
you know,

1347
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,650
what we talk about wildlife,
we were talking about the 50,000 car

1348
00:57:55,651 --> 00:58:00,060
accidents that are in Michigan every
year alone because of the over abundance

1349
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,430
of deer.
This is sort of what we're talking about

1350
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:04,800
with human beings.
We have an over abundance of human

1351
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:05,634
beings.
Now,

1352
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:09,720
obviously I'm not suggesting we have
massive hunts on humans,

1353
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:13,680
so turning to herd the herd,
but we would,

1354
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:16,080
if we were some sort of an alien and we
looked at,

1355
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,850
okay look,
let's put it this way.

1356
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:23,420
If chimpanzees were overrunning Chicago,
like somehow or another chimpanzees like

1357
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,080
figured out how to get Chicago,
uh,

1358
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:32,190
they fucking swinging from tree to tree
and they moved in and started,

1359
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,590
it starts setting up shop and overriding
the place apart where people are getting

1360
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:38,940
in car accidents with chimps and uh,
would we kill them?

1361
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,390
That would be very tricky.
I don't think we would because chimps

1362
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:45,030
are way fucking smarter than beer and we
liked smart shit.

1363
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:48,300
So we wouldn't kill champs away.
We would kill deer.

1364
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,200
So people obviously are smarter than
most people are smarter than chimp.

1365
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,060
I know some people that probably aren't
smarter than chimps,

1366
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:57,720
but when it gets too intelligent
animals,

1367
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:00,330
that's when we get weird.
Like nobody gives a fuck if you kill a

1368
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:01,380
bug,
okay?

1369
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:05,910
If mosquitoes contained Zika virus and
malaria and all this different shit,

1370
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:09,240
you can kill mosquitoes all God damn day
long and for whatever reason,

1371
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:12,600
nobody gives a fuck about mosquitoes
because we've all agreed that mosquitoes

1372
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:13,680
are the enemy,
right?

1373
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,750
Mosquitoes contain malaria.
Malaria has killed.

1374
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:16,980
This is a number.
I know it was real.

1375
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,160
Malaria has killed 50% of all the people
that have died ever.

1376
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,890
How that,
wow.

1377
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,980
So you've had again,
50% of all the human beings that have

1378
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:27,860
died ever in the history of people have
died from malaria.

1379
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,230
How about them?
Map

1380
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,200
Real Shit is,
I've been fascinated with malaria for

1381
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:36,870
years.
So I've,

1382
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:40,220
I've read a lot of Shit on malaria and
I've had two friends that got malaria,

1383
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:42,770
including justin wren,
our friend who was in here recently who

1384
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,390
fights this weekend.
I'm Bella door.

1385
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,540
Good luck to my friend Justin.
He's the best.

1386
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,000
This guy is fucking him.
You want to talk about an amazing human

1387
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:50,830
being.
This guy,

1388
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,290
uh,
he gave up like years of his life to go

1389
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:57,680
to the Congo and dig wells for these
people.

1390
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:00,020
These pygmies in the Congo,
he's just the salt of the earth,

1391
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:03,530
like the nicest guy ever.
But he got malaria to is doing that and

1392
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:05,000
almost died.
Um,

1393
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,050
so nobody gives a fuck if you kill a
mosquito,

1394
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:08,230
which is my point,
you know,

1395
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:12,080
you could swap flies of vegans will swat
a fucking mosquito,

1396
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,011
right?
You know,

1397
01:00:13,011 --> 01:00:15,900
you look who please no mass day in jail.

1398
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,260
My blood.
It's the blood of a carried eater.

1399
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,460
No,
you fucking,

1400
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,350
he slapped that fucker down.
But there's,

1401
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,420
there's a certain level like,
okay,

1402
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:27,980
if a up an aunt is on your food,
a lot of times a Vegan will kill that

1403
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:29,420
ant.
And what do you do with the body?

1404
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,060
You throw it to the ground,
you'd ignore it cause it's little,

1405
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,090
but don't you don't,
you just fucking killed an aunt in my

1406
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,890
house.
And if you went like that and brushed it

1407
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:38,240
off,
I wouldn't say a word.

1408
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,550
I'd be like,
Doug's doing some acceptable behavior.

1409
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,670
He killed an aunt that's on his pants.
He dropped it on the ground.

1410
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,970
But if a mouse ran across my kitchen,
you stomped it and then ignored it.

1411
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:47,804
I be like,
Hey,

1412
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,310
what is this fucking job hair you've
left?

1413
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,280
Right.
There's a weird hierarchy of living

1414
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:57,920
things and the lion is clearly,
I mean,

1415
01:00:57,921 --> 01:00:59,660
one of the lines is fellow mammals.

1416
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,840
Yup.
Um,

1417
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,030
and you know,
I don't even know what to say about

1418
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,190
about that,
but uh,

1419
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,810
but not rats.
Fuck rats,

1420
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,880
rats of the black plague and all kinds
of,

1421
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,080
nobody gives a shit.
If you fucking kill a rat and your

1422
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:16,520
garage,
if you,

1423
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,740
if you're so hardcore,
you're not into killing rats.

1424
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,800
I've got a great rad story.
And your hairdresser,

1425
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:27,140
I was living in the hills and uh,
I rented this house and I had a real rat

1426
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:30,350
problem to the point where I'd hear him
banging around inside the rafters.

1427
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:34,040
There are big man like the hills around
Los Angeles.

1428
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,360
Los Angeles is a very strange place
because you have this city and then you

1429
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,090
have just outside the city,
pretty abundant wildlife,

1430
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:43,580
including coyotes,
a lot of hawks.

1431
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,290
And a lot of crazy shit,
but this a place that I lived had a rat

1432
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:51,230
problem.
So I set out a rat trap and,

1433
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,690
uh,
I killed this fucking big ass rat,

1434
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:54,860
like as big as my laptop.

1435
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,940
It was huge,
man.

1436
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:59,780
It was no bullshit.
Like body big fucker.

1437
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:01,510
We gotta be real careful when you said
it.

1438
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,980
Definitely break one.
Right?

1439
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,180
Um,
I set it out and I,

1440
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,000
and I heard it in my kitchen.
I'll,

1441
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:09,530
you know,
I'm like,

1442
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:10,910
Oh shit.
I got one.

1443
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:15,890
And I went out there and I looked and
it's this big fucking like fat boy rat.

1444
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,360
I was like,
oh Geez,

1445
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,620
look at the size of that thing.
So I said,

1446
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:21,290
okay,
in the morning I'll get up and don't

1447
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:22,980
kill,
put that thing in the garbage and

1448
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:24,780
whenever and deal with it.
I went to sleep.

1449
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,120
I got up in the morning,
that fucker was gone.

1450
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:32,070
They ate him down to almost nothing.
All that was left is the tail.

1451
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,470
So rats apparently don't even like rat
tail,

1452
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,360
but they had most of his body.
The rats had cannibalized most of his

1453
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:39,930
body.

1454
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,230
That's why we say fuck rats.
Yeah.

1455
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:45,030
And if you see one red,
you got a dozen.

1456
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,300
Oh,
it'll eat.

1457
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,620
My house was overrun with them.
It was really bad.

1458
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,090
Yeah,
it was real bad,

1459
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:52,890
man.
He's like one of the first places I

1460
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:54,600
lived when I lived out here and I was
like,

1461
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:55,810
what the fuck is going on?
Cause I,

1462
01:02:55,811 --> 01:02:59,400
I had before that I lived in New York
and in new Rochelle and um,

1463
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,370
my area,
although New York City has a huge rat

1464
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:04,890
problem,
New York City's rat problem is crazy.

1465
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,590
I parked my car once,
it's back in the days of phones,

1466
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,110
payphones.
I didn't have a cell phone.

1467
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:14,460
I parked my car at this gas station.
I was getting some gas and I walked over

1468
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:19,440
to the pay phone and as I'm on the phone
I saw three rats jump up in my wheel

1469
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:23,850
wells climb up over my tires.
Three big fat rats.

1470
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:27,160
Like this place was overrun with rats.
They were looking to move or something.

1471
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,490
They say you see one ret,
I don't know,

1472
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,180
maybe check the numbers,
but if you see one,

1473
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,350
I don't know if it's a hundred or a
hundred or a thousand or something like

1474
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,690
that.
Let's get you see one.

1475
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:43,120
There's 50 million
pizza rat.

1476
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,060
Have you seen this New York City pizza
rat?

1477
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,880
He's a rat.
Take it home for you.

1478
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:49,743
This word.
Yeah,

1479
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,360
this is,
this is cool.

1480
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:53,670
But here's something that a lot of
people don't know.

1481
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,550
Rats are hunters.
Um,

1482
01:03:55,620 --> 01:04:00,600
why don't you Jamie pullup rack kills
pigeon because there's not just one

1483
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:03,270
video of these.
There's many videos of rats in New York

1484
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:07,140
City attacking and killing pigeons.
Iphone videos.

1485
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,380
It's this fucking bizarre.
I had no idea.

1486
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,780
I had no idea they were pregnant.
Did you?

1487
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,420
Well,
wow.

1488
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:19,460
Look at this fucking rat is jack in this
pigeon and the pigeon gets away and like

1489
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:23,850
almost almost gets free.
What's going on here?

1490
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,880
It's like their little lane prey.
So this rat has this pigeon by the neck.

1491
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,760
So this is a different one that I saw.
The one I saw,

1492
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:36,780
the pigeon gets away.
It's like near stairs and Oh yeah,

1493
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,550
here it is.
The pigeon tries to get away and the rat

1494
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:39,270
chases it down.

1495
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,010
Look at this cause he's already winged
him.

1496
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,170
Yeah,
but look at this.

1497
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,750
The rat chases a living pigeon.
Well look at the camera guy doesn't want

1498
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:47,880
it.
He's like not getting through clothes.

1499
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,380
Okay.
Walking around with his iphone.

1500
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:52,430
I know what I'm going to do to this.
Oh,

1501
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,520
why wouldn't you go?
Oh,

1502
01:04:53,521 --> 01:04:55,620
photos are going to do,
but I had no idea.

1503
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:58,020
Did you know that rats were predators?
No.

1504
01:04:58,021 --> 01:04:58,854
I,
you know,

1505
01:04:58,860 --> 01:04:59,611
uh,
Tunis.

1506
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:02,850
Maybe even
an animal.

1507
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,433
Yeah,
no.

1508
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,720
Always a problem with,
you know,

1509
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:09,510
when you had green around,
look how strong he is.

1510
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,660
He just jumped that fucking curb with
that thing and its mouth.

1511
01:05:12,661 --> 01:05:14,670
Like it was nothing.
There was one point he stood up on his

1512
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:17,620
hind legs.
Fucking monsters.

1513
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,160
Yeah.

1514
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,010
We're so lucky.
Their little image of a rat was the size

1515
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:21,844
of a deer.

1516
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,610
Oh,
okay.

1517
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,110
Oh liquid.
There it goes.

1518
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:27,260
It,
you still tries to get away and he's on

1519
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,220
it.
He's got it back.

1520
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,750
That's great.
Techniques in was that good technique.

1521
01:05:30,751 --> 01:05:32,370
That's a very good look at the back
legs.

1522
01:05:32,371 --> 01:05:35,970
He was controlling very good technique.
Oh God.

1523
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,490
Jujitsu,
Jujitsu.

1524
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,250
I got to mention something like that
because the only way my grandpa knows

1525
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:44,450
who I'm talking to is the fight guy.
That's how I explained to my grandpa.

1526
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,170
Your grandpa likes watching,
loves it.

1527
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,700
Loves the UFC.
Like I said,

1528
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:49,080
he's the only guy in the nursing home.
They'll watch.

1529
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:52,170
Wow.
[inaudible] 93 going on 94 freaking out

1530
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:57,030
all the other people.
Yeah.

1531
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,850
So it looks like that's it.
Rats are creeps seat.

1532
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,860
Now if you kept caught that rat in a
trap,

1533
01:06:01,861 --> 01:06:02,850
nobody would get mad at.
Yeah.

1534
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,160
But if you,
uh,

1535
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,090
you shoot a bear,
the fucking protest.

1536
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,300
I have a different story for you.
Uh,

1537
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,500
uh,
had a house up in,

1538
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,400
uh,
in door county and old farmhouse and no

1539
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:15,840
one lived in it for a long time and we
had rats in that house.

1540
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:18,810
But the other thing that we had in that
house were snakes.

1541
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:20,873
And,
uh,

1542
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:21,923
my,
uh,

1543
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,560
my daughter's,
my daughter's mother didn't like snakes

1544
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:27,000
at all.
She opened up the back door,

1545
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,230
the place one time.
And it was,

1546
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,880
I don't know,
I guess it was a fox in it cause it's a

1547
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:33,840
big ass snake and it's like,
like knocking on the door,

1548
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:35,700
trying to get you,
there was a spot where they could get

1549
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,980
in.
When we started to remodel the place

1550
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,300
taken with,
you know,

1551
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:44,250
we put some beams up and we were taking
some interior walls down snake skins.

1552
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,690
Oh,
I would,

1553
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,090
she's just pro if she's listening to
this,

1554
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:53,110
she's hearing that for the first time,
man.

1555
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,660
She was like,
oh wow.

1556
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,140
Like three feet long,
you know,

1557
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:58,730
where they molted or whatever the word
is.

1558
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,460
Oh man,
those aren't predators.

1559
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:03,940
Right.
I mean those are your presence on the

1560
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,320
license and they're probably there for
the rats.

1561
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:07,460
It's probably good.
Yeah.

1562
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,740
Have him.
Yeah.

1563
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:12,000
Well that's the thing about life.
Like in my,

1564
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,170
in my neighborhood,
I see hawks all the time and they're the

1565
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:17,360
ones that keep the population of rodents
down.

1566
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,470
Yeah.
See Him all the time,

1567
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:19,520
man.
They're fucking beautiful.

1568
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:25,320
As do in our area is the thing that I
struggle with a little bit is coyotes.

1569
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,890
Wko people do guy coyote hunting around
me.

1570
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,480
And,
um,

1571
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,860
he,
we were talking about wolves before and,

1572
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:33,191
uh,
I mean,

1573
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:34,540
I'm not physically,
you know,

1574
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:37,870
I'm not worried about coyotes like
taking us down or anything like that.

1575
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:43,060
And I have this at fact talked to
[inaudible] tell us about it and he,

1576
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:47,950
his response to me talking about
allowing Chi Coyote hunting on our place

1577
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:49,720
once he goes,
Oh man,

1578
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:51,400
I just think they're trying to make a
living too.

1579
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,400
And you know,
they eat a lot of rodents.

1580
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,280
They clean up a lot of,
uh,

1581
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,150
the weekend,
the,

1582
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:02,260
and the old deer and that sort of thing.
But,

1583
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:04,030
um,
my buddy,

1584
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:04,811
uh,
Greg,

1585
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:06,360
who you may or a great cue for who you
meet,

1586
01:08:06,361 --> 01:08:07,480
her man,
a big dude,

1587
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:12,570
Steve Talks about him all the time.
Recently had a deer run into his yard by

1588
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:15,770
a pack of coyotes when he took it down
and it in his yard.

1589
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,860
Whoa.
It was a deer.

1590
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,720
It had been wounded during the gun while
we assumed the gun season,

1591
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:22,370
they'd had a big scar in the back of it
and knock,

1592
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,650
I suppose it could have been up.
You don't want Arrow that had cut it or

1593
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:26,390
something like that.
So it was weak or whatever.

1594
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,711
And uh,
yeah,

1595
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:29,360
in the middle of the night,
this went down in the middle of the

1596
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,290
night.
You went outside cause I couldn't

1597
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,220
believe it.
Never seen anything.

1598
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,900
How many coyotes?
Well,

1599
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,990
based on he didn't see how many,
but it was,

1600
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,130
you know,
they,

1601
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,650
they work in groups of two or three or
four or five.

1602
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,710
Um,
so they were right.

1603
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:42,800
They had me right.
You know,

1604
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:46,580
I have a chicken coop in my yard and uh,
I went out in the middle of the night to

1605
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,790
shut the coop because I let the chickens
out and they wander around and I closed

1606
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,140
the coop.
And uh,

1607
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,930
when I closed the coop,
I was just outside enjoying the piece,

1608
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:54,920
looking up at the stars.

1609
01:08:55,310 --> 01:09:00,260
And I heard these deer running,
like running full clip.

1610
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,030
And then something was chasing after
them,

1611
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,310
full clip,
but it was dark and my eyes hadn't

1612
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,350
adjusted.
So I was trying to figure out what the

1613
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,610
fuck was happening.
But these deer were running and this is

1614
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:11,890
something was chasing them.
And I saw,

1615
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure it was a coyote,

1616
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,160
but it could have been an outline.
But I saw,

1617
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:19,160
uh,
I saw what looked like the silhouette of

1618
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:21,410
a coyote on the top of this hill.
And I was like,

1619
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:22,650
this is so wild.
Like,

1620
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:26,030
here's a house here and this fucking
asshole over here is watching the

1621
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:27,780
Bachelorette.
And like,

1622
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,330
you know,
this guy pulls in,

1623
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:35,000
it was driveways and Mercedes.
He's smoking his e-cigarette and some

1624
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:38,600
fucking two thing claw shit is going on
right there.

1625
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:41,600
These coyotes are chasing down these
deer because there's a,

1626
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:44,990
there's a series of oak trees down the
street from my house where these deer

1627
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:45,824
tend to bed.

1628
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,360
I see them there all the time and it's
like,

1629
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:48,950
probably like five or six of them.
And,

1630
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:49,941
but uh,
you know,

1631
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:53,060
you'll see coyotes especially come
spring,

1632
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,310
you know,
like when the phones are being born,

1633
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:58,670
you see these fuckers hanging around
just looking for an easy meal.

1634
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,550
You know guys who raise cattle around
me,

1635
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:03,620
we'll talk about,
and I don't know Nathan if you know

1636
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:05,100
anything about this,
but I,

1637
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:09,140
to my knowledge,
I've never had a calf taken by a cop by

1638
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:12,740
coyotes or anything like that.
I have had a calf that was born and

1639
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,770
died.
It was stillborn or something that

1640
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:18,470
wasn't there the next day.
So Coyote's took it.

1641
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,270
But yeah,
call abandon it too.

1642
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,250
The one thing that you do not want to
mess with,

1643
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:26,210
it was a 1,450 pound Herford cow.
We just had a calf.

1644
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:26,691
Yeah.
Yeah,

1645
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:30,110
I would imagine is not going to let you,
you're that guy get kicked by a cow.

1646
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,420
Oh,
I've only had pigs and chickens tagging

1647
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,510
and that's the only one.
The dogs like we forget and leave the

1648
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:38,840
dogs in for the night.
A pig lit or an actual whole piglet.

1649
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,450
Piglet.
A full grown pig would probably,

1650
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,510
especially if there's more than one,
I'm sure they take care of themselves.

1651
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:47,110
They're vicious.
I got her to one of my pig's ears.

1652
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,010
I mean if I were to fall down and my pig
pen,

1653
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:52,230
you'd be fucked.
And if I couldn't get up there,

1654
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,710
my wife would come home and there'd be
nothing left to me.

1655
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,270
Three,
four pigs would have to be done.

1656
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,590
Yeah,
that's real.

1657
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,110
That's real.
That's the number one.

1658
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:04,110
Here's more statistic.
That's it's your number.

1659
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,440
The number 1% of people that have died
is another one.

1660
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:09,440
Number one animal that kills people on
farms.

1661
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,880
Really?
Pigs.

1662
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,560
Yeah.
People fall like sometimes like an old

1663
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:17,880
farmer will have a heart attack and fall
into the pigsty and they just gobble

1664
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:18,440
them up.

1665
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,820
I for the first time I actually saw it
in my pigs,

1666
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:22,040
eat a chicken,
please google it.

1667
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,330
I want,
I couldn't save the chicken and time.

1668
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:25,440
And so I was like,
what am I going to do?

1669
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:27,150
I don't want to save a half mangled
chicken,

1670
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,640
you know,
so I let him finish it,

1671
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:32,970
but they systematically cornered the
thing and I'm running over and try it.

1672
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:35,460
And then it was over.
It was too many coyote take a chicken

1673
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:36,840
from my yarn or watching a hop the
fence,

1674
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:38,850
but it's in its mouth.
It was crazy.

1675
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,900
And I was going to kill the fucker.
But then I realized it was a female and

1676
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:45,840
then it had,
it had cubs like a lot of the typing and

1677
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:48,690
hollering that you hear like,
like people think there's a lot of

1678
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:51,780
misconceptions about coyotes and one of
them is that when you ever hear that

1679
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:53,380
that there's like some sort of a,
a party,

1680
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:55,860
a lot of it is a mother,
uh,

1681
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:56,850
communicating with her young.

1682
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:58,110
Yeah.
And uh,

1683
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,560
I was pretty sure that this was hat what
happened because my dog had let this

1684
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:06,210
female near the chickens,
like the dog had like it was sort of

1685
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:08,730
like aided and abetted this coyote
killing this,

1686
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:09,990
um,
this chicken.

1687
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,160
And then I realized like,
Oh,

1688
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:15,420
this is a female that has babies.
And so that's where your soft spot.

1689
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,270
I'm a pussy.
When you hear that sound though,

1690
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,940
I mean when my wife first moved to our
farm,

1691
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:26,480
I mean it sounds like there are a pack
of children being murdered and it was

1692
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,090
still night,
like all where we are and it just

1693
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:31,740
resonates.
That's good.

1694
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,850
That's weird.
I have a relatively new friend out in

1695
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,920
Washington who has actually been
emailing me and asking me for advice

1696
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:45,120
about a coyotes trapping coyotes.
You knew when you think about trapping

1697
01:12:45,121 --> 01:12:50,121
cocktail Rinella,
he rep recommend sub sonic 22 is when I

1698
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:54,710
trapping wildlife colleges.

1699
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,280
I know in Wisconsin,
uh,

1700
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,980
when people would start to talk to them,
talk to them about,

1701
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,650
you know,
I'm trying to get rid of the sea animal

1702
01:13:01,651 --> 01:13:04,260
or whatever happened to make a woodchuck
or something like that,

1703
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:07,140
he would always recommend a small piece
of land at a very high velocity.

1704
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,130
Yeah,
well that's what a buddy of mine does.

1705
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:13,770
He sets out cat food,
he puts cat food.

1706
01:13:13,771 --> 01:13:15,960
He leaves these coyotes that we're
targeting is dogs.

1707
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:21,260
So we would set out plates of cat food
and sit on his balcony and just wait and

1708
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,270
call him into yeah,
you can call with Predator calls,

1709
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:26,180
but that you might call them some other
shit too.

1710
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,480
Man,
we were talking about this yesterday

1711
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:31,314
that they,
um,

1712
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,980
they just did this study of all these
different mountain mines that they've

1713
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:36,870
killed.
Here's some more numbers.

1714
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,840
I think they killed like a hundred
mountain lions in the San Francisco

1715
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,490
area,
in northern California area.

1716
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:42,811
And,
uh,

1717
01:13:42,811 --> 01:13:44,400
out of these mountain lions that they
killed,

1718
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:48,330
most of them had cats and dogs in their
body.

1719
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,910
That's a finding out that this is what
these things are eating.

1720
01:13:50,911 --> 01:13:53,760
Only 5% of them had deer in their body.
Well,

1721
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:56,670
it's easier,
but it's bizarre.

1722
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:57,953
I mean they're,
they're,

1723
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,180
they're targeting people's pets.
I mean,

1724
01:14:00,181 --> 01:14:02,970
that's,
that's their food cause fucking weird

1725
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:03,751
man.
Madison,

1726
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:05,970
Wisconsin where I live on the edges of
town.

1727
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,440
Uh,
that's it.

1728
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,950
And we actually live near to parks.
We have coyotes and,

1729
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:13,700
okay.

1730
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,110
Yeah.
There was a certain group of folks who

1731
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:15,561
are like,
well,

1732
01:14:15,561 --> 01:14:16,760
you know,
they're just out there trying to make

1733
01:14:16,761 --> 01:14:18,580
live in two until,
you know what?

1734
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:22,940
I'm kittens mittens and Fifi he got up
and then we've got this situation we

1735
01:14:22,941 --> 01:14:23,780
have to deal with.
Yeah.

1736
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,830
It makes a story for the kids at that
bizarre thing to see your cat in the

1737
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:30,500
jaws of a coyote as it's running away.
You know,

1738
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:31,280
there's a,
uh,

1739
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,720
the La Museum of national history has
this really cool exhibit on North

1740
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,030
American animals and their exhibit,
I pulled,

1741
01:14:38,031 --> 01:14:41,750
I had a picture of it on my instagram,
Jamie of the coyote there,

1742
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:46,190
exhibit of the Coyote in Los Angeles is
a coyote with a fucking cat and its

1743
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:50,900
mouth that's in the Museum of natural
history in Los Angeles.

1744
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,190
The actual,
you know,

1745
01:14:52,191 --> 01:14:54,060
they have stuffed animals,
they have buffalo,

1746
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,500
they show Moose and they have these,
you know,

1747
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:57,440
so you can get a see,
oh,

1748
01:14:57,441 --> 01:14:58,640
that's what that one of those looks
like.

1749
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,070
Yeah.
Well they have these displays,

1750
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:02,930
the stuffed animals.
So the coyote has a fucking cat and its

1751
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,070
mouth and it's on someone's porch.
We're going to at home.

1752
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,120
Look at this.
That's a national history.

1753
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,300
That's the museum.
Fucking dead cat.

1754
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,370
And my kids will like this.
Yeah.

1755
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,770
Yeah.
Like I'm Daddy.

1756
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:17,450
Well honey,
the only fucking animal,

1757
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:19,820
it's killing something.
And the entire museum,

1758
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,210
this is the animal that's killing me.
I thought that was the notes from the,

1759
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,710
the,
the uh,

1760
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,470
museum.
And then I realized that that was it.

1761
01:15:27,471 --> 01:15:28,880
You had written that.
Yeah.

1762
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:29,930
See if they're really,
they're saying,

1763
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:32,220
fucker,
no,

1764
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,920
but look what these people are saying.
Look at this guy.

1765
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,320
My cat was just killed by one of these
fuckers.

1766
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,240
You know,
I'll shoot a coyote for no reason other

1767
01:15:39,241 --> 01:15:41,300
than it's a coyote fuck a coyote.
Yeah.

1768
01:15:41,301 --> 01:15:42,021
And they were right,
man.

1769
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:43,670
Those are a little,
little creepers,

1770
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,200
little creepers.
Look at this.

1771
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,480
Uh,
what does it say?

1772
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,230
Swine likely kill fewer people than
cattle do,

1773
01:15:51,231 --> 01:15:52,970
but there's no reliable data.
Hmm.

1774
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,860
20 people a year killed by cattle.
It said,

1775
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,090
whoa.
Um,

1776
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,940
find out how many people killed by pigs.
Couldn't find any but one story

1777
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:00,590
recently.
Mm hmm.

1778
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:03,380
One guy in Oregon.
I would guess that that number is a

1779
01:16:03,381 --> 01:16:04,310
little bit higher.
I mean,

1780
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,480
personally,
I know,

1781
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,393
uh,

1782
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:07,870
okay.

1783
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:12,430
Two people have been killed by bowls or
bowls is especially solitary bulls.

1784
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,050
Um,
you know,

1785
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,670
the old expression is you fuck with the
bull,

1786
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:18,000
you get the horn.
I would imagine that was,

1787
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,430
I was milking for a farmer one time and
uh,

1788
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,380
you know,
one of the things with dairy farming and

1789
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:24,970
I grew up dairy farming,
but,

1790
01:16:24,971 --> 01:16:27,790
uh,
if a cow has a stepdown teat that's,

1791
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,070
you know,
we usually say tit,

1792
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:29,913
but you know,
we're on the,

1793
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,180
I guess it doesn't matter.
No,

1794
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,930
but they have stepped on time to clean
it up or they get mastitis,

1795
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:37,090
which is a sort of infection.
Um,

1796
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,700
it's,
it's very sore obviously.

1797
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,920
Um,
so you gotta you gotta,

1798
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,770
you know,
strap up the milker and not put it on

1799
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:45,790
that one.
And I was in a hurry.

1800
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:48,310
I was late for my other job,
so I'm trying to hurry and I forgot

1801
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:50,470
about this one column.
This guy's cows didn't go in the right

1802
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:52,420
stall,
so my head wasn't where it needed to be.

1803
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:53,710
Anyway,
I put the,

1804
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:58,330
I put the milker on the bad tit and she
kicked me so hard.

1805
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,710
She kicked me in the face and then I
flew back into the metal post.

1806
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,380
I mean,
I was out for good 20 minutes,

1807
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:06,580
you know,
when you wake up in a daze.

1808
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:09,470
I mean,
so that's one example of how somebody

1809
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,010
could

1810
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,530
easily be killed by a car or you were so
big,

1811
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,100
you know what I mean?
I'll do is fall and once dumps you and

1812
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:16,934
that's it.

1813
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,020
Well,
again,

1814
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,720
it goes back to the calving thing.
Um,

1815
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,380
our neighbor,
the guy who I used to,

1816
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,540
while he still does some farming for,
uh,

1817
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,620
for us to cuts and rakes and bales or
hay,

1818
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:28,160
it was almost killed by a,
um,

1819
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,130
uh,
a car would just fresh and just had a

1820
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:33,650
calf.
And he went in there to deal with the

1821
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:37,070
calf and she got him into a corner and
beat the snot out of him.

1822
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:41,770
Eventually he was able to crawl out and
get under a gate.

1823
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,910
And,
and this isn't normally a very nice

1824
01:17:43,911 --> 01:17:44,840
animal,
you know?

1825
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,550
Um,
uh,

1826
01:17:46,551 --> 01:17:51,140
so it's funny to tell that story when
I've been sending you all this shit

1827
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:52,450
about how nice my cows aren't.
I

1828
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,780
so,
well,

1829
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:58,910
we were talking about that because I
said that when we were around your cows,

1830
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,530
they fucking panic.
Then they ran off.

1831
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:03,200
But you brought up an important point.
We were shooting squirrels.

1832
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:05,890
They're shooting pigeons.
So what,

1833
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,540
we had shot anything yet.
Is there a lot of you though too?

1834
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,850
There's a lot of you guys,
a few fewer guys,

1835
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:13,640
four guys.
Brian Count might have been singing

1836
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,390
loud.
He was singing and you guys smelled

1837
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:19,160
different.
I mean I definitely don't let strangers

1838
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,270
in with mine,
you know,

1839
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,580
I wouldn't want that.
Yeah.

1840
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:24,930
What happened that day is what it,
a couple of different things that

1841
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:26,430
happened.
Cause you know,

1842
01:18:26,431 --> 01:18:29,940
factually you were correct.
What happened was is you went into their

1843
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,500
pasture,
well they weren't out in pasture.

1844
01:18:31,501 --> 01:18:34,620
We had them in a,
in a corral barn yard because we'd been

1845
01:18:34,621 --> 01:18:37,260
hunting and I didn't want him out on the
pasture where they would be and that

1846
01:18:37,261 --> 01:18:39,510
sort of thing.
Um,

1847
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:43,830
there is that video of that and you see
as you guys are walking in,

1848
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,650
and I never even thought about this.
Then Joe was like,

1849
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,290
I should probably go out there.
The cattle would be a little calmer if

1850
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,940
I'm with them.
But you know,

1851
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:53,220
I was afraid that Brian was going to
fall through the floor.

1852
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,200
It's shown email,
here's where you can buy it.

1853
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,880
And I wanted to throw rocks too.
But,

1854
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:02,430
um,
as you're walking out there,

1855
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,310
there,
they all turn and look at you as you're

1856
01:19:05,311 --> 01:19:07,470
walking in because that's on that,
that outtake.

1857
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,770
And then when you start shooting,
they're all down in the corner.

1858
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:15,990
Being very in a defensive position.
And the analogy I think I use to you is

1859
01:19:15,991 --> 01:19:20,991
imagine you're at home having dinner and
four dudes walk into your house with

1860
01:19:22,561 --> 01:19:26,730
cameras and guns talking loud,
doing their whole thing and,

1861
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,910
and then they start shooting.
Guessing you're going to probably go to

1862
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:30,780
a corner of the house.

1863
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,170
Yeah,
no defensive position at once.

1864
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:35,340
The shooting started happening.
Um,

1865
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,800
Jamie,
I just pulled this up.

1866
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:41,570
There was more people were killed by
pigs in 2014 than were killed by sharks.

1867
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,780
Sharks get a bad rap last year.
Uh,

1868
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:49,781
it says there were 12 fatal pig attacks
worldwide versus 10 shark fatalities.

1869
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:52,450
So.
Huh.

1870
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,460
Different stats,
I guess different websites on Pharma

1871
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,210
specific by that might've been,
yeah,

1872
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:01,190
I think they're talking about wild pigs
actually,

1873
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,323
which I didn't know.
Wow.

1874
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,790
Well that many people,
they're fucking creepers though.

1875
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,200
Have you ever been around wild pigs?
I actually have not,

1876
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,630
man.
I was in home ranch with Rinella and we

1877
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:12,630
were walking down this road and we're
pig hunting and we got close to these

1878
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:15,840
pigs and they didn't know we were there
because it's really thick brush and

1879
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:18,480
grasses.
And we heard them fighting and they were

1880
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,430
less than 20 yards away and they're
going to war.

1881
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,590
And I'm like,
these are demons,

1882
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:26,730
man.
They fucking demons.

1883
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:28,680
They sound like monsters.
This sound like something from the Lord

1884
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:32,640
of the rings
and they're attacking each other for

1885
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:34,560
whatever reason.
Like right there.

1886
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:35,221
I'm like,
God,

1887
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:38,580
there's fucking creepy things when
they're giant tusks and they're black

1888
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:41,240
hair and that they look like demons,
you know?

1889
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,830
And they sound crazy to hear one.
You'd go,

1890
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:44,664
oh,
okay.

1891
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,830
You know,
that's how the king and the game of

1892
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,210
thrones died.
Remember?

1893
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,430
Do you ever watch that show?
How dare you?

1894
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,710
How dare you say no?
Um,

1895
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,340
he was killed by a boar.
Wild boar.

1896
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:54,174
Spoiler.

1897
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:57,543
Well,
it

1898
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,030
doesn't matter.
You don't have to doug,

1899
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,700
he dies quick.
He does early in the show.

1900
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,540
But,
um,

1901
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,070
but he was killed by a wild boar.
And that's,

1902
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,570
that's not uncommon.
You know,

1903
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,430
they're big animals,
man.

1904
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,590
They get real big.
Fair enough.

1905
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,380
You know,
you're going out to,

1906
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,590
we're not going to feel well that's
there had very different animal.

1907
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:18,540
I mean,
deer have killed people.

1908
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:19,920
It has happened,
not just car accidents,

1909
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:22,110
but they have gord people.
It has happened.

1910
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,690
It is possible.
It's very rare,

1911
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:25,890
obviously.
It usually they just want to get the

1912
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:28,350
fuck away from him.
But uh,

1913
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,660
you know,
they're wild.

1914
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,850
They're animals.
They don't play by our rules.

1915
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:36,060
And I think we have a real problem in
this world with our idea of what an

1916
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:37,050
animal is.
You know,

1917
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,270
we anthropomorphize these things.
We think of,

1918
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:40,920
I'm the same way we think about our
pets.

1919
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,340
When you have a dog and you think of
your dog the same way you think of a

1920
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:45,720
wild bear.
Like,

1921
01:21:45,721 --> 01:21:47,220
boy,
they're playing on some fucking

1922
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:49,950
completely different fields.
They have completely different rule

1923
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:51,330
book,
you know,

1924
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,490
and we'd like to think that we're not
animals.

1925
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,510
And that kind of connects us,
that that's where the disengagement and

1926
01:21:57,511 --> 01:21:59,850
the disconnection with our,
our food supply comes from.

1927
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:00,684
Yeah.
We're so,

1928
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,250
you know,
we're above it.

1929
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,290
Yeah.
That's our psyche.

1930
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,290
When we were also,
we're just not used to being around

1931
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:10,740
them.
Most people are not around wild animals

1932
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,210
ever,
ever.

1933
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:16,140
The great majority of people that live
in cities are virtually never run

1934
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:17,700
anything other than pigeons and
squirrels.

1935
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,480
They're just not around them.
So our ideas of wild animals,

1936
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:23,400
I like these beautiful things that you
rarely see.

1937
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:24,330
Why would you want to kill one?

1938
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,030
Yeah.
An interesting point about squirrels,

1939
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:31,120
urban squirrels versus a woods.
Squirrels.

1940
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,390
Uh,
we shot a couple more episodes,

1941
01:22:34,391 --> 01:22:36,640
immediate or that'll be coming out here
in the next couple of weeks.

1942
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,490
And A,
we took Helen and,

1943
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,520
and,
and Brittany,

1944
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:43,390
a squirrel hunting.
And their experience mostly with

1945
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,850
squirrels was urban.
And Helen had this,

1946
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,710
wow.
They're way different than,

1947
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,180
oh,
they know what squirrels,

1948
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:51,640
they're like not coming down.
And of course Brittany was talking about

1949
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,450
like rubbing acorns on her body and
maybe they'll come out and stuff like

1950
01:22:55,451 --> 01:23:00,451
that.
But a completely different wild animals.

1951
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,670
They're out there making the living,
they're out there surviving that,

1952
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,900
that whole thing.
They aren't going to react the same way

1953
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,170
to,
to human beings walking into the woods.

1954
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:10,800
Animals are pliable.
They're,

1955
01:23:10,801 --> 01:23:14,220
they're flexible just like people are.
And if you start feeding wild animals,

1956
01:23:14,221 --> 01:23:17,370
they kind of become domesticated.
There's a park right down here in north

1957
01:23:17,371 --> 01:23:20,100
Hollywood.
He could sit down in the park and if you

1958
01:23:20,101 --> 01:23:22,440
bring a bag of peanuts,
the squirrels will literally come and

1959
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:24,270
take them from your hands like a little
baby.

1960
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:25,950
And it's cool,
you know?

1961
01:23:25,951 --> 01:23:28,140
I mean those are different animals,
you know,

1962
01:23:28,141 --> 01:23:29,130
like,
like,

1963
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,500
like the deer in my yard.
Like a,

1964
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,750
my buddy came over one day and there was
this deer standing there just standing

1965
01:23:35,751 --> 01:23:36,511
and he's like,
dude,

1966
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:37,620
I didn't even think that was a real
deer.

1967
01:23:37,621 --> 01:23:39,610
I thought you were fucking with me cause
uh,

1968
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:42,930
he came over my house and we're going to
work out and there's this deer stand

1969
01:23:42,931 --> 01:23:43,764
there.
Look at that.

1970
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:45,150
I think it goes,
what the fuck is that?

1971
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,380
I go,
it's a deer.

1972
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,580
He was like,
this is a real deer.

1973
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,110
Cause he's a,
he's a buck.

1974
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,810
And just stand there looking at us and
uh,

1975
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,561
and he goes,
okay,

1976
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:53,580
would you shoot that buck?
I go,

1977
01:23:53,581 --> 01:23:55,770
fuck no,
that's a depth thing.

1978
01:23:55,771 --> 01:23:58,950
Might as well be a pet about starving.
I'd shoot it.

1979
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:01,440
But that thing is not worried about me
at all.

1980
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:06,120
It has never been attacked by a person.
It doesn't associate people with danger.

1981
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,830
They're just standing there staring at
me.

1982
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,660
You can't your hostess.
Yeah,

1983
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:11,820
you can't kill them.
That's fucked up.

1984
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,610
That's why you can,
if you have to survive.

1985
01:24:14,611 --> 01:24:16,770
But that's not a game animal.

1986
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,220
We have a,
a rule.

1987
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,320
Um,
I don't think that you were up by my

1988
01:24:21,321 --> 01:24:22,940
cabin,
but Brian was,

1989
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,860
and my wife said,
you know,

1990
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,660
can you not kill him right here by the
cabin?

1991
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:32,660
You have a rule rule,
but you had a beaver that you guys

1992
01:24:32,661 --> 01:24:33,560
killed right there,
right.

1993
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,390
Uh,
oh.

1994
01:24:35,391 --> 01:24:37,060
That beaver that we ate.
Oh,

1995
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:38,330
that was,
that was up on a crick.

1996
01:24:38,331 --> 01:24:39,650
Not,
not far from there,

1997
01:24:39,651 --> 01:24:43,040
but that's okay.
She allows the beavers to die.

1998
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:44,931
Well,
yeah,

1999
01:24:44,931 --> 01:24:48,270
she loves the Muskrats to die to burrow
into the dam and you know,

2000
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,810
cause all kinds of damage.
I want them to die.

2001
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:51,570
Yeah,
you got it.

2002
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,090
We get rid of him because they're
causing their,

2003
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:54,440
you know,
the issues by the way,

2004
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:58,190
how good is that?
God Damn beaver taste absolutely.

2005
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,860
Bar none.
Best wild meat I've ever eaten.

2006
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,830
It's fantastic.
Well the waiver Nela cooked it.

2007
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:04,280
Yep.

2008
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,400
Braised it and then slow cooked it like
a stew.

2009
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:11,750
And I'm telling you man,
it was like the best beef stew you've

2010
01:25:11,751 --> 01:25:13,340
ever had in your life.
Like in Guam,

2011
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:15,530
rich and flavorful.
And again,

2012
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:19,820
just like we're talking about with um,
organic beef versus regular,

2013
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,140
you know,
corn fed.

2014
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:26,290
This is a wild animal with a wild
natural diet and a real healthy big fat

2015
01:25:26,301 --> 01:25:26,680
beaver.

2016
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,250
Yeah.
So,

2017
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,420
so texture wise,
I mean it's,

2018
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,860
I've eight rack cooling.
Oh,

2019
01:25:30,861 --> 01:25:31,930
slow down.
Koons.

2020
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:34,840
A whole nother ball game.
But it's a raccoon.

2021
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:37,530
It's a wild game thing.
Bear,

2022
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:42,620
I mean people seriously,
one of the worst thing in Wisconsin,

2023
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:46,780
I'm taking the shirt off.
I notice there was not a beaver in the

2024
01:25:46,781 --> 01:25:51,090
middle of the grail.
Sustainable beaver.

2025
01:25:51,091 --> 01:25:53,680
When did you eat a raccoon man game
feeds,

2026
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,380
you know,
they do it.

2027
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,810
They,
we have bare feeds,

2028
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:56,411
like,
you know,

2029
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:57,370
packers,
packers,

2030
01:25:57,371 --> 01:25:59,080
bears weekend,
they'll have a bare feet at the local

2031
01:25:59,081 --> 01:26:00,160
tavern.
And you know,

2032
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:02,050
people bring in all their stuff to wild
game.

2033
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,980
Hold

2034
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,570
the fuck on.
First of all,

2035
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,640
let me just explain to people that are
only listening.

2036
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,880
I asked,
I asked nate,

2037
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:14,900
I go,
where did he eat?

2038
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:17,510
No raccoon.
And Doug throws his hands up.

2039
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:18,021
Like,
I'm like,

2040
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:21,920
what have you had French fries?
I get to fucking raccoon,

2041
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:23,180
man.
It's been a long time.

2042
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,150
A long time.
That's so what is it that you have a

2043
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:26,984
bear?
What?

2044
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,140
Every once in a while when they're,
it's packers,

2045
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:31,100
bears,
you know,

2046
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:33,331
you know,
they'll have a,

2047
01:26:33,331 --> 01:26:35,550
at a local tavern,
they'll have like Newman's barn grill.

2048
01:26:35,551 --> 01:26:36,860
We'll plug,
those guys don't,

2049
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:37,910
and he'll point,
you know,

2050
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,700
they're,
they've had bear bear feeds,

2051
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,260
you know,
for the pack or bears game,

2052
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:43,820
you know,
there's a connection and they'll,

2053
01:26:43,821 --> 01:26:44,310
uh,
you know,

2054
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:47,000
people bring other stuff.
There's buyer game feeds,

2055
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,600
rattlesnake a fee,
but you're calling it a feed.

2056
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,550
You don't like a steak feed or uh,
you know,

2057
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:53,110
it's just,
uh,

2058
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:55,280
you feed a bunch of people and they sit
down and get drunk.

2059
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,810
Well,
how much chuck and how they cook in the

2060
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:57,710
bear,
what are they doing?

2061
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:59,330
Probably roasting it,
you know,

2062
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,600
I mean the big barrel clothes on.
Yeah.

2063
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,470
Yeah.
That's it just have a gigantic banner to

2064
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,260
me that's part of it up and you know,
that sort of thing.

2065
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,340
It's good.
Well,

2066
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:09,530
bears a real tricky,
right?

2067
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:13,570
You got to make sure that you clear the
role that temperature is constant as

2068
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,413
well.
Oh yeah.

2069
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,273
It's everywhere is,
Yep.

2070
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:18,130
Kenosis is a concern.
Yeah.

2071
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:21,130
So yeah,
it's sort of a Wisconsin tradition.

2072
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,740
I saw your
game fee

2073
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:29,510
be and it could be bare,
it could be back in the day when there

2074
01:27:29,511 --> 01:27:30,920
was more,
uh,

2075
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,173
when,
uh,

2076
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,560
the raccoon heights we're in,
uh,

2077
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,700
we're more valuable and that's,
there's an ebb and flow to that market.

2078
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:38,480
Of course.
Well,

2079
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:43,100
you've got all these hides and what he'd
do with the carcasses and so a certain

2080
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:44,660
amount of them are,
are being eaten.

2081
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,670
Um,
what does it taste like?

2082
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:48,930
Any Greasy?
Yeah,

2083
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,480
he's really greasy.
Yeah.

2084
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:51,840
Was it a good grease?
Is it?

2085
01:27:51,841 --> 01:27:51,960
Yeah.

2086
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,890
Good.
Good for you.

2087
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,330
It's,
it's one of those things,

2088
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:56,010
there's a little gaming as to it,
you know,

2089
01:27:56,011 --> 01:27:57,660
it's one of the things you've got to get
used to it,

2090
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:58,950
you know,
and I don't eat enough,

2091
01:27:58,951 --> 01:28:01,080
bear me to get used to it,
but no,

2092
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,070
I've had,
they're talking about raccoon,

2093
01:28:03,071 --> 01:28:04,100
the raccoon,
raccoon all,

2094
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:06,180
I'm sorry.
You're talking about Pat Baer.

2095
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:07,043
Raccoon.

2096
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:08,420
Oh,
I,

2097
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,410
I way prefer beer.
Yeah.

2098
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,830
Super Gaming.
It's kind of nutty in a weird way.

2099
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:16,130
Did bear was greasy at all?
Bare to me.

2100
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,440
Tasted like a,
almost like a beef.

2101
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,760
Where did you,
uh,

2102
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,930
Alberta?
Yeah.

2103
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:26,240
So what's that e in Wisconsin?
In the midwest where there's hunting

2104
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:28,610
going on.
They're doing a lot of baiting of them

2105
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,541
with,
you know,

2106
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:32,430
like old donuts and stuff like that.
Um,

2107
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,800
and I remember Steve Talking about,
um,

2108
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,860
I've never,
I've never bear hunted anywhere.

2109
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:40,850
Um,
how he doesn't like taking,

2110
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:44,740
like,
does it spring bears or because they're

2111
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,600
eating?
Behold the timing is of sound.

2112
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,930
Sandburs he loves the blueberry bears,
but not the cause.

2113
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:52,760
It,
their meat tastes like what the eight

2114
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,280
right.
Hey Holy.

2115
01:28:54,281 --> 01:28:56,210
And that's what we're talking about
crazy though.

2116
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,270
That you know Rinella show.
Have you ever seen that show where he

2117
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,130
shot happens?
I haven't the show watch much TV

2118
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,750
at all.
Well he uh,

2119
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:07,710
he shot a bear in Alaska and the fall
and it had been just feasting on

2120
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:11,280
blueberries and he was saying that this
is the best meat bar.

2121
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:14,430
None in the world are known.
And he was saying that you opened this

2122
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:19,431
bear up and you smell blueberries and
it's like a sweet tasting meat and then

2123
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:21,120
you,
and then it just really,

2124
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,060
I mean you eat a burger,
you don't think about it.

2125
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:25,590
You drink a soda,
you don't think about it,

2126
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:28,950
but that is your cells.
You were literally supplying nutrients

2127
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:31,860
to yourselves,
to your food and when you eat,

2128
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:34,890
like I used to work with this dude,
he's string a lot of carrot juice and

2129
01:29:34,891 --> 01:29:38,190
his fucking hands turned orange.
Like his skin tarts started turn orange

2130
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:41,130
cause he was eating like three or four
glasses of carrot juice a day.

2131
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:41,450
Orange.

2132
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:44,430
Are we talking orange is fuck like weird
like Spray Tan,

2133
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:47,270
like Jersey shore Cheetos,
orange or no,

2134
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,510
like an orange,
like a carrot.

2135
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,150
You know he made a jerk off motion.
I don't know why.

2136
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:54,990
You know why that was shirking off with
cheese.

2137
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,490
That's a joke.
Do you know that?

2138
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:58,380
Okay.
It is,

2139
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,610
but I don't want to say cheetos and
jerking off like we mean it's,

2140
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,210
it's kind of one of those things,
you know,

2141
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,430
it's like a bare feet.
Like you got to bring those concepts to

2142
01:30:06,431 --> 01:30:07,550
understand.
Yes,

2143
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:12,070
she knows I give you a pass times
renting now.

2144
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,050
I don't know man.
There's some stuff about this guy I

2145
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:16,940
didn't know before,
so,

2146
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,820
oh
well cheetos forgot cios.

2147
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:27,750
If you're eating cheetos all day or
potato chips or whatever the fuck it is,

2148
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:31,650
that is literally supplying yourselves
and we don't think about it that way.

2149
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:33,120
We just think about this tastes good.

2150
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,650
I am me.
I am Doug.

2151
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:36,930
Doug eats cheeseburgers cause
cheeseburger taste good,

2152
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,660
but a cheeseburger literally supplying
your body.

2153
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,670
You know,
I started this diet recently.

2154
01:30:41,671 --> 01:30:46,560
This is called the primal blueprint diet
is guy on the podcast name Mark Sisson

2155
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:49,920
and he is an advocate of no grains,
no bread,

2156
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,480
no pasta,
no rice,

2157
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:53,430
no nothing,
mostly fats.

2158
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:56,010
You get your fats from Avocados,
from a healthy fats,

2159
01:30:56,011 --> 01:31:01,011
from beef and the chicken or whatever
the fuck you eat and coconut oil,

2160
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:03,510
things along those lines,
a mct oil.

2161
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:07,200
And uh,
I've been on it now for two weeks and

2162
01:31:07,201 --> 01:31:09,510
it's pretty fascinating,
pretty fascinating.

2163
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:11,700
First of all,
it took me a while to like adjust from

2164
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,490
going on a carbohydrate based,
uh,

2165
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,110
energy to a fat base energy getting my,
my energy from fats.

2166
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,980
My body fat's decreased pretty
significantly.

2167
01:31:22,981 --> 01:31:27,981
I lost at least six pounds now and I'm
eating like normal amounts,

2168
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:33,500
but I'm just eating fat and proteins and
a lot of vegetables and no sugars at

2169
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:33,900
all.

2170
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:34,681
None.
Zero.

2171
01:31:34,681 --> 01:31:37,290
I'm not eating,
I'm not eating any processed sugar.

2172
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:40,860
I eat occasional piece of fruit,
blueberries and things along those

2173
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:42,840
lines,
but it's mostly vegetables and meat that

2174
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:45,150
I'm eating and,
and a lot of Avocados.

2175
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:50,540
But my cells obviously are getting
nutrients off of this,

2176
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:54,900
off of healthy fats.
And what he found is he had arthritis.

2177
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,440
He also had irritable bowel syndrome.
Those things went away when he,

2178
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:01,660
when he cut grains out of his diet and
we stopped eating processed sugar

2179
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,390
influence things,
inflammation.

2180
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,930
Yeah.
And that these healthy fats like healthy

2181
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:09,520
fats for your body,
like coconut oil,

2182
01:32:09,521 --> 01:32:14,521
things along those lines is really the
best fuel for your body and your body

2183
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:17,430
gets into a state of Ketosis,
which takes about two weeks where I just

2184
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:20,800
started getting into it just started
getting into the state of Ketosis and

2185
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:23,050
your body,
once it reaches a state of Ketosis,

2186
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:28,320
gets its energy primarily from fat and
it's a more normal natural way for your

2187
01:32:28,481 --> 01:32:31,420
body to respond and your body can shift.

2188
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,640
Like you know,
your body's very flexible can shift from

2189
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,440
a glucose based carbohydrate based fuel
system to a fat based fuel system.

2190
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,980
So this one of my body has just started
to do and I committed to this.

2191
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:44,200
I was going to do a month,
but I just decided to make it two

2192
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:46,150
months.
I'm committing to this for two months

2193
01:32:46,151 --> 01:32:47,680
and I'm gonna talk about it and see what
it's like.

2194
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:52,210
But I'm sold two weeks in.
I don't like it in the fact that if I go

2195
01:32:52,211 --> 01:32:55,900
to a restaurant and someone's got a
spaghetti and meatballs next to me,

2196
01:32:55,901 --> 01:32:57,900
I'm like,
fuck the meatballs.

2197
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:00,490
Fuck,
I can't eat spaghetti like I have.

2198
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,560
I can't eat any sugar.
No desserts.

2199
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,460
Does that seem different to you?
Uh,

2200
01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:07,230
and what I mean is what you smell like
a,

2201
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,890
uh,
a carbohydrate like that.

2202
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,250
Uh,
like a crazy,

2203
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:11,710
it was all of a sudden,
whoa.

2204
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:13,840
Maybe not so much before.
No,

2205
01:33:13,841 --> 01:33:15,970
it's the opposite.
This is what's really strange about it.

2206
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:20,590
I what they've said,
what people have hypothesized and the

2207
01:33:20,591 --> 01:33:24,220
theories are that your gut bacteria
controls a lot of your appetite.

2208
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:27,850
And this is one of the reasons why I
used to be stuffed,

2209
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,700
like stuffed at the end of a meal and I
would still want sugar.

2210
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:33,270
I'd still wants to candy or it's still,
yeah,

2211
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,170
it's awful.
Right?

2212
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:39,120
You still want some pie all bring up on
her nose.

2213
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,630
Well,
now I don't,

2214
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:45,810
it's weird because of this show.
My body taking plenty of probiotics,

2215
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:47,890
uh,
drinking a lot of Kombucha,

2216
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,920
things along those lines.
I'm taking some probiotic supplements.

2217
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,950
You're you,
you introduce healthy bacteria into your

2218
01:33:53,951 --> 01:33:57,700
stomach and your gut and because of that
your shift,

2219
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:01,150
it shifts like what you're hungry for.
It's very strange.

2220
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:05,260
Like bread to me looks like a like why
don't you eat stuffing out of a

2221
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:07,600
mattress?
Like it looks like nonsense to me.

2222
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:09,850
It's very strange cause I used to see
like bread,

2223
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:13,430
someone bring out like a restaurant,
nice loaf of bread and butter.

2224
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,710
My,
Oh give me that.

2225
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:17,710
Be All excited.
Slap some butter on that bitch and eat

2226
01:34:17,711 --> 01:34:19,390
it up.
Now I look at him like that's not even

2227
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:20,530
food.
Like I said,

2228
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:23,350
it doesn't register to me as a two week
period of time.

2229
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:25,390
You have two weeks,
two weeks and you were such an

2230
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,283
unhealthy.

2231
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,150
I'm saying,
I mean I think part of it must be

2232
01:34:31,151 --> 01:34:34,810
psychological that I've decided that
this isn't food that I've made a shift

2233
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:37,510
in my mind because I'm not eating it.
I haven't eaten it in two weeks,

2234
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,110
but I think there's a real good argument
that it's gut bacteria.

2235
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:43,090
That's a big part of it because the
sugar,

2236
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:46,750
like they had like a dessert tray thing
and they brought it out at a restaurant

2237
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:48,030
I was at the other day,
you know,

2238
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,190
you know like the fancy place they bring
you like would you look dude,

2239
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:55,900
this wound you would need to be
[inaudible] and none of it looked good.

2240
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:58,430
It all looks like to me.
Whereas before I'd be like,

2241
01:34:58,431 --> 01:35:01,330
what am I going to fuck my body up?
I got to figure this out,

2242
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:04,640
we're going to take home with me.
It's very interesting stuff.

2243
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:05,820
And uh,
I,

2244
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,610
I'm,
I wanted to experiment with it because

2245
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:08,570
the guy was fascinating.

2246
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:10,040
He's very intelligent.
And I said,

2247
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:10,700
well,
well how,

2248
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,620
what does it hurt for me to try this
out?

2249
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:15,830
I thought it'd be an interesting topic
of discussion to do it first,

2250
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,690
you know,
60 days or so and then maybe even have

2251
01:35:17,691 --> 01:35:20,390
him back on or have someone else on that
advocates it.

2252
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:22,220
And,
and I've read people that don't advocate

2253
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,820
a carbohydrate rich diets.
And it seems to me that your body is

2254
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:29,150
pretty flexible in your body,
can exist on a bunch of different types

2255
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:31,790
of fuel and people get really dogmatic
about it.

2256
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,470
You know,
like you have to do it this way,

2257
01:35:33,471 --> 01:35:35,690
you have to do it that way.
And uh,

2258
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:37,610
I don't think,
I think it's all,

2259
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,350
there's also biodiversity,
right?

2260
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,240
There's different people come from
different climates.

2261
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:42,590
They come from different parts of the
world.

2262
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:46,550
Originally their ancestors did and I
think their bodies have become more

2263
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:50,720
acclimated to those types of foods.
And that was like the big issue with

2264
01:35:50,721 --> 01:35:53,810
native Americans when the European
showed up with alcohol and they

2265
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,600
literally didn't have the genes to
process this stuff,

2266
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,870
whereas Irish people processed shit like
that.

2267
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:00,110
Yeah,

2268
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:00,943
no.
Yeah.

2269
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:03,680
Italians,
it's interesting that you said that

2270
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:07,970
about probiotic because I've been taking
a probiotic for about 18 months now.

2271
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,760
Uh,
all the places where I got this advice

2272
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:15,170
was from my accountant and
he's a buddy.

2273
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,700
Uh,
or is it like a,

2274
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:18,440
I went over your taxes and which she
needed?

2275
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:21,650
No,
it's one of her clients.

2276
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:22,340
But,
um,

2277
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:27,340
I had been sick and she said something
about probiotics and honest to God,

2278
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:30,260
18 months,
I've been taking a probiotic every

2279
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:33,440
morning and I'm not been,
and I haven't done anything else

2280
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:34,820
different,
but I've been,

2281
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:38,240
uh,
not necessarily healthier but less ill,

2282
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,863
ill at all really.

2283
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,690
There's a,
an article I read once about skin flora

2284
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:47,720
and uh,
it was in regards to grappling cause a

2285
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:51,080
with Jujitsu and wrestling,
a big issue is ringworm.

2286
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,330
And even staff infection.
I've gotten both.

2287
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:54,321
Really?
Yeah,

2288
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:55,610
man,
it sucks that there were,

2289
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:57,590
the staff was real scary because,
um,

2290
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:00,530
my friend Tate Fletcher spotted it.
We were at an airport,

2291
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:03,080
we were hanging out,
getting ready to go on a plane and I

2292
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:06,230
just had my foot sitting up on my knee
and he's looking at the bottom of my

2293
01:37:06,231 --> 01:37:08,270
calf and he goes,
hey man,

2294
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:09,650
what's going on with your leg?
I go,

2295
01:37:09,651 --> 01:37:10,730
what?
He's like,

2296
01:37:10,731 --> 01:37:12,470
what's going to get at least like,
what's all this?

2297
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,453
I go,
what is it?

2298
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,230
He like,
there's little pimples on my ligament.

2299
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:15,861
I don't know.
He goes,

2300
01:37:15,861 --> 01:37:17,840
dude,
that looks like staff.

2301
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,400
Like are you serious?
And he goes,

2302
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:20,690
yeah,
I don't like that man.

2303
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:22,400
Go get that checked out because he,
you know,

2304
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,410
he uh,
fought,

2305
01:37:24,411 --> 01:37:26,330
has been grappling his whole life and he
had,

2306
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,130
he had caught it before.
I had never caught it.

2307
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:31,790
I caught ringworm before and I knew what
that looked like and so I was like,

2308
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,500
this is fucking pimples.
Like what is it?

2309
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,700
He's like,
I'm telling you,

2310
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:37,490
I think that staff,
so I go immediately to a dermatologist,

2311
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,350
take his advice and the guy goes,
Yup,

2312
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:43,280
you can get on some fucking antibiotics.
He gives me these horse pills of death.

2313
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,390
This stuff's awful.
These first of all antibiotics when you

2314
01:37:47,391 --> 01:37:51,920
have staff wrecks your entire system
because it doesn't just kill the staff.

2315
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:54,710
Yeah.
It kills all the healthy flora too.

2316
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:57,510
Yeah.
So just start over what they say to

2317
01:37:57,511 --> 01:38:01,650
counter that is to take probiotics once
you're done with your whole cycle,

2318
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,020
but also to prevent it in the future.

2319
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:07,130
You take healthy bacteria,
like a lot of acid off list,

2320
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:11,370
different forms of probiotics and you
are essentially giving your body

2321
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:16,371
soldiers to fight off infection.
And the skin flora changes when you take

2322
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:19,770
high doses of healthy acidophilus and
things along those lines.

2323
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,040
Your skin,
it's also like people that are Vegan.

2324
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:27,840
There's a some different probiotics like
raw sauerkraut,

2325
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,410
like raw sauerkraut has really good.
Kimchi is another one that's really

2326
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:33,390
good,
fantastic probiotic.

2327
01:38:33,391 --> 01:38:36,210
You're essentially taking it live
organisms that become a part of your

2328
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:40,050
body and their soldiers.
And these live organisms fight off

2329
01:38:40,051 --> 01:38:43,440
against shitty bacteria.
It's amazing stuff.

2330
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:46,710
Well,
part of the reason I was convinced other

2331
01:38:46,711 --> 01:38:51,230
than I get my medical advice
cheap is,

2332
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,390
uh,
in the other work that I do,

2333
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:57,340
I build and manage athletic fields.
Um,

2334
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:00,840
and there a huge movement to go towards
organic,

2335
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,160
uh,
uh,

2336
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:08,280
fertilization or cultural practices in
on athletic fields.

2337
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,040
You know,
this one facility that I manage,

2338
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,320
um,
before every tournament,

2339
01:39:13,321 --> 01:39:17,340
we'll get emails and calls from parents
who bring their eight year old and say,

2340
01:39:17,341 --> 01:39:19,140
well,
we're coming in from wherever and we

2341
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,510
would like to know what's been applied
to your fields.

2342
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:25,440
My son or daughter has a issue with
herbicide and tolerance or whatever.

2343
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:29,420
And I take that shit really seriously.
Um,

2344
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:34,640
we started using a compost from,
uh,

2345
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:39,570
both a facility nearby from the county,
but also from a supplier.

2346
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:42,510
And applying that as a part of our,
um,

2347
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,350
our regime cut,
we're able to cut back on fertilizer.

2348
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,330
And the other thing that was really
interesting is that,

2349
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:51,720
um,
a lot of the pathogens that we have

2350
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:53,640
issue with on,
and you see my golf courses,

2351
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:56,820
they get a different kinds of fungus
that affect the grasp because you're,

2352
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:59,100
it's,
you're putting water on it and you're

2353
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:04,101
feeding the shit out of it.
And by putting that compost on there,

2354
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:05,610
um,
and providing,

2355
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,580
you know,
essentially the organisms that are good

2356
01:40:08,581 --> 01:40:09,990
for the soil,
we're feeding the soil,

2357
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,780
not the plant,
which nitrogen that they,

2358
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,220
you know,
synthetic nitrogen or,

2359
01:40:14,221 --> 01:40:15,470
or,
uh,

2360
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,380
does.
And so what ends up happening is we're,

2361
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,810
we're feeding that soil and so now we've
got a whole environment there that,

2362
01:40:20,811 --> 01:40:21,860
that,
uh,

2363
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:25,830
turf grass has got an opportunity to
utilize everything that's in that soil

2364
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:27,620
and it's healthier.
Um,

2365
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,141
and,
you know,

2366
01:40:28,141 --> 01:40:32,190
we're kind of going the other,
we're going the other direction in,

2367
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:35,580
in everything from farming to grown
grass,

2368
01:40:35,581 --> 01:40:36,750
for kids to play soccer on it.

2369
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,560
Well,
I know a guy who lived near a golf

2370
01:40:38,561 --> 01:40:42,720
course growing up and the pesticides
that they use on the golf course fact

2371
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:47,140
the water supply and he got bone cancer
and cancer throughout his neighborhood.

2372
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:49,300
Everyone in his neighborhood was
affected.

2373
01:40:49,301 --> 01:40:53,440
Someone they knew got cancer.
It was rampant and it was just that were

2374
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:57,520
drinking the water that came from this
area where the had been contaminated

2375
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,430
because of a fucking golf course.
Yeah.

2376
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:00,553
Reaching in.
And,

2377
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,550
uh,
the one company that I work with,

2378
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:07,000
uh,
has built,

2379
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:08,860
uh,
been a part of a construction of a golf

2380
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:12,640
course that from day one was,
and it's actually certified organic,

2381
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:17,020
but it was better part of their process
all the way along and they control,

2382
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,880
you know,
the amount of traffic on it and all of

2383
01:41:18,881 --> 01:41:21,400
those sort of things too.
But it's a beautiful golf course and

2384
01:41:21,401 --> 01:41:23,160
they haven't used any,
uh,

2385
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:26,260
best sides or synthetic fertilizers on
it.

2386
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:30,510
One of the things that they had brought
up in that same article about organic

2387
01:41:30,511 --> 01:41:35,460
meat being healthier was the
incorporation of clover and with grass

2388
01:41:35,461 --> 01:41:37,560
and then somehow or another clover
helps.

2389
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:41,880
It helps sustain like a nitrogen balance
with the grasses.

2390
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:45,630
Like it's a,
clover is a nitrogen fixing plant.

2391
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,940
So if you,
you know,

2392
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:49,010
in a pasture we,
we,

2393
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:54,050
we introduced clover into our pastures
and so it fixes nitrogen into the soil

2394
01:41:55,951 --> 01:41:58,560
that's then available for the grasses
and uh,

2395
01:41:58,650 --> 01:42:02,070
white clovers and a lot of the things
that I actually plant in some of the

2396
01:42:02,071 --> 01:42:03,760
food plot stuff that we do for,
for deer.

2397
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,830
Yeah.
For deer.

2398
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:06,360
Um,
it's sweet.

2399
01:42:06,361 --> 01:42:09,690
It tastes good.
And it's also providing nitrogen to the

2400
01:42:09,691 --> 01:42:11,810
plants that need it.
Um,

2401
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,070
yeah.

2402
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:13,900
Nah.
And that's a big problem with things

2403
01:42:13,901 --> 01:42:18,901
like gigantic fields of only grain of
only corn or have only wheat that this,

2404
01:42:19,271 --> 01:42:24,271
it's not natural for one plant species
to be mano critter.

2405
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:26,530
Yeah.
That's not normal.

2406
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:27,460
Right.
That's not natural.

2407
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:30,070
And it's kind of like what you were
talking about when we were talking about

2408
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:34,750
these really interesting diverse
ecosystems that are created by these

2409
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:37,180
organic farms.
Like this one that you were,

2410
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:38,470
you were highlighting earlier.
Yeah.

2411
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,690
Yeah.
And so it is,

2412
01:42:41,691 --> 01:42:43,520
it's a,
it's a complete ecosystem.

2413
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,390
No Sir.
That's how it's supposed to be.

2414
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,370
Well,
the thing that gets me is that,

2415
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,660
you know,
this Mark Sheppard,

2416
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:49,820
I mean,
I,

2417
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,120
I've just page through it.
You know,

2418
01:42:51,121 --> 01:42:53,280
Doug's read more of it than I have,
but I mean,

2419
01:42:53,281 --> 01:42:55,710
you look at this and you read it and it
makes sense and you're like,

2420
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:56,700
wow,
this guy's a genius.

2421
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:01,590
But then you think about ancient
civilizations were doing things along

2422
01:43:01,591 --> 01:43:03,150
these lines.
Where did we lose that?

2423
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,860
You know,
where did that go away?

2424
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:09,150
We lost it with this factory farming and
we also lost it when we started putting

2425
01:43:09,151 --> 01:43:12,870
people in cities.
I think cities are a real big part of

2426
01:43:12,871 --> 01:43:16,830
our disconnect and also awesome.
I love cities.

2427
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:18,480
I love to be able to go to the and
implement.

2428
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:19,770
Yeah,
I like getting like highway,

2429
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:23,490
like the guy you mentioned the guy you
mentioned Joel,

2430
01:43:23,491 --> 01:43:24,390
that girls this shit.

2431
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:27,540
Yeah,
no that was,

2432
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,950
that was um,
Ron Finley,

2433
01:43:28,951 --> 01:43:31,350
you know you've heard of Joel Salitan
has been on the podcast.

2434
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,790
Yeah,
he's Aussie.

2435
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,100
I was going to reference him.
He's amazing.

2436
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,680
He's got some amazing books.
You know,

2437
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:40,650
he's got a lot of books on a really
interesting strategy for like letting

2438
01:43:40,651 --> 01:43:42,570
pigs and all these different animals
graze.

2439
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:45,060
And so what he does is he sets up this
perimeter fence,

2440
01:43:45,061 --> 01:43:48,450
this large like mildly charged fan stuff
that go to it.

2441
01:43:48,451 --> 01:43:50,550
It's a irritates them.
And they said they don't run over the

2442
01:43:50,551 --> 01:43:53,990
fence and then he moves,
it moves the fence and they graze in new

2443
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:56,910
area so they don't just distraught.
Yeah.

2444
01:43:57,110 --> 01:44:00,590
They don't just end their living as if
they were wild.

2445
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:03,410
They're essentially grazing off acorns,
things along those lines.

2446
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:08,270
And it just giant areas where they roam
and forage and they eat just like a wild

2447
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:08,710
pig.

2448
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,150
And because of that,
their flesh is very different.

2449
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,770
But that's what you got in your freezer
now dude,

2450
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,780
well this is,
this is elk,

2451
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:17,030
but I have a one kid from my free smart
home.

2452
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,430
You got to pay.
Yeah,

2453
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,840
we your them.
Oh,

2454
01:44:20,841 --> 01:44:23,240
okay.
Well that's the way to do it.

2455
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:25,700
I mean it's a different kind of meat.
It looks different.

2456
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,830
You know what I mean?
It has a deeper,

2457
01:44:27,831 --> 01:44:29,330
darker,
richer color.

2458
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:32,240
And that's one of the things that I
noticed when we shot when Rinella and I

2459
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:37,130
shot a pig at the till hone ranch.
It was thick with fat from acorns and

2460
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:38,200
its texture.
The,

2461
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:41,090
the meat was like a dark red and it was
delicious.

2462
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:42,140
It's a different animal.

2463
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:45,530
Isn't it an interesting like with beef,
um,

2464
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:48,250
I still eat the occasional,
uh,

2465
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:50,680
beef that,
uh,

2466
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,090
that I might not know where it came
from,

2467
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,620
right?
Not very often,

2468
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:54,760
but are,
there's one,

2469
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:55,930
uh,
one place,

2470
01:44:56,140 --> 01:45:00,070
one restaurant at a nearby or place that
I go to and he finishes his beef with,

2471
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,690
uh,
with corn.

2472
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:03,130
Oh.
But it's mostly,

2473
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:04,190
you know,
grass fed,

2474
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:08,370
but he's still sort of old school with
the marble it to yeah,

2475
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:13,480
I taste the difference between,
of course she tasted his difference

2476
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:14,920
between Venice soon because really
again,

2477
01:45:14,921 --> 01:45:17,680
I don't have this wide experience of
hunting and in,

2478
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:19,700
in different areas and having meet from
different areas.

2479
01:45:19,701 --> 01:45:24,430
So I am excited like your elk,
but so the venison to grass fed beef to

2480
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,650
corn fed beef.
Um,

2481
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:29,440
and it's been a long time since I've had
something that I,

2482
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:31,360
like I said where I didn't know where it
came from,

2483
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:34,690
but I can tell you when it was,
when it was a fat cattle,

2484
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,460
they call them.
Um,

2485
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,950
I feel like after I get done eating a
piece of meat like that,

2486
01:45:38,951 --> 01:45:40,540
like I have a little prime rib or
something.

2487
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:42,960
When they go out on a Saturday night,
I feel like I should take a knife and

2488
01:45:42,961 --> 01:45:44,620
he's like scraped that fed off of my
tongue.

2489
01:45:44,621 --> 01:45:46,990
It just has a completely different
tastes and that just,

2490
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:52,080
I'm not interested in anymore.
And so my taste has changed that way.

2491
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:54,930
Um,
so

2492
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:59,710
it's very tender,
but it's also because that animals dying

2493
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:04,090
animal,
you're eating a sumo wrestler,

2494
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:05,980
you know,
ain't no slob.

2495
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:06,971
What are the,
what's that?

2496
01:46:06,971 --> 01:46:08,530
Uh,
where the massage them?

2497
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:09,503
Yeah.
Colby.

2498
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:14,130
Yeah.
Or why you are the more common as I say,

2499
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:17,470
why do you I don't like that stuff man.
I've had it before.

2500
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:19,480
I mean it's okay,
but it's just,

2501
01:46:19,481 --> 01:46:24,430
it's so fucking soft and weird.
It's like why w w how the fuck is this

2502
01:46:24,431 --> 01:46:27,790
muscle carrying this animal around?
Gelatinous?

2503
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,140
It's weird.

2504
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:30,940
I'll take it to even more of an extreme
and,

2505
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:33,250
and uh,
and that is a veal.

2506
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:37,540
There was down the road from our old
friend who had the issue with us when we

2507
01:46:37,541 --> 01:46:40,510
were hunting and he would call and leave
me those crazy message

2508
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,750
just before,

2509
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:46,350
before he will in that place.
It was owned by another guy who raised

2510
01:46:46,351 --> 01:46:48,930
veal and,
and when I was younger I helped out up

2511
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,810
once in a while.
And how you helped out was to help him

2512
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:56,870
load the veal.
Those animals are in a cage where they

2513
01:46:56,881 --> 01:47:01,500
essentially can't turn a box where they
can barely turn around and they're being

2514
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:02,660
fed,
you know,

2515
01:47:02,661 --> 01:47:07,661
a milk replacer powdery that you mix
with water and it's kind of a liquid.

2516
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:11,850
And that's all they're getting.
And the best looking veal calves,

2517
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,730
calves,
where the last animal I ever wanted to

2518
01:47:14,731 --> 01:47:16,950
eat,
I mean it smelled bad.

2519
01:47:16,951 --> 01:47:19,470
It,
there was nothing good about it.

2520
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,380
Muscles aren't developed.
They're not,

2521
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:23,000
they don't want them to develop,
you know,

2522
01:47:23,001 --> 01:47:24,410
crazy thing.
I don't,

2523
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:27,380
I don't even understand that.
I don't understand how it got started

2524
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,330
and I don't understand why people keep
eating it.

2525
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,330
Well,
people eat lutefisk I mean,

2526
01:47:31,331 --> 01:47:33,580
that's weird.
Lutefisk what does that look like?

2527
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:35,890
Well,
it's ludicrous.

2528
01:47:35,891 --> 01:47:37,110
So I was like,
what did he do wrong?

2529
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:40,070
But fish in a,
what is it a lie?

2530
01:47:40,210 --> 01:47:40,761
Yeah.
Well,

2531
01:47:40,761 --> 01:47:41,541
I mean,
yeah,

2532
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,970
they took it to mean we shouldn't think
it's a survival thing.

2533
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:45,980
The Vikings did it on ships and stuff,
but people still,

2534
01:47:45,981 --> 01:47:47,210
it's more,
it's a tradition thing,

2535
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:47,901
but,
oh,

2536
01:47:47,901 --> 01:47:51,000
so it's literally lie,
lie.

2537
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:54,110
I mean,
but in lie poisonous,

2538
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:56,020
this is real.
I'm like,

2539
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:59,300
fuck is this?
And it's weird.

2540
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:02,350
I mean,
you want to talk gelatinous by Fred.

2541
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:05,570
Learn Hanson is standing up with his
hands in the air right now.

2542
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:08,510
It's an older machine.
Regions are awesome.

2543
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:10,820
I just got to say that.
Oh my God,

2544
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,840
what?
That's weird.

2545
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:16,640
Eerie wines with Lutefisk.
Oh God.

2546
01:48:16,641 --> 01:48:19,760
It's looks like Jizz look at it.
It's like,

2547
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:23,480
it's like slime,
like snail slime.

2548
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,310
And I,
I've never had veal,

2549
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:26,810
but I've had this and that,
you know,

2550
01:48:26,811 --> 01:48:29,780
it's gotta be what does this light,
but yeah,

2551
01:48:29,781 --> 01:48:31,210
but this is just a,
well it was,

2552
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:33,300
it was five.
Yeah.

2553
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:35,230
And it's just tradition now,
but people,

2554
01:48:35,231 --> 01:48:36,320
it is,
it tastes like,

2555
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:37,920
I can't even describe it.
I don't,

2556
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,580
I think I blocked it out in my mind.
Well,

2557
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:42,283
see what they,
these,

2558
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,440
these Norway and the Norwegian areas of,
of Wisconsin,

2559
01:48:45,441 --> 01:48:47,120
they have these dinners,
you know,

2560
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:49,820
lutefisk dinners for fundraisers and
such,

2561
01:48:49,821 --> 01:48:51,950
but they also have,
they have other things.

2562
01:48:51,951 --> 01:48:52,770
So you try,
you know,

2563
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:57,770
my whole thing was money out of respect.
I'll take a bite of lutefisk and then,

2564
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:59,930
and then I watched that dawn with some
like,

2565
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:03,260
you know,
Swedish meatballs and you know,

2566
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:04,540
left.
So you know,

2567
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:06,380
and just soaked in,
just get it out of your mouth.

2568
01:49:06,381 --> 01:49:09,050
It's one of those things like what's the
other thing you washed down with Swedish

2569
01:49:09,051 --> 01:49:10,670
meatballs and I have,
so it's like a little,

2570
01:49:10,671 --> 01:49:14,540
isn't it a potato bread type?
Almost like a Tortilla

2571
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,820
show here you guys are eating raccoons.

2572
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:25,910
Ludicrous smelt fees,
smelt feet,

2573
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:30,190
little tiny fishy scoop bub and giant
and deep fry.

2574
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,420
The fry eat the whole thing,
right?

2575
01:49:32,421 --> 01:49:34,760
Guts and all that much.
What is that like?

2576
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,170
It's,
it's really good.

2577
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,930
I mean we are wrestling club.
Oh not so good.

2578
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:40,780
I like it.
I like

2579
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:45,350
the favorite thing,
but I mean it's not your Friday anything

2580
01:49:45,351 --> 01:49:46,610
and it's pretty good,
you know,

2581
01:49:46,611 --> 01:49:49,030
I mean we'll fry bread and all that
jazz.

2582
01:49:49,031 --> 01:49:50,920
I guess I do tartar sauce.
You put the,

2583
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:55,210
doesn't have the amount of Bun and
chow down and make some money for the

2584
01:49:55,211 --> 01:49:57,340
wrestling club.
Well you gotta do what you gotta do if

2585
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:59,410
you're home beavers,
there's a TV show.

2586
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:02,340
I think money from the wrestling club
from fucking,

2587
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:06,400
this is how do you make this connection?
It's a fundraiser.

2588
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:07,151
Yeah.
That's what we do.

2589
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:08,800
That's how we make money.
We have feeds,

2590
01:50:08,801 --> 01:50:10,270
Ludovic speeds,
stake feeds,

2591
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:11,080
bare feet,
you know,

2592
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,930
and it's,
it's that real creative

2593
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:14,780
comes to uh,
uh,

2594
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:16,630
raising money,
I guess.

2595
01:50:16,631 --> 01:50:17,410
Although we have the,

2596
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,850
the Cazenovia,
this is one plug.

2597
01:50:18,851 --> 01:50:21,530
I do want to put it,
the Cazenovia Turkey busters fishery

2598
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:24,550
coming up this week.
Turkey busters fishery.

2599
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:26,861
What is it?
Turkey.

2600
01:50:26,861 --> 01:50:27,590
Buster.
Well,

2601
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:28,060
first,
well,

2602
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:31,780
it's a sportsman's club.
I don't think we have a website or

2603
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:33,220
anything,
so I wouldn't look it up.

2604
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:34,103
But,
uh,

2605
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:36,600
uh,
so it's a sportsman's club and in

2606
01:50:36,601 --> 01:50:37,650
Cazenovia,
which is,

2607
01:50:37,651 --> 01:50:39,030
you know,
250 people,

2608
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:43,530
it's sort of the lion's Club,
the knights of Columbus,

2609
01:50:43,531 --> 01:50:45,780
the every,
you know,

2610
01:50:45,781 --> 01:50:47,910
the rotary,
it's everybody put together.

2611
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:52,440
It's just this group of dudes who are
really into Turkey hunting and call

2612
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:54,520
themselves the Turkey buster busters.
Yeah.

2613
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,593
And,
uh,

2614
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:56,980
why do we have a fishery?
Well,

2615
01:50:56,981 --> 01:50:58,680
I have this little,
uh,

2616
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:01,150
Lake [inaudible] Lake there in
Cazenovia.

2617
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:05,020
And one of the things that we do is that
with the money that we raised as a stock

2618
01:51:05,021 --> 01:51:06,960
it with walleyes and other,
um,

2619
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:09,070
game fish.
And,

2620
01:51:09,071 --> 01:51:10,930
uh,
uh,

2621
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:14,770
so one of the things that we do is have
this fishery which is on the ice.

2622
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:19,150
So it's a,
essentially ice fishing tournament would

2623
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:21,600
be the wrong word.
Um,

2624
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:26,880
although there are prizes for like the
biggest blue Gill and the biggest bass

2625
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:28,240
and,
and that kind of thing.

2626
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:30,520
Um,
but mostly it's a thing where people

2627
01:51:30,521 --> 01:51:33,250
come to when you have raffles and,
um,

2628
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:35,220
it's the social event of the season.

2629
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:37,870
Cazenovia oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2630
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:41,920
Jesus,
don't get it.

2631
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:43,660
They are lying.
But all they have,

2632
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:47,890
all they have,
all they have is the phone number and

2633
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:50,170
contact.
This is at Cazenovia memorial park

2634
01:51:50,171 --> 01:51:52,420
contact.
Chuck Keller called the Tower Online.

2635
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:54,940
Whatever you do,
we've already said too much.

2636
01:51:56,330 --> 01:52:00,040
If they have a website,
they're getting Dick pics right now as

2637
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:01,310
you speak.
Wow.

2638
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:04,510
Yeah.
So those are different ways that,

2639
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:06,490
and you know,
and some of the stuff that we've also

2640
01:52:06,491 --> 01:52:08,870
done is um,
uh,

2641
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:13,280
donate it bought and donated like white
archery bows or uh,

2642
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,240
Matthew's bows to uh,
uh,

2643
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:18,190
the,
to the schools,

2644
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,113
uh,

2645
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:20,650
physical education program.
Oh,

2646
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:21,610
that's cool.
Yeah.

2647
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:22,960
That's awesome.
If they still do that,

2648
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:24,370
that's very cool.
Yeah.

2649
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:29,490
So this is a little organization of,
of a bunch of guys who get together once

2650
01:52:29,591 --> 01:52:32,350
her did depends on the time of the year,
once or twice a month then well,

2651
01:52:32,351 --> 01:52:35,500
there's certainly a benefit to having a
small community like that where

2652
01:52:35,501 --> 01:52:39,190
everybody really does care about the
welfare of the community and cares about

2653
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:42,820
all these different things like red
wrestling team needing money for

2654
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:45,980
uniforms and things along those lines.
We lose a lot

2655
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,630
of that.
When you have big cities,

2656
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:50,090
this is,
there's so much to gain in a big city,

2657
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:53,630
but there's so much to lose to,
and it's like we were talking earlier

2658
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:56,480
about the diffusion of responsibility
that you have when there's 20 million

2659
01:52:56,481 --> 01:52:58,640
people.
You see somebody with their fucking car

2660
01:52:58,641 --> 01:53:00,920
broken down the side of the road.
I don't even think about stopping.

2661
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:03,350
Well I hope this asshole as aaa,
you know,

2662
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:07,010
Brown pass by.
But if you're on some country road and

2663
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:09,170
you see someone broken down,
you think one or two things,

2664
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:11,270
I hope this guy,
he's not a serial killer and I should

2665
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:11,990
probably try to help him.

2666
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:12,580
Yeah,
exactly.

2667
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:14,900
Those are the two things you think.
And the other thing out in our,

2668
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:18,530
our territory when you're driving right
in our area when you're driving around

2669
01:53:18,531 --> 01:53:20,210
is you wave to everybody.
Yeah,

2670
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:21,103
yeah.
She'd drive or not.

2671
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:22,910
It might not be putting your hand up
like this or anything,

2672
01:53:22,911 --> 01:53:24,050
but yeah.
At least to driving on little.

2673
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:26,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

2674
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:30,410
That's nice.
You know that that is definitely missing

2675
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:32,150
on the highway cause otherwise he'd be
fucking

2676
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:39,860
break.
You know,

2677
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,930
it's a saint as you
know.

2678
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:44,810
It's all weird in that

2679
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:46,330
it is weird.
People are weird,

2680
01:53:46,331 --> 01:53:50,230
but cities are especially weird because
I don't think this is a normal thing.

2681
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:51,093
I don't know what,
well,

2682
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:55,090
we've only had them for the last couple
hundred years in this sort of magnitude

2683
01:53:55,091 --> 01:53:57,400
that we have now,
like with New York and La and things

2684
01:53:57,401 --> 01:54:00,280
along those lines.
Just to have so many people jammed into

2685
01:54:00,281 --> 01:54:04,480
an area like this.
And as we started this conversation,

2686
01:54:04,481 --> 01:54:08,800
have a complete disconnect as to where
your food comes from and that the food

2687
01:54:08,801 --> 01:54:12,850
is coming from life,
whether it's plant life or whether it's

2688
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,490
animal life,
your food comes from life.

2689
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,570
Life eats life,

2690
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,540
allogenic London.
Is that

2691
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:22,990
what the Seawolf we were just talking
about this.

2692
01:54:22,991 --> 01:54:23,980
Yeah.
What'd he say?

2693
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:24,821
Um,
well,

2694
01:54:24,821 --> 01:54:25,700
it's a,
this character,

2695
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:28,540
it's this old pirate in this book called
the Sea Sea Wolf.

2696
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:33,690
I knew it was going to get a pirate
fan of pirates who isn't man cards are

2697
01:54:34,751 --> 01:54:37,050
awesome.
I mean,

2698
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,310
you know,
maybe not to the new age ones.

2699
01:54:39,311 --> 01:54:40,470
The Somalis are,
well yeah,

2700
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:42,330
they're a little different.
But you know,

2701
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:44,590
those are the,
not without my sympathy as well.

2702
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,410
Everybody's got an agenda and
everybody's got a reason to fight.

2703
01:54:47,411 --> 01:54:49,060
You know,
they have a very,

2704
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,020
well,
we'll get into that.

2705
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:52,300
This specific pirate,
his whole,

2706
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:55,650
you know,
he's a loner and his whole thing in the

2707
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:58,390
conversation throughout the book is he
talks about it as a yeast,

2708
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:01,540
yeast eats life.
And his whole contention is

2709
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:05,050
what the fuck matters.
Life eats life.

2710
01:55:05,051 --> 01:55:07,930
I mean,
you could make an argument like you're

2711
01:55:07,931 --> 01:55:08,890
going to be dead,
you're going to be dead,

2712
01:55:08,891 --> 01:55:09,940
you're gonna be dead.
Who gives a fuck?

2713
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,410
Who gives a fuck what happens?
You know?

2714
01:55:11,411 --> 01:55:12,100
I mean,
people's,

2715
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:13,780
that's not a very nice way to look at
things,

2716
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:14,643
you know?
But it is,

2717
01:55:14,650 --> 01:55:15,730
it's,
I mean,

2718
01:55:15,731 --> 01:55:16,690
it's a fact,
you know,

2719
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:19,620
as a fact.
But also this moment right now is

2720
01:55:19,621 --> 01:55:20,640
enjoyable.
Oh,

2721
01:55:20,641 --> 01:55:23,730
absolutely.
I have a problem with that sort of

2722
01:55:23,731 --> 01:55:26,250
absolute sort of,
you know,

2723
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,300
worrying about the end and not,
no,

2724
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,060
absolutely.
The moment is enjoyable.

2725
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:32,850
Like an l sit.
All comradery and friendship and a good

2726
01:55:32,851 --> 01:55:34,980
meal with friends is one of the best
things you can have in life.

2727
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:39,450
Adventures and things that you enjoy,
activities that you like to participate

2728
01:55:39,451 --> 01:55:41,040
in.
Those are very enjoyable.

2729
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:45,840
And I think that's what life is.
Life is about these friendships and

2730
01:55:45,841 --> 01:55:47,970
these enjoyable moments that we have
with each other.

2731
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:50,820
So this is absolute ideas that people
have,

2732
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:52,260
but what is the point,
man?

2733
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:53,101
Yes,
but again,

2734
01:55:53,101 --> 01:55:54,660
it's all going to end,
man.

2735
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:55,590
Well,
okay,

2736
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:57,690
you could look at it that way.
It's like what's the point in playing

2737
01:55:57,691 --> 01:55:59,430
the game?
The is going to be over one day.

2738
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,980
Do you not enjoy the fucking game?
Enjoy the game.

2739
01:56:03,170 --> 01:56:05,790
We saw sitting on the steps today.
You know,

2740
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:08,700
you know,
just sitting there in Hollywood,

2741
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:12,270
just poisoned Fox.
They're poisoned by the brake dust.

2742
01:56:12,271 --> 01:56:13,890
It's fucking flying through the air
everywhere.

2743
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:17,280
Shit's terrible for you.
Hopefully different smells out here,

2744
01:56:17,281 --> 01:56:19,050
man.
This brake dust is terrible.

2745
01:56:19,051 --> 01:56:21,210
It's one of the one things that people
don't talk about,

2746
01:56:21,211 --> 01:56:23,520
about living in urban environments that
you don't.

2747
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,530
You go to your car,
you know that shit.

2748
01:56:25,531 --> 01:56:28,080
If you have a wheel and you see that
stuff on the outside of your wheel,

2749
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,570
you're breathing that.
You're breathing that everywhere.

2750
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,600
Especially if you live in New York or if
you live in La and there's constant

2751
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:35,970
traffic going by you.
Every time they hit the brakes,

2752
01:56:35,971 --> 01:56:38,400
a little bit of fucking dust gets up in
the air and that stuff,

2753
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:41,310
and you're dealing with millions and
millions of cars and stuff permeates the

2754
01:56:41,311 --> 01:56:41,780
environment.

2755
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:45,690
It's terrible for you.
People's People's vault,

2756
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,370
the voluntary coast guard,
if Somalia,

2757
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,140
that's what the pirates called
themselves.

2758
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:52,980
The reason why they started doing
pirating in Somalia,

2759
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:56,190
because they were fishermen,
they fishermen and these assholes from

2760
01:56:56,191 --> 01:57:00,270
Europe and Russia were dumping toxic
waste off their shores,

2761
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:02,730
nuclear waste,
toxic chemical waste.

2762
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:05,580
And it was killing all the fish.
So what they started doing was

2763
01:57:05,581 --> 01:57:08,850
kidnapping the people that were in the
boat that we're doing the dumping.

2764
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,060
So these fishermen who were fucking
starving to death because they,

2765
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:14,280
all of a sudden they're,
their waters were polluted.

2766
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,890
They started going after these guys and
kidnapping them.

2767
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:18,090
Then they realized,
hey,

2768
01:57:18,091 --> 01:57:21,240
we get way more fucking money from
kidnapping people than we do from

2769
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:22,950
fishing.
They became pirates.

2770
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,280
And so they also started taking this
stuff called cat.

2771
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,880
And this is a,
it's,

2772
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:31,170
it's a narcotic.
It's a stimulant that they,

2773
01:57:31,171 --> 01:57:32,004
uh,
they take.

2774
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:35,460
It's like a plant that they chew and it
gives them like,

2775
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,530
like it's like a fucking meth type
plant.

2776
01:57:37,531 --> 01:57:39,410
I don't know the exact uh,
pull,

2777
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,620
pull that up.
I think it's k,

2778
01:57:40,621 --> 01:57:41,790
h,
a t,

2779
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:44,310
but it's a stimulant that they chew all
the time.

2780
01:57:44,311 --> 01:57:47,550
It's one of the reasons why the people
are so there it is cat to be banned in

2781
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:50,760
the UK.
They see like this guy's eating chewing

2782
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:51,610
on these,
uh,

2783
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:56,660
these leaves and it produces popup up a
website or a web description instead of

2784
01:57:57,181 --> 01:57:59,610
an image and we'll find out what is the
actual,

2785
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:01,770
um,
go to all set of images.

2786
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:06,140
It's Kinda like a big league chew on
there.

2787
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:09,240
Yeah.
This is a as scene in that movie.

2788
01:58:09,241 --> 01:58:10,950
Captain Phillips.
Yeah.

2789
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:13,560
Though this or this,
this stuff is,

2790
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:16,830
it's a,
it's a drug and these people take it.

2791
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:19,650
It's an alkaloid.
Yeah.

2792
01:58:19,651 --> 01:58:23,640
Here it is.
Catherine known or it's an amphetamine

2793
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:26,250
amphetamine like stimulant,
which has said to cause excitement,

2794
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:29,520
a loss of appetite and euphoria.
And so these guys take this,

2795
01:58:29,521 --> 01:58:32,550
they get jacked on this cat,
k,

2796
01:58:32,551 --> 01:58:33,121
h,
a,

2797
01:58:33,121 --> 01:58:34,410
t.
And.

2798
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:36,630
M.
They would go out and fucking kidnap

2799
01:58:36,631 --> 01:58:39,030
people.
Well,

2800
01:58:39,031 --> 01:58:39,930
that's the thing too,
you know,

2801
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:40,973
I mean,
my initial,

2802
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,300
when I said,
except

2803
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,810
Somali pirates,
I mean,

2804
01:58:43,811 --> 01:58:48,280
that's how we tell history is from
Captain Phillips side.

2805
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:49,690
You know,
and that's like the Howard Zinn thing.

2806
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:51,310
Howard Zinn tells it from the other
side,

2807
01:58:51,311 --> 01:58:53,140
you know,
so let me retract that.

2808
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:55,880
I like Somali pirates a little bit too.
You know what you guys got to,

2809
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:56,920
uh,
you know,

2810
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,940
they've got a reason to fight.

2811
01:58:58,010 --> 01:58:59,660
They got fucked.
It's for the longest time,

2812
01:58:59,661 --> 01:59:02,270
they were incredibly peaceful people.
Somalians were very peaceful.

2813
01:59:02,330 --> 01:59:02,961
They,
you know,

2814
01:59:02,961 --> 01:59:05,330
they weren't out there,
Robin and trying to Jack People,

2815
01:59:05,331 --> 01:59:07,880
they were fishermen.
And when the Europeans started dumping

2816
01:59:07,881 --> 01:59:10,370
that stuff off their shores,
they had to take a new approach.

2817
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:14,540
They had to just adapt,
improvise,

2818
01:59:14,541 --> 01:59:15,420
overcome.
Yeah.

2819
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:17,540
But again,
where's that coming from?

2820
01:59:17,541 --> 01:59:18,510
Coming from,
you know,

2821
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:21,890
large scale human beings living in these
giant civilizations,

2822
01:59:21,891 --> 01:59:24,350
creating waste.
They don't know what to do with some

2823
01:59:24,351 --> 01:59:28,130
Dick hole decides to dump it off the
coast of Africa because they don't have

2824
01:59:28,131 --> 01:59:29,090
any say in the matter.
You know,

2825
01:59:29,091 --> 01:59:32,010
they didn't want to dump it in the then
the London Bay.

2826
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:35,170
Yeah.
So they decided to do that here too long

2827
01:59:35,171 --> 01:59:38,480
to do it all day.
Does that make loosen standards so that

2828
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:41,960
companies can put more in?
That's a big deal with New York City as

2829
01:59:41,961 --> 01:59:44,540
well.
The Hudson River's fucking deserted

2830
01:59:44,541 --> 01:59:46,430
wasteland.
It was at one point in time,

2831
01:59:46,431 --> 01:59:48,540
they're dredging it up now and starting
to uh,

2832
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,100
to clean it and,
and trying to uh,

2833
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:56,200
really impose very strict regulations on
the amount of waste that gets in it.

2834
01:59:56,850 --> 01:59:59,720
But these large animal facilities,
same thing.

2835
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:00,680
Yeah,
exactly.

2836
02:00:00,681 --> 02:00:03,680
Where we put this stuff and you see
these trucks going up into these big

2837
02:00:03,681 --> 02:00:04,760
tank trucks full of,

2838
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,440
and they had the hall it really far
because they don't have enough,

2839
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:10,740
they're renting land all over.
So they're hauling it as a big issue in

2840
02:00:10,741 --> 02:00:14,190
our areas is the weight on the roads.
And so then,

2841
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:15,570
you know,
and the farmers,

2842
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:18,210
you know,
they didn't want to be taxed or

2843
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:19,044
anything.
So they,

2844
02:00:19,230 --> 02:00:21,810
I believe there's a compromise where it
wasn't a road tax,

2845
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:25,410
but they made him have another axle.
So it spread the weight out and wasn't,

2846
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:26,550
you know,
turn the hell out of the

2847
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:27,261
roads.
Oh,

2848
02:00:27,261 --> 02:00:29,030
so the actual physical weight on the
road,

2849
02:00:29,031 --> 02:00:31,280
is that why they go to the giant tankers
doing,

2850
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,280
I always wondered why they weighed them.

2851
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:35,910
Well in our neck of the woods again,
um,

2852
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:39,210
a lot of the roads were just gravel
roads and then over time they did this

2853
02:00:39,211 --> 02:00:41,460
thing called tarn chip.
So I grabbed the road.

2854
02:00:41,461 --> 02:00:44,440
It's not built in,
it doesn't have any particular engineer.

2855
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,770
Well this was supposed to have some
engineering standards,

2856
02:00:46,771 --> 02:00:48,080
but fun as possible.
Yeah.

2857
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:51,900
And there aren't any engineering
standards,

2858
02:00:51,901 --> 02:00:56,040
but gravel roads are a bitch to keep up.
So they started to Taryn chip them.

2859
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:56,831
So it's,
you know,

2860
02:00:56,831 --> 02:01:00,630
it's a poor man's a blacktop.
So you put uh,

2861
02:01:00,810 --> 02:01:02,940
or asphalt,
so you put this tar down and then go

2862
02:01:02,941 --> 02:01:05,190
over the top of it.
And I could have pea gravel,

2863
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:08,310
pea gravel stuff and it all binds
together and then over 10 people keep

2864
02:01:08,311 --> 02:01:10,710
driving on.
And over time it actually seals it up.

2865
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:13,380
And if you're just driving over it with
cars and pickup trucks,

2866
02:01:13,381 --> 02:01:16,610
it's okay.
But now here comes big tanker truck or

2867
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:17,810
being taker,
uh,

2868
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:20,430
w you know,
behind a monster tractor and you know,

2869
02:01:20,431 --> 02:01:23,580
it's breaking down the sides of the
roads and it ends up being an issue for

2870
02:01:23,581 --> 02:01:25,200
us.
And as nate said,

2871
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:28,290
they're having to haul this stuff
further for cause you can only put so

2872
02:01:28,291 --> 02:01:32,040
much shit on so much ground.
And the shit that they are putting out

2873
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:33,890
there is,
uh,

2874
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:35,861
you know,
it's,

2875
02:01:35,861 --> 02:01:39,800
it's liquid manure that's going into
these tanks or into these

2876
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,850
facilities and newer liquid.
Oh,

2877
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:45,310
it's nuts.
It's just found a new way to torch the

2878
02:01:45,311 --> 02:01:46,300
terrorist.
And there's a,

2879
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,770
there's a double standard with it.
Um,

2880
02:01:48,990 --> 02:01:50,450
[inaudible] so he got this massive
model,

2881
02:01:50,451 --> 02:01:51,540
liquid manure.
You don't,

2882
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,400
they,
they're not going to store it.

2883
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:53,960
They're not going to compost it or
anything like that.

2884
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,510
So like right now we've got a nice snow
pack,

2885
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,520
12 inches,
and they're spread it on top of the

2886
02:01:58,521 --> 02:01:59,840
snow.
So,

2887
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:00,660
and,
and,

2888
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:02,390
and just to illustrate the double
standard,

2889
02:02:02,391 --> 02:02:03,770
I got family that,
uh,

2890
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:05,420
is in the septic business,
you know,

2891
02:02:05,421 --> 02:02:08,720
so if they go out,
if they spread this shit on a certain

2892
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:09,710
slope,
human shit,

2893
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:12,620
human shit from like holding tanks are
pumping out.

2894
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:14,100
So spread it.
Yeah,

2895
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:15,560
we'll see.
Here's the thing though.

2896
02:02:15,630 --> 02:02:18,140
It,
they spread it on the snow and if they

2897
02:02:18,141 --> 02:02:19,100
do it over,
have you,

2898
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:20,440
if they do it over,
uh,

2899
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:23,980
he said that because Jamie just pulled
up liquid I newer spreaders and tool

2900
02:02:23,981 --> 02:02:27,080
bars for the people that are listening
and I've added added axles,

2901
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:27,890
you know,
that's a new thing.

2902
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:31,280
They used to have one axle just spread
and it was just too much on the road.

2903
02:02:31,281 --> 02:02:34,520
But so a septic dude,
he goes out there to get rid of this

2904
02:02:34,521 --> 02:02:37,220
human shit.
And if he does it on a certain grade,

2905
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:41,730
he'll get a giant fine from the dnr.
But a farmer goes out and does it and

2906
02:02:41,731 --> 02:02:42,440
it's say,
hey,

2907
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,820
you know,
so human shit,

2908
02:02:43,821 --> 02:02:45,050
a farmer can dump human.
No,

2909
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:47,420
no.
A farmer can go dump cow shit.

2910
02:02:47,421 --> 02:02:48,350
And the thing is,
you know,

2911
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:50,420
in the end,
I mean shit a shit a shit.

2912
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:51,283
You know what I mean

2913
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,031
though,
right?

2914
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:54,280
Because cow shit is just,
they're eating grass.

2915
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,480
So like manure

2916
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:57,950
facilities,
they're not $30 kid.

2917
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:00,210
Right.
And you know,

2918
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:03,770
obviously this,
when the snow melts and you know that,

2919
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:06,370
that a lot of that shit is going into
the stream.

2920
02:03:06,371 --> 02:03:08,950
So like we're doug and I,
you know,

2921
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:11,530
we really value our shit.
You know,

2922
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:12,790
we keep it,
we compost it,

2923
02:03:12,791 --> 02:03:15,310
we turn it into something with value.
[inaudible] that's a waste.

2924
02:03:15,311 --> 02:03:18,220
It's going into the water and polluting
and it's a waste of money.

2925
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,180
The drone footage,
they did it.

2926
02:03:21,181 --> 02:03:24,090
This pig farm,
this guy.

2927
02:03:24,091 --> 02:03:26,090
I've seen some,
I don't know if not a particular memory

2928
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,960
that you would probably agree with.
I agree with.

2929
02:03:27,961 --> 02:03:30,600
And those,
those people in the cowspiracy

2930
02:03:30,601 --> 02:03:34,470
documentary certain degree with is that
there's something evil about these ag

2931
02:03:34,471 --> 02:03:36,120
gag laws.
Oh yeah.

2932
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:39,060
Crazy shit.
Where you're not supposed to film

2933
02:03:39,061 --> 02:03:41,970
atrocities that are being committed in
these factory farms.

2934
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,580
Well,
this guy got a drone and he flew it over

2935
02:03:44,581 --> 02:03:49,581
this pig farm and they have a goddamn a
lake of pig piss.

2936
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:52,100
It is gigantic.
And it's,

2937
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:56,430
they have these things where the pigs
live these cages.

2938
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:57,930
And then here,
here's a guy.

2939
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:59,880
Um,
he's gonna do it right here.

2940
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:04,940
He's a w for people who want to spy.
Drone exposes Smithfield foods.

2941
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,590
Say say that up.
Put that up.

2942
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:09,430
Smithfield foods.
Factory farm.

2943
02:04:09,431 --> 02:04:13,650
So spy drones expose Smithfield foods.
Factory farms.

2944
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:17,670
The lagoon is a good word because it
sounds dirty.

2945
02:04:17,970 --> 02:04:20,820
The lake of pig Cesspool piss and what
a,

2946
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:21,360
yeah,
it's,

2947
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,090
it's like a red color.
It's disgusting.

2948
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:25,260
I look at these,
I mean,

2949
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,940
imagine how many animals are in one of
those shots.

2950
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,610
It's fun and they don't see sunlight.
You know,

2951
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,050
it's

2952
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:31,640
fucked.
It's fucked.

2953
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:32,960
It's not.
It's not,

2954
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:35,660
it's not human.
It's not humane.

2955
02:04:35,690 --> 02:04:37,470
It's not ethical.
It's not right.

2956
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,650
But to bring it all home.
All right,

2957
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:42,540
look at this.
The lagoon,

2958
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,490
the color.
Does it just sit there?

2959
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,340
Do they ever do anything with it or is
it just sit there and bubble.

2960
02:04:47,341 --> 02:04:48,174
Bubble.
Bubble.

2961
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:49,103
What'd you say?
Jam.

2962
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:51,990
They spray it around to the house.
That's an to try to find a picture of

2963
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:56,430
the person they talked to the neighbor
Paul Ryan in the air.

2964
02:04:57,330 --> 02:04:59,760
Oh my God.
It gets in the air and goes into

2965
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:02,360
people's houses and think some of the
neighbors are saying it gets like it

2966
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:04,200
gets in their house and they can't even
breathe.

2967
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:09,220
Oh fucking here's a guy.
There's a fear factor thing here.

2968
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:10,800
This guy,
former pig factory on,

2969
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:11,634
well let me hear this guy.

2970
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:14,093
Huh?

2971
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:15,860
Come on Don Webb.

2972
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,593
Something wrong.
Yeah,

2973
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:21,090
there's no sound,
but you can just see the way it's moving

2974
02:05:21,091 --> 02:05:23,400
within the facility there too.
Oh,

2975
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:25,470
there's an issue with the computer.
Um,

2976
02:05:25,471 --> 02:05:27,010
strange.
Yeah man.

2977
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:27,870
It's,
it's dark.

2978
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:31,350
It's evil and it's when all of a sudden
these things don't get treated like a

2979
02:05:31,351 --> 02:05:33,030
life.
They get treated like a commodity.

2980
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:36,390
And I think,
I guess there's levels right?

2981
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:38,520
To people that are vegans,
they would say,

2982
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:40,560
well,
any animal that you would be willing to

2983
02:05:40,561 --> 02:05:43,350
raise and then ship off and sell.
Like,

2984
02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:47,280
why are you any better than this guy
who's got these things stuffed into this

2985
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:47,761
thing?
I mean,

2986
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:50,460
yeah,
your animals are living a normal life,

2987
02:05:50,461 --> 02:05:51,990
but then eventually you're gonna kill
him anyway,

2988
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:54,040
you know?

2989
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:54,890
Yeah.
Whereas,

2990
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:56,720
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

2991
02:05:56,930 --> 02:05:58,920
You know that I have a,
uh,

2992
02:05:59,050 --> 02:06:03,170
a friend who's a Vegan and in fact,
one of my heifer calves is named after

2993
02:06:03,171 --> 02:06:04,260
her.
Um,

2994
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,970
and she's honored by that actually.
Cause she knows that that one's never

2995
02:06:07,971 --> 02:06:08,804
going to be,
um,

2996
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:13,230
or it probably won't be pleased where we
won't be mature,

2997
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:14,300
but,
um,

2998
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,130
unless she gets a prolapsed cervix or
something like that.

2999
02:06:16,131 --> 02:06:17,180
But,
um,

3000
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:19,823
yeah.

3001
02:06:19,930 --> 02:06:22,930
So if you push these broken and you're
done for cows,

3002
02:06:23,410 --> 02:06:25,360
cows,
you got to be specific there,

3003
02:06:25,361 --> 02:06:29,710
Joe.
So to say that there's not a difference

3004
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:30,730
is,
well,

3005
02:06:30,731 --> 02:06:32,080
there's depth,
just not paying attention,

3006
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:32,621
but no,
I mean,

3007
02:06:32,621 --> 02:06:34,900
if that's what the argument is,
then you're not paying attention and we

3008
02:06:34,901 --> 02:06:36,190
can't have a conversation about it.

3009
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:39,930
I just think they think that the
ultimate goal at the end is definitely

3010
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:44,010
death or the ultimate result for these
animals.

3011
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:45,140
Yeah.
Well,

3012
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,000
I mean,
the same people don't want you to be

3013
02:06:47,001 --> 02:06:48,190
shooting wild animals either.

3014
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:49,200
Yes.
Yeah.

3015
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:50,490
Well,
even wolves,

3016
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:54,540
which is why I've just read one is
hilarious because there's so much

3017
02:06:54,541 --> 02:06:58,920
ignorance involved in people's idea of
what a wolf is and why there's so many

3018
02:06:58,921 --> 02:07:02,940
folk tales and stories that involve bad
wolves killing people.

3019
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:05,810
There was a two,
I just read this to,

3020
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:06,541
um,
wolves,

3021
02:07:06,541 --> 02:07:07,620
I believe it was Idaho.
We can,

3022
02:07:07,710 --> 02:07:12,090
we can check it and if we're not to,
but two wolves killed 176 sheep or

3023
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:13,980
something like that.
And One night I am for fun.

3024
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:15,690
Well that's the thing that wolves do
what's,

3025
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:18,570
and then they're having a real big
problem with this and yellowstone and,

3026
02:07:18,571 --> 02:07:21,810
and a lot of places that have elk is
that they don't kill.

3027
02:07:21,811 --> 02:07:25,500
Like a cat will kill a wolf or a cat
will kill an elk rather.

3028
02:07:25,501 --> 02:07:27,690
And he will eat that elk for a long
period of time.

3029
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:30,990
He'll bury it,
he'll try and he'll eat it and a wolf

3030
02:07:30,991 --> 02:07:32,370
kills it,
eats a little bit,

3031
02:07:32,371 --> 02:07:35,140
and then kills another one and then
kills another one and kills another one.

3032
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:39,220
And they do whatever the fuck they want.
One of these guys that I know at hoyt

3033
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:42,070
was telling me about this,
this wolf,

3034
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:46,150
that it killed this a cow.
And the way it did it was it attacked

3035
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:49,420
the cat cow.
Elk attacked it towards guts apart and

3036
02:07:49,421 --> 02:07:52,090
then this thing,
and then backed off and just watched and

3037
02:07:52,091 --> 02:07:56,140
sat and didn't eat and watch this thing
struggle and try to walk away and tried

3038
02:07:56,141 --> 02:07:59,560
to walk into this river.
I tried to get away and they would go

3039
02:07:59,561 --> 02:08:02,170
after it again and tear it apart a
little bit more and then back off again.

3040
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:06,430
They do it for fun and it's what they're
designed for.

3041
02:08:06,431 --> 02:08:10,340
They're killing machines and they enjoy
it and it's it.

3042
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,510
They're beautiful.
And I'm not saying they're evil.

3043
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:16,870
We should kill them all and eradicate
them from the face of war of the world.

3044
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:20,320
But there's something strange about that
kind of animal.

3045
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:22,510
They're not,
they're not necessarily,

3046
02:08:22,511 --> 02:08:26,200
they're not environmentalist.
They're not conservationists to fucking

3047
02:08:26,201 --> 02:08:29,050
wolves.
And wolves are dangerous.

3048
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:29,711
They're,
they're,

3049
02:08:29,711 --> 02:08:32,980
they're,
they have an essential place in a very

3050
02:08:32,981 --> 02:08:36,850
diverse ecosystem.
But the top of the food chain is fucking

3051
02:08:36,851 --> 02:08:38,350
human beings,
period.

3052
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:40,240
And when human beings decide,
you know what,

3053
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:44,510
there's too many of these goddamn wolves
that are killing a hundred plus sheep in

3054
02:08:44,511 --> 02:08:46,030
a night.
Or my friend,

3055
02:08:46,031 --> 02:08:49,390
um,
Mike Hockridge who lives up in,

3056
02:08:49,391 --> 02:08:50,770
um,
in BC,

3057
02:08:50,771 --> 02:08:52,810
his neighbor,
they're fucking cow,

3058
02:08:52,811 --> 02:08:56,200
got taken out at cal,
got taken out by wolves and you're in,

3059
02:08:56,201 --> 02:09:00,430
in BC where he lives,
there's no tag limit for wolves.

3060
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:02,830
You could shoot as many as you want.
You can shoot well,

3061
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:04,630
you could be your hobby.
What do you do?

3062
02:09:04,631 --> 02:09:05,860
I go bowling.
I shoot wolves.

3063
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:07,630
Like they,
they're fucking trying to take out as

3064
02:09:07,631 --> 02:09:08,710
many walls as they can.

3065
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:11,780
When we were talking about coyotes
before,

3066
02:09:11,781 --> 02:09:12,650
and personally,
I don't,

3067
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:14,750
you know,
I've shot a few coyotes in my day.

3068
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:16,130
How dare you.
And uh,

3069
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:16,993
yeah.
Uh,

3070
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:20,240
but it's not something I could go on and
pursue.

3071
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:21,800
Uh,
you know,

3072
02:09:21,801 --> 02:09:23,930
necessarily it's more opportunistic or
whatever.

3073
02:09:23,931 --> 02:09:28,931
It's fucking with roadrunner and you've
got to take them out and anvil acme,

3074
02:09:29,570 --> 02:09:31,610
Doug's just like,
it's,

3075
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:33,950
you know,
it's sort of like the deer thing.

3076
02:09:33,951 --> 02:09:37,000
When I was listening to various
arguments about a deer,

3077
02:09:37,001 --> 02:09:38,350
what,
one of the reasons we have so many deer

3078
02:09:38,351 --> 02:09:43,070
in Wisconsin and another agricultural
areas is because of agriculture.

3079
02:09:43,071 --> 02:09:45,380
And they are highly adaptive.

3080
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:47,410
Yes.
And that's a really big point because

3081
02:09:47,411 --> 02:09:50,560
they're not even essentially wild.
They're really kind of like a farm

3082
02:09:50,561 --> 02:09:52,240
animal and a lot of ways.
And it was one of the,

3083
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:55,630
the things that Steve brought up on the
show that we talked about,

3084
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,490
you know,
I don't know if it ever made the air

3085
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:57,840
did,
did,

3086
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,040
does that make the air,
we were just talking about how these

3087
02:10:00,041 --> 02:10:01,180
animals are essentially

3088
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:03,570
a lot of ways,
they're like a livestock almost.

3089
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:08,760
Well non fenced in the trail camera
pictures that I sent you have different

3090
02:10:08,861 --> 02:10:09,750
gear that I had,
you know,

3091
02:10:09,751 --> 02:10:10,500
different,
uh,

3092
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:11,031
you know,
bucks.

3093
02:10:11,031 --> 02:10:11,521
I'm thinking,
well,

3094
02:10:11,521 --> 02:10:13,800
you're not going to see that out and of
course,

3095
02:10:14,150 --> 02:10:15,930
or guitar or whatever or maybe you do.
But,

3096
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:17,130
uh,
but no,

3097
02:10:17,131 --> 02:10:18,270
I mean,
well,

3098
02:10:18,271 --> 02:10:20,580
they're very different than that.
The mule deer that we were talking about

3099
02:10:20,581 --> 02:10:22,260
before the show started that Rinella
killed,

3100
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,850
uh,
that was on a show recently,

3101
02:10:23,851 --> 02:10:25,830
which is enormous,
beautiful,

3102
02:10:25,831 --> 02:10:27,530
majestic public land mule

3103
02:10:27,530 --> 02:10:32,090
deer that he killed a mule deer.
They've found we'll travel 150 miles,

3104
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,290
um,
during season there.

3105
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:36,240
They really migrate in

3106
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:40,670
probably for a lot of the same reasons
because they have to for food.

3107
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:42,620
Yeah.
Food and for whatever.

3108
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:45,410
Whereas an older,
a deer gets in our area,

3109
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:49,880
at least my experience has been so the
older deer gets in our area,

3110
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:53,260
the less it moves.
So if you have a,

3111
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:55,250
a buck that you're,
you know,

3112
02:10:55,251 --> 02:10:58,640
you're managing for bigger bucks and you
start seeing one that maybe has a

3113
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:01,640
distinctive antler or something,
so you can tell it from other ones,

3114
02:11:01,990 --> 02:11:04,520
um,
you'll begin to realize,

3115
02:11:04,521 --> 02:11:05,930
you know,
that great big one that I shot,

3116
02:11:06,210 --> 02:11:09,890
I saw that dear for two years.
He lived in about a 40 acre area.

3117
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:11,130
Wow.
That's crazy.

3118
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:12,840
Yeah.
I'm just waiting for him to slip up.

3119
02:11:13,950 --> 02:11:17,220
And he did.
There's a lot of these hunting shows

3120
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,180
where they named the deer's.
Yeah.

3121
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:20,011
You know,
they'll,

3122
02:11:20,011 --> 02:11:22,730
they'll call this one,
you know,

3123
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:24,600
old forkey,
whatever,

3124
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:27,120
and they'll have names for these animals
and they'll target them.

3125
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:29,880
We're looking for lucky.
We're trying to get lucky know they'll

3126
02:11:29,881 --> 02:11:32,700
have these shows.
And like this is so bizarre because it's

3127
02:11:32,701 --> 02:11:36,240
in a lot of ways you're like kind of
farming because they have these gigantic

3128
02:11:36,241 --> 02:11:39,750
pastures that they call food plots.
So what they'll do is they'll,

3129
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:43,200
they'll plow the land and they'll grow a
lot of clover,

3130
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,900
a lot of different different times,
Alfalfa,

3131
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:48,000
different things that they know.
Dears,

3132
02:11:48,030 --> 02:11:49,820
we'll eat deers,
no.

3133
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:53,040
Deers.
And so then they set up a tree stand and

3134
02:11:53,041 --> 02:11:54,120
a whack them out.

3135
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:56,930
Yeah.
And um,

3136
02:11:57,630 --> 02:12:00,060
I do it too.
Part of what I do in my land management

3137
02:12:00,061 --> 02:12:04,650
service for people is to,
is to help their property become more

3138
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:07,920
wildlife friendly.
One of the things that I try to push to

3139
02:12:07,921 --> 02:12:11,340
people is that when we're doing things
like timber stand improvement or

3140
02:12:11,341 --> 02:12:15,810
invasive species management,
or providing a wildlife food plots,

3141
02:12:15,811 --> 02:12:17,460
we're planting with wildlife,
food plots,

3142
02:12:17,461 --> 02:12:19,530
just not dear food plots.
And a lot of those guys that,

3143
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:21,650
you know,
what I really want to steer well,

3144
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:23,880
what's a concern at all?
Yeah.

3145
02:12:23,881 --> 02:12:26,910
And what's good for deer is generally
good for a whole host of wildlife.

3146
02:12:26,911 --> 02:12:28,500
So it's a little bit different,
but yeah,

3147
02:12:28,501 --> 02:12:29,161
no,
I know what you mean.

3148
02:12:29,161 --> 02:12:31,260
I tend to name them afterwards,
like that big one,

3149
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,650
big one that I killed.
Uh,

3150
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,090
you know,
we called them the standard.

3151
02:12:36,150 --> 02:12:39,270
Um,
and because also the standard by which

3152
02:12:39,271 --> 02:12:41,230
all after this we'll be judged,
you know?

3153
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:44,940
And uh,
but yeah,

3154
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:47,280
I mean that part of the relationship is,
is uh,

3155
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,710
complicated man.
It is complicated,

3156
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:53,850
but like all things involving life,
they'd become complicated.

3157
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:54,920
There's,
it's not,

3158
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,100
it's not as simple.

3159
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:58,100
Yeah.
Can I talk about media or a little bit?

3160
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:58,963
Yeah,
please.

3161
02:12:59,120 --> 02:12:59,990
Um,
so we did,

3162
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:00,930
we shot,
uh,

3163
02:13:01,170 --> 02:13:02,830
starting this Thursday,
there'll be a,

3164
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:05,180
there'll be three episodes in a row that
were shot on the farm.

3165
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:06,320
The first ones,
actually,

3166
02:13:06,321 --> 02:13:08,510
steve taken apart a couple of the deer
that,

3167
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:11,300
that he finally shot a couple of years
on our place.

3168
02:13:11,301 --> 02:13:13,610
And technically he'll say something
else,

3169
02:13:13,611 --> 02:13:16,880
but during our hunting killed two deer.
But he took them apart.

3170
02:13:16,881 --> 02:13:21,881
So it's a really informative episode
about the different kinds of cuts,

3171
02:13:23,451 --> 02:13:25,790
how well one,
how to just do it,

3172
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:29,510
and then the different kinds of cuts in
the methods for doing this stuff.

3173
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:30,730
Just really,
um,

3174
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:33,450
I just watched it and I just,
just really impressed by it.

3175
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,060
And he's amazing.
He really is.

3176
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:38,710
He's so God damn important because in
my,

3177
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:43,800
my mind on television,
he is the most prominent intellectual

3178
02:13:43,991 --> 02:13:47,320
voice for wild game management,
wild game conservation,

3179
02:13:47,350 --> 02:13:48,850
and for hunting.
He's,

3180
02:13:48,851 --> 02:13:51,190
he's a true conservationist.
Um,

3181
02:13:51,370 --> 02:13:54,850
he's a guy who really,
truly believes in public land hunting

3182
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:57,220
and it goes way out of his way.
I mean,

3183
02:13:57,221 --> 02:14:00,460
he gets plenty of offers to hunt on
private land.

3184
02:14:00,461 --> 02:14:05,461
He prefers to hunt on public land and he
prefers to do his best to try to do

3185
02:14:06,101 --> 02:14:08,230
whatever he can to help keep those lands
public.

3186
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:09,950
Yeah.
And to promote that.

3187
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:10,670
And,
uh,

3188
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:14,600
I think one of the things he likes about
hunting on my place is that he knows

3189
02:14:14,601 --> 02:14:17,540
that after the fact we,
you know,

3190
02:14:17,541 --> 02:14:20,720
like when you were there and just like
this pasture and every other year

3191
02:14:20,721 --> 02:14:22,910
there's a small group of people that
hunt opening weekend.

3192
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:26,630
After that I start letting other folks
come in.

3193
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:28,760
I mean it's our private land we're able
to do,

3194
02:14:28,761 --> 02:14:32,570
but it is the public's animal and yeah,
I put restrictions on folks.

3195
02:14:32,571 --> 02:14:35,930
You can't shoot a buck or you know,
it's got to be this big or whatever it

3196
02:14:35,931 --> 02:14:37,440
is.
And uh,

3197
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:40,800
and he's applauded that in the past and,
Aye.

3198
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:41,673
Aye.
Aye.

3199
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:42,800
Aye.
Aye.

3200
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,710
That's really important to me.
Um,

3201
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:46,520
because I struggle with that a little
bit.

3202
02:14:46,521 --> 02:14:50,450
But um,
but the alternative isn't very good.

3203
02:14:50,451 --> 02:14:53,210
Where you land is just wide open to
anybody who wants to come in on an

3204
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:55,040
experience that no good.

3205
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:59,230
What is the problem is you can't really
count on everybody to be ethical.

3206
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:03,370
You can't really count on everybody to
take care of if your land with reverence

3207
02:15:03,371 --> 02:15:07,810
and dignity and the way you treat it,
the liability,

3208
02:15:07,811 --> 02:15:10,300
you can't let every yahoo very
important.

3209
02:15:10,301 --> 02:15:11,134
Very important.
Like,

3210
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:13,630
like the,
the animal they got winged in the neck

3211
02:15:13,631 --> 02:15:16,930
cause he's going by that the,
that the coyotes took up part,

3212
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,180
you know,
who knows who shot that,

3213
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:22,420
whether or not it was an ethical shot or
it's a bad shot.

3214
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:23,190
Yeah.
And that's,

3215
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:24,550
that's a big part of it.
Well,

3216
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:29,180
so that's the first episode.
The next two are two people that I,

3217
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:33,960
I hunted with us that I know and love
and we actually uh,

3218
02:15:34,270 --> 02:15:36,220
did a very similar thing to what you and
Brian did.

3219
02:15:36,221 --> 02:15:38,220
The first time Brittany and Helen,
uh,

3220
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:43,660
hunted was in Montana.
That was a year ago and sort of like a

3221
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:45,910
steve did with you and Brian.
Well,

3222
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:49,090
very low.
The next hunt was to bring them to our

3223
02:15:49,091 --> 02:15:51,550
place.
So they went from hiking and working

3224
02:15:51,551 --> 02:15:55,060
hard and freezing and not seeing deer
very much to freezing her ass off,

3225
02:15:55,061 --> 02:15:58,690
sitting in a blind doing and the weather
cooperated.

3226
02:15:58,691 --> 02:16:00,420
It was nearly,
not nearly as cold as well

3227
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,070
or snowy though.
Uh,

3228
02:16:02,071 --> 02:16:06,550
coincidentally I was in town the night
before the opening day and I was so

3229
02:16:06,551 --> 02:16:10,340
bummed out that I had scheduled it where
I had to be in Colorado the next day and

3230
02:16:10,341 --> 02:16:13,180
I barely made it out of Madison.
Oh yeah,

3231
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:15,190
I was in your town,
man.

3232
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:19,240
Fuck.
Well that can't happen again.

3233
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:21,010
Yeah.
We were thinking about cal and I were

3234
02:16:21,011 --> 02:16:24,220
thinking about flying in on Sunday,
but we were schedules didn't permit.

3235
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:25,530
Yeah.
Um,

3236
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:28,750
I would have been that have been great.
Um,

3237
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,693
next.
Yeah.

3238
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:30,633
Good.

3239
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:31,741
I'm counting on it.
Yeah,

3240
02:16:31,741 --> 02:16:33,340
I will.
Next year we're going to manage it.

3241
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:34,360
Alan and I were,
were,

3242
02:16:34,361 --> 02:16:36,520
we made a commitment to it.
We were talking about it.

3243
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:38,230
What can we had so much fun two years
ago.

3244
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:40,360
Yeah.
I can't believe we must do what I can to

3245
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:43,300
make sure the weather is not as,
we don't mind shitty weather,

3246
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:44,990
you know,
people ask me,

3247
02:16:45,150 --> 02:16:46,430
you know,
what was it like with those guys?

3248
02:16:46,431 --> 02:16:47,181
They said,
you know,

3249
02:16:47,181 --> 02:16:48,840
as,
uh,

3250
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,820
that's us.

3251
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:51,290
Yeah.
That's shit on a stick.

3252
02:16:51,291 --> 02:16:54,210
Which is still,
I think it's still the number one

3253
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:59,230
mediator viewed huge.
We had so much fun,

3254
02:16:59,751 --> 02:17:02,030
man.
It was so fun just hanging out.

3255
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,920
Just [inaudible].
I am trying to interject.

3256
02:17:03,921 --> 02:17:06,180
So you know,
with conservation was the mood.

3257
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:07,820
It,
it was so fun man.

3258
02:17:08,310 --> 02:17:09,440
So fun.
Those,

3259
02:17:09,470 --> 02:17:11,810
that's one of the things about these
experiences.

3260
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:16,370
The comradery is almost as important as
the hunting itself.

3261
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,330
Like just to have a bunch of guys
hanging out,

3262
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:19,990
having a good time,
uh,

3263
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,100
on your farm.
And,

3264
02:17:21,101 --> 02:17:23,720
and this,
you have such a beautiful piece of land

3265
02:17:23,721 --> 02:17:26,840
that when we're talking about earlier
that we use the term driftless.

3266
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:29,390
Um,
and what that means is that this is the

3267
02:17:29,391 --> 02:17:34,370
area where the glaciers passed over.
They didn't go through this area.

3268
02:17:34,371 --> 02:17:38,720
So you have beautiful rolling hills and
people think of Wisconsin as being like

3269
02:17:38,721 --> 02:17:41,130
sort of a flat area,
which it is and some songs.

3270
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:43,070
Yeah.
But where you guys are at,

3271
02:17:43,071 --> 02:17:45,080
it's amazing.
It's fucking gorgeous.

3272
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:49,800
So much wildlife to Turk do.
We saw Turkeys,

3273
02:17:49,801 --> 02:17:51,510
we saw,
we almost hit a Turkey on her way to the

3274
02:17:51,511 --> 02:17:52,620
airport.
There's three of them,

3275
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:54,430
big ones.
That would,

3276
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,340
uh,
that would have messed up our day.

3277
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:58,410
I mean,
I don't know if we'd have made it,

3278
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:00,300
made it,
we would have made it,

3279
02:18:00,301 --> 02:18:02,460
I would have knocked the glass out.
We would put our goggles on.

3280
02:18:02,461 --> 02:18:03,420
We would have drilled,
we wouldn't be here.

3281
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:08,010
Don't worry about us.
Part of the reason I got the fire in the

3282
02:18:08,011 --> 02:18:08,641
belly,
dude,

3283
02:18:08,641 --> 02:18:11,430
you said that goes on and drive all the
way.

3284
02:18:12,690 --> 02:18:14,250
They can't take out your windshield
though,

3285
02:18:14,251 --> 02:18:14,830
right?

3286
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:15,520
Birds,
man.

3287
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:16,353
So,
uh,

3288
02:18:17,010 --> 02:18:19,960
uh,
so we had such a good time with that.

3289
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:22,240
And uh,
I think when Helen and Brittany,

3290
02:18:22,241 --> 02:18:27,241
who were a beginner hunters,
they wanted to have that experience

3291
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:30,490
similar to what you and Brian had in
Montana.

3292
02:18:30,491 --> 02:18:30,791
Well,
you know,

3293
02:18:30,791 --> 02:18:32,590
we don't take it easy on us because
we're,

3294
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:34,930
you know,
whatever women or whatever it happens to

3295
02:18:34,931 --> 02:18:36,250
be.
And I would not take it easy on either

3296
02:18:36,251 --> 02:18:39,230
one of those two for any reason,
because they're just there.

3297
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:40,273
They're bad ass

3298
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:43,040
swimming.
Helen's addicted to Jujitsu.

3299
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,600
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3300
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:47,660
She's been doing Jujitsu with Anthony,
with the Tony Bourdain.

3301
02:18:47,661 --> 02:18:50,450
They've been going fucking crazy.
She takes it all the time.

3302
02:18:50,451 --> 02:18:52,790
She's lost a ton of weight.
She looks fantastic.

3303
02:18:52,930 --> 02:18:53,980
Yup.
You know,

3304
02:18:54,210 --> 02:18:57,790
uh,
so we did a very similar thing,

3305
02:18:57,791 --> 02:19:00,340
although this time,
if you recall when you guys were there,

3306
02:19:00,341 --> 02:19:03,250
we had these blind set up.
They were like pop up lines and stuff.

3307
02:19:03,490 --> 02:19:04,323
So,
uh,

3308
02:19:04,330 --> 02:19:05,081
Steve says,
you know,

3309
02:19:05,081 --> 02:19:09,910
I think we have to have them do ground
blinds and you know how hard that was

3310
02:19:09,911 --> 02:19:13,090
when we were inside those blinds and
they didn't really offer any heat or

3311
02:19:13,091 --> 02:19:14,500
anything.
So it made complete sense.

3312
02:19:14,501 --> 02:19:16,390
Well,
we built these beautiful blinds.

3313
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:20,040
I'm the one that Steve built will be
there after the

3314
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,810
apocalypse.
You guys built them while you were

3315
02:19:21,811 --> 02:19:22,430
there?
Yeah.

3316
02:19:22,430 --> 02:19:23,000
Yeah.
Okay.

3317
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,060
Do just get some plywood.

3318
02:19:24,370 --> 02:19:24,851
Oh No,
no,

3319
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:25,191
no,
no,

3320
02:19:25,191 --> 02:19:26,590
no.
Just with what was there.

3321
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,010
I mean of course

3322
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,950
Steve had to take some wire and baler
twine and stuff along and Brittany and I

3323
02:19:30,951 --> 02:19:31,781
just went off where I was.
I,

3324
02:19:31,781 --> 02:19:33,470
we'll just pull stuff together and kind
of make them,

3325
02:19:33,471 --> 02:19:35,930
how many days did you do this for?
The blinds?

3326
02:19:36,590 --> 02:19:37,460
Oh,
a couple hours.

3327
02:19:37,461 --> 02:19:38,600
One afternoon.
Okay.

3328
02:19:38,601 --> 02:19:40,000
So like you say,
well what was there,

3329
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:42,430
you mean like wood and yeah.
You know,

3330
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,090
uh,
branches from trees and,

3331
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,990
and uh,
you know,

3332
02:19:44,991 --> 02:19:47,060
and that sort of stuff,
stuff that was just laying around.

3333
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:49,100
And what did you do with the one that I
got that I bought it yet.

3334
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:50,970
Oh,
that's up on a up,

3335
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:52,560
we call it shit on a stick.
Right.

3336
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:57,110
So what did that area's called now?
Oh yeah.

3337
02:19:57,111 --> 02:19:58,090
You know,
well we named them all.

3338
02:19:58,570 --> 02:20:03,570
So I put for a round bales on end and
then I set,

3339
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:07,340
set it up on top of it.
Actually the second day I went up there

3340
02:20:07,341 --> 02:20:11,540
with my camera man and sat and uh,
it didn't make the show thankfully,

3341
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:13,640
but uh,
I will admit on the year that I took a

3342
02:20:13,641 --> 02:20:16,910
shot at a deer and just cleaned Mr and I
tell you,

3343
02:20:16,911 --> 02:20:20,120
I spent a couple hours at African him
cause I just couldn't believe I missed.

3344
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:23,720
Well you did.
Well when we were there I fell and

3345
02:20:23,721 --> 02:20:25,190
fucked up my rifle scope.
Remember?

3346
02:20:25,191 --> 02:20:29,240
And you actually helped me cite it back
in because I didn't know that was,

3347
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:31,520
um,
I had an issue with the scope being

3348
02:20:31,521 --> 02:20:33,950
loose and it was set in whoever said it
in.

3349
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:36,410
Um,
just because we change scopes,

3350
02:20:36,411 --> 02:20:40,280
I had a leopold and we put a vortex on
and when we changed the scope,

3351
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:42,440
unfortunately it wasn't done right.

3352
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:45,620
And there's something,
so just some steps weren't taken to

3353
02:20:45,621 --> 02:20:49,700
secure it correctly and you float on it
real hard on it.

3354
02:20:49,701 --> 02:20:51,350
That hard man.
Cause I was,

3355
02:20:51,351 --> 02:20:53,240
that was off man.
It was off bad.

3356
02:20:53,241 --> 02:20:56,570
Yeah.
Like more than a foot or close to a foot

3357
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,510
at a hundred,
you know,

3358
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:01,850
a hundred yards.
Well I wish I had that excuse.

3359
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:03,800
I just cleaned miss that deer.
It was,

3360
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:04,880
I was a polk.
I mean,

3361
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:08,840
but she was standing still many a yards,
about 400 yards.

3362
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,350
It was a political,
but I had a long fucking shot man.

3363
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,390
Uh,
and uh,

3364
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:15,680
I just,
I cleaned,

3365
02:21:15,681 --> 02:21:17,630
missed it.
Now do you use one of those,

3366
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:20,960
um,
ranch phone calculator apps where like

3367
02:21:20,961 --> 02:21:23,660
you have to like figure out like how far
it is,

3368
02:21:23,661 --> 02:21:25,910
the velocity of your gun,
you know,

3369
02:21:25,911 --> 02:21:27,920
what are you're shooting at 30 odd sex?
I actually,

3370
02:21:27,921 --> 02:21:28,880
I had a,
um,

3371
02:21:29,150 --> 02:21:30,690
a savage three windmills.

3372
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:31,800
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3373
02:21:31,801 --> 02:21:33,890
They thought for me to,
Oh yeah.

3374
02:21:33,891 --> 02:21:35,810
Savage is the sponsor of the show now,
right?

3375
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:37,160
Yes.
Excellent guns.

3376
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:38,570
Oh,
wonderful family.

3377
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:41,840
Wonderful.
So that special trigger to like,

3378
02:21:41,850 --> 02:21:44,510
that's like the one step two step
process.

3379
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:47,480
So they have a very light trigger,
but it won't go off accidentally.

3380
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:48,700
And it was,
you know,

3381
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:54,610
the rifle was dead nuts and should say
these guys I know about this stuff

3382
02:21:55,191 --> 02:21:57,900
because of Steve and now his podcast,
it's called the mediator podcast,

3383
02:21:57,980 --> 02:22:00,420
which I talked him into doing and now
he's a,

3384
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,060
now he's addicted to it too.
Yeah,

3385
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:04,100
it's a great fun.
Great.

3386
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:07,970
It's a great podcast.
He's so good at it.

3387
02:22:08,450 --> 02:22:09,950
Yeah.
You had the guys from vortex on there

3388
02:22:09,951 --> 02:22:13,160
talking about different things and I
learned a lot that day.

3389
02:22:13,610 --> 02:22:14,630
Um,
so anyway,

3390
02:22:14,631 --> 02:22:16,570
I cleaned mist and,
um,

3391
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:22,950
I know I've talked about this before and
maybe the podcast and I've,

3392
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:26,070
I said I've never regretted shot that I
didn't

3393
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,140
take.
And Steve's like really,

3394
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:29,790
um,
cause you know,

3395
02:22:30,390 --> 02:22:32,100
incredulous about most of the things
that I say,

3396
02:22:32,101 --> 02:22:35,190
but at most things everybody said,
well,

3397
02:22:35,191 --> 02:22:36,510
he challenges you,
that's for sure.

3398
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:39,300
But I,
I took that shot and I kind of regretted

3399
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:41,910
it because it was a long poker.
It was a rifle that wasn't my rifle.

3400
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:45,960
I would make that shot with my own,
but right over her back and she ducked

3401
02:22:45,961 --> 02:22:47,940
in the whole thing and I was sure I hit
her.

3402
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:48,983
I went down there,

3403
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:51,870
did she jump The gun?
Like did she drop down?

3404
02:22:53,080 --> 02:22:54,530
Zynga Virbac

3405
02:22:54,550 --> 02:22:56,160
uh,
and uh,

3406
02:22:56,690 --> 02:22:59,620
and we watched it,
my camera man and I kept watching it on

3407
02:22:59,621 --> 02:23:02,050
the thing and so I went right down to
the spot where I marked exactly where

3408
02:23:02,051 --> 02:23:04,570
the spot was.
We had snow and everything and um,

3409
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:05,790
I just cleaned,
missed and,

3410
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:09,580
and it was a shot that in retrospect,
that kind of wish I wouldn't have taken,

3411
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:11,800
especially with what was happening right
then deer,

3412
02:23:11,801 --> 02:23:13,300
we're starting to come to the field and
all that.

3413
02:23:13,301 --> 02:23:14,590
But anyway,
and the point was,

3414
02:23:14,591 --> 02:23:16,570
it was from that blind that you sent me
after that,

3415
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:18,790
that hunting.
So that's where it lives is up there on

3416
02:23:18,791 --> 02:23:19,930
top of the lid.
It's a great spot.

3417
02:23:19,931 --> 02:23:21,980
You'll love it when you see it.
Um,

3418
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:24,860
have you ever seen those bail blinds
that are,

3419
02:23:24,861 --> 02:23:29,220
they look like a bale of Hay.
You sneaky go inside them and you're

3420
02:23:29,230 --> 02:23:29,790
like,
Hey,

3421
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:32,050
can you actually me?
And we've actually made,

3422
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:35,690
I've just,
Oh,

3423
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:38,240
we used to make some cozy blinds,
you know,

3424
02:23:38,241 --> 02:23:39,980
my old man would,
uh,

3425
02:23:40,220 --> 02:23:42,650
he'd take three,
four round bales and then you put a

3426
02:23:42,651 --> 02:23:44,450
little cover on top and you're on there.
Toasty.

3427
02:23:44,930 --> 02:23:49,260
I missed out on the biggest buck
opportunity in my life because my old

3428
02:23:49,261 --> 02:23:50,720
man let me get out of chores in the
morning.

3429
02:23:50,721 --> 02:23:51,860
He said,
you go out in that blind,

3430
02:23:51,861 --> 02:23:53,330
he's like,
me and your brother are going to kick

3431
02:23:53,331 --> 02:23:57,950
one out of the swamp.
10 o'clock rolls around and I'm so cozy

3432
02:23:58,010 --> 02:24:01,670
and I'm passed out and uh,
all sudden they're here.

3433
02:24:01,671 --> 02:24:02,504
My old man,
he's like,

3434
02:24:02,690 --> 02:24:04,700
what are you doing?
I get up.

3435
02:24:04,701 --> 02:24:05,240
I'm like,
what?

3436
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:06,650
He's like,
don't you see that thing?

3437
02:24:06,651 --> 02:24:06,951
I'm like,
Oh,

3438
02:24:06,951 --> 02:24:09,830
I was too small and I can't remember
what he was calling.

3439
02:24:09,831 --> 02:24:11,960
He was,
he had a name for it and he's just like,

3440
02:24:11,990 --> 02:24:12,930
that was,
you know,

3441
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:16,600
swampy and Oh my God.
And I've never,

3442
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:18,740
never,
well I didn't sound asleep.

3443
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,280
It was a soft trying to make an excuse.
See all my old man,

3444
02:24:21,290 --> 02:24:24,250
I never lived that down with my old man
cause I was such a,

3445
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:26,510
and we've,
we were watching that guy,

3446
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:28,610
you got to shine in at night.
You ever been shining?

3447
02:24:28,850 --> 02:24:29,950
No.
You need,

3448
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:32,480
if you need to do that.
Sometimes it's not like moonshine and

3449
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:37,370
strong light
and shine the deer that are out in the

3450
02:24:37,371 --> 02:24:41,060
field just to cut your monitor where
they're at and yeah.

3451
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:42,320
Well isn't that,
well,

3452
02:24:42,321 --> 02:24:44,210
that's where what people use for
poaching,

3453
02:24:44,211 --> 02:24:45,044
right?
Yeah.

3454
02:24:45,590 --> 02:24:49,400
To do.
You don't have guns and here we can't do

3455
02:24:49,401 --> 02:24:50,930
it during season,
but it's legal.

3456
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:53,150
Oh,
you can't do it during the rifle season

3457
02:24:53,210 --> 02:24:54,300
during hunting season.
No,

3458
02:24:54,860 --> 02:24:56,090
that's right.
It ends at a certain date.

3459
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:56,953
Well,
anyway,

3460
02:24:57,380 --> 02:24:58,610
um,
but what we did,

3461
02:24:58,611 --> 02:25:00,890
because the other problem with those
blinds,

3462
02:25:00,891 --> 02:25:03,960
as you might remember,
is pretty damn crowded in them and they

3463
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:04,840
actually sell,
uh,

3464
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:05,733
uh,
uh,

3465
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:06,531
uh,
uh,

3466
02:25:06,531 --> 02:25:08,900
blind now called shadow her blind,
which is a different other gray.

3467
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:09,763
Yeah.
Yeah.

3468
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:11,780
Um,
and so I have a few of those around.

3469
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:13,290
Um,
and,

3470
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,300
and there,
there are great,

3471
02:25:14,301 --> 02:25:18,020
but we couldn't,
it didn't make sense to do that.

3472
02:25:18,021 --> 02:25:20,480
We had too many people and you know,
the filming thing.

3473
02:25:20,481 --> 02:25:23,290
So we built a little blinds for four
people,

3474
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:23,960
you know,
two people,

3475
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:26,320
202 cameramen,
but they weren't insulated then.

3476
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:30,160
Ho they sure weren't.
And the day before while you were there,

3477
02:25:30,161 --> 02:25:32,590
you know what happened?
It was beautiful at the end before we

3478
02:25:32,591 --> 02:25:33,970
were out squirrel hunting in the morning
just,

3479
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:36,790
and these girls were shooting squirrels,
man.

3480
02:25:36,791 --> 02:25:38,780
It just wait til you see this,
uh,

3481
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:42,340
that they did such a great job.
They were so much fun and they were just

3482
02:25:42,341 --> 02:25:45,240
so incredible squirrel,
murderers and,

3483
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:49,990
and they just like you and Brian,
man,

3484
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:52,180
they,
they got it and they cleaned them.

3485
02:25:52,181 --> 02:25:53,440
They did the whole thing,
you know,

3486
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:55,290
uh,
to the point where,

3487
02:25:55,291 --> 02:25:57,820
uh,
I think Helen was maybe a little

3488
02:25:58,030 --> 02:25:59,470
regretful that she had,
uh,

3489
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:01,480
uh,
well they had three deer to,

3490
02:26:01,550 --> 02:26:03,400
if they broke down completely by
themselves,

3491
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:04,570
did they?
Um,

3492
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:06,520
did everybody shoot a deer?
Was everybody's successful

3493
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,170
buddy?
But the guy who hosted it,

3494
02:26:09,740 --> 02:26:10,550
you,
yeah.

3495
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:11,930
Oh man,
that's crazy.

3496
02:26:12,090 --> 02:26:13,340
You got a big one last year,
right?

3497
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:14,610
Yeah.
I got a nice one last year and I,

3498
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:17,510
I,
I filled the freezer this year later on,

3499
02:26:17,511 --> 02:26:18,680
you know,
the season goes on.

3500
02:26:18,930 --> 02:26:19,910
What,
what are the,

3501
02:26:19,911 --> 02:26:20,600
okay,
keep going.

3502
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:21,351
This,
Oh,

3503
02:26:21,351 --> 02:26:21,981
I'm sorry.
Well,

3504
02:26:21,981 --> 02:26:24,690
so we did much the same.
We set up and,

3505
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:26,900
and uh,
it was really interesting way to marine

3506
02:26:26,901 --> 02:26:29,360
sniper trainer.
If Steve,

3507
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:30,140
uh,
Noah's,

3508
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:32,780
he's from actually from our area there.
He came in and talked to us about

3509
02:26:32,781 --> 02:26:34,720
shooting a little bit and you know,
specifically for,

3510
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,890
for Helen and Brittany and,
uh,

3511
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:38,420
I'm just so proud of those two,
you know,

3512
02:26:38,421 --> 02:26:42,550
they take it so seriously as,
as seriously as you and Brian did.

3513
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,500
Okay.
You take it really seriously and Brian

3514
02:26:44,870 --> 02:26:47,240
always took it seriously when he needed
to take it seriously.

3515
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:49,760
Um,
and uh,

3516
02:26:49,790 --> 02:26:51,290
very into it,
very,

3517
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:52,161
uh,
respectful,

3518
02:26:52,161 --> 02:26:53,840
wanting to know about and all that.
And we,

3519
02:26:54,070 --> 02:26:56,420
I hope that,
I think it comes out in the episodes,

3520
02:26:56,421 --> 02:26:57,590
you know,
I'm so close to it.

3521
02:26:57,591 --> 02:26:59,150
I can't,
I can't necessarily say,

3522
02:26:59,151 --> 02:27:01,610
but we are very successful.
Well,

3523
02:27:01,611 --> 02:27:03,350
I don't want to spoil it for everybody,
but yeah,

3524
02:27:03,351 --> 02:27:04,280
there were,
we put,

3525
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:07,580
we put some deer on the ground and um,
and they,

3526
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:09,560
they did a terrific job.
Um,

3527
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,960
and I think it makes for compelling,
uh,

3528
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:15,560
for a compelling,
Yup.

3529
02:27:16,350 --> 02:27:17,880
That show's always awesome.
Um,

3530
02:27:17,881 --> 02:27:21,570
what I wanted to ask you is,
with all the wildlife that you have in

3531
02:27:21,571 --> 02:27:22,640
your area,
what,

3532
02:27:22,770 --> 02:27:24,180
what are the seasons?
I mean,

3533
02:27:24,181 --> 02:27:26,610
I know you have more than one season of
deer.

3534
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:29,400
So when does the season started?
There's an archery season first.

3535
02:27:29,430 --> 02:27:30,970
Yeah.
Archery season starts ones.

3536
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:33,960
Uh,
September 15th or the second Saturday in

3537
02:27:33,961 --> 02:27:35,280
September.
How many archer?

3538
02:27:35,281 --> 02:27:37,830
Do you have a lot of archery hunt
hunters come out there?

3539
02:27:38,130 --> 02:27:38,963
Yeah.
A lot

3540
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:41,400
on our place.
No,

3541
02:27:41,550 --> 02:27:42,383
no,
no,

3542
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:46,650
but I'd be happy to have one or two.
I don't even like rifle hunting that

3543
02:27:46,651 --> 02:27:47,820
much anymore.
Um,

3544
02:27:48,690 --> 02:27:53,160
well the thing about archery hunting for
deer in our area is,

3545
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:54,810
you know,
it's a very well,

3546
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:58,510
but you've learned all this to hunt with
cam is it's,

3547
02:27:59,090 --> 02:28:01,770
they've got to be closer and I don't
care how many of them there are,

3548
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:04,020
they've got to be close and they've got
to come in.

3549
02:28:04,021 --> 02:28:06,120
You're going to spend some time out
there and not much is going on.

3550
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:10,680
But our archery season coincides with
the first part of November,

3551
02:28:10,681 --> 02:28:12,600
end of October,
first partner in November where the pre

3552
02:28:12,601 --> 02:28:14,880
rutten rod is going on.
So there's a lot of deer activity.

3553
02:28:15,210 --> 02:28:17,220
And so there are,
um,

3554
02:28:18,270 --> 02:28:21,060
you know,
you can call and you can use sense and

3555
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:22,820
all that stuff and they're coming in.
As you know,

3556
02:28:22,821 --> 02:28:25,010
it's a completely different relationship
with the animal.

3557
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:27,420
We actually have crossbow hunting.
Uh,

3558
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:29,870
now you can use a crossbow,
not along Boeing personally.

3559
02:28:29,871 --> 02:28:31,490
That's what I use.
Um,

3560
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,040
that's cheating.
Yeah,

3561
02:28:34,041 --> 02:28:34,710
whatever.

3562
02:28:34,710 --> 02:28:38,500
Oh,
that's not archery.

3563
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:43,860
That's a shitty gun.
It doesn't fucking scope on it.

3564
02:28:44,470 --> 02:28:45,700
Sure does.
It sure does.

3565
02:28:45,701 --> 02:28:48,790
Cravings of magnification scope.
You put the crosshair on,

3566
02:28:48,791 --> 02:28:50,300
you pull the trigger,
you'd sit in on arrest,

3567
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:53,170
you can rest it down like a candidate
that is not archery,

3568
02:28:53,171 --> 02:28:54,850
God it and drink beer.
While you're doing that,

3569
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:55,910
you can,
you could smoke,

3570
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:57,770
shoot heroin,
shoot things.

3571
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:00,150
Well,
you don't have to practice with them

3572
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:01,270
much at all.

3573
02:29:01,460 --> 02:29:04,100
And uh,
and it is certainly different than

3574
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:05,580
shooting a rifle.
Um,

3575
02:29:05,630 --> 02:29:08,180
I'm comfortable that 50 or 60 yards with
a crossbow.

3576
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,640
Yeah.
And I know people can shoot further in

3577
02:29:09,641 --> 02:29:10,474
it.
And then I just,

3578
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:12,650
ethically I just,
I'm just not interested in that.

3579
02:29:12,980 --> 02:29:17,980
But I am interested in,
I don't have a boy of Cam was here.

3580
02:29:18,861 --> 02:29:19,401
He,
you know,

3581
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:22,940
dragged me outside or maybe you will.
I say that that bow hunting is for

3582
02:29:22,941 --> 02:29:24,940
people who don't have enough to do in
that.

3583
02:29:25,030 --> 02:29:30,030
It's true that it takes so much time to
be an ethical bow hunter.

3584
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:32,930
You're talking about gun was shot 200
arrows today.

3585
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:34,790
Yeah.
I shot all day to day.

3586
02:29:34,850 --> 02:29:38,600
I had a weight representative come to my
house and we're,

3587
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:41,370
we're shooting era.
I have a whole three d setup in my yard.

3588
02:29:41,371 --> 02:29:43,700
Yeah.
Shooting a rubber elk all day to day.

3589
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:45,170
My arms are sore.
Yeah.

3590
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:46,490
Yeah.
You have to be an asshole.

3591
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:49,790
Well,
you have to be committed to it.

3592
02:29:49,970 --> 02:29:51,180
Yes.
And yes.

3593
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:54,040
I,
the hardest thing for me during that

3594
02:29:54,041 --> 02:29:57,850
time of the year on the farm is to sit
in a tree and wait for a deer to come

3595
02:29:57,851 --> 02:29:59,260
by.
Um,

3596
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:02,620
I've got all of these other things that
I need to be doing that during that

3597
02:30:02,621 --> 02:30:04,210
period of time,
not at my,

3598
02:30:04,710 --> 02:30:07,120
at my work and in Madison or something
like that,

3599
02:30:07,121 --> 02:30:11,290
but on that farm.
So I'm actually moving a little bit more

3600
02:30:11,291 --> 02:30:13,840
towards in,
during archery season is because I've

3601
02:30:13,841 --> 02:30:17,020
not had a whole lot of archery and we've
had a couple of guys over the years.

3602
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:20,980
But to start the host people come home
cause I'm gonna be there anyway.

3603
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,470
I might be partaking in it and myself.

3604
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:26,790
Well that's my,
that's actually more attractive to me

3605
02:30:26,791 --> 02:30:31,050
then even coming on an opening day now.
How long does the uh,

3606
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:34,650
archery season last until the 1st of
January.

3607
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:36,750
Til the 1st of January.
So it goes straight through.

3608
02:30:36,930 --> 02:30:38,070
Well you can,
yeah,

3609
02:30:38,071 --> 02:30:41,250
you can bow hunt during the gun season.
So I could have come down and bow hunted

3610
02:30:41,251 --> 02:30:42,630
when those girls were shooting
squirrels.

3611
02:30:42,631 --> 02:30:43,530
I could have bow hunted.

3612
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:45,270
Yes.
And when they were shooting deer,

3613
02:30:45,271 --> 02:30:47,460
you could have bow hunted.
You just had to wear orange jacket

3614
02:30:47,461 --> 02:30:48,570
rather than the camouflage.

3615
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:51,770
But before that I could work cammo yeah.
So I could,

3616
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:52,633
I could,
uh,

3617
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:56,180
I could archery,
hunt and then bail and then take off

3618
02:30:56,181 --> 02:30:57,130
right before.
Hmm.

3619
02:30:57,830 --> 02:30:59,840
Oh that's,
it's end of October.

3620
02:30:59,841 --> 02:31:00,390
The first part,

3621
02:31:00,390 --> 02:31:01,380
November.
Uh,

3622
02:31:01,410 --> 02:31:02,580
when the,
when the,

3623
02:31:03,890 --> 02:31:05,940
the act of rod is going on,
that's,

3624
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,080
that's the time.
What's,

3625
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:09,260
what's the deal with a black powder?
Is that still separate?

3626
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:11,010
That's after.
After everything.

3627
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:12,970
After the gun season.
So then it lasted black

3628
02:31:12,970 --> 02:31:14,050
power.
Black power.

3629
02:31:15,220 --> 02:31:17,040
I'm just kidding.
[inaudible]

3630
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,100
people know we're talking about,
we're talking

3631
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,170
about muzzle loaders.
Yeah.

3632
02:31:21,370 --> 02:31:24,900
For some strange fucking reason.
It's okay to use a primitive,

3633
02:31:24,901 --> 02:31:27,480
stupid weapon that you should never use
in real life.

3634
02:31:27,990 --> 02:31:32,340
You put a ball and you pack the powder
in like you're living in the fucking 18

3635
02:31:32,341 --> 02:31:34,680
hundreds.
Can you shoot this stupid thing?

3636
02:31:34,890 --> 02:31:35,461
The,
and the thing,

3637
02:31:35,461 --> 02:31:38,430
here's the thing about muskets.
This is the weird thing about them.

3638
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:43,290
They're real fucking accurate now.
Like real accurate to like 200 yards.

3639
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:46,950
So they're basically a rifle that you
can't make a good ethical followup shot

3640
02:31:46,951 --> 02:31:48,750
on.
I don't like,

3641
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:51,690
I get it old.
Not only that,

3642
02:31:51,691 --> 02:31:54,450
you shoot in this fucking giant cloud of
smoke in front of me.

3643
02:31:54,451 --> 02:31:56,430
I don't know what happened.
Boom.

3644
02:31:56,431 --> 02:31:57,420
Where's the animal?
I don't know.

3645
02:31:57,421 --> 02:31:58,500
Did he hit it low?
Fucking,

3646
02:31:58,501 --> 02:31:59,334
I dunno.
Well,

3647
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:00,690
there'd be plenty of people who are
going to,

3648
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:02,510
you're going to hear it from the Congo.

3649
02:32:02,770 --> 02:32:04,160
I know.
I listened.

3650
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:07,110
It's,
it is definitely more accurate and

3651
02:32:07,111 --> 02:32:10,770
better than a bow,
but my point is use a fucking gun.

3652
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:13,200
Like why?
If you're shooting one of those things

3653
02:32:13,201 --> 02:32:15,420
and it's accurate to several hundred
yards,

3654
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:19,260
I know people that have shot a deer at
250 yards with a musket,

3655
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:22,080
so with a muzzle loader,
when you're getting to that kind of a

3656
02:32:22,081 --> 02:32:24,030
distance,
like what does that really,

3657
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:26,190
well,
you're got a rifle to shitty rifle.

3658
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:30,090
If you're talking about a bow,
if you shot something at 200 yards,

3659
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,460
you're basically closing your eyes and
shooting up at the sun.

3660
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:34,740
You know who the fuck knows where that
Arrow is going?

3661
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:37,860
You're shooting 250 yards,
both a musket or a muzzle loader.

3662
02:32:37,861 --> 02:32:41,520
You can put the crosshair on that thing.
You can accurately judge just like he

3663
02:32:41,521 --> 02:32:44,430
came with a rifle.
The problem is it takes you like 15 to

3664
02:32:44,431 --> 02:32:47,380
20 seconds to reload as opposed to just
going straight.

3665
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:49,440
If you're,
if you want to make a followup shot with

3666
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:50,580
a rifle,
you know,

3667
02:32:50,581 --> 02:32:54,370
or there's a lot of people now that are
hunting with semiautomatics,

3668
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:56,130
whether you're going Pang,
Pang,

3669
02:32:56,131 --> 02:32:58,800
Pang,
you can shoot a deer three times in two

3670
02:32:58,801 --> 02:33:00,980
seconds.
I'll think about the black potters.

3671
02:33:00,981 --> 02:33:02,790
You've got to have your bayonet for the
finish.

3672
02:33:02,830 --> 02:33:07,200
That's the civil war.
Then you're on the run.

3673
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,170
Do you have to have a flint?
It hits the thing.

3674
02:33:10,171 --> 02:33:11,980
It makes us Johnny Reb,
yeah.

3675
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:14,310
Everybody has their preference

3676
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:18,340
thing on my or my family's farm.
You know,

3677
02:33:18,341 --> 02:33:20,980
I'm the captain and the captain gets to
decide what happens.

3678
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:22,060
Yeah.
And um,

3679
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:23,860
um,
and so,

3680
02:33:23,861 --> 02:33:24,381
you know,
and,

3681
02:33:24,381 --> 02:33:25,480
and it's like,
oh,

3682
02:33:25,481 --> 02:33:27,970
this is the way it's going to be.
I'm not absolute about anything.

3683
02:33:27,971 --> 02:33:29,890
You know,
over time things kind of ebb and flow

3684
02:33:29,891 --> 02:33:31,090
and change and,
and uh,

3685
02:33:31,570 --> 02:33:32,620
you know,
for me,

3686
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:33,341
well,
I still want to,

3687
02:33:33,341 --> 02:33:37,000
I want to be out there in that first
part of that first part of November.

3688
02:33:37,210 --> 02:33:39,910
I don't have to practice everyday I k
camp where I live.

3689
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:43,660
I don't have to become a,
and I readily admit it.

3690
02:33:43,690 --> 02:33:44,081
I,
you know,

3691
02:33:44,081 --> 02:33:45,760
I have an old hoyt,
um,

3692
02:33:45,850 --> 02:33:47,710
and uh,
I liked the bowl and I'll shoot it once

3693
02:33:47,711 --> 02:33:48,730
in a while,
but man,

3694
02:33:48,880 --> 02:33:51,670
20 yards about it where I feel like I
can make an ethical shot.

3695
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:53,710
Dare you,
we need to get you a new hood.

3696
02:33:54,010 --> 02:33:55,480
What year?
What year or do you have

3697
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,300
man,
I'd have to check with Shane.

3698
02:33:57,301 --> 02:33:58,440
That guy bought it from,
it was,

3699
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:00,730
I bought it from him used cause he was
upgraded

3700
02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:02,970
in the 60s.
Like one of them bamboo ones.

3701
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:08,460
Fucking a,
I think it's like a mid eighties,

3702
02:34:08,461 --> 02:34:11,760
maybe a late eighties.
Laundry wheels for fucking laundry.

3703
02:34:12,250 --> 02:34:13,480
Yeah.
Uh,

3704
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:16,070
mid eighties for real.
Uh,

3705
02:34:16,210 --> 02:34:17,080
mid to late eighties.

3706
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,010
Maybe it was early nineties.
I'm sure I'll hear.

3707
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:22,050
She was a slingshot.
Do you have any rocks you going bro?

3708
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:24,100
Fuck.
Are you doing man

3709
02:34:25,870 --> 02:34:27,910
spear?
Just jump on the tree.

3710
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,840
It's just not my,
uh,

3711
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,100
uh,
my priority and,

3712
02:34:33,110 --> 02:34:34,660
and,
and I have a lot of ways,

3713
02:34:35,560 --> 02:34:39,220
I have a lot of respect for bow hunters
who spend the time to become that

3714
02:34:39,221 --> 02:34:41,920
proficient at it.
And then you end up spending a lot of

3715
02:34:41,921 --> 02:34:43,660
time whitetail hunting.
I are is,

3716
02:34:43,661 --> 02:34:45,560
there's guys who spent a lot of time
doing that.

3717
02:34:45,561 --> 02:34:46,570
And like I said,
I just don't,

3718
02:34:46,670 --> 02:34:49,730
I totally understand.
I totally understand.

3719
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:52,320
I'm totally bust your balls.
It's not something that I would add.

3720
02:34:52,790 --> 02:34:54,610
I don't think anybody should do it.
How about that?

3721
02:34:56,150 --> 02:34:58,390
I'll go hunting.
It's too much work and it's too

3722
02:34:58,391 --> 02:34:59,570
addictive.
It just,

3723
02:34:59,571 --> 02:35:02,080
and forget about bow hunting.
If I never hunt again for the rest of my

3724
02:35:02,081 --> 02:35:02,380
life.

3725
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:04,660
Archery is massively addictive.
I love it.

3726
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:05,973
I'm,
I'm shooting,

3727
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:08,440
I shoot every day.
It's so much fun to me.

3728
02:35:08,441 --> 02:35:11,560
It's a,
it's a nice peaceful like meditation

3729
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:14,320
type of a thing.
But they have like ranges out here.

3730
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:14,970
Yeah,
yeah.

3731
02:35:14,970 --> 02:35:15,803
There's a bunch.
Yeah,

3732
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:17,580
there's a bunch.
There's a,

3733
02:35:17,581 --> 02:35:19,840
a big one off of a,
the two 10.

3734
02:35:19,841 --> 02:35:22,060
So she's fucking huge long distance
range.

3735
02:35:22,061 --> 02:35:23,380
But I think that,
um,

3736
02:35:23,410 --> 02:35:24,910
it's a,
it's a nice meditation.

3737
02:35:24,911 --> 02:35:27,790
It's nice to do,
but when it comes to compound bows,

3738
02:35:27,970 --> 02:35:32,110
man is really the difference between of
both from the 1980s and a modern like

3739
02:35:32,111 --> 02:35:35,400
2016 hoyt defiant.
He might as well be shooting a mosque.

3740
02:35:35,401 --> 02:35:37,930
It versus like a modern savage arms
rifle.

3741
02:35:37,931 --> 02:35:39,300
It's not that much difference.
Yeah.

3742
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:40,210
I mean the,
the,

3743
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:41,020
the real,
the,

3744
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:45,280
the amount of power that these things
have now and the speed in which they

3745
02:35:45,281 --> 02:35:46,840
shoot arrows and the accuracy.

3746
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:49,900
There's so much technology and
engineering going into bose,

3747
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:52,900
it's really kind of amazing because it's
one of the few pieces of hunting

3748
02:35:52,901 --> 02:35:55,480
equipment that literally changes and
improves every year.

3749
02:35:56,350 --> 02:35:59,080
Couldn't sell.
We think about that when I hear these,

3750
02:35:59,190 --> 02:36:00,910
uh,
the bowhunting purist friends who are

3751
02:36:00,911 --> 02:36:04,030
just cackling right now about you giving
me shit about,

3752
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:06,330
about bow hunting,
which is great.

3753
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:08,880
They're going,
well this is a real purist.

3754
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:11,110
The thing I'm a pussy because he,
he's a compound bows.

3755
02:36:11,130 --> 02:36:14,590
They recur cause they like not being
accurate at all.

3756
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:17,260
They're like,
they're like fucking hoping they hit

3757
02:36:17,261 --> 02:36:18,094
shit.

3758
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:21,200
Sorry.
I can,

3759
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:22,840
they're there.
They get mad at me right now.

3760
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:27,870
Full
shoot a real bowl man with you of going

3761
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:31,060
make it yourself.
Get some leather.

3762
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:32,890
The last animal.
Your shot.

3763
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:37,000
Wrap it around your fingers.
I actually think that Steve was talking

3764
02:36:37,001 --> 02:36:40,400
about on this upcoming butchery one
about how he was taking,

3765
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:43,720
how they used to take the silver skin
off of meat and they'd get the long

3766
02:36:43,721 --> 02:36:46,870
strips of it and that's what they made
their bow string trains with.

3767
02:36:47,050 --> 02:36:47,910
Yeah.
Sinew.

3768
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:49,330
Yeah.
That's amazing.

3769
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:51,850
Yeah.
You should dry it out and roll it and

3770
02:36:51,851 --> 02:36:52,840
turn it into,
I mean,

3771
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:55,680
did you see his thing from um,
uh,

3772
02:36:55,710 --> 02:36:58,090
w when he was in the jungle?
Was it Borneo?

3773
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,560
Where the fuck did he go?
Bolivia.

3774
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:00,653
Bolivia.
Yeah.

3775
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:02,770
God Damn,
that was an amazing show.

3776
02:37:02,771 --> 02:37:04,190
Two part episode.
Yeah.

3777
02:37:04,191 --> 02:37:06,700
They went to Bolivia and the traditional
bows,

3778
02:37:06,701 --> 02:37:11,020
those guys use to kill animals.
They had these really heavy,

3779
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:16,110
really long arrows and these stick bows
that they had made themselves

3780
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:20,420
and he showed up with a hoyt carbon
spider and he's drilling.

3781
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:20,961
Yeah.
There's,

3782
02:37:20,961 --> 02:37:21,860
there's the,
uh,

3783
02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:23,370
balls of these guys had,
well,

3784
02:37:23,371 --> 02:37:24,670
look at that errol.
Yeah.

3785
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:25,790
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

3786
02:37:25,791 --> 02:37:28,550
They had these really long,
really heavy arrows and notice how

3787
02:37:28,551 --> 02:37:32,330
there's no fledglings on the Arrow and
he's got the followup Arrow right there

3788
02:37:32,331 --> 02:37:33,110
in his hand.
Yeah.

3789
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:35,390
Yeah,
they keep them in their hands.

3790
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:40,160
And I remember on this episode how he
struggled to,

3791
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:42,570
uh,
hit the fish because the,

3792
02:37:42,571 --> 02:37:46,290
how the water reflect the Arrow and
these guys,

3793
02:37:46,291 --> 02:37:48,890
you're just nailing them when after,
and it's not just that,

3794
02:37:48,891 --> 02:37:51,200
it's not the water deflecting.
It's the image.

3795
02:37:51,330 --> 02:37:54,560
It looks different.
The fish is actually,

3796
02:37:54,590 --> 02:37:57,290
it could be as much as six inches lower
than what you think.

3797
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:59,330
Ah.
Cause the refraction in the water from

3798
02:37:59,331 --> 02:38:01,670
your looking down,
it almost like a lens.

3799
02:38:01,970 --> 02:38:04,610
So it's like distorted where the actual
fish is.

3800
02:38:04,611 --> 02:38:06,950
So if you shot right at the fish,
he would never hit it.

3801
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:08,750
Yeah.
You have to shoot like below it.

3802
02:38:08,751 --> 02:38:09,950
It's real weird.
You ever,

3803
02:38:09,970 --> 02:38:13,170
do you ever see the,
the ones that people use in America?

3804
02:38:13,171 --> 02:38:14,690
The,
it's like a trident.

3805
02:38:14,770 --> 02:38:15,680
Yeah.
It's like a big,

3806
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:16,741
you know,
they're your,

3807
02:38:16,741 --> 02:38:19,670
you're kind of making up for that.
You know,

3808
02:38:19,671 --> 02:38:23,120
you got some more,
we have all these prongs and they shoot

3809
02:38:23,121 --> 02:38:26,450
these arrows that like they split when
they're doing sturgeon.

3810
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:29,830
The shocks.
Well,

3811
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,530
we,
uh,

3812
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:32,750
when I was a kid,
we used to shoot carp up at the end of

3813
02:38:32,751 --> 02:38:37,110
the lake and,
but there is the sh waters real shallow

3814
02:38:37,111 --> 02:38:38,870
and they'd go up there and just raise
hell and their backs,

3815
02:38:38,871 --> 02:38:41,750
it'd be out of the water.
So you'd be dealing with it,

3816
02:38:41,751 --> 02:38:42,140
right,
right,

3817
02:38:42,140 --> 02:38:42,590
right.

3818
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:46,220
Yeah.
I used to live near Lake Charles in

3819
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:51,430
Boston and there was a area by the
waterfall with the carpet pool up and it

3820
02:38:51,471 --> 02:38:52,370
was incredible.
I mean,

3821
02:38:52,371 --> 02:38:56,300
you're looking at like these 20,
30 pound fish and there's dozens of them

3822
02:38:56,301 --> 02:38:59,420
just stacked together and you see him on
the surface of the water,

3823
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:02,900
you know,
but it's a junk fish to us,

3824
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:05,930
but a delicacy to people in the UK and
in Asia.

3825
02:39:05,931 --> 02:39:07,940
It's very interesting.
Like what one person?

3826
02:39:08,290 --> 02:39:11,270
Yeah,
one person decides it's a good fish and

3827
02:39:11,271 --> 02:39:12,330
then in the,
you know,

3828
02:39:12,331 --> 02:39:16,370
and the problem was they were an
invasive species and a lot of the North

3829
02:39:16,370 --> 02:39:20,330
American rivers and lakes and people
don't like them for whatever silly

3830
02:39:20,331 --> 02:39:22,040
reason,
but there are very good fish to eat

3831
02:39:22,041 --> 02:39:24,200
apparently.
If you prepare it properly,

3832
02:39:24,970 --> 02:39:25,820
you can say,
you know,

3833
02:39:25,821 --> 02:39:27,520
a lot of things.
I mean you're,

3834
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:30,110
one of the things about grass fed beef
is um,

3835
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:31,820
you know,
a lot of times it doesn't have the fat.

3836
02:39:32,090 --> 02:39:33,920
So I mean,
you got to know how to cook it.

3837
02:39:33,921 --> 02:39:35,000
You can't overcook it.
Right.

3838
02:39:35,001 --> 02:39:36,370
That's a big point.
I mean,

3839
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:37,670
you can say about any kind of meat.
I mean,

3840
02:39:37,671 --> 02:39:40,100
people fuck up a really good piece of
meat,

3841
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:41,240
you know?
Well,

3842
02:39:41,241 --> 02:39:43,940
especially if a real lean piece of deer,
venison,

3843
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:45,590
elk or something like that.
Moose,

3844
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:49,040
same thing mean you what you want to
barely like singe the outside of it

3845
02:39:49,041 --> 02:39:49,910
almost.
And just,

3846
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:53,450
and you know,
and knowing like how to prepare it as a

3847
02:39:53,480 --> 02:39:55,430
big part of the responsibility of
hunting.

3848
02:39:55,750 --> 02:39:58,730
You know,
you don't want to have this meat that

3849
02:39:58,731 --> 02:40:01,670
you've got from this animal and you have
so much reverence for the death of this

3850
02:40:01,671 --> 02:40:04,220
animal and then you just prepare it like
an asshole.

3851
02:40:04,540 --> 02:40:07,520
Like you have to put almost as much
thought into the cooking.

3852
02:40:07,700 --> 02:40:09,680
It's one of the things I really love
about Rinella show.

3853
02:40:09,710 --> 02:40:12,290
Yes sir.
Like the episode that I watched last

3854
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:14,040
night about that mule deer that

3855
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,180
he shot this enormous dear,
was it really focused on at the end of

3856
02:40:18,181 --> 02:40:19,200
it,
how we prepared it.

3857
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:21,540
You know,
he showed you how to prepare it and how

3858
02:40:21,541 --> 02:40:24,720
to cook it properly and how you can tell
when it's done and all this different

3859
02:40:24,721 --> 02:40:25,440
stuff.
And Neil,

3860
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:28,860
he'll go through the butchering process.
We'll go through the cooking process and

3861
02:40:28,861 --> 02:40:30,750
that's something,
a lot of these shows they don't even

3862
02:40:30,751 --> 02:40:32,730
touch man.
They get the dear luke at him.

3863
02:40:32,731 --> 02:40:36,060
He's a real Iowa giant and they take a
picture with this animal.

3864
02:40:36,061 --> 02:40:40,070
They show the antlers.
Look at his fourth son is fifth and Brow

3865
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:44,460
Tine is sticking up black pass or don't
intend the tower during the tower down

3866
02:40:44,461 --> 02:40:45,440
in Texas.
Yeah,

3867
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:47,100
well there's a lot of that,
a lot of donating,

3868
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:49,860
a lot of donating and this is,
I suppose that's a good thing,

3869
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:51,030
but yes,
it is a good thing.

3870
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:52,710
But there's also shows where they're
pretend,

3871
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:54,500
you know,
we're out here hunting and you know,

3872
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:56,780
you gotta use fucking piles of corn out
there,

3873
02:40:56,790 --> 02:40:59,400
whether you're waiting for these animals
to come to and you're,

3874
02:40:59,401 --> 02:41:01,320
you know,
you just kind of shooting at these spots

3875
02:41:01,321 --> 02:41:01,651
where,
you know,

3876
02:41:01,651 --> 02:41:03,300
they're gonna be,
isn't that,

3877
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:06,780
that's always an interesting part of any
discussion about hunting,

3878
02:41:06,781 --> 02:41:07,471
about,
you know,

3879
02:41:07,471 --> 02:41:09,960
where the ethical lines yes.
Because guys will say,

3880
02:41:09,961 --> 02:41:12,420
well,
we cause baiting is illegal by us

3881
02:41:12,421 --> 02:41:14,940
because of a chronic wasting disease.
Um,

3882
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:18,560
when you put a pilot corn out there
exchanging saliva and that's how they,

3883
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:20,670
that's how it spread.
That's interesting cause,

3884
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:26,010
but you guys do have some deer farms,
which is where people think the origins

3885
02:41:26,011 --> 02:41:28,060
of chronic wasting disease or from,
yeah.

3886
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:30,450
I heard an interesting,
uh,

3887
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:32,820
uh,
discussion about that recently and one

3888
02:41:32,821 --> 02:41:35,520
of the things they talked about is that
there were these protein blocks being

3889
02:41:35,521 --> 02:41:37,020
put out and that may have been there.

3890
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:39,050
They've never,
uh,

3891
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:42,450
there've been a few different ideas of
where it came from.

3892
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:43,313
And,
um,

3893
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:45,460
one is,
uh,

3894
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:48,030
uh,
from the deer farms and other is these

3895
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:51,530
protein blacks that maybe got put out
and it's got an animal byproduct in it.

3896
02:41:51,531 --> 02:41:55,560
And maybe that's how it,
so is it like a prime thing?

3897
02:41:55,590 --> 02:41:57,210
Is it something that's exactly what it
is,

3898
02:41:57,211 --> 02:41:59,640
is a priority.
So it's similar to mad cow disease.

3899
02:41:59,641 --> 02:42:01,020
That's exactly right.
Oh,

3900
02:42:01,470 --> 02:42:03,130
so would that have come?
I don't know.

3901
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:04,160
Um,
you know,

3902
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:06,950
and I've even heard it said that,
um,

3903
02:42:07,410 --> 02:42:10,350
there are places where they were and
tried to improve the genetics of the

3904
02:42:10,351 --> 02:42:11,700
deer herd.
So they were bringing in,

3905
02:42:12,380 --> 02:42:13,920
you know,
bigger bucks and releasing him.

3906
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:16,020
I don't have any proof of any of it.
So those,

3907
02:42:17,150 --> 02:42:20,850
that could be the case that they are,
they are very concerned with people that

3908
02:42:20,851 --> 02:42:23,580
release these animals from these farms
out.

3909
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:26,280
But there's some fucking place,
like I got contacted by this guy,

3910
02:42:26,281 --> 02:42:28,110
hey man,
come hawn tent my place.

3911
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:31,200
And then I looked at his instagram page
and I'm like,

3912
02:42:31,201 --> 02:42:33,760
that's not even a fucking cage.
Well,

3913
02:42:33,761 --> 02:42:35,490
it,
I don't know.

3914
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:37,400
I don't want to talk shit because,
uh,

3915
02:42:37,401 --> 02:42:37,831
I,
you know,

3916
02:42:37,831 --> 02:42:39,150
I don't know this guy.
I don't know why,

3917
02:42:39,151 --> 02:42:41,820
but it's a high fund fence operation.
Um,

3918
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:43,260
I don't even want to say what state it
is,

3919
02:42:43,290 --> 02:42:45,190
but these are,
they're barely deer.

3920
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:47,820
There are these,
these deer that have these fucking

3921
02:42:47,821 --> 02:42:49,230
bushes growing out of their heads.
Yeah.

3922
02:42:49,440 --> 02:42:51,480
If you see what their antlers look like,
you're like,

3923
02:42:51,481 --> 02:42:53,010
okay,
that's not even real.

3924
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:57,810
Have you get Jamie pull,
pull up this a ridiculous antlers in a

3925
02:42:57,811 --> 02:42:59,680
deer farm.
Oh,

3926
02:42:59,790 --> 02:43:02,310
they,
they're growing these animals and their

3927
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:05,340
trophy trophy.
Do you call them trophies?

3928
02:43:05,341 --> 02:43:09,510
But essentially they're manipulating the
genetics of these animals so that they

3929
02:43:09,511 --> 02:43:10,890
have all these antlers.

3930
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:15,010
So these are rich assholes can go and
shoot these things and like this hundred

3931
02:43:15,011 --> 02:43:18,340
acre fenced in area where they're
letting these animals out of their

3932
02:43:18,341 --> 02:43:19,010
pants,
like look,

3933
02:43:19,010 --> 02:43:20,650
see,
what is that?

3934
02:43:20,860 --> 02:43:23,440
What are we looking at here for one
reason,

3935
02:43:23,530 --> 02:43:25,480
which is free.
So you could put that on your wall.

3936
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:30,460
I'm sure you could kill it and it would
taste just like a regular deer.

3937
02:43:30,461 --> 02:43:31,930
I'm sure they're delicious and they
probably,

3938
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:36,700
but look at this man.
So they're growing these insane antlers

3939
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:40,150
via supplemental feeding them
supplements and feeding them this shit

3940
02:43:40,151 --> 02:43:44,170
that makes their like antler steroids
that makes their antlers grow.

3941
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:45,840
They don't look like antlers,
Matt.

3942
02:43:45,841 --> 02:43:47,240
It looks like two.
Yeah,

3943
02:43:47,580 --> 02:43:50,020
like all nut.
Like Doug said,

3944
02:43:50,021 --> 02:43:52,390
we were talking about this.
It's criminal.

3945
02:43:52,570 --> 02:43:55,720
I mean Doug's very strong opinion and
needed about that.

3946
02:43:55,721 --> 02:43:58,200
I mean that's what's critical here.
Be Careful

3947
02:43:59,970 --> 02:44:00,370
Cajun.

3948
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:01,520
Oh Man.
Cajun Amanda.

3949
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:03,210
And then having a three,
you know,

3950
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:06,230
300 acres isn't that big.
And you've got this 300 acres cage,

3951
02:44:06,260 --> 02:44:08,800
you know,
that's not hunting fish in a barrel.

3952
02:44:08,801 --> 02:44:11,920
That's fish in a barrel.
I said earlier with that on 40 acres.

3953
02:44:11,921 --> 02:44:14,200
That's where that that you're true.
But you know what?

3954
02:44:14,201 --> 02:44:16,540
You could live that,
leave that 40 acres warning if he wants

3955
02:44:16,541 --> 02:44:18,310
to.
And that's a big part coming to a bait

3956
02:44:18,311 --> 02:44:19,780
pile or any of that stuff.
You know,

3957
02:44:19,790 --> 02:44:21,220
that's where it part of ethics.
Right.

3958
02:44:21,221 --> 02:44:22,570
And I figured him out.
Yeah.

3959
02:44:22,571 --> 02:44:26,500
And I guess that's where I was getting
to is you know where those lines are.

3960
02:44:26,501 --> 02:44:28,420
Well,
this is the hunting that I grew up with.

3961
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:30,310
I never,
I've never hunted,

3962
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:31,930
uh,
outside the Midwest.

3963
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:35,380
I really only hunted outside of our farm
twice.

3964
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:40,330
Why have a friend who hunted in Texas at
a ranch that has 10,000 acres fence?

3965
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:42,010
Den.
I'm like bolts as far as I'm concerned.

3966
02:44:42,011 --> 02:44:44,530
Those are wild animals.
10,000 acres.

3967
02:44:44,531 --> 02:44:46,720
Yeah.
I mean there's not a fucking animal on

3968
02:44:46,721 --> 02:44:48,910
earth that's going to travel that far
other than a mule deer.

3969
02:44:48,970 --> 02:44:50,860
There's not,
they're not an animal on earth is going

3970
02:44:50,861 --> 02:44:52,690
to migrate further than that and it's
lifetime.

3971
02:44:52,691 --> 02:44:57,220
You essentially have this gigantic
fenced in habitat and their idea about

3972
02:44:57,221 --> 02:44:57,731
it is,
look,

3973
02:44:57,731 --> 02:45:01,330
we can manage the wildlife,
sustainable wildlife inside.

3974
02:45:01,331 --> 02:45:03,620
We're not feeding them anything they
live off is,

3975
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:07,060
but we're just keeping people out.
We're not keeping the animals in,

3976
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:08,440
keeping people out.
I'm like,

3977
02:45:08,441 --> 02:45:10,540
okay,
I can buy that song.

3978
02:45:10,541 --> 02:45:11,374
I think,
yeah.

3979
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:12,890
Is that a lot in this eye line of the
song?

3980
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:16,440
The put up the fence fucking music out
or all the new showroom.

3981
02:45:16,570 --> 02:45:19,660
Oh
God was here.

3982
02:45:19,661 --> 02:45:23,050
He tell it to your face.
Manage some kind of sin.

3983
02:45:23,640 --> 02:45:26,500
Says hippies though,
that's hippies you want to fucking get

3984
02:45:26,501 --> 02:45:27,660
on your land.
By the way,

3985
02:45:27,670 --> 02:45:30,610
I hear that the bit where they're like,
ah,

3986
02:45:30,770 --> 02:45:33,430
the part about the sign,
the sign said,

3987
02:45:33,770 --> 02:45:37,300
um,
anybody caught trespassing will be shot

3988
02:45:37,301 --> 02:45:38,900
on sight.
You know,

3989
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:40,120
it's,
it's like a radio bit,

3990
02:45:40,140 --> 02:45:41,160
you know,
and then,

3991
02:45:42,430 --> 02:45:43,930
and then it ends.
That's the end of the song.

3992
02:45:44,110 --> 02:45:48,430
It's a complicated business.
It's a complicated business and these

3993
02:45:48,431 --> 02:45:50,120
ethical lines,
uh,

3994
02:45:50,590 --> 02:45:52,290
are difficult.
Uh,

3995
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:54,400
it's something that you have to think
about.

3996
02:45:54,401 --> 02:45:58,960
It's something you have to talk about
and we'll be willing to teach your mind

3997
02:45:58,961 --> 02:46:01,400
sometimes to a baiting bears is a big
dog.

3998
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:03,530
Baiting bears is a big one because,
uh,

3999
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:05,680
there's a lot of places where the only
way,

4000
02:46:05,681 --> 02:46:07,750
especially in the spring,
you're ever going to kill a bears if you

4001
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:08,980
bait.
So they,

4002
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:10,010
to control the population

4003
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:11,720
of these barriers because the bears are
killing Moose.

4004
02:46:11,721 --> 02:46:14,030
They're killing calves.
Uh,

4005
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:17,150
they're killing Fonz from deere,
the killing all sorts of things.

4006
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:18,980
And they're killing cubs.
They're killing each other.

4007
02:46:18,981 --> 02:46:20,930
I mean,
the bears are killing machines.

4008
02:46:21,110 --> 02:46:23,780
So when they have these in environments
where they have to control the

4009
02:46:23,781 --> 02:46:27,320
population and they allow baiting,
the reason why they allow baiting is to

4010
02:46:27,321 --> 02:46:30,980
make a successful hunt.
And recently I think in Maine it was,

4011
02:46:31,310 --> 02:46:34,310
I don't know if they passed it,
but they were trying to pass no baiting

4012
02:46:34,311 --> 02:46:36,230
on bears.
And the reason why they were doing it is

4013
02:46:36,231 --> 02:46:38,960
cause anti hunting.
People were trying to stop people from

4014
02:46:38,961 --> 02:46:42,020
hunting bear.
So the way they would essentially make a

4015
02:46:42,021 --> 02:46:44,210
hunt completely ineffective was saying
no baiting.

4016
02:46:44,510 --> 02:46:46,890
So cause as soon as you can't bait find
them,

4017
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:48,490
yeah.
You're not gonna have any success.

4018
02:46:48,491 --> 02:46:49,960
You don't have,
you don't find any success.

4019
02:46:49,961 --> 02:46:50,440
Yeah,
no.

4020
02:46:50,440 --> 02:46:52,470
I have friends who live in Michigan and
they were telling me,

4021
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:56,050
listen man,
you could go a fucking decade without

4022
02:46:56,051 --> 02:46:58,600
seeing a bear in the woods.
Meanwhile they're everywhere.

4023
02:46:58,670 --> 02:47:00,340
Yeah.
You just don't find them.

4024
02:47:00,341 --> 02:47:03,050
You go near him that you hear the,
they hear a snap and twitter.

4025
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:04,320
Like this guy.
Yeah.

4026
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:05,373
And they

4027
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:07,300
so quiet.
It's pads.

4028
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:10,130
It's one of the weirdest thing about
bear hunting is when you're out there

4029
02:47:10,131 --> 02:47:11,870
and you're waiting,
they walk,

4030
02:47:11,910 --> 02:47:13,790
you know,
like you stand by like a trail where you

4031
02:47:13,791 --> 02:47:16,880
know the head by,
you'll see one before you hear it.

4032
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:18,650
Like they'll just be right there.
You're like,

4033
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:20,510
oh shit,
he's right there.

4034
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:23,120
They're just so God damn quiet.
Amazing.

4035
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:26,030
That's such a big animal.
It could be so quiet and slippers on

4036
02:47:26,031 --> 02:47:27,620
their feet.
They have slippers.

4037
02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:29,630
Yeah,
I mean the pads.

4038
02:47:29,631 --> 02:47:32,390
Vera touched the bear's pads.
It's weird man.

4039
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:35,540
And it's designed to creep up on Shit,
you know?

4040
02:47:35,570 --> 02:47:36,920
I mean,
that's why cats have them too.

4041
02:47:36,921 --> 02:47:38,540
They have those pads at the bottom of
their feet.

4042
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:40,420
They,
why don't they have hooves hooves?

4043
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:41,151
Be Better.
Yeah.

4044
02:47:41,151 --> 02:47:42,760
Well hooves back too much.
No,

4045
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:44,930
you can't be jacking chant with all
that.

4046
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:47,150
Nice.
So they come creeping up on you.

4047
02:47:47,151 --> 02:47:48,920
But they're like little ghosts,
man.

4048
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:54,560
Weird cats and bears.
They're ghosts pad slipper wearing

4049
02:47:54,561 --> 02:47:57,850
fucking ghosts.
No.

4050
02:47:58,480 --> 02:47:59,420
Oh,
good stuff.

4051
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:00,613
Listen,
I think,

4052
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:02,220
I think we're done.
I think we should wrap this pitch up and

4053
02:48:02,230 --> 02:48:03,750
bring it home.
Um,

4054
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:05,420
so there's a lot of fun,
man.

4055
02:48:05,421 --> 02:48:06,470
Thank you.
Absolutely.

4056
02:48:06,500 --> 02:48:07,333
I appreciate it.

4057
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:11,380
I would say a little bit about,
yeah,

4058
02:48:11,410 --> 02:48:14,770
thank you very much.
And to steal a line from Ray Wylie

4059
02:48:14,770 --> 02:48:17,170
Hubbard,
the days I keep my gratitude higher than

4060
02:48:17,171 --> 02:48:20,950
my expectations are really good days and
today is about as good a day as you

4061
02:48:20,951 --> 02:48:21,784
could get.

4062
02:48:21,820 --> 02:48:24,760
Well I really enjoyed it.
I appreciate you guys flying out here

4063
02:48:24,761 --> 02:48:28,840

have this conversation and you know,

4064
02:48:28,841 --> 02:48:31,030
get,
get your perspective on things because I

4065
02:48:31,031 --> 02:48:32,920
think a lot of people have a,
you know,

4066
02:48:32,980 --> 02:48:36,070
listeners continue the discussion man
can never stop learning.

4067
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,800
That's what it's all about really.
I mean this is all about just trying to

4068
02:48:38,801 --> 02:48:41,740
figure out other people's perspectives
and together work together,

4069
02:48:41,741 --> 02:48:43,720
man.
It came man,

4070
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:45,980
stay the fuck off doug's land.
You hippies.

4071
02:48:46,140 --> 02:48:48,690

boss.

of fun.
