00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello Freak bitches.
When did this start?

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,500
When did the trigger warnings?
When did the safe spaces,

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,510
when did all this emerge?
Well,

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,600
it has its roots in the student radical 
Islam of the 19 sixties,

5
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,434
especially the far left radicalism.
It really popped up in the 19 nineties 

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,634
and the early nineties when I was 
teaching in the US at that point and 

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,600
which are,
you know,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,433
I taught at Harvard from 93 to 98 and 
there was a fair push for political 

9
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,280
correctness especially in the early part
of the nineties,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,473
but,
but it got pushed back down and 

11
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,310
disappeared and went under ground.
It went underground is more accurate and

12
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,144
then it's just come back with a 
vengeance in the last five years and I 

13
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,224
think it's partly because we have all 
these radical left political activist 

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,910
departments at the universities,
women's studies being at the top of the,

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,763
of the list that have done nothing for 
the last 30 years to even longer than 

16
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,630
that.
Now it's almost 40 years,

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,950
30 years,
let's say,

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,670
have done nothing but produce an never 
ending stream of ideological.

19
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:05,070
He reminded counter civilization,
political activists,

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,970
and that's all subsidized by,
by tuition and by the public purse,

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,923
and that's another thing we really got 
to ask ourselves is why the hell are we 

22
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,130
subsidizing revolution?
Why are we doing that?

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,600
It's crazy and it's dangerous.
It's dangerous.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,810
What?
So what exactly is going on with women's

25
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:31,320
studies that you believe is fostering 
revolution?

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,690
Wow.
You'd go on their websites and read,

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,640
read what they say.
I mean,

28
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,540
first of all,
for the,

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,280
for the women's studies types,
and this is a,

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,530
what would you call it,
a false anthropology.

31
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,364
There's this idea that way back when 
there was a feminist paradise and that 

32
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,424
would be like noble savage mode of 
living where everything was 

33
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,424
egalitarianism and a women dominated.
It was a matriarchal culture that was 

34
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:01,620
put forward by Ucla anthropologist named
[inaudible] tests.

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,200
I can never pronounce her name properly,
but I think I got it.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,940
And then that was overthrown by 
patriarchal institutions,

37
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,500
start essentially starting at about the 
time,

38
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,280
say,
of the,

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,940
of,
of,

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,150
of Judaism.
And that was all overthrown.

41
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,790
And ever since then we've lived in an 
oppressive patriarchy.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,320
And that's what our culture is.

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,153
It's an oppressive patriarchy.
So they're pointing to one unsuccessful 

44
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,560
society that they believe existed or did
it?

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,500
No,
no,

46
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,600
it didn't exist.
There's no evidence for whatsoever.

47
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,371
It's,
it's,

48
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,910
it's complicated,
but it's the,

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,013
it's the telling of a kind of 
psychological myth as if it was history 

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,813
and,
and,

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,230
and anyway.
So,

52
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:41,250
so the basic claim is that Western 
civilization is a brutish patriarchy and

53
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,084
that whatever positive things that might
have managed to accomplish were all 

54
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,280
accomplished as a consequence of 
oppression and,

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,230
and uh,
and theft.

56
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,030
And that the appropriate thing to do is 
to restructure it from the bottom up.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,840
And they mean that they mean that they 
mean every single bloody concept.

58
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:58,674
And you can marry that modern 
postmodernism and throw in a nice stash 

59
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,104
of Marxism and you have the,
the ideological and motivated grounds 

60
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,714
for social revolution.
And I'm just go online and look at a 

61
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,560
dozen women's studies websites.

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,650
Just read them.
You can see what they say.

63
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,484
They produce political activists and 
their goal is to restructure the 

64
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,660
patriarchy.
Well,

65
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,494
what's the patriarchy?
While the patriarchy is Western 

66
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,460
civilization and what is restructure 
mean?

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,120
That's easy.
It means tear it down and destroy it.

68
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,043
Why?
Because it's a brutish system that's 

69
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:38,360
predicated on nothing but oppression.
It's nothing but a tyranny in the,

70
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:41,560
in the eyes of the,
of the radical women's studies types,

71
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,930
heterosexuality.
That's a tyranny.

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,430
Capitalism.
That's a tyranny.

73
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,390
Democracy.
Well,

74
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,010
that doesn't even exist.
And even if it did,

75
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,040
it would be a tyranny.
Everything's a tyranny.

76
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,540
And so you can ask these and and what 
would they replace it with?

77
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,180
They replace it with their own 
ideological utopia.

78
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,890
While we've already had 100 years of 
that,

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,900
we saw what happened.
Oh well that doesn't matter.

80
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,420
That wasn't real Marxism.
That's what the bloody marks is.

81
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,030
Always say that wasn't real Marxism.
It's like,

82
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,893
oh,
how many millions of people have to die 

83
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,830
before you're convinced that it's real 
Marxism.

84
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,750
And I know what they mean by that too.
They mean,

85
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,050
hey,
if I was the Marxist dictator,

86
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,280
things would gone a lot better.
It's like a.

87
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,050
You should think again,
sunshine.

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,453
If you were the Marxists dictator,
things wouldn't have gotten a lot 

89
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,183
better.
So if you're the sort of person that 

90
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,730
thinks that if you would have been 
controlled,

91
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,564
things would've gotten a lot better than
you're exactly the sort of person who 

92
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:37,330
should never be in control.
So.

93
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,820
And it's resentment.
It's horrible.

94
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,930
Resentment,
you know?

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
That's an important point because I 
think this is something that you've said

96
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:47,380
that I absolutely agree with that I 
think a lot of this thinking and the way

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,440
people are behaving,
it seems based on revenge.

98
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,090
It seems based on revenge for awkward 
upbringings,

99
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:57,460
so social uncomfortable of 
uncomfortability.

100
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,313
That seems like there's something about 
the way they view the world where they 

101
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:04,810
want to get back at people that have 
literally done them no wrong.

102
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,770
It's resentment for the burden of being.
It's deeper,

103
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
it's deeper,
but I mean human being human existence 

104
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,300
is characterized by a fair bit of 
suffering.

105
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,790
You know,
we're limited creatures and life is very

106
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,230
hard.
Everyone dies.

107
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:19,840
Everyone you love is going to die.
Most of the things you do,

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,120
all of the things you do will eventually
fail.

109
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,583
You know,
suffering is a certainty and it's very 

110
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,280
easy for people to become resentful 
about,

111
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,620
about being,
about existence.

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,753
You know,
these kids who shoot up high schools 

113
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:32,410
and,
and,

114
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,160
and these mass shooters there,
they're the perfect examples of,

115
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,680
of people who run on nothing but 
resentment.

116
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,210
They're out to kill the innocent because
that's the best marker of a.

117
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,043
that's the best way of showing just how 
much contempt they have for existence 

118
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,520
itself.
Why punish the guilty?

119
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,880
They deserve to be punished.
It's a lot more malevolent and,

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,750
and,
and,

121
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,090
and,
and vengeful to punish the innocent.

122
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,150
It's like people are motivated to a 
great degree by resentment of being.

123
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,210
And a huge chunk of that is manifested 
in,

124
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,940
out to the dark side of the ideological 
possession.

125
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,523
So I get to decide who my enemies are 
and then I get to go after them and I 

126
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:09,734
can go after them for every single thing
that's ever been done to me that isn't 

127
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,210
good.
And well,

128
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,500
a lot of that's just built into the 
structure of existence.

129
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,130
Then they group up,
they exhibit confirmation bias.

130
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,023
They all form some sort of a group think
and then they act accordingly and this 

131
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,594
is what you've been warning against and 
this is where I completely agree with 

132
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,100
you in this way.

133
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,933
I think the subject is so important and 
I love the way you've outlined all the 

134
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,364
steps and the problems with Marxism and 
ideologies in general that we are 

135
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,194
dealing with this.
These are the beginning steps of it and 

136
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,910
people who look at it now and they say 
it's social change and social justice.

137
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,790
It's not.
It's not.

138
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,870
It's not.
That's right.

139
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,270
It's not.
This is not going to improve things.

140
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,550
Implementing these policies will make 
things worse.

141
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,473
They've made things worse.
Every single place they've ever been 

142
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:55,054
implemented and often they've made 
things so much worse that you actually 

143
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,870
can't imagine it and people don't do the
reading.

144
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,450
I've done the reading,
I've done the reading.

145
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,403
I know how bad things can get.
They can get so bad that no matter how 

146
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,540
bad you think they are,
you're not even in the bloody ballpark.

147
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,393
Well,
it's just so strange that these sort of 

148
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,093
courses and these sorts of ideologies 
are thriving in universities and it's 

149
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,380
really disconcerting to someone who has 
children.

150
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,470
You know,
that your children are going to go there

151
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,660
and they going to trade schools.
You know,

152
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,040
I think,
I think that,

153
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,110
wow,
I think I used to teach at Harvard,

154
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,480
just send them to trade schools,
the universities.

155
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,940
I think the universities,
I think you can make good,

156
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,390
reasonable case that the universities do
more harm than good.

157
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,040
Now,
I hate to say that.
