1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,950
Okay,

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,110
and we live these gentlemen,
we're live supporting the latest round 

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,110
earth Shell.
We're just coming out with it.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,650
Round Earth.
She'll tee shirts.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,980
Both Jamie and I get $3 per month from 
the federal government to tell you that 

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,830
the world is round and Mick West is a 
big part of it all.

7
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:30,831
He is one of the main shills that tells 
everybody that he knows that he has a 

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:35,571
whole website dedicated to arguing 
against people that think the world is 

9
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:35,571
flat.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,900
The differences that don't get paid for 
it.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,210
And stop lying.
I know you're getting 3:50

12
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,040
per month.
Yeah,

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,090
I wish I did.
I would have to pay for my web hosting 

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,660
and it's a command in my pocket and 
nobody pays me anything.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,890
See,
Mick West is serious.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,960
He's not joking around with us.
Um,

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,430
what this is to be one of the most 
bizarre trends.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,140
And Jamie,
I think you said at first that you 

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,591
thought it was originally a troll.
You thought that they were fucking 

20
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:03,591
around,
like,

21
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:06,060
I still think some people are for sure.
It's.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,410
Yeah,
but I feel like it started out with like

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,460
four Chan or something like that,
or maybe you read it,

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,920
these crazy kids,
these wacky kids,

25
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,921
they decided to start trolling saying 
that the earth is round or the earth is 

26
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:18,921
flat.
Some of it.

27
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:21,080
But a lot of it is just people who,
uh,

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,220
yeah,
they,

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,080
they actually believe it.
Yes.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,510
There's a lot of extra people actually 
believe it.

31
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,750
And then there's people who see that 
this people out there who believe it and

32
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,080
then they start like kind of egging 
these people on.

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,130
Yes.
And then it becomes really,

34
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,320
really hard to tell where the dividing 
line is,

35
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,800
who's actually trawling and who's 
actually a genuine,

36
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,430
true believer.

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,310
There are absolutely a lot of true 
believers,

38
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,490
but there's also a lot of people with 
like little green frogs in their avatar 

39
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,160
that think it's fucking hilarious.
Yeah,

40
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,380
I think it's the kind of,
uh,

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,460
that type of person that's kind of uh,
adopted it.

42
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,630
Yes.
Yes,

43
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:55,270
yes.
Uh,

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,900
you know,
you talking a shit posting the other.

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,790
Yes.
Yes.

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,310
And that's just something that you could
do is if you want to just annoy people,

47
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,310
buy shit posting,
you'll just post a bunch of flood earth 

48
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,810
memes because the so infuriating to the 
average person.

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,540
But I just kind of a what the heck is 
this person is posting and uh,

50
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,610
you know,
the shit poster enjoys that type of 

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,400
thing.
I was watching a video with this guy was

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,660
ranting on and on,
and then it's not theory that we need to

53
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,240
stop accepting that the flat earth 
theory,

54
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:30,390
but that it's a fact.
We need to start accepting the fact that

55
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,391
it's a effect.
He was hilarious when we find this 

56
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:35,690
because I saved.
It is a,

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,120
I think his name was like Vegan warrior 
or something like that.

58
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,430
Which is always a yes.
The Egan Warrior.

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,410
He's a realist.
It says it's no long.

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,170
He's not only a flat earth or he's a 
realist.

61
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,470
Yeah,
I think I've come across.

62
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,970
I think this is actually a relatively 
small number of people who were really 

63
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,110
active in promoting the flood of stuff 
on,

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,130
on Youtube.
What's in the world is that they

65
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,550
keep claiming that all the photos of 
earth are fake,

66
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,090
but they don't have a single photo of 
this fucking ice wall that's supposed to

67
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:11,230
be around Antarctica and they keep 
saying erroneous Lee,

68
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,480
that you're not allowed to fly over 
Antarctica.

69
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,400
Like,
yes you are.

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
They keep saying that there's no 
photographs of earth from space that 

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
they're all composites.
No,

72
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,430
that's not true.
Why do they keep saying that?

73
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,970
They keep saying that there's a fucking 
saddle is a bunch of satellites,

74
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,971
but there's one from Japan that takes 
high resolution photos of the earth 

75
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,830
every 10 minutes.
The full earth from 22,000

76
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,430
miles away.

77
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,630
Yeah,
that's the Japanese hemaware.

78
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,340
Yes.
But there's also like a,

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,190
as a US satellite that was just launched
last year that goes 16 satellite,

80
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,400
which is basically the same resolution.
Pull this sucker right up to your face.

81
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,190
And the Russians,
the Russians have a satellite,

82
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,240
a.
everyone's got their own satellite 

83
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240
because he's basically the way that 
satellites.

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240
So they put him like,
uh,

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240
oh,
uh,

86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,080
the equator so they can see their own,
uh,

87
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,070
their own country.
So Russia has one,

88
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,530
you can mostly see India,
China has one,

89
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:05,110
it's not as good as the other ones,
but the Russian one is there like a,

90
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,400
you know,
the same resolution,

91
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,610
121 megapixels as the size of the image 
that I do.

92
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,000
It's like a 11,000
pixels by 11,000

93
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,210
pixels view of the earth and you can 
zoom in and you can,

94
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:21,211
you can see cities,
you can see contrary cells and you can 

95
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:24,520
actually use these images from the 
satellites to actually match up with the

96
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:27,070
views of clouds and controls from the 
ground.

97
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,830
So you can actually check to see if 
these images are actually correct,

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,400
at least for where you are.
Right.

99
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,150
Then you could like finding friends and 
somewhere else and ask them like,

100
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,330
do you have this type of cloud overhead 
so you can actually verify whether 

101
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:39,330
these,
uh,

102
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,960
these images are actually real on it.
Well I brought it up to my friend Eddie 

103
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,420
and he said it's all fake.
He said all the photos of fake,

104
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,860
they look fake.
I'm like,

105
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,920
but how would you know what a real photo
of earth from 22,000

106
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,590
miles looked like?
Wouldn't look exactly like earth.

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,360
And I think when you get to that stage 
of deep belief,

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,370
you kind of have to believe that they're
fake.

109
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,650
There's no way,
a real challenge.

110
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,470
Like how do you actually break through 
that for somebody?

111
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,130
How can you actually,
um,

112
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,690
convince them that something isn't fake 
if they just automatically assume it's 

113
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:12,690
fake.

114
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,730
And I think has,
has the person actually looked in detail

115
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,731
at these images,
most people know and how they looked at 

116
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:20,731
the fact that,
you know,

117
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:23,020
you get one every 10 minutes.
I went every 15 minutes and do a,

118
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:28,021
you know,
every single images is 121 megapixel 

119
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:31,051
image and the old matches up exactly 
with what the weather is around the 

120
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:32,170
world and it matches up with all the 
other side images.

121
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,900
One from the Russians were on from the 
Chinese run from the Japanese.

122
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,880
Uh,
they all match up.

123
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,060
And I really don't think that the people
who say,

124
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,400
ah spake,
I've really actually looked.

125
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,760
No,
you're absolutely right there.

126
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,240
They definitely haven't,
nor nor do they have any desire to.

127
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,300
It's a belief issue and it's almost like
a religious issue.

128
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,170
It's a really fascinating.
It's completely infected.

129
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,750
The world of professional pool players,
really professional pool player,

130
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:58,220
a professional pool players.

131
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,260
There's a guy named cj Wiley's,
a top pool player who's 100 percent 

132
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,390
convinced the earth is flat.
There's another guy named Max everly's.

133
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,570
A buddy of mine out of his mind thinks 
the world is flat.

134
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,350
I wonder if that's related to their like
obsession with the table being flat.

135
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,940
No,
I don't think so.

136
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,950
You'd have to make sure that the 
temple's level,

137
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,930
but then they got this little round 
balls on the table as well,

138
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,920
so that's confusing,
right?

139
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,921
Yeah.
You got a little solar system going on 

140
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:25,781
with your pool balls.
What's confusing is they're smart guys 

141
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:25,781
like you.
We talked to them.

142
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:26,760
You'd be like,
this is a reasonable intelligent guy.

143
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,120
Are they really believing that his blood
100 percent,

144
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,630
they're not shit posting jewel.
This unusual people,

145
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,660
they go down a youtube rabbit hole and 
that's part of the problem is once you 

146
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,150
believe something,
yeah,

147
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,000
it's very difficult to unbelievers.

148
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,260
It is and there's so much out there.
Yeah.

149
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,340
If you tell people to do some research 
or the end up doing is just looking at 

150
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,550
more videos,
the confirm what they.

151
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,870
They believe that they prefer the ones 
that come from it of course,

152
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,170
but it's just amazing to me that people 
would decide that all of these photos 

153
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,710
were fake so that they don't believe the
world is round,

154
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,670
but yet they don't have a single photo 
of this fucking flat earth.

155
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,790
Not One one photo.
Not only that,

156
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,910
every planet you see is round.
You can.

157
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,940
You could follow them.
You could look at them with with if you 

158
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,421
have a reasonable telescope,
you could see the difference as the 

159
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:21,920
change and spin.
I mean you can tell that they're round.

160
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,250
There's a lot of flood earth.
Have the same camera that I've got,

161
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,480
which is a Nikon p 900 flat earthers 
have an excellent camera.

162
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,490
They have A.
I brought one with me.

163
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,520
They have like Nikon has a deal with the
flat earth society.

164
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,510
Is this,
this camera?

165
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,730
It's just like,
it's not like an slr or anything.

166
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,630
It's just like a $600 camera,
uh,

167
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,200
but it's got this really,
really long a zoom lens on it,

168
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,350
like a,
it's like a 200 millimeter zoom lens so 

169
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,551
you can see,
you can zoom in on the move and you can 

170
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,070
zoom in on the stars and planets and you
can use this camera.

171
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:57,071
I've used it a few times to actually 
take pictures of Jupiter and have a 

172
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,821
Venus Mars and you can actually just 
make out the roundness of the planet and

173
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:06,371
the actual shadow of the sun use.
You'll see Venus as being like the move 

174
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:10,400
and being like an arch and you'll see 
jupiter and you see the bands of Jupiter

175
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,780
and you can do that with this camera.

176
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,780
And this is a camera that a lot of them 
have because they're obsessed with 

177
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,020
zooming in on things that are on the 
horizon,

178
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,460
like ships going beyond the horizon.
But if they just start,

179
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,660
take the same camera that they haven't 
pointed upwards,

180
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,540
they would actually see things in the.
In the sea,

181
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,170
the solar system,
basically the rudy come be explained any

182
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:33,170
other way.
One great thing is the moons of Jupiter.

183
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,620
If you look up a Jupiter really closely,
even with some binoculars,

184
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:41,330
you can see it's got these four little 
moons that are orbiting it.

185
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,140
Then it looks like to just follow the 
lights in the line with with Jupiter and

186
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,770
they actually move around in a regular 
pattern and they move around.

187
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,840
They've got all bits of like some of 
them are thinking like 80 hours or 

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:53,840
something.
So they move around really fast.

189
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,911
Like everyday is a completely different 
pattern of these little dots around 

190
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:57,911
Jupiter.

191
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:57,911
And you can actually see that with this 
camera.

192
00:08:57,911 --> 00:09:02,621
I've taken photos of it,
posted them on the website or even with 

193
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,990
binoculars.
And if you actually watch it from day to

194
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,991
day,
you will see the moons of Jupiter move 

195
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:09,810
in exactly the same way that science 
predicts us that they should move.

196
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Were you using Kepler's laws of 
planetary motion and Newton's Newton's 

197
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,460
law of gravitation?
Uh,

198
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,290
they will.
Yeah,

199
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,300
they,
they move exactly as if they are a 

200
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
little simulation of a planetary system.
So either the,

201
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,810
some kind of weird hologram up in that 
little corner of the sky which moves 

202
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,520
around or there is actually a planet 
there with little moons orbiting it.

203
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,860
Probably Hologram.
What,

204
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,710
what,
when did you first become aware of this?

205
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,840
Like you,
you've run medibank for a long time.

206
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:44,280
And for those who don't know,
Mick and I met on the Scifi show that it

207
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:49,281
did Joe Rogan questions,
everything where we discussed chem 

208
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:52,161
trails or con trails and what causes a 
jet engine to make what looks like 

209
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:56,841
artificial clouds by passing through 
condensation in the heat of the engine 

210
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:56,850
produces these countries.

211
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,700
And people were absolutely convinced 
that these are,

212
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,550
that they're spraying the government is 
sprang something in the sky.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,860
And uh,
you,

214
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:04,720
you caught it,
you,

215
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,990
you had a fairly good explanation for 
it.

216
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:10,520
You said they're basically like training
wheels for conspiracy theories because.

217
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,780
Yeah,
it's,

218
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,610
it's,
uh,

219
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,160
something you can see.
Yeah,

220
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,900
I think he's said he's kind of more 
enticing.

221
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,990
Yes.
Uh,

222
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,170
and I think the same thing applies to 
the flat earth.

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,540
Now you got some.
When I got into the flutter thing,

224
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,330
it was,
I became aware of it a few years ago.

225
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:28,950
So yeah.
So the government is turning up.

226
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,320
Is that your camera?
Yeah,

227
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,920
yeah,
the government spying on.

228
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,290
Yeah.
So like,

229
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,610
uh,
when I first heard about the flood of,

230
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,660
they obviously have,
I heard it before my actually my father 

231
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:44,660
going back,
uh,

232
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,410
when I was young,
he told me that he was a member of the 

233
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,410
flood to society.

234
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,870
Your father told you that was he joking 
around?

235
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,930
A kind of,
but what he was doing it in a kind of a 

236
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,600
satirical way.
Ironically,

237
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,150
uh,
he was doing it because like he was like

238
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,880
saying people,
uh,

239
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,170
to sure of themselves.
And so I'm going to join the flux of the

240
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,420
society.
He didn't believe the earth was round,

241
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,750
so it's been around for quite a while.
The flat Earth Society and the flesh,

242
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,160
the flusher theory,
uh,

243
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,990
as beat around obviously like thousands 
of years ago,

244
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:17,991
people thought the earth was round and 
then slightly fewer thousand years ago 

245
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:18,930
people figured out that it wasn't,
it was figured out by the ancient Greeks

246
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:22,480
like 3000 years ago that it wasn't a um,
by the.

247
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,790
It wasn't that.
It wasn't,

248
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,780
it wasn't flat.
Sorry.

249
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,830
Oh,
you fucked it up.

250
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,250
You gave up the goose.
You,

251
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
you said thousands of years ago,
people thought the Earth was round and 

252
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,530
they realized it wasn't you just right 
now you gave them fuel.

253
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,550
That's a quote that's going to go on 
youtube.

254
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,200
I am a,
she'll quote from the last one.

255
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,640
What do you strike that one?
A slight misquote.

256
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,060
Yeah.
So,

257
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,360
so yeah.
What happened was science basically 

258
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,820
figured out the shape of the universe.
And you know,

259
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,440
in the,
uh,

260
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,450
the 18 hundreds,
there was a gentleman scientist doing 

261
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,640
those courses.
All kinds of cool things with stars,

262
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:02,641
like measuring the orbits and checking 
out how far away things were and 

263
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,670
discovering that there were galaxies and
things like that.

264
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,020
You know,
there's all this science going on,

265
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,650
but then there was this kind of,
this guy comes along coal Samuel 

266
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,680
Robotham who published under the name of
Parallax in 18,

267
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:19,681
60 and he started publishing what is 
basically the same as Eric debase book 

268
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,410
that's been published now pretty much 
every single thing that Eric debase 

269
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,070
current book you will find in Samuel 
Rebirth book from 1860.

270
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,320
And in fact,
if you read the book,

271
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,490
which I don't recommend,
uh,

272
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,510
you will see that about 80 percent of 
the text book is actually quotes from 

273
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,470
these books from the scene.
Hundreds.

274
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,420
It's not actually that this new stuff 
that he's discovered is all stuff like,

275
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,370
you know,
if somebody walks away from you,

276
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,080
you will see their feet disappeared 
first.

277
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,590
And then he has a two page quotes of 
Samuel wrote both them saying the exact 

278
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,680
same thing from the 18 sixties.
So it's basically recycling this,

279
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:03,681
this theory that started in the 1860 
[inaudible] and then just adding a few 

280
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:03,850
little sprinkles to it.
Like,

281
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,870
you know,
saying that as astronauts must be fake 

282
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,880
and the space station is space.
Satellites are fake as well.

283
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,950
Yeah,
he's hilarious.

284
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,860
He thinks that dinosaurs are fake 
nuclear bombs or fake.

285
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,340
I mean there's the idea that one person 
will be this mastermind that discovers 

286
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,710
all these monumental frauds.

287
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,300
Yeah.
And he,

288
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,330
he,
I don't think he's claiming to discover 

289
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,100
these things.
There's lots of people who think that 

290
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,100
newco nukes are fake and you know,
dinosaurs being fake.

291
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,340
It's an obvious thing for creationists 
and people of that ilk.

292
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,450
But uh,
yeah,

293
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,460
he's,
he's basically recycling theories in a 

294
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,781
way that is popular to the reader and 
figuring out how to get them across to 

295
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:45,781
people.
So he,

296
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:50,121
right.
It is the youtube videos that are very 

297
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,340
engaging and they sound good.
They sound,

298
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,740
if you don't know what's,
what they sound like,

299
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,180
they make sense.
That's the problem.

300
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,690
And some of them are quite technical,
but at least they use a lot of technical

301
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,870
terms.
But the,

302
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,980
the,
the delve into things like,

303
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,350
um,
uh,

304
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,130
there's,
there's a variety of experiments.

305
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,160
The Michelson Morley experiment,
the Eddie mentioned is one of them that 

306
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,620
keeps cropping up and then there's the,
which has never been reproduced.

307
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,980
That's the experiment that actually has 
been reproduced because it's the wrong 

308
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,871
way,
not the way that they wanted the 

309
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:24,871
Michelson.
Morley,

310
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:27,740
Missouri,
the Michelson Morley experiment was an 

311
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,840
experiment to detect the luminaire 
forests ether,

312
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,220
which is the supposedly medium through 
which light travels.

313
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Now back in the 18 hundreds,
we didn't know that the light was made 

314
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,640
about a photons [inaudible] light was 
was waived.

315
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:44,641
So we thought that there was this stuff 
that permeated all a space called the 

316
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:45,400
luminesce luminesce,
luminesce,

317
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,560
ether,
luminaire ether.

318
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,640
It's a little hard to pronounce and that
this is what light travels through as 

319
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,520
waves going through and didn't know 
exactly how it works,

320
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:59,330
but the they figured that must be this 
stuff that permeates all space.

321
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,660
And then they figured that since the 
earth was moving and these scientists 

322
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:04,660
actually knew at the time that the earth
was moving,

323
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,530
so they were using this as a basis for 
their experiment.

324
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,510
They thought that if the earth is 
moving,

325
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,840
then they will be able to detect the 
ether by doing these experiments.

326
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:18,841
So what they did,
they set up this experiment where they 

327
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:18,841
shot light one direction and the shorter
the other direction.

328
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:22,730
Then when it came back together,
it combined and if they were moving 

329
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,990
through the ether or if the ether was 
moving through them,

330
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,880
then the light that went one way would 
interfere with the,

331
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,660
with the light and went the other way.
So that was the,

332
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,790
the whole experiment was just just this 
thing.

333
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,450
They shot these two light beams in two 
directions and they figured like,

334
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,920
you know,
if we turned the table this way,

335
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:41,921
it will change because we're now going 
through the ether in different 

336
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,051
direction.
But what happened was nothing was 

337
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:46,541
detected,
which was kind of the start of people 

338
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:46,541
realizing,
oh,

339
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:46,760
there is no luminary.

340
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,470
Ether use that to say that is because 
the earth isn't moving.

341
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,310
That was what the flatter.
But they did.

342
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,370
They did.
The Michelson and Morley knew the earth 

343
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,251
was moving.
They wanted to figure out whether the 

344
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:06,850
ether was moving with the earth or 
whether the earth was moving through the

345
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,560
ether.
So they were trying to detect the ether.

346
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,650
So people who thought that the earth was
the center of the universe,

347
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:17,651
not really so much pellet,
flat earthers people who are Geo 

348
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:21,490
Centrists,
people who thought that the sun went 

349
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,741
around the earth and the whole all the 
stars went around the earth and there's 

350
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:27,061
still people like the recent resurgence 
of some of the thing was Gavin mcinnes 

351
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:33,731
sent me something or some guy thinks 
that the earth is the center of the 

352
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:33,731
universe.
Essentially.

353
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:36,470
He was saying that it sort of confirms 
everything in Genesis.

354
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,670
I was like,
what?

355
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,080
Yeah,
well,

356
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:44,081
I mean if you need to shoehorn a whole 
universe into the descriptions in 

357
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:49,721
genesis,
then he probably gonna have to take a 

358
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:49,721
few.
A few shortcuts.

359
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:50,320
They,
yeah.

360
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:50,780
This,
these,

361
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,900
these experiments like the Michelson 
Morley experiment and.

362
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:57,280
But people bring them up and they say 
that what the detector,

363
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:02,281
it was no motion,
but what it actually detects your 

364
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,440
detective was no luminaire for as ether.
And because they detected no luminary,

365
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,770
luminary burst ether,
they eventually led to theories about 

366
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,700
what light actually is,
which is a wave particle duality.

367
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,280
You know,
the light is photons which act both as a

368
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:20,270
wave and a particle and eventually to 
the theory of relativity.

369
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,390
Well,
you started medibank when,

370
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,960
when did you,
uh,

371
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,280
I think it's about five years ago,
but I've been doing the chem trail stuff

372
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,400
with control science for like over 10 
years now.

373
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,460
I was just looking at one of my old 
posts when a satellite images that's 

374
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,370
quite surprised at how long I've been 
doing it.

375
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,890
Uh,
and uh,

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,890
yeah.
And medibank been going about five years

377
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,040
and the flat earth stuff came up maybe 
two years ago.

378
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:50,040
I started to see things about flutter 
earth and a

379
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,170
little bit over a year ago I wrote a 
post on what,

380
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,800
what should we do about debunking the 
flat earth?

381
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,340
And it basically said like,
all these people are basically either 

382
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,600
trolling all the crazy.
So there's no point in addressing either

383
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:08,601
of them.
And I think most of them are just 

384
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:08,601
trolling because no one could seriously 
believed this.

385
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:09,150
You'd have to be like,
I don't think you're right.

386
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,710
I know I've come to realize that I'm 
not.

387
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,200
I was wrong.
And that,

388
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,260
that post,
now it's gone down the line,

389
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,460
but it's,
it's,

390
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,190
you know,
I've always been one a from that.

391
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,690
It's stunning.
It really is stunning.

392
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,750
It's stunning how many people like this 
is why Jamie made these young Jamie.com.

393
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,680
You can go and get these flatters shell 
shirts that uh,

394
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,540
somehow or another were being paid to 
say that the earth is round.

395
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Like the idea that anybody would 
actually believe that I've had so many 

396
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:38,780
people tweet at me.

397
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,570
I know where your checks to come in 
from,

398
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:40,910
Bro.
You're fucking sell out.

399
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,740
I'm a sell out.
Like why would I give,

400
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,170
do you don't think that if I really 
thought the earth was flat,

401
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
like if someone thought the earth was 
flat,

402
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,880
what a revelation that would be.
What an amazing discovery P,

403
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,670
every scientist will be clamoring to 
expose this.

404
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Every single scientist,
the idea that all these scientists who 

405
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:58,760
make their name off discoveries by the 
way,

406
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,500
especially a monumental and provable 
discovery,

407
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,750
like the world being flat like somehow 
or another,

408
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:08,751
they would hide that.
And then the big question is why would 

409
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:08,751
the government say the world is flat?
I mean,

410
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:13,251
why would they in any way,
why would they rather hide the fact the 

411
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:13,251
world is flat?
Like what?

412
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:17,530
What motivation would anybody have to 
show that the world was round who've 

413
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:17,530
been pretty fascinating.

414
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,010
If we lived on this flat disc and 
everybody else throughout the universe 

415
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,830
was in a on a planet,
we'd be like,

416
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:23,760
Whoa,
what's this?

417
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,210
What's going on?
And there's a weird thing that's going 

418
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,551
on with some of these flat earth people 
where they're linking this to assign 

419
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:34,410
that we are in some way special that we 
are the chosen ones.

420
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,480
And that was,
you know,

421
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:39,480
in some it keeps going back to genesis 
and that you know,

422
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:44,190
that we are the children of God and that
creation is true.

423
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:49,191
And that evolution is a lie.
And it gets to some weird anti juice 

424
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,000
stuff with a lot of these guys.
Yeah.

425
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,710
A lot of conspiracy theories basically 
boiled down to some kind of suspicion of

426
00:19:56,101 --> 00:20:01,101
other people.
And quite often suspicions of Jewish 

427
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:01,101
people.
Why Jewish people was always the Jews.

428
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,520
It's just people couldn't catch a break.

429
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,380
I didn't know exactly why.
I think perhaps perhaps because of the,

430
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,810
the whole,
uh,

431
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:11,811
the Jews killed Jesus Christians don't 
let the Jews or Christians don't like 

432
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:11,811
the Jews.
Yeah.

433
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,650
So the just being viewed as being an 
other and they're often near the Jewish.

434
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Uh,
the broader us population is often like 

435
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,741
a minority within sitters.
So it's an easy person to pick on when 

436
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:29,181
things go wrong about that way.
I'm sure there's loads of books written 

437
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:30,840
by Jews,
other subject of conspiracy theorists.

438
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,460
Do Bay have a recent video about Jews 
and about Hitler.

439
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,940
They all,
they all go down that road.

440
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,800
Um,
what,

441
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,870
what can it be done if anything other 
than your website?

442
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,880
What can be done,
if anything to like

443
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,130
my,
my concern is these young kids that are 

444
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,351
on the fence,
my thoughts are I'm not going to reach 

445
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:59,341
out.
There's some 45 year old crazy person 

446
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,881
who is making youtube videos three times
a day about the world being flat and 

447
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:06,331
ranting and raving and challenging 
everyone to debates that he's never 

448
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,541
gonna engage in that.
Those guys don't mean anything to me 

449
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:13,190
like you can't do anything about them,
but there's some 16 year old kids out 

450
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,450
there that maybe were in highschool and 
maybe don't have a real formal education

451
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,480
in science or astrophysics and they're 
getting confused and they may be smoke a

452
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:22,570
little too much pot as you motherfucker 
whoever's listening to this.

453
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:25,050
That's you and you start.
It's.

454
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,150
I've,
I've been tricked before and I wrote 

455
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,881
this big instagram posts recently about 
Rod's about those roswell rods.

456
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,950
God,
they got me.

457
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,150
I was convinced.

458
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,310
I was convinced,
but it was just.

459
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,370
I never looked into it.
I just watched a documentary and this 

460
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:44,370
guy had the footage.
I was like,

461
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,451
wow,
these things are flying around and we 

462
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:48,451
can't see them.
That's crazy.

463
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:51,800
Yeah,
and then a show called [inaudible] if 

464
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,661
you don't,
if you'd never saw the instagram posts 

465
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:55,000
that I made.
There was a guy that made this video,

466
00:21:55,001 --> 00:22:00,001
a documentary.
I think you made more than one and it 

467
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,680
showed that there was these things that 
looked like tubes that had jelly fish,

468
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:05,140
like wings that were flying through the 
air.

469
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,100
Supposedly it speeds undetectable to the
human eye,

470
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:12,820
like they were moving so fast we 
couldn't see them and so I was convinced

471
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:17,821
man I was really good and then there was
a show called monster quest and what 

472
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:22,171
they did is they set up two cameras,
one camera which was a very fast high 

473
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:26,761
speed camera,
and the other one which is a standard 

474
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,041
video camera and the standard video 
camera caught all these rods flying 

475
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,431
around and then the exact same images 
right next to each other with this high 

476
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:35,110
definition,
high speed camera showed actual bugs.

477
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,380
So what those rods were was just a video
artifact of these bugs that we're moving

478
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:45,691
so close to the screen and so fast that 
the camera couldn't register correctly 

479
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,180
and so it created this elongating effect
and made it look like there were these 

480
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,180
jellies.

481
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,180
Fish.
Yeah.

482
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,500
Well,
I think that type of thing,

483
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,550
that type of video is the type of thing 
that needs to be done to counteract this

484
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:56,010
type of

485
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,540
work though,
because if people aren't looking at the 

486
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540
of eight,
if they see those images,

487
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,390
I put those images up and dude,

488
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,030
if you look at them,
my instagram posts,

489
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,000
it's filled with people angry at me 
because they think it's fake.

490
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,020
They think it's fake.
I don't think I'm a shill because I put 

491
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,611
that up.
If you can't get people to look at 

492
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:16,611
things that that's a challenge in 
itself.

493
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,810
How do you get people to look at things,
but I think like if you start slowly,

494
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,170
I do.
I engage with a lot of like conspiracy 

495
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,430
theorists online and I know when I'm 
doing it I'm not actually going to reach

496
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,430
the vast majority of the people.
I'm talking directly to that.

497
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:32,670
I know there's lots of other people 
reading what I'm saying.

498
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,440
Who,
who will and you know,

499
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:39,441
just because people are complaining 
about your posts of the create images 

500
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:42,810
doesn't mean that there aren't people 
who actually went to look.

501
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,560
Ditto.
Oh,

502
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:46,460
I'm sure.
Because I think it got like 50,000

503
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,460
likes or something like that.
So I'm sure even besides people that 

504
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,460
didn't like it,
many people there were like,

505
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,050
Oh really?
Like is because that was one of the big 

506
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,991
things that they,
the flat earth people kept saying that 

507
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,020
there's no photos of the earth that 
aren't a composite from space.

508
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,580
Like that's just not true.
And they're like this,

509
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,700
this Rod's video that you saw with the 
two cameras.

510
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,760
If that hadn't existed,
you might have taken a bit longer.

511
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,810
Yes to.
I mean,

512
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:13,811
you might still believe it now.
You might be telling your friends about 

513
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:13,811
it.
Have you checked seeing these crazy rods

514
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,650
that are everywhere.
The guy who made that video showed up at

515
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:20,651
a q and a that I did once for the UFC.
I do these q and a's where people yell 

516
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,150
out questions like,
what do you think about this guy?

517
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,390
That guy,
that kind of thing.

518
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,600
And uh,
he waited in line to get to the front of

519
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:30,130
the line to tell me that I was wrong or 
that the rods are reelected,

520
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,250
like,
come on,

521
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,510
you still buying it.
You're still,

522
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,850
he still selling it,
they call it,

523
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,110
they call them roswell rods.
Just hilarious,

524
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,370
but they're implying that somehow or 
another they're alien.

525
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,880
Probably some guy was at Rosewell taking
pictures,

526
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,250
trying to get you fos and some bugs flew
by.

527
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,050
It wasn't even Rosewell.
That's what's funny.

528
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,930
They called Roswell Rod.
The best footage is from Mexico.

529
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,000
The best footage was from a bunch of 
cave jumpers.

530
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,180
You know they have that one really 
enormous cave,

531
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,210
but it's a.
it's a whole essentially a gigantic pit 

532
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:58,210
and people skydive into it.
I've ever seen that.

533
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,780
Yeah,
I've seen things like that.

534
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,730
It's pretty wild.
It's pretty wild.

535
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:06,731
But they filmed,
they set up a camera to watch them jump 

536
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:08,540
off the edge and parachute down and you 
see the rods flying by.

537
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,120
That was like the best footage was from 
Mexico,

538
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,490
from this one place,
so it had nothing to do with Roswell.

539
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:15,770
They just called them roswell rods 
because they're dorks.

540
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,460
They probably had to,
you know,

541
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,470
they were probably looking down the 
darkness of the pit below and then they 

542
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,760
had a shaft of sunlight and friends of 
that.

543
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:25,310
So the books are flying through the 
sunlight with a dark background,

544
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:26,720
which is something you don't normally 
see.

545
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,260
So it would have been like an unusually 
good environment for rods to show up in.

546
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,970
Exactly,
exactly.

547
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,360
And it's in that guy,
me waiting in line to get to the front 

548
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,201
of the line.
They asked me a question and tell me 

549
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:44,201
that,
you know,

550
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:44,201
he has the evidence,
I need to see it.

551
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:47,240
It's that kind of thinking is once 
someone commits to an idea,

552
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,270
it's very difficult to shake them off of
it and they just look for confirmation 

553
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:52,270
bias.

554
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:52,580
They just look for someone else to agree
with them.

555
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,090
They find communities,
they find these flat earth communities,

556
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:58,010
which is hilarious.
The flat one of the best.

557
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,280
One of the best fucking unintentional 
hilarious things I read online.

558
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:04,790
This dude wrote the flat Earth Society 
has members all around the globe.

559
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,310
Yeah.
Whoops.

560
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,070
Did he even realized what he was saying 
or is that just him fucking.

561
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,690
I hope it's trolling.
Yeah,

562
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,060
because the community thing I think is 
like a key thing.

563
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,890
Yes.
I,

564
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,980
I,
I just,

565
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,030
I recently did a deep bond of a Ufo that
the Chilean navy supposedly saw a,

566
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,050
what was that?
I'm not aware of that way.

567
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,380
It was,
it was like this.

568
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,210
I'm just thinking that it was a Chilean 
navy helicopter had this infrared camera

569
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,540
and they sold this,
this black to black dots off in the 

570
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:37,710
distance that looked like a weird thing,
like a,

571
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,410
like a figure eight type thing flying 
away.

572
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:44,411
And then it started like spraying out 
this stuff and they couldn't figure out 

573
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:44,411
what was.
And they chased after

574
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:49,160
it,
but it was too fascinating going away 

575
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,160
from them.
Uh,

576
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,220
and the Chilean government has an 
official UFL investigation team and 

577
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,900
they,
they set them on it and spent two years 

578
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,010
figuring out what it was and they 
couldn't figure out what it was.

579
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,840
And they said it's a,
it's a,

580
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,830
uh,
confirmed unidentified object.

581
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,550
Uh,
and then they published their findings 

582
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,890
and then I,
and some other people and medibank 

583
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:12,890
looked at it and we figured out that it 
was actually just a,

584
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,770
a plane flying away from the helicopter,
leaving some controls behind.

585
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,820
We actually figured out exactly what,
which plane it was a and so this got 

586
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,820
this,
got a bit of play online and there was 

587
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,720
unlike Huffington post and things like 
that and some Ufo enthusiastic,

588
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,830
a study talking to me and I joined the 
groups and I joined a few of the groups 

589
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,230
and then I find myself in this kind of 
weird corner of the Internet where 

590
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,360
everybody believes in Ufo shows,
unquestioningly and they're always 

591
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,320
putting up these photographs of things 
and people are like,

592
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,490
oh,
great capture dude.

593
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,920
And it's just something like a street 
light or something.

594
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
But uh,
they,

595
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,810
they,
they think they had this,

596
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,870
this confirmation bias,
this group confirmation bias where they 

597
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,010
can't disagree with someone and they 
know they're in a safe space.

598
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:05,710
So they can put out whatever theory that
they like and they know that people will

599
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:08,010
be like,
they're just very supportive of them.

600
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,490
By one that happened a couple of days 
ago,

601
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,640
some woman put up a picture of a strange
light that she said was in the sky.

602
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,200
And so I downloaded the picture and I 
boosted the brightness.

603
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,440
And a story was actually a reflection of
a something in a security light on her 

604
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,361
porch and you could see it was like it 
was trees behind it and it's a security 

605
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:32,241
license is reflection.
So I posted that and then I started 

606
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:36,210
getting cold,
like a shill for pointing this out.

607
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,660
A couple of people.
I said,

608
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,670
Oh yeah,
it's just this life.

609
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:39,720
But other people were like,
well,

610
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,200
why don't you believe me?
Why you would like invalidating claims?

611
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:49,610
And so they want to have these kind of 
walled gardens where everybody believes 

612
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:49,610
the same thing.
That's a good way to put it.

613
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Walled Gardens,
it really is a good way to put it 

614
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,180
because that debt is what those 
community seemed like.

615
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,620
And that's one of the things that I 
found when I did that television show.

616
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,910
I.
I still harbored a few conspiracy 

617
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,531
theories before I did that show,
but doing that show for several months 

618
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,760
and constantly interviewing people who 
believed in outlandish things.

619
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:10,390
I found the same thing over and over and
over again.

620
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,510
Illogical people with very little 
evidence,

621
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,030
believing things in almost a religious 
way.

622
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,300
And I found it with bigfoot and I found 
it with us and I found it with chem 

623
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,931
trails and I found it with.
It was just one after the other in 

624
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:28,780
varying stages of ridiculousness.
Feel like contrail chem trails where the

625
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,810
most nutty people,
Ufo people seem to be the most 

626
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,490
reasonable because it's the most 
reasonable theory at of all of them.

627
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,490
The idea that we have spaceships.
Why doesn't someone else have 

628
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,951
spaceships?
There's hundreds of of galaxies in the 

629
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,941
known universe,
hundreds of billions of planets in each 

630
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:50,581
galaxy.
The odds of there being some sort of a 

631
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:50,581
life form out there.
It's pretty high,

632
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,360
but there's nothing.
That's the craziest thing.

633
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,270
Like the more I went into,
the more I talk to these people,

634
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,810
the more I went over all their evidence,
air quotes,

635
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:03,811
evidence,
the more I asked them why they believe 

636
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:03,811
things.
There is nothing.

637
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:05,230
There's not a goddamn thing that you can
put on a scale.

638
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,320
There's nothing that you can way.
There's not a thing that you can 

639
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,320
measure.
There's not a thing that you can look at

640
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,480
a photo and go,
wow,

641
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:11,950
that's compelling.
There's not one,

642
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,450
they just an idea and that idea is that 
there's something in this guy that flies

643
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:19,260
around that we either might catch if 
you're there,

644
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,830
the right place,
the right time or not,

645
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,970
and that they're from another planet.

646
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,400
Yeah.
I could look at what they put forward as

647
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,230
the best evidence is often like snuffing
cases from the six days where there's an

648
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,820
eyewitness who said something like,
there was some guy on a road who says he

649
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,230
blacked out and like,
you know,

650
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,900
his car got messed up from the sixties.

651
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,030
Well,
that's the other thing that I know too 

652
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,070
much about psychedelic drugs and I know 
about indogenous psychedelic drugs.

653
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:44,560
The brain producing this chemical called
dimethyltryptamine.

654
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:49,561
That happens when you're sleeping.
Now they've proven that this stuff is 

655
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:53,980
produced in the liver and the lungs and 
they believe it's now.

656
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,010
They've got evidence that it's produced 
in the pineal gland is a very potent 

657
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,131
psychedelic drugs that your brain 
produces and your brain produces during 

658
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:02,590
rem sleep.
So these people,

659
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:06,490
they all take naps and during these naps
they have these crazy fucking dreams and

660
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:11,491
it's entirely possible that during these
dreams what happened is they got some 

661
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:15,541
indogenous dmt dump,
whether they were under stress or 

662
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,171
whether they just add just a,
an erratic dump of this human 

663
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:22,540
neurochemical that entered into their 
bloodstream.

664
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,630
Whatever it is,
it caused it all these fucking Ufo 

665
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:27,820
abductions,
all of them,

666
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,300
like almost exactly happened at night.
And they happen when these people are 

667
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,300
sleeping.
Like,

668
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,750
wouldn't you just assume that you are 
dreaming?

669
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Like why?
Why wouldn't you assume you were 

670
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:39,840
dreaming?

671
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Yeah,
I,

672
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:39,840
uh,
I have these.

673
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,330
I used to have a night terror 
hallucination things which are kind of 

674
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:43,330
like that.
Yeah.

675
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,630
And it was always the same type of 
thing.

676
00:31:44,631 --> 00:31:49,631
It was like a giant spider coming down 
from the ceiling to ultimately move.

677
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:54,671
I was frozen for a second and then jump 
out of bed and turn on the light and 

678
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
look for the spider.
And it happened all the time.

679
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,150
Like,
and I knew because there was no spider 

680
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,601
that it wasn't real.
But I could see if someone was having a 

681
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:05,000
different type of hallucination that 
seemed a bit more real,

682
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:05,630
and then,
you know,

683
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,240
it may be,
it's a,

684
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,890
it came in between sleep cycles for them
then.

685
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,500
Yeah,
totally.

686
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,170
Yeah.
You can see because it seemed completely

687
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,250
real.
Yeah.

688
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,340
I had,
I used to have them all the time and it 

689
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,340
was always like,
you know,

690
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,070
it was horrible.
It was these like giant really realistic

691
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:24,071
spider.
And it wasn't like I was dreaming 

692
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:27,100
somewhere else.
I was in the room and I could see it 

693
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,900
like I was seeing something crawling 
across the table right here.

694
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:32,901
It was this hallucination.
I don't really get them any more than 

695
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:32,901
what it was,
uh,

696
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:33,590
you know,
my brain is fixed itself or whatever,

697
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:34,820
but it's probably a lot.

698
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,920
Do it being young and confused and 
hormones and nerves.

699
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,980
And then also

700
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,770
like your brain starts filling in the 
blanks.

701
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,860
You don't have a very good understanding
of the universe in your brain.

702
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,210
Your imagination runs wild.
I,

703
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,430
it was very confusing to me doing that 
television show and it really changed me

704
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:57,431
a lot and it changed me to the point 
that people started accusing me of being

705
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,390
a co opted by the government that the 
government threatened my family and told

706
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:07,391
me to stop talking about conspiracies 
like and then the idea that I wouldn't 

707
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:11,861
say that if that was the case,
like you don't think I would fucking 

708
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:14,951
tell everybody if someone threatened my 
family because it was talking about 

709
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,010
Ufos,
I'd be telling everybody I'd be like,

710
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,690
hey man,
I would tell all my friends.

711
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,260
I'd be like,
dude,

712
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,710
they fucking threaten me because I was 
talking about Ufo is this shit is real.

713
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,690
Hangar 18,
Harry 51.

714
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,940
There was a paper a while ago published 
online how many people it would take to 

715
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,350
cover up seven conspiracy theories and 
the probability of none of those people 

716
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,740
ever talking.
Yeah.

717
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,840
And it's just ridiculous.
Like you can't have tens of millions of 

718
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,850
people in on a conspiracy.
Well,

719
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,570
the flat earth one is the best one for 
that.

720
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,490
Yeah,
I mean that's.

721
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,620
What about those clients?
Every single scientist.

722
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,070
Yeah,
and everyone who is involved in shipping

723
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:54,071
routes and overseas flights and the fact
that you can fly west and land east,

724
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,570
I mean,
you,

725
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:56,300
you,
you can,

726
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,240
you can just land in one spot,
take off again,

727
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,580
land in spot,
and you could eventually get to the same

728
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:06,581
spot that you're at with a bunch of 
different flights that you can track 

729
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:06,770
them on,
on a gps.

730
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:08,100
I mean,
it must fight to gps.

731
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,670
Oh,
that's everything is everything.

732
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,690
Yeah.
Well,

733
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,050
one thing I want to,
uh,

734
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,580
try to introduce two people who believe 
in flat earth is this concept that a 

735
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,900
ground truth,
a ground truth as a concept in a 

736
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,870
satellite observations,
which I kind of touched on before.

737
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:27,540
Like you take a satellite observation 
and you say,

738
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,060
does it match what you see on the 
ground?

739
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Or if he goes something like a weather 
prediction model,

740
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,220
predicting the weather you see,
does that match what you see on the 

741
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,510
ground?
And this is something that you can do if

742
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,790
you're actually really interested in 
looking into the flight.

743
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:45,350
A theory is figure out what the actual 
ground truth is.

744
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,380
Full something.
Now I want to talk very briefly about a 

745
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,400
program called delirium,
which you might've might've seen.

746
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:54,350
It's just basically a solar system 
simulates,

747
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,910
it,
shows what's in the night sky.

748
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,010
You've probably seen these little,
these little,

749
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:03,011
uh,
things on your phone where you hold it 

750
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:03,011
up and it shows you what the stars are.

751
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:03,011
Yeah,
just went like that for the PC.

752
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,580
And you can use,
use the one on,

753
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,290
uh,
on your phone as well.

754
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,770
So what I would encourage people to do 
is figure out what is this program 

755
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,840
actually correct?
Is it actually showing me what we see in

756
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:17,440
the night sky?
And you can do it really easily.

757
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,630
Basically you just look at what's on the
screen and then you go outside and you 

758
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,951
look to see,
is this what I'm seeing on the screen 

759
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:26,951
here?
Uh,

760
00:35:26,951 --> 00:35:29,600
so this is basically you checking the 
ground truth of this program,

761
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,700
which seems like a very straightforward 
thing,

762
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:36,701
but then what you can do from that is 
you can then use the program to look at 

763
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,110
the sky from other positions.
And

764
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,120
because you verify that it's correct for
where you are and you can ask someone 

765
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,431
else to verify it's correct for where 
they are and you can check like other 

766
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:47,280
photographs that have been taken to see 
if they match up as well.

767
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,640
You'll eventually build up,
you know the knowledge that this program

768
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,830
is correct.
This still arion program,

769
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,980
all the little program you have in your 
phone that shows you the stars in the 

770
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,711
sky.
So you've got this computer showing you 

771
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:00,960
what it expects to see from any 
position,

772
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,990
any position anywhere on the world and 
you by doing ground truth observations 

773
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,700
have figured out.
I figured out what it actually is.

774
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:09,510
Yeah.
So that's.

775
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,200
That's the type of thing you see in 
delirium.

776
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,480
A obviously in a much less light 
polluted environment than you have here.

777
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,680
Do you think that a lot of what's going 
on with these people that are theorizing

778
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,770
and keep that up?
That's pretty cool.

779
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:26,771
Look at with a lot of what's going on 
with these people theorizing about flat 

780
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:31,331
earth and there seems to be some desire 
that people have to expose hidden 

781
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:35,621
truths,
hidden hidden discoveries or or things 

782
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:39,371
that are somehow or another being kept 
from everybody and the the.

783
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,740
What's,
what's fascinating to me is they're 

784
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,560
looking into this nonsense.
They're looking into this thing that's 

785
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,750
not real.
When the real space like the actual,

786
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:55,751
like what is observable about space is 
so mind blowing.

787
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Yeah.
And somehow or another that is what you 

788
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,681
absolutely can see every day where you 
absolutely can observe what you 

789
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,851
absolutely can read about and learn 
about and what scientists are 

790
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:12,611
discovering on a daily basis is so mind 
blowing when you see like they don't 

791
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:17,801
believe satellites are real.
When you see how many satellites we 

792
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:18,350
actually have,
that's what's really fucked.

793
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,160
It's not that there's no satellite.
Yeah.

794
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,700
Satellites bashing into each other and 
then uh,

795
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,850
we'll have been more centralized there.

796
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,160
Thousands of them up there and they have
to time,

797
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,780
space flights.
They have to time space lights based on 

798
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,521
whether or not they're going to hit 
these satellites or space junk or some 

799
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,750
of the stuff that's been ejected from 
various rocket trips.

800
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,370
I mean,
it's still floating

801
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,380
up there.
You seen the movie gravity?

802
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,060
Yes.
Yeah.

803
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,090
This bit in that where the satellite 
start bumping into each other and it's 

804
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,660
this big chain reaction eventually.
All the satellites.

805
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:49,870
Good.
So I didn't get knocked out.

806
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,720
Did you see that Japanese express 
expedition that they tried to.

807
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:57,721
Do they try to capture?
I don't know how well it worked that 

808
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:58,600
well.
I had a really big tether.

809
00:37:58,601 --> 00:37:59,890
They were dragging behind it.
Yeah.

810
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,770
They were trying to like catch a bunch 
of space junk with a net,

811
00:38:02,771 --> 00:38:03,460
right?
Yeah.

812
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,410
Somehow or another.
Yeah.

813
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:05,040
It's amazing.
Yeah.

814
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,910
This stuff is way more interesting than.
Yes.

815
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,970
Yeah.
That's the real stuff that's really 

816
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,770
crazy with idea is so it's less.
These tiny little thing with the earth 

817
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,760
is flat and it was stuck in this weird 
prison where people are keeping us here.

818
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

819
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:19,120
That's the thing too,
that somehow or another,

820
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:23,580
by being on a flat planet,
it gives you a different perspective and

821
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:25,120
they don't want you to have that 
perspective,

822
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:28,180
so they tell you the world is round like
it doesn't make any sense.

823
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:33,390
Yeah.
One thing I've heard is that they think 

824
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:33,390
that if they can convince you that the 
world is flat when it isn't,

825
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,040
then it's kind of like in 19 four where 
they get people to believe that two plus

826
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:43,081
two equals five and they've actually 
indoctrinate people to genuinely believe

827
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:47,290
that even though they know it's not 
true,

828
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,020
but they still believe it and it's a way
of mind control,

829
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,840
said the same thing would have happened 
with the flat earth,

830
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:57,841
but on a far grander scale,
you're not just convincing someone that 

831
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:57,870
two plus two equals five and war equals 
peace,

832
00:38:57,871 --> 00:38:58,750
et Cetera,
et cetera.

833
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,140
You're convincing them that the earth is
flat when it's actually around.

834
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:05,980
So by doing,
by twisting their minds around something

835
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:09,610
that's demonstrably false and making 
another thing that is correct,

836
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,970
then you're gaining power over their 
minds in the same way that they did in 

837
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,850
1984.
Right?

838
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,120
Well,
in the same way the scientologists do or

839
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:23,121
Mormons do or anybody that creates some 
sort of an ideology that's provably 

840
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:23,340
false.
I mean,

841
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,400
look,
there's not a whole lot of difference 

842
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,440
between scientology and flatter theory.
I mean,

843
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,470
there really isn't.
I mean if you really read l Dot Ron 

844
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,620
Hubbard's work,
if you read what his actual theories 

845
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
were about the origins of mankind,
it's pretty fucking loony.

846
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,890
And yet there's thousands and thousands 
of members of scientology to the point 

847
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,221
where they're making documentaries about
it and writing books about it and these 

848
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:50,001
people are coming out and they've 
escaped the church and these harling 

849
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:50,001
stories.
Man,

850
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:50,850
I had this guy on my podcast a couple of
weeks ago.

851
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Ronnie miscavige is David miscavige's.
Dads want in the sky has been wasted his

852
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:02,031
life can.
I lived in the scientology world for 50 

853
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:02,031
years.
I mean it's,

854
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:02,460
it's crazy.
It's crazy.

855
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,820
It is.

856
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,830
It is.
Not much difference between that and 

857
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:07,830
flat earth theory.
It really isn't.

858
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,000
You know,
scientology works like it's like 

859
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,270
gradually sucks you in a bit at a time,
you know,

860
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:12,600
it just sounds all very reasonable at 
the.

861
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,780
It's very self help in the beginning.
More and more like the further you get 

862
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,170
into it,
but also the reverse,

863
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,200
the first original principles of it.
Like when you start thinking positive 

864
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,941
and doing positive things,
there's a lot of benefits to that and 

865
00:40:28,941 --> 00:40:31,161
people start seeing those benefits.
They start feeling positive and then 

866
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:34,510
they get into the tetons and the frozen 
souls chucked into the volcano and 

867
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:34,620
they're like,
what?

868
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,870
Well,
I think you could

869
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,440
argue that the sim good in the flood 
earth,

870
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,450
not the flat earth theory as such,
but the black death way of thinking like

871
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:49,451
questioning things.
And I think this is something that 

872
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:50,030
people really like about it,
is that you don't,

873
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,120
you don't,
you don't believe scientists just 

874
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,520
because scientists say something is this
thing they called the static method,

875
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,570
which basically is a Greek word meaning 
questioning.

876
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,840
So you've got to question everything.
You can't believe that gravity exists or

877
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,500
pandemic around the scientist because 
scientist do it.

878
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:14,501
You actually have to observe it for 
yourself and if you can't absorb it for 

879
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:16,460
yourself then it isn't real,
which leads people to think the earth is

880
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:21,461
flat because it kind of appears flat 
from various positions and they haven't 

881
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:26,201
been into space or they haven't done the
various experiments that show that is 

882
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,231
not flat.
So I think you've got young people who 

883
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,770
are exposed to the idea of as a techy 
ism and they think,

884
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,340
oh,
that's great.

885
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:34,730
You know,
I've,

886
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,750
I'm rebelling against authority like 
young people do and they think like,

887
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,330
I will not believe.
I will not believe the scientists.

888
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:47,331
I'll do my own research,
but then they get sucked into people 

889
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:51,790
like Dubay who feed them all this 
nonsense is very articulate and very 

890
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,051
smooth the way he talks and he makes his
well edited videos and they're very 

891
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:56,960
compelling.
And because he's not an authority,

892
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,160
he's not like,
you know,

893
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,150
part of the government.
He's perhaps the,

894
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,800
the,
the,

895
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,920
the old culture.
They tend to give his arguments way more

896
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:09,230
weight than mainstream science.
Yeah.

897
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,120
Yeah.
And then they'll find out something like

898
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,150
that New York Times article that was out
a couple months back where it showed 

899
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,511
that scientists from the 19 fifties were
paid off by sugar companies to switch 

900
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:25,011
the blame to saturated fat and they 
started attributing all these health 

901
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:29,721
problems that were really about sugar 
and about eating processed sugar start 

902
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:34,040
attributed to the saturated fat and it 
changed a lot of people's diets and 

903
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,050
really fucked a lot of people up in 
terms of like,

904
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:39,330
like people started eating margarine and
all these things that are filled the 

905
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,181
trans fats and very unhealthy for you.
And they did it because they thought 

906
00:42:42,181 --> 00:42:45,591
that they were following science.
And so questioning science and 

907
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:47,190
questioning scientists,
you know,

908
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:52,191
occasionally you're right,
occasionally you'll find something like 

909
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:52,191
this.
Yeah.

910
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:53,850
This conspiracy by the sugar industry,
you know,

911
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:55,320
there's the old saying,
trust yet,

912
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:56,550
verify.
Yes.

913
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,600
Reagan popularized that with a salt 
talks.

914
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,470
I think yes,
that's a very good statement.

915
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:06,471
Trust yet verify.
And that's if you want to trust our 

916
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,080
Dubay that's fine.
But like check,

917
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,200
check the things that he says.
I checked one of his things on the way 

918
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,360
here on the plane.
Uh,

919
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:17,390
he has a thing that a lot of them say,
which is the horizon always rises to a 

920
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,900
higher level.
So on the plane,

921
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:23,901
on the way here,
I checked to see if there was actually 

922
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:23,901
correct.
Now,

923
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:24,390
most people when they checked to see if 
their horizon rises to a level,

924
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:26,220
they just look out the window and they 
say,

925
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,900
Oh yeah,
there's the horizon over there.

926
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:28,650
I said high level,

927
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,320
but uh,
on the horizon is actually going down a 

928
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,830
little bit when you look out the window 
of the plane because you're 30,000

929
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:40,831
feet up in the air.
It actually drops around two or three 

930
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,721
degrees,
but it's very hard to see when he was 

931
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:42,721
looking at it out of the window of the 
plane.

932
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:47,100
So it's very easy to get taken into 
believing that is that it stays at eye 

933
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,260
level.
So what I did is I took this a little 

934
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,611
carpenters level.
He brought a carpenter stuck up into 

935
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:54,120
very small one.
It's like this like a inch,

936
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,220
as long as the,
uh,

937
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,390
and I've taped some old tube to the top 
which is like a bit of pen and then I 

938
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,280
set it level and wedged it so it was 
level and then I looked through the tube

939
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,060
on the top of this level and so wide 
horizon was and the horizon was just 

940
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,070
below the end of a level.
So the horizon,

941
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:17,071
it actually dropped away,
which meant the debates claim about the 

942
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,091
horizon rising to a level which is 
something you'd expect on a flight to 

943
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,030
earth was actually incorrect and it's 
demonstrably incorrect with this $2 

944
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,380
level which actually got free from 
somewhere and anyone can do this.

945
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,100
You don't even need to be in a plane if 
it works better.

946
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,130
If you just like on a cliff or something

947
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
like a thousand feet up.
Well that's another claim that people 

948
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,431
keep saying that or divo tease this flat
earth idea that that if you get on a 

949
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:42,780
plane and you look up and you look out 
the window,

950
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,840
it looks flat.
But I do not think that people 

951
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,751
understand perspective and they do not 
understand how huge the earth is when 

952
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:55,290
you see there's images,
someone did an image that showed how far

953
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,950
you are up when you're 30,000
feet in the air and then how,

954
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,280
how like huge the earth actually is,
and you get this like little image of a 

955
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:09,711
plane at 30,000
feet and then the dot of the plane is 

956
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,820
represented in the,
the amount of distance between the earth

957
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,240
is in perspective.
And then you see how enormous the planet

958
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:20,241
is and it's just,
you're dealing with something that's so 

959
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:20,340
big.
It's almost,

960
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,830
I mean,
it feels like it's flat.

961
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,250
It feels like it's flat because it's 
enormous in your tiny.

962
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,670
Yeah,
that's,

963
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,700
that's a huge issue with people is that 
they don't really understand the scale 

964
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,350
of the planet and they don't understand 
how little it actually curves.

965
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:36,470
Uh,
those.

966
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:36,940
There's,
uh,

967
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,220
road.
Uh,

968
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,170
if you look,
if you look up like the longest roads in

969
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,940
America,
longest straight road in America,

970
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,300
there's,
this road is in like Oklahoma or 

971
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,120
somewhere and it's about 80 miles long 
and it's just perfectly straight.

972
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,150
But it actually isn't perfectly straight
because when they laid it out,

973
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:54,280
they laid it out along a line of 
latitude,

974
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,730
so it's one of the lines that goes 
around around the earth.

975
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,510
So it's actually slightly curved.
When you look at it,

976
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:06,511
it looks perfectly straight.
You have to actually like take their 

977
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:08,920
whole image and then draw a line from 
one end to the other in google earth and

978
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:11,560
you see that it deviates by just these 
tiny little amount.

979
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,630
But if you were to drive along this 
road,

980
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,840
you're actually driving around.
You're actually turning right slightly 

981
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,221
the whole time.
But it looks perfectly straight because 

982
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:23,221
it's hardly moving.
It's old over these 80 miles.

983
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:24,850
It moves maybe like 10 feet or 
something.

984
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,520
And you know,
people just don't,

985
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,670
don't,
don't realize just how small the curve 

986
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,180
of the earth actually is.
It looks flat

987
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,450
and again,
and again,

988
00:46:35,451 --> 00:46:39,170
I think a real big problem with this 
theory and with a lot of these theories,

989
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:44,171
a lot of these really outlandish 
conspiracy theories is once they hook 

990
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:45,710
you,
it's very difficult to unhook yourself.

991
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,220
You,
you don't want to believe that you got 

992
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,220
taken.
You don't want to believe he'd been had.

993
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,560
You don't want to believe you've been 
fooled,

994
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,590
so you keep going deeper and deeper down
the rabbit hole and you keep finding 

995
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,930
more and more confirmation bias.
More people inside that walled garden as

996
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:00,380
you put it.

997
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:06,410
Yeah,
and some people actually go out and do 

998
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:06,540
scientific experiments and they try 
reasonably hard.

999
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,900
Some of them,
but then they make some kind of mistake 

1000
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,320
and then they say,
this is actual proof that the earth is 

1001
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:14,320
flat.
Like those.

1002
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,930
The level experiment that I did,
someone did something similar with that 

1003
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,070
is that they use like a water level 
where you have two tubes connected and 

1004
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:22,070
you use the,
the,

1005
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:26,080
the level of the water because the water
level's the same on both of them and 

1006
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,540
then they hold this up and see if it was
below the horizon.

1007
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,310
But they did this experiment and they 
did it at sea level,

1008
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,070
which meant is always going to be 
exactly the same as the horizon.

1009
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,500
You've actually got to go up a thousand 
feet before you can see anything,

1010
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:36,940
but they still,
you know,

1011
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,730
even even though they,
they,

1012
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,740
they thought that they were doing some 
science,

1013
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,040
but they make this one key mistake and 
then they weren't listened to anybody 

1014
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,140
trying to tell them what the mistake 
actually was.

1015
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,710
A people this a ridiculous amount of 
people doing flat earth experiments on 

1016
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:56,770
youtube and just getting it completely 
wrong.

1017
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,940
I think the most common one is people 
taking photographs or something that 

1018
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,180
they shouldn't be visible from a certain
position.

1019
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:09,990
Like they'll say like,
here's a catalina island and it's like 

1020
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,090
60 miles away and according to the 
curvature of the earth,

1021
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,730
that means it should been below five 
miles of curve.

1022
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,010
Uh,
and so it shouldn't be visible.

1023
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,500
And then there's all these mistakes that
they make.

1024
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:21,210
Some of them are like,
they,

1025
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,480
they do the math wrong.
Some of them,

1026
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,790
like they don't account for the fact 
that you've got a,

1027
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,060
you know,
a,

1028
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,340
a factor in how high the viewer is.
Or some of them will just,

1029
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,700
they'll get entirely the wrong island.
Like they'll say like,

1030
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:34,390
oh,
this is this island,

1031
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:36,100
which is just layer 100 miles away in 
the right.

1032
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,840
You're looking at something that's 40 
miles away.

1033
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,010
Well,
how can we can look out in the.

1034
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,480
I mean,
here's a simple one.

1035
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,450
How can we look out across the ocean?
You don't see anything on the side.

1036
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,040
Yeah.
Like what's over there?

1037
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,050
Well,
so far away that you can't see it.

1038
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,540
They got an out there.
They're got out though because the,

1039
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,640
uh,
you wouldn't get to see anything away 

1040
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:54,640
because of the atmosphere.
So thank you.

1041
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:54,640
I'm going to say three things.
Get further away.

1042
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,100
They get fainter and fainter islands 
that they believe in the atmosphere.

1043
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,520
They do and they use it a lot to make up
reasons for certain things like,

1044
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,800
like things going on below the horizon 
and that's where it gets weird,

1045
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:09,160
right?
It's that people use some science to try

1046
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:11,500
to debunk science or things that they 
claim a science,

1047
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:14,920
like the lore of perspective perspective
isn't,

1048
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:15,700
doesn't exist.

1049
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,010
There's no law of perspective.
I mean,

1050
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:21,610
if you were to make a lower perspective,
you could say that the size of something

1051
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,610
decreases inversely proportional to its 
distance,

1052
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,190
so if it gets twice as far away,
it's half the size.

1053
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:31,090
If it gets four times as far away,
it's a quarter of the size and that's it

1054
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,090
and that's,
that's all that perspective is.

1055
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,310
Now.
People talk about vanishing points.

1056
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,460
Well,
that came up during the podcast with 

1057
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:41,460
Eddie Bravo.
Yeah,

1058
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,120
and Jamie brought it up and then Eddie 
started posting pictures on his 

1059
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,120
instagram of a guy from the early 19 
hundreds who is an artist who wrote 

1060
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:50,620
something about the law perspective in 
drawing,

1061
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,870
just drawing.
He was just explaining how you,

1062
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,290
how you define perspective when you're 
illustrating things.

1063
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,380
That's,
that's the lower perspective on a piece 

1064
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,380
of paper,
on a photograph.

1065
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,290
It's nothing at all to do with the real 
world.

1066
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,170
It's about what you can,
what you can see visually,

1067
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,230
what the image is projected onto your 
eyes or what comes through a camera when

1068
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:09,520
you take a picture,
you know,

1069
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:11,830
what's the actual perspective of things.
You know,

1070
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:14,260
things just get smaller,
but it says it sounds good.

1071
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,740
When you say the law perspective,
it sounds good,

1072
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,741
like you're invoking a law scientific,
but then they will discuss a real law 

1073
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:25,400
like the law of universal gravitation.
Yeah.

1074
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,370
I just,
again,

1075
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,100
I don't have

1076
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,560
anything against Eric do pay or any of 
these people.

1077
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,860
I really don't.
My real concern is with young people out

1078
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:38,861
there that are listening to this that 
get sucked into this stupid shit and 

1079
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:41,510
there's a soul much that you could 
learn.

1080
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,590
There's so much that's fascinating about
the university,

1081
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,610
so it's fascinating about the natural 
world.

1082
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,400
There's so much to learn and to waste 
anytime.

1083
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:54,550
The only thing that's good about it is 
you'll recognize the pitfalls that the 

1084
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,571
human mind can slip into that I've 
slipped into that many people I know 

1085
00:50:58,571 --> 00:50:58,790
have slipped into.
And again,

1086
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,040
it's not a,
it's not a like in any way,

1087
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:06,041
shape or form.
It's not something to be embarrassed 

1088
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:06,041
about or sad about.
It's just,

1089
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:10,300
it's a normal natural human inclination 
to try to find things that are hidden 

1090
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,360
truths or you know,
that are covered up mysteries.

1091
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,580
It's natural for whatever reason,

1092
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,770
I think it's very much a part of growing
up and I think it's just a,

1093
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,780
it's different for different people.
I had a whole bunch of crazy ideas when 

1094
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:24,790
I was growing up.
What'd you have a.

1095
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:29,791
I thought I could bring about world 
peace by getting a whole bunch of world 

1096
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,311
leaders together and uh,
I actually sent letters to a bunch of 

1097
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:36,661
world leaders and I figured like I 
shouldn't send it directly to the world 

1098
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:37,660
leaders because there'd be a,
it'll be a bit.

1099
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,840
Yeah,
they will want to read my letters.

1100
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:41,790
So I sent it to the brothers.
So I sent a letter to,

1101
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,670
to Raul Castro who is now a the 
president of Cuba,

1102
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,550
but back then I thought,
well I can,

1103
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:53,580
I can set up this organization of the 
relatives of world leaders and bringing 

1104
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,600
about will piece now.
It's that like I was like 13 at the time

1105
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,030
that you decided to get ahold of their 
brothers.

1106
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,680
That's kind of hilarious.
Yeah,

1107
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,370
well I think it like a sneaky backdoor.
Yeah.

1108
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,970
And I found his address in a WHO's who 
in the library back in the day,

1109
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,910
back in the day when you look things up 
in the library.

1110
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:11,980
Yeah.
I mean,

1111
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,920
that's not even that unreasonable.
That's like you thinking,

1112
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:17,170
well,
world piece seems to make sense to me.

1113
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,190
This idealistic child,
uh,

1114
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:24,210
and you know,
you want to try to do something and you 

1115
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,951
think you can,
you think you can make a difference and 

1116
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:28,550
you can add rebelling against things.
I had delusions of solving great 

1117
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,410
mathematical problems when I was young.
Those like,

1118
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,760
you know,
problems like how do you try sex and 

1119
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,371
angle with a by this geometrical methods
which was proved to be impossible to do.

1120
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,320
And yet I still spent months and months 
trying to do it when I was a kid because

1121
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,440
I thought that can't tell me what's 
possible and what's not possible.

1122
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:50,320
It seems like it's possible to me.
And if you did discover it,

1123
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,960
what a gigantic it would have been 
feather in your cap.

1124
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,550
That would have been.
That was the motivation really.

1125
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,650
It wasn't just like pure altruism.
I wanted to,

1126
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:02,810
I believe in a bunch of stupid shit and 
the big one for me that I've clung to 

1127
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,240
longest has bigfoot.
That one man.

1128
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,300
Oh,
it's so hard for me to let that one go 

1129
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,540
because.
Well,

1130
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:14,460
first of all,
because it used to be an animal,

1131
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,130
needs to be gigantic pithy guess,
but man,

1132
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:20,190
when my friend Les Stroud actually 
started doing that show,

1133
00:53:20,191 --> 00:53:22,350
that bigfoot show,
have you ever seen that show?

1134
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,470
And I don't think so.
I did that show with some fucking

1135
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
guy who's just a total hoax or and the 
guy put on a big foot mask and they got 

1136
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,620
this high resolution photo and video of 
this big foot mask that they're claiming

1137
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:36,510
is big foot to staring at them through 
the woods.

1138
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:40,560
It is so stupid looking CV and finally 
Jamie and this guy,

1139
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,670
this is our wacky.
This guy is the bigfoot community.

1140
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,730
Thinks he's full of shit.
That's when you know you fucked up when 

1141
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:50,130
the big foot community is calling 
shenanigans,

1142
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,480
they're like,
this guy.

1143
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,510
I'm not buying this as spending.
You get these schisms in this community,

1144
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,560
so they fracture off into sub 
communities.

1145
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,190
The scientologists,
there are people who have purchased from

1146
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,330
the scientologists watch this.
This is awesome.

1147
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,870
See is guys in the woods and he sees it.
He sees it's through the trees.

1148
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:07,710
What is it?
Where is it?

1149
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:08,730
And he can't.

1150
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,150
It's not even moving.
Meanwhile,

1151
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,420
bigfoot's just been running from people 
from day one.

1152
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:17,421
Right?
But there's one animal is just standing 

1153
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:17,421
there and he's like,
God,

1154
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:17,421
I think I see it.
I think I said.

1155
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,800
So then towards the end of the video,
he gets really close,

1156
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:24,801
like looking at it.
The fuck out of here is Galligan Afro 

1157
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:24,801
from the Nineteen Seventies.
Like,

1158
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,510
look how clean it's hair looks.
I mean,

1159
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:29,460
it looks so dumb.
It's not moving.

1160
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,470
No,
he gets close up on it.

1161
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,050
Look at that.
Isn't that wink or something?

1162
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,100
Oh yeah.
Here it is.

1163
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,880
Look,
look how bad this is bad.

1164
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,590
This is.
Here's the this.

1165
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,780
Here's how you know it's fake.
Whenever something looks like a dude in 

1166
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,300
a monkey suit,
it's a dude in a monkey suit.

1167
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,390
That's all you need to know because your
brain knows.

1168
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:49,560
Your brain's like,
Hey,

1169
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:51,390
wait a minute.
Like if you look at a gorilla,

1170
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,940
gorilla doesn't look like a person in a 
gorilla suit.

1171
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:59,180
Feel good a giraffe.
It does not look like a person in draft 

1172
00:54:59,180 --> 00:54:59,180
suit.
Feel like a big foot and it looks like a

1173
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,740
dude in a monkey suit.
It's a fucking dude.

1174
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:05,741
The monkey suit,
like your brain starts filling in the 

1175
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:06,270
blanks and also whether you recognize it
or not,

1176
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,180
your brain recognize,
recognize geometry.

1177
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,750
Facial geometry recognizes a FIBONACCI 
sequence.

1178
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,660
Hogwash.
Yeah.

1179
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:14,760
And you see,
that's why people freak out when you see

1180
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:18,320
someone fake lips or fake nose upside 
down and things like that when,

1181
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,510
when people do weird shit to their face,
like when someone,

1182
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:26,530
um,
get the plastic surgery in the face and 

1183
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,330
they like radically altered their face,
it's jarring to us.

1184
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:31,200
And one of the reasons why it's jarring 
is because the brain recognizes geometry

1185
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:35,700
and human facial recognition or facial 
patterns and the structure of the face.

1186
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:38,640
And when that geometry is off,
it's confusing to us.

1187
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,560
Like why are their cheeks so big?
Why is that?

1188
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,390
No so small?
Why are the lips so big?

1189
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:47,391
Like what the fuck is going on?
It's like your body starts to react to 

1190
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:47,391
it.
Yeah,

1191
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:51,831
there's an illusion with a put two sets 
of eyes on people and you look at that 

1192
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:55,311
and you just.
Your brain just is constantly resetting 

1193
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:55,311
and you go my eyes across the way or 
another.

1194
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,560
You frightened just so hard wired to 
recognize faces.

1195
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:03,590
Yes.
That it just automatically recognize 

1196
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:04,440
faces in your face and my face are 
different,

1197
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:08,880
but there's a science to you or the 
structure of your face that's applied to

1198
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:09,720
the science.
My face,

1199
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,240
and that's the golden ratio.
I mean if you,

1200
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,660
if you look at a person's face,
you can actually do the math where their

1201
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:16,920
chin is,
where their eyes are.

1202
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,180
It all lines up and your brain 
recognizes when that's not the case.

1203
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:23,650
So if you see that and you see like,
oh a person,

1204
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:24,070
what the fuck's

1205
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:29,070
going on?
Because it is a person that's a person 

1206
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,771
that's a dude in a monkey suit.
It's not even a good one and there's so 

1207
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:31,870
many people that tried out that 
Patterson footage,

1208
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,780
which is so bad.
Yeah,

1209
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,330
they,
they,

1210
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:37,390
they believe so hard.
They believe so hard.

1211
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:42,970
It's the hardest one for me to realize 
that those people were all full of shit 

1212
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:42,970
because when I was a kid,
man,

1213
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,320
God,
I don't want a big foot to be real.

1214
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,210
That was a,
that was a tough one.

1215
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,420
Tough one to let go and plus it was a 
real animal at one point in time there 

1216
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,450
was really a thing called [inaudible],
which was an eight to 10 foot tall,

1217
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,130
if it may have been by people at least 
occasionally.

1218
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,380
Yeah,
yeah,

1219
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,390
yeah.
It's A.

1220
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,580
Yeah,
you want things to be true like Ufos.

1221
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,970
I was going to a Ufo is and all kinds of
weird stuff on it when I was younger and

1222
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:14,971
I think partly like me figuring out the.
A lot of it was just bullshit was part 

1223
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:17,670
of the buddy for getting into like 
debunking stuff later,

1224
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,240
but at a certain degree I think there's 
no harm in people believing in things 

1225
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,660
like you know,
little kids believe in Santa Claus,

1226
00:57:24,661 --> 00:57:26,880
etc.
That type of things rather christmas,

1227
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:31,930
easter bunny,
and it's just that for some people it 

1228
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,641
kind of goes a bit wrong because a bit 
too far they don't let the child is 

1229
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:38,151
beliefs drop away as they get older or 
they stay longer or when they come of 

1230
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:43,920
age they go into that kind of the next 
level of disbelief,

1231
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:49,380
of imaginary things that they wanted to 
be true and a lot of that boils down to 

1232
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:51,690
what we're talking about earlier,
the distrust in authority,

1233
00:57:51,691 --> 00:57:52,760
like people,
you know,

1234
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:57,770
distrust of others,
and the belief that there's some secret 

1235
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,760
cabal of people doing things to them.
The illuminati.

1236
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,810
Yeah.
So I think it's partly this kind of a 

1237
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,941
natural,
childish wanting to believe in things 

1238
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:10,880
which we all have.
We all believed strange things when we 

1239
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,680
were young and I think that aliens in a 
lot of ways,

1240
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:16,681
they're like a cosmic daddy.
The idea that there's someone who's 

1241
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:20,600
really on the ball that's watching us 
and you can make sure we don't fuck 

1242
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,901
everything up.
That's where this content movies are so 

1243
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:23,901
popular.
Just the idea of like,

1244
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:27,620
oh,
aliens coming to help us or whatever is 

1245
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:27,620
so,
so enticing.

1246
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:27,660
It'd be so amazing.

1247
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,450
Yeah.
Meanwhile,

1248
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:31,210
I think the movie alien is probably more
likely.

1249
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,600
What's gonna happen?
Just come down here and fuCk us up.

1250
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:39,730
I'm the weird thing about the ufo 
community and the big foot community and

1251
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:44,731
all these different communities is that 
along the line they become people that 

1252
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:45,580
make a living at it and they become,
you know,

1253
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:50,581
air quotes experts and that that becomes
a problem because then they have a 

1254
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:55,651
vested interest in making sure that 
other people believe they start writing 

1255
00:58:55,651 --> 00:58:55,651
books,
thEy start doing lectures,

1256
00:58:55,651 --> 00:59:00,391
they start showing pictures.
And also here's what's interesting as 

1257
00:59:00,391 --> 00:59:04,330
the number of phones that have cameras 
have radically increased.

1258
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,470
The number of usable ufo pictures is 
radically decreased.

1259
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,090
Yeah.
Which doesn't make sense.

1260
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,890
Was like this one got 83 times.
Zoom on it.

1261
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,370
You can take pictures of if there was a 
ufo,

1262
00:59:16,371 --> 00:59:19,880
you can take a real close up picture of 
I take patients on planes all the time,

1263
00:59:19,881 --> 00:59:23,190
the flying five away or 10 miles away or
sometimes even like,

1264
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:28,191
you know,
every 100 miles away and you can make 

1265
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:28,191
out the plane.
You see the windows a.

1266
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,240
Yeah,
depending on the angle.

1267
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,640
That's the claim that they can trail is 
put out sometimes at the planes don't 

1268
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,111
have windows,
which is generally that a generally 

1269
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,411
because they using these crappy little 
cameras and you just can't see the 

1270
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:41,411
windows got the less than one pixel 
wide.

1271
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,920
Right.
If you've got a good camera and use zoom

1272
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,940
in far enough,
the windows appear kind of like,

1273
00:59:44,941 --> 00:59:49,941
you know,
things appearing over the horizon when 

1274
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:49,941
you zoom in the.
Speaking of this camera,

1275
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:52,850
this suddenly coming up in august,
which is the eclipse,

1276
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:58,350
uh,
there's gonna be a total eclipse of the 

1277
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:58,670
sun over north America,
I think August 21st this year.

1278
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:04,250
And I think that's,
that would be a great opportunity for 

1279
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,790
people to encourage anybody who believes
in the earth to actually start looking 

1280
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,280
at,
you know,

1281
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:13,330
the what's going on.
Don't they have any excuse for that 

1282
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:13,330
though?
He hadn't like how are they,

1283
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,580
how are they going to justify it by 
eight?

1284
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:19,590
They actually look at it.
I think the challenge is getting people 

1285
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,080
to look at things.
The excuse the excuse.

1286
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:26,081
The reason we're giving them is that 
there's an eclipse and everybody wants 

1287
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:26,081
to look at the eclipse because it's an 
amazing thing.

1288
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,290
The moon goes in front of the sun and 
blocks the there.

1289
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:32,410
Yeah,
but I think that you're giving them too 

1290
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,731
much credit.
I think all someone has to do is make a 

1291
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,400
youtube video with some wonky 
explanation for why an eclipse works and

1292
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,820
then it works because the earth is a 
disk and the sun gets below the disc and

1293
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:39,110
it blocks it out from below.

1294
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,250
I mean,
it just doesn't seem to me that it's.

1295
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:43,580
It's enough.
This is a like a solar eclipse though.

1296
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:48,581
They finished.
They can tell that the moon is going in 

1297
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:49,970
front of the sun because I know what 
you're saying is logical,

1298
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,740
but you know,
even the flight others believed that the

1299
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:53,990
moon goes in front of the sun for a 
solar eclipse.

1300
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,260
Yeah,
because they can.

1301
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,280
You can track the position of the moving
through the sky and they know that,

1302
01:00:58,290 --> 01:00:59,670
you know,
he gets closer to the sun every,

1303
01:00:59,671 --> 01:01:01,910
every time.
don't they believe that the earth's sits

1304
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:04,070
flat and then everything spins around 
the earth.

1305
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,740
The earth is flat and the,
uh,

1306
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,620
the sun a sun and the moon are orbiting 
above like this.

1307
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:17,621
But you know,
sometimes the moon is going to be below 

1308
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:17,930
the sun and it blocks out the light of 
the sun.

1309
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:21,380
And that's how an eclipse happens on the
earth and on the rounder.

1310
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,900
So it will be an amazing thing to see 
even if you're a flat earth believer,

1311
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,440
this,
this very rare coincidence when the moon

1312
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:35,620
is in front of the sun.
So I usually encourage people who have 

1313
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,260
flat earth believers to look at this 
amazing thing that's happening.

1314
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,600
Uh,
they still don't give a fuck.

1315
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:44,170
Is there,
is there a uniformity in the flat earth 

1316
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,080
community and they like all greed or is 
there a dissension?

1317
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,860
There's some people say,
you know,

1318
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,860
that it's because the ice wall.
No,

1319
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:52,040
there's no fucking ice wall just to drop
off and everybody dies.

1320
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,850
There is kind of like,
you know,

1321
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:56,780
this mainstream thing where the dubay 
model of things,

1322
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,730
it's kind of like in the chem trail 
community,

1323
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,110
you know,
you've got this one guy,

1324
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:05,111
a dane wigington who's this really 
popular guy and then you've got like a 

1325
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:05,111
bunch of other patients.

1326
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:06,680
one is he,
is he the guy that made that,

1327
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,490
uh,
the videos,

1328
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,720
uh,
now that was michael.

1329
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:13,721
James murphy was the guy that guy was,
he was a little loony and,

1330
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,560
and,
uh,

1331
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:20,590
wigington is the guy who lives in a big 
house on 200 acres up in the mountains 

1332
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,000
somewhere.
And uh,

1333
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:27,120
he got obsessed with the solar panels 
being blocked by contractors and so 

1334
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,120
began the counter,
I'll believe it,

1335
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,490
but he,
he's like the equivalent of dubay.

1336
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:30,570
Rarely because he's the guy who was 
really promoting it.

1337
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,710
But then there's other people in the 
country,

1338
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,780
the community who are,
uh,

1339
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,130
doing their own thing and they say,
yeah,

1340
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:42,140
we can send guy's full of crap because 
he believes in global warming and we 

1341
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:42,140
don't.
So there's this,

1342
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,930
there's this division between people who
believe in global warming and who don't.

1343
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:50,070
So there's some people I think that chem
trials are trying to stop global warming

1344
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:53,820
and other people think that chem trails 
are causing global warming.

1345
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:59,090
And then there's other people that think
that's kim kendrick was something 

1346
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,191
completely different.
This spreading nano robots to control 

1347
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:04,101
people's minds and things like that.
You've got the same type of range of 

1348
01:03:04,101 --> 01:03:04,920
things in the flat earth believers as 
well.

1349
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:07,890
Like you.
Some people think that the earth is kind

1350
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,650
of concave and it's not actually flat at
all.

1351
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:13,530
What about the hollow earth people?
So the earth is hollow.

1352
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,700
That's,
that's not even,

1353
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:19,730
that's not really a flatter thing that's
like around us with a hole in the top 

1354
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:23,120
and a whole new world in there.
People live on the inside of the earth,

1355
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:28,250
which makes even less sense than the 
data from a physical point of view.

1356
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,390
While they think there's monsters in 
there.

1357
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,100
Yeah.
What were those aliens?

1358
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,500
The rothschilds they think their lizard 
people.

1359
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,820
They live under the earth.
Yeah.

1360
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,640
Lasers make tunnels.
You've heard that.

1361
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

1362
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,160
It sounds.
Sounds real.

1363
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,540
Yeah.
I'm looking into it.

1364
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:43,070
Any,
any,

1365
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,620
any conspiracy theory is going to have a
range of a plausibility.

1366
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,680
Yeah.
From reasonably plausible to completely 

1367
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:51,680
implausible,
like you think of some of the.

1368
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,780
A nine slash 11 conspiracy theories.
Like at one end you've got like the.

1369
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:00,090
The world trade center was destroyed by 
nuclear bombs that were in the basement.

1370
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,280
Nuclear bombs,
nuclear bombs.

1371
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,390
People think that.
Yeah,

1372
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,060
I haven't heard that one now.
It's a fringe one,

1373
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:07,920
but it's got a few people who believe 
it.

1374
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,710
Then there's people who think a bit bit 
more plausible.

1375
01:04:10,711 --> 01:04:12,900
They were destroyed by energy.
Weapons from space.

1376
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:17,901
Like there was these beams of energy 
like high powered microwave or something

1377
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:22,941
that blew the buildings up and then this
know you get more and more plausible.

1378
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:28,130
Those pre planted explosives or some 
guys running there on the day with some 

1379
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,020
explosives to blow building seven,
and then you've got just,

1380
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,860
they let buildings haven't burned when 
they didn't have to.

1381
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,320
And then then they got,
they,

1382
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,760
they knew it was going to happen,
but it did nothing about it.

1383
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:41,910
And then they had some warnings about it
and they didn't do anything about it.

1384
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,900
So you got this whole range of 
plausibility for the conspiracies,

1385
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,570
uh,
with the flat earth.

1386
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,580
It's pretty much all of this end because
the flush,

1387
01:04:51,581 --> 01:04:55,230
her theory is that the earth is flat or 
it's round.

1388
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:00,620
So with the flesh of you,
you've only got a very extreme.

1389
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:03,370
And then more extreme theories.
Uh,

1390
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,700
some of the most,
the most extreme thing which we,

1391
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,310
all conspiracy theories ended up with is
the,

1392
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:09,930
uh,
everything is an illusion.

1393
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:15,140
We're living in the matrix.
A conspiracy theory or that theory is 

1394
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,250
very compelling that,
that is very bizarre because

1395
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,900
one day if technology continues the way 
it has been,

1396
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,960
there will come a time where they able 
to create an artificial reality that's 

1397
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,410
indiscernible from this reality.
As long as we don't blow ourselves up 

1398
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:34,291
and technology continues to advance,
innovation continues to advance at the 

1399
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:35,350
rate it is now,
which is exponential,

1400
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,410
right?
It's entirely possible that a hundred 

1401
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:43,440
years from now or whatever it is,
they'll be some way that they can 

1402
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,381
interface with your somehow with your 
brain and create some sort of an 

1403
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,690
artificial experience.
Right?

1404
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:53,730
That's not outside the realm of prospect
theory is that doing it now and it's 

1405
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:54,970
detectable that these things that we are
seeing,

1406
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:58,330
I kind of artifacts or living in the 
matrix,

1407
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,880
you might have heard of the mandela 
effect.

1408
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:02,120
Yes.
As you know,

1409
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:06,580
the people who believe that this kind of
glitches in the matrix,

1410
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:10,810
like the berenstein bears,
berenstein bears are actually called the

1411
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,990
bear steinbeck as a and an alternate 
timeline.

1412
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:15,040
Oh,
there was this movie,

1413
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,670
a cold shazamm,
uh,

1414
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,160
done by.
Well,

1415
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,180
I can't remember the guy's name now.
People say sinbad.

1416
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:24,940
Sinbad.
Khazan.

1417
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,840
Yeah.
Mixed fleet.

1418
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,880
They completely believe that this 
actually happened,

1419
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,760
but that is,
it is.

1420
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:34,930
It is.
But they believe it.

1421
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:39,931
So that's,
that's something that's at the end of 

1422
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:39,931
all,
all these conspiracy theories.

1423
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:43,020
That's not a very reasonable one,
but there's some really reasonable 

1424
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,441
scientists that believe that there's 
going to come a time where the elon 

1425
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:46,441
musk.
Yes,

1426
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:46,930
believes that.
Yeah.

1427
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:47,730
Yeah.
I,

1428
01:06:47,731 --> 01:06:52,731
I not really convinced myself because 
it's kind of a simplistic argument 

1429
01:06:52,731 --> 01:06:56,831
saying that yeah,
technology will always advance and get 

1430
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:59,941
better.
There are fundamental limits on 

1431
01:06:59,941 --> 01:07:03,150
information theory.
Like how much information that we can 

1432
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,290
process.
Have you ever messed around with um,

1433
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,000
a htc vive or any of the more recent 
state of the art?

1434
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,170
Now they're mindblowing,
mindblowing.

1435
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,310
And this is one of the reasons why I 
subscribed to it.

1436
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:13,480
I mean,
not today,

1437
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,340
but I mean,
I think one day in the future,

1438
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:17,260
whether there's 100 years or whatever it
is of technology.

1439
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,780
I mean,
you just got to think 150 years ago they

1440
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:24,781
were using teletypes to date.
That was the only way to get a medicine 

1441
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:24,781
message across,
you know,

1442
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:26,290
um,
and then what can we do today?

1443
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,020
We can take a film and send it to 
someone in Australia.

1444
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:34,021
They get it in real time.
I think it's very reasonable to assume 

1445
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:37,321
that if you put on the htc vive,
they have this one underwater 

1446
01:07:37,321 --> 01:07:37,330
experience.
It's amazing.

1447
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:38,860
Jamie scene,
if you could find it,

1448
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:41,920
because I know it's in video form,
but I think it's reasonable it on.

1449
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
There's going to be extremely realistic 
things that make you think that you are 

1450
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,000
there.
Yes,

1451
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,520
but I don't think it's realistic that 
you would be able to not detect that a 

1452
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,510
scientist wouldn't be able to detect 
that,

1453
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:56,630
that we are all living in a simulation.
Is this simulation just just you?

1454
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:58,860
Is it just your head to see this right 
here?

1455
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,610
This is.
You put this thing on.

1456
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:01,670
I mean again,
yeah.

1457
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:06,810
We're in 2017 and this is all and it's 
fairly fairly adolescent stage and man,

1458
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:13,951
when you're,
when you're in this thing and you're 

1459
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,020
looking around,
it's not necessarily high definition.

1460
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,130
It's,
it's,

1461
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,550
it's very clear

1462
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,210
and you know that it's not real,
but god,

1463
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:25,211
it gives you this feeling that it's real
and then a whale pulls up and all these 

1464
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:25,211
fish swim by.
It's.

1465
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:29,420
It's amazing and it more than anything,
it gives you a window into the future.

1466
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:34,760
It gives you a window when you sit next 
to this whale and it makes noises and 

1467
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,410
the noises are all three d.
It gives you a window when you start 

1468
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,890
thinking about pong,
remember pong game that you would play.

1469
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:44,891
It was like,
I can't believe I'm controlling 

1470
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:44,891
something on the television to to to,
to,

1471
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:44,891
to,
to,

1472
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:49,110
to do it.
Then you compare that to like halo and 

1473
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,150
the games you can play right now and an 
xbox and was like my god,

1474
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:55,540
like the improvements are radical and I 
think that the improvements in this sort

1475
01:08:55,791 --> 01:09:00,791
of artificial reality,
this virtual reality that you're seeing 

1476
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:00,791
in this

1477
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:05,370
current htc vive 100 years from now,
I would only imagine that we could get 

1478
01:09:06,731 --> 01:09:10,060
to a point where it's indiscernible that
somebody I next to you.

1479
01:09:10,061 --> 01:09:10,780
Really.
That's great.

1480
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:11,670
That's why lie.
Look at that.

1481
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,410
That whale,
the whale is a living thing.

1482
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:19,411
It's made up of cells.
You could take one cell from that whale 

1483
01:09:19,411 --> 01:09:22,921
and you could put it under a microscope 
and you could dissect it and you could 

1484
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:22,921
look at the cell and everything that 
say,

1485
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:24,640
okay,
we're having a different argument here.

1486
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,890
I'm,
I'm thinking that it's going to feel 

1487
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:29,940
real.
You're saying scientists will be great,

1488
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,830
I believe.
I believe you won't be able to.

1489
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,900
You will be able to.
I don't believe that they could make 

1490
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,181
something that you could not detect.
I'm not text with science cripple the 

1491
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:43,960
cripple your intelligence,
so you're away from it.

1492
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,080
They'll be able to make something that's
indiscernible like while you're 

1493
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,501
experiencing it,
it's like you would a scientist could 

1494
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:52,501
come along and check it.

1495
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:53,350
It's a bit of a philosophical question 
though because like you know,

1496
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:56,710
what we have now is our observable 
universe with the laws of physics.

1497
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:01,660
I don't think within this universe you 
could make something that stimulates the

1498
01:10:01,661 --> 01:10:06,661
universe that's the same because there's
just too much information in the 

1499
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:10,861
universe to be stimulated by something 
that is within the universe or even 

1500
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:11,650
something like as small as like the the 
earth.

1501
01:10:11,651 --> 01:10:16,270
I don't think you could simulate the 
entire earth in our physical universe,

1502
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:21,830
not now.
You don't think you could do it a 

1503
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,830
thousand years from now?
Yeah,

1504
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:25,280
really good thing.
So I think there are fundamental limits 

1505
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:25,280
as to how much information will be 
required.

1506
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,340
You could get something that's a,
a,

1507
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,820
an imitation of that,
but it will be detectable different.

1508
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:37,570
Like each.
Each simulation is going to be lower 

1509
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:39,610
fidelity than the universe that created 
it.

1510
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:40,390
Right?

1511
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:45,540
So you can only create something that's 
less complex than the universe you have 

1512
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:45,940
currently in.
Is that true though?

1513
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,700
I mean as time moves on 5,000
years from now,

1514
01:10:48,701 --> 01:10:50,320
whatever it is,
I mean,

1515
01:10:50,321 --> 01:10:55,321
how could anyone possibly discern or how
could you even guess and estimate how 

1516
01:10:55,321 --> 01:10:57,770
far it would advance?
You go back 5,000

1517
01:10:57,771 --> 01:10:59,380
years ago,
people were modern humans,

1518
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:04,740
you know?
I mean the people that built the 

1519
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:04,740
pyramids.
So we're modern humans,

1520
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:04,740
right?
They,

1521
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:04,900
they looked like us.
Maybe a little smaller.

1522
01:11:04,901 --> 01:11:06,970
They didn't get as much to eat.
They look just like us.

1523
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,340
If you went 5,000
years in the future,

1524
01:11:09,341 --> 01:11:14,341
it's not.
It's not unreasonable if we don't blow 

1525
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:16,231
ourselves up that you would,
that we would have some sort of quantum 

1526
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:19,401
computing,
some astronomically powerful devices 

1527
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:23,300
that could render and create an 
artificial reality that felt to you 

1528
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:28,790
entirely real.
I don'T think that's outside the realm 

1529
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,251
of possibility,
but could you then create within that 

1530
01:11:31,251 --> 01:11:31,560
universe the same quantum computers that
are stimulating yourself?

1531
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,950
So I think that that's kind of a paradox
really.

1532
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:38,340
It has to be as powerful as the thing 
that is simulating it.

1533
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,820
I don't think so.
I think artificial intelligence is gonna

1534
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,840
lead us to a well,
if You can create something that's 

1535
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,520
artificial intelligence,
right?

1536
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,110
Which we feel like is going to happen 
way quicker than 5,000

1537
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:54,111
years from now.
If you create SomethIng that's 

1538
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,111
artificially intelligent,
it's going to improve upon.

1539
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:58,461
It's designed almost instantaneously.
It's going to realize like if you've 

1540
01:11:58,461 --> 01:11:58,461
given autonomy.
Yeah.

1541
01:11:58,461 --> 01:11:59,250
We don't know what's gonna happen,
right?

1542
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,460
Quantum computers.
We don't know how well they're going to 

1543
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,591
work.
That it could be a dud because could be 

1544
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:06,720
fucking amazing.
Could be fucking amazing.

1545
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,890
Yeah.
Who knows?

1546
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:13,510
It's something to think about,
but when when scientists start thinking 

1547
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,960
that we are currently living in some 
sort of computer simulation,

1548
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,040
I don't discard it.

1549
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,070
I'll give it a pause.
I mean I don't,

1550
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,120
I don't subscribe or not subscribed to 
something as ridiculous as that because 

1551
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,240
it seems to me within the realm of 
future possibility,

1552
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:27,880
yeah,
it's,

1553
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:32,890
it's kind of like it's a thought 
experiment because like if we are the 

1554
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,591
simulation,
we were not going to figure it out when 

1555
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:36,591
we're not going to have to do anything 
about it if we do figure it out.

1556
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:37,110
Right,
right,

1557
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:37,750
right.
Yeah.

1558
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,980
A thought experiment and the scientists 
are looking at the laws of physics.

1559
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,280
If they keep drilling down far enough,
maybe eventually they'll discover like 

1560
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,450
the some kind of artificial substrate to
the universe,

1561
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:53,451
which is all ones and zeros and that we 
are actually living in some kind of 

1562
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:56,390
simulation,
but that's just basically as resolving 

1563
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:57,960
the laws of physics and more,
you know,

1564
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,560
if we get down that deep,
what can we.

1565
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,140
We can't do anything about it.
Well,

1566
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:06,141
not only that,
does that actually mean that we are 

1567
01:13:06,141 --> 01:13:08,631
living in some sort of an artificial 
realm or does it mean that that's what 

1568
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:08,970
the universe is made of?
It's not artificial,

1569
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:14,210
but that the universe,
much like what we're creating like that 

1570
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:18,050
the universe is almost fractal and much 
like what we're creating when we're 

1571
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:21,411
creating these artificial environments 
at the universe itself is made out of 

1572
01:13:21,411 --> 01:13:22,650
ones and zeros and then this whole thing
is really mathematical.

1573
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:27,730
Yeah.
And that just because we haven't been 

1574
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:29,841
able to detect it up until now,
it doesn't mean it hasn't been running 

1575
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:32,781
on some sort of a,
some sort of a uber complicated 

1576
01:13:32,781 --> 01:13:33,310
mathematical principle.
Yeah.

1577
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:38,660
I think he's kind of a moot point in a 
Way because like what's important is 

1578
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,210
what are the laws of physics and you 
know,

1579
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:44,240
can we,
can we detect what's actually running 

1580
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:44,240
the laws of physics?
Yeah.

1581
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,720
So yeah,
it's,

1582
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,350
it's a philosophical question.
What mental masturbating.

1583
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:55,130
Yeah.
It seems to me that that's a thing that 

1584
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,591
people do,
and I think we could bring it back to 

1585
01:13:57,591 --> 01:14:00,171
this flat earth thing,
is that people love to go down these 

1586
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:03,620
honey holes of of information and have a
debate and ideas and whether it's 

1587
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:09,171
bigfoot or ufos,
we love to chase ourselves chasing our 

1588
01:14:09,171 --> 01:14:11,980
own tail when it comes to these bizarre 
subjects

1589
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,340
that that may or may not be real and 
most likely aren't real.

1590
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:20,700
We love to chase and become like 
engrossed in these things and I wonder 

1591
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,640
why we're doing it.
I wonder if we're distracting ourselves.

1592
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,080
you know?
I mean,

1593
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:28,150
it doesn't seem to be people that are 
fully happy with their life that really 

1594
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,210
get into this kind of stuff that really 
go all in and balls deep.

1595
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:39,510
You don't.
You don't get a guy who has lIke a 

1596
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:40,480
promising career.
He's at the top of his field.

1597
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,460
Happy family,
great friends,

1598
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:43,700
great hobbies,
loves his law,

1599
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,990
and then it just becomes a ufo and that 
doesn't seem to be the case.

1600
01:14:46,991 --> 01:14:47,040
Yeah.

1601
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:50,450
You still got these pool players who 
believe they're not doing so good.

1602
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,730
It's hard out there for a pool player 
right now.

1603
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:54,260
The guys at the top of the game is 
there,

1604
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,870
the teacher,
I think those guys just watched too many

1605
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:59,000
fucking youtube videos and they don't 
have any science.

1606
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:04,120
Most of pool players.
One of the things about what's that 

1607
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,270
common expression about pool players.
if someone plays pool really well,

1608
01:15:05,271 --> 01:15:10,271
it's the glorious results of a misspent 
youth because it takes a long time to 

1609
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:14,101
learn how to play pool really well and 
you're not going to be doing that while 

1610
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:14,101
you're,
you know,

1611
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:18,580
got your nose buried in physics books.
I think like people like things like 

1612
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:18,580
the,
that they,

1613
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,651
that they get things out to them,
they're getting something out of it is 

1614
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:22,730
giving them purpose in their life.
It's like,

1615
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,320
you know,
he's kind of like a hobby in a way.

1616
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,150
Like you just doing something because 
you enjoy doing it.

1617
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:27,280
Like playing chess.
Yeah.

1618
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:29,750
Except along with that hobby of doing 
stuff.

1619
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:33,260
They actually have a belief.
There's is required for them to actually

1620
01:15:33,261 --> 01:15:36,710
do their hobby and they don't obviously 
think of it like that,

1621
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:41,740
but that's essentially what it is.
They have these activities that they 

1622
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:41,740
like doing,
like gardening or whatever,

1623
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,330
but it requires them to believe that the
earth is flat,

1624
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,860
so they're spending all that time,
uh,

1625
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,940
like making youtube videos about how the
earth is flat or doing their experiments

1626
01:15:52,011 --> 01:15:57,011
about how the earth is flat and that 
they're getting something out of it 

1627
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,831
because it's the little hobby.
I do The same thing except I'm actually 

1628
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:05,710
doing it for science.
Like I do these fun little experiments 

1629
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:06,320
like on the,
on the plane today I was on the plane,

1630
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:08,720
like wedged up against the window 
looking for,

1631
01:16:08,721 --> 01:16:11,690
with this holding my camera up against 
it and the woman next to them.

1632
01:16:11,691 --> 01:16:16,691
So I thought I was this crazy guy.
You should have told you that the earth 

1633
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:17,000
isn't flat,
ma'am.

1634
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,760
she probably thought that I was thinking
to the earth was flat.

1635
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:24,790
I've seen other people on youtube that 
bringing levels onto the plane and 

1636
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:24,790
they're like,
hey,

1637
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,520
look for the level isn't moving well if 
you work

1638
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:31,750
day and you have an eight hour day plus 
commute plus family plus whatever bills 

1639
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:37,231
and issues that you have to deal with.
And then you get into one of these 

1640
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:37,231
youtube videos,
you simply,

1641
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:42,320
you simply don't have the time to really
explore all of the possibilities and all

1642
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:46,540
the science behind all of the arguments.
and it's just.

1643
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,120
Yeah,
I think what happens is either they,

1644
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:54,570
you know,
they get this superficial understanding 

1645
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:54,570
of the conspiracy theory,
uh,

1646
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:57,220
or the,
the actual real life suffers.

1647
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,500
A lot of people get sucked into 
conspiracy theories like,

1648
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:05,570
like chem trails or nine slash 11 truth.
And they become socially isolated and 

1649
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:11,780
they become the,
they get divorced and they lose custody 

1650
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:11,780
of the children.

1651
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:11,780
Happens all the time.
Yeah.

1652
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,070
And this,
this isn't like,

1653
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:18,100
you know,
he's not like the government punishing 

1654
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,631
them or anything like that.
It just because they become obsessed 

1655
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:22,061
with something that is outside of 
societal norms and they feel this 

1656
01:17:22,061 --> 01:17:26,200
overwhelming,
compelling need to tell other people 

1657
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,200
about it.
Yeah.

1658
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,550
And they talk about,
oh yeah,

1659
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:33,551
people roll their eyes when I bring up 
the subject of controls or the flat 

1660
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:33,551
earth.
And of course they do.

1661
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:35,270
But yeah.
But from their point of view,

1662
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,020
they're trying to wake up other people 
they're doing,

1663
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:42,140
they're doing the lord's work by giving 
the truth to people.

1664
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,140
But then there's some theories that are 
really compelling,

1665
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:50,170
like when you look into like operation 
northwoods and you find out that the 

1666
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:53,711
government really was planning false 
flag attacks and it didn't work out as 

1667
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:53,960
sex saturated.
I now it's not.

1668
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:55,700
How's exaggeration?
Well,

1669
01:17:55,890 --> 01:18:00,890
the,
it was a discussion document signed by 

1670
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:00,890
the joint chiefs of staff.

1671
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,610
Uh,
it's a,

1672
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,440
it was rejected by a candidate,
by candidate,

1673
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:08,160
by the joint chiefs of staff very far.
It was just one documents.

1674
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,440
They signed it though they got it.
They didn't sign you that they wanted to

1675
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:14,120
do it,
but it was an idea,

1676
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:16,790
the idea that you were going to attack 
american civilians,

1677
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:19,340
that you were going to arm cuban 
friendlies and attack one tunnel,

1678
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,330
that you're going to blow up a drone,
airliner.

1679
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,530
These were all proposed things.
They will propose things.

1680
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,770
Yeah.
But it was just like,

1681
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,300
you know,
but you can understand.

1682
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:31,330
I understand what you're saying,
but spit balling that you're going to 

1683
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:31,520
deceive the american people and kill 
american civilians,

1684
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,670
and then this is a normal part of the 
way nero burned rome.

1685
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,600
HiTler burned,
burned.

1686
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:40,601
The reichstag that false flag attacks 
are real and that they have happened 

1687
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:42,650
throughout history.
So when you do have an open mind and you

1688
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:47,651
are compelled to try to seek the truth,
you got to be aware that these things 

1689
01:18:47,651 --> 01:18:48,200
have happened in history.

1690
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:52,040
They are real and if you dismiss 
everything,

1691
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:57,250
you'll be thought of as a shill,
as much as I mean as much as people who 

1692
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,480
look for conspiracies and everything.
There are also people who try to dismiss

1693
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:04,481
everything and you have to be very 
careful because there are a lot of 

1694
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:06,650
things that people do conspire to do.
Like one of the things that I brought up

1695
01:19:06,651 --> 01:19:08,030
before and people hate when I talk about
this,

1696
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,360
but I'm going to do it again.
Uh,

1697
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,740
people say I don't believe in conspiracy
conspiracy's.

1698
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,530
And I said,
you don't believe in any conspiracies?

1699
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,440
No.
Okay.

1700
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:20,470
Do you believe nine slash 11 happened?
I do believe that people flew planes 

1701
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:25,660
into jet blue jet planes into buildings.
Well then you believe in conspiracies 

1702
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,500
because someone can aspire to do that.
And they did it.

1703
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,320
They pulled it off.
a bunch of people got together,

1704
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,650
decided they were going to attack.

1705
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:37,030
They flew a plane into the pentagon.
They flew two planes into the world 

1706
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,300
trade center towers.
I mean that really happened.

1707
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:41,270
So that's a conspiracy and they pulled 
it off.

1708
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,540
So when you debunk all of these things 
that are absolutely false,

1709
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:50,090
like flat earth and chem trails and ufo 
is and all that Jazz,

1710
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:54,090
you got to be careful to not try to 
debunk everything because now people are

1711
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,130
saying,
I just think like,

1712
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,680
I personally just feel the northwest 
thing is a bit overblown.

1713
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,980
I don't it what it was.
I think it speaks volumes about what the

1714
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:04,010
mindset of the joint chiefs of staff for
one example.

1715
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,810
And a good one though.
Yeah.

1716
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:07,190
But they didn't come up with any others.

1717
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,380
Um,
what about what got us into Vietnam?

1718
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,030
Gulf of tonkin.
Yeah.

1719
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,800
That was a false flag.
Well,

1720
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:18,801
that's debatable too,
because that was just basically they 

1721
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:18,801
thought that they were being attacked.
Nothing.

1722
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:19,710
Debatable.
Yeah.

1723
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,920
I think that's pretty much been agreed 
upon the flag.

1724
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,650
It was a series of events led.
There was the,

1725
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:30,700
it didn't happen to over two nights the 
report of the boats being fired upon a.

1726
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:36,180
And it turns out that probably wasn't 
anything there.

1727
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,850
Right.
So it's debatable is,

1728
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,780
did they think there was something there
and they wanted to be.

1729
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,590
So did they completely invented out of 
thin air right now?

1730
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,720
Probably used it as a pretext to,
uh,

1731
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,520
to uh,
start the Vietnam war.

1732
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,850
Uh,
but they just took advantage of it.

1733
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:01,860
learn the same way the bush took 
advantage of the nine slash 11 attacks 

1734
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:03,340
to push his agenda.
Now,

1735
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:08,340
is that a conspiracy?
It's hard to say like what knowledge did

1736
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,980
bush have of the nine slash 11 attacks 
beforehand?

1737
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:14,760
We know he took advantage of it and we 
know that,

1738
01:21:14,761 --> 01:21:15,140
uh,
you know,

1739
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,210
the,
uh,

1740
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,320
the american administration back then 
took advantage of the gulf of tonkin 

1741
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,921
reports.
We don't know for sure whether the gulf 

1742
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:27,621
of tonkin reports were fabricated or how
much they were fabricated or what 

1743
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:29,440
actually happened on that night.
Uh,

1744
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:34,700
and uh,
but we do know that they were taken 

1745
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:34,850
advantage of.
Yeah.

1746
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:35,250
Well,

1747
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:36,100
uh,
my,

1748
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:39,280
my whole point is that you have to be 
careful when you,

1749
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,590
a person who debunks things that are 
legitimately ridiculous,

1750
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:47,950
that you have to take into consideration
the possibility that people do 

1751
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:48,980
conspiring to do things.
Totally.

1752
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:49,760
They do.
Yes.

1753
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:53,810
If that's happened within pretty high 
levels of government with enron,

1754
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:58,900
I mean there's this and there's been a 
ton of conspiracies that turned out to 

1755
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,081
be true and that's what they arms very 
ryan the Iran contra scandal.

1756
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,310
I probably went to all the way to the 
top.

1757
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,980
Oh yeah.
Reagan probably knew all that.

1758
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:09,260
That was where it was hilarious when it 
was,

1759
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:12,080
when reagan was showing the first signs 
of alzheimer's,

1760
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:17,470
when he didn't remember,
he didn't remember anything and people 

1761
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:17,470
were like,
oh,

1762
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:17,470
he's lying.
And it turns out no,

1763
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,280
and he's actuallY memories really 
eroding.

1764
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:21,140
The community was an older man.
I Mean,

1765
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,360
he's in his late seventies at the time,
wasn't he?

1766
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:23,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1767
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:28,690
He was a trump sage.
I think jesus christ trump.

1768
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:33,790
There was a fucking hilarious article 
about trump today that he doesn't 

1769
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,551
believe in exercise because he believes 
that the body has a finite amount of 

1770
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,110
energy in it and then when you exercise 
you use up that energy and that's why he

1771
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:40,790
has so much energy because he doesn't 
exercise.

1772
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,390
He has strange diets.
Like he has his steaks.

1773
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:47,780
Well done and he likes to eat lunch meat
straight out of the fridge,

1774
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:49,880
but It's not the head of the show.
Sure.

1775
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:54,740
He's a very nice guy.
Are you never met the guy?

1776
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:56,780
Yeah.
He doesn't look healthy,

1777
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:58,430
but he's got a lot of energy,
man.

1778
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,440
Kind of amazing.
How much energy he has.

1779
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,270
Alex jones.
Yeah,

1780
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:03,050
he did.
Well,

1781
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,190
he kind of looks reasonably healthy.
Guess he's not healthy?

1782
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,070
No,
no.

1783
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,880
Alex hasn't looked at healthy.
He's overweight and he's,

1784
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:11,110
uh,
he's younger than me.

1785
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,420
like I was used to freak out that he's 
younger than me.

1786
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:13,840
I was like,
oh,

1787
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:16,510
you're younger than me.
I keep just goes hard.

1788
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:18,990
Alex goes hard all the time,
you know,

1789
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,830
and now it takes a toll.
Well,

1790
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:22,440
it's also,
I mean,

1791
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,350
constantly worrying that the 
government's after you and that there's,

1792
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,080
you know,
every fucking turned he take has a 

1793
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,601
conspiracy behind.
It's the mind can only take so much 

1794
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:33,601
pressure.

1795
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:34,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1796
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:41,150
Cool.
Should we talk about some of flood of 

1797
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:41,150
that stuff?
Sure.

1798
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:41,150
What else you get out there?
You've got notes.

1799
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:45,430
I do.
I read everything I could think of on 

1800
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:45,430
the fly to which is a shit load of 
stuff.

1801
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,520
Uh,
the international space station.

1802
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:48,810
Oh,
that's a good one.

1803
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:50,850
Yeah.
I think that that footage is fake.

1804
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,430
They think it's all fake,
but what you can do is you guys,

1805
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:59,520
you can get back to the skylab footage 
and ask someone who believes in flat 

1806
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,681
earth how they faked the skyline footage
because this footage of skylight with 

1807
01:24:03,681 --> 01:24:03,681
people like,
you know,

1808
01:24:03,681 --> 01:24:06,110
they're running around and running 
around in circles in zero gravity,

1809
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:11,140
as long sequences of people doing stuff 
in zero gravity and it's in a space 

1810
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,860
that's actually too big to fit in any,
any plane that's ever been built.

1811
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:19,250
So it couldn't be filled,
filmed in a thing Where they do the 

1812
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:19,350
vomit comet.
Yeah.

1813
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,320
It has to be something that was actually
a zero

1814
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,140
for people don't know what that is.
When,

1815
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:27,800
when you see scenes in movies where 
someone was moving in zero gravity,

1816
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:31,520
they would film that in a plane that 
would literally be,

1817
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:33,410
tHey would get the plane up to like 
40,000

1818
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:38,030
feet or whatever and then they would 
just literally shoot down so that you're

1819
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:42,530
kind of going faster down than gravity 
and you could float around.

1820
01:24:42,531 --> 01:24:42,590
Yeah.

1821
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,140
So this is zero gravity here.
Yeah.

1822
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,020
Running around in circles and they do 
all kinds of stuff like that.

1823
01:24:48,021 --> 01:24:50,720
You get three of them running and this 
is the space that they're in.

1824
01:24:50,721 --> 01:24:52,760
There is,
is so big that it wouldn't fit in.

1825
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:58,290
Like you probably wouldn't even fit in 
the beluga thing that they use for 

1826
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,541
transporting a planes.
But it ties us back to area 51 because 

1827
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,860
there's some giant airplanes that they 
make an area 51.

1828
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,020
They used to simulate zero.
Yeah.

1829
01:25:06,021 --> 01:25:07,720
I mean it's obvious that this isn't 
space.

1830
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,470
Yeah.
And this is like from the seventies.

1831
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,990
Yeah,
pretty amazing,

1832
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,360
but the space station,
the international space station,

1833
01:25:14,361 --> 01:25:19,361
it flies over at regular intervals and 
this is not one of the ground truth 

1834
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:20,330
things that I was talking about earlier.
You can see it,

1835
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,070
you can look up when it's going to fly 
over.

1836
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:23,450
You can get them to send you a list.

1837
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:26,470
There's a cycle spot the station as a 
nasa site,

1838
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,520
uh,
but you don't have to trust it,

1839
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:32,480
but you can still sign up and it will 
tell you when the space station is going

1840
01:25:32,481 --> 01:25:37,481
to fly over to the second.
He'll tell you to the second one it's 

1841
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:37,481
going to appear and how,
how,

1842
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:41,800
how,
how it will be and how long it'll be 

1843
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:41,800
visible for.
And you can get to send you an email and

1844
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,330
then get your camera out and take 
photographs of it when it,

1845
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:48,390
when it happens.
So you know that this website is 

1846
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:50,981
correct,
you've proven it on the ground and you 

1847
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,711
can also do it from different positions 
and get two people doing it and you can 

1848
01:25:53,711 --> 01:25:57,221
figure out how,
how high the space station is by 

1849
01:25:57,221 --> 01:25:57,221
triangulating acu?
Yeah.

1850
01:25:57,221 --> 01:25:57,590
What's the angle?
What's the angle?

1851
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:02,860
How far apart they are and you can 
figure out that the space station is 

1852
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:02,860
actually 250 miles high.

1853
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:07,550
It is orbiting the earth at 250 miles 
and you can also take photographs of the

1854
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:13,121
space station with this camera and you 
can zoom in close enough on the space 

1855
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:18,371
station to actually see the shape of the
space station and the solar panels and 

1856
01:26:18,371 --> 01:26:21,851
the main modules and everything so you 
can see that actually is something that 

1857
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:25,871
is moving along the same path that nasa 
says is moving along and at the same 

1858
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:31,061
speed as they suggest and it's at the 
right height and is the right size 

1859
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:37,360
because you can do the calculations on 
the camera and figure out what the size 

1860
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,130
of the space station is.
So we know that something that the exact

1861
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:44,730
same size and shape and speed of the 
space station is exactly where nasa says

1862
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,590
it is.
And there's really no way you could fake

1863
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:52,850
that on a flat earth because you'd have 
to have this bizarre.

1864
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:58,330
A thousand foot wide a floating thing 
moving along at like 14,000

1865
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:04,421
miles an hour.
Doing this kind of whizzy pattern all 

1866
01:27:04,421 --> 01:27:05,480
around this spiral graph pattern around 
the flat earth.

1867
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:07,310
It's Just.
It's literally impossible.

1868
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,830
Whereas if you'd look at it from the 
globe model point of view,

1869
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,970
it's just the space station orbiting the
globe,

1870
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:19,090
but does this bother you?
Sometimes you're even debunking the 

1871
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:19,090
staff,
do it,

1872
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:19,970
does it?
Does I catch myself and go,

1873
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:21,320
fuck,
am I doing?

1874
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:22,480
Yeah,
it's obviously,

1875
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:27,520
yeah.
One of the most stupidly obvious proofs 

1876
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,840
that were not on the flatter is that if 
you get three people yesterday,

1877
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:34,850
standard,
one of them or the bottom of South 

1878
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,300
Africa,
one of them at the bottom of south 

1879
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,401
America and one of them in Australia and
have them all look south from that 

1880
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:40,940
position.
Now on the flat earth,

1881
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,070
you got one person here,
one person here,

1882
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:48,071
one person here,
and if the old south like away from the 

1883
01:27:48,071 --> 01:27:50,441
north pole,
they're all looking in completely 

1884
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:50,990
different directions,
but in the real world,

1885
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:51,980
what do they actually see?

1886
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,930
The lcd,
the exact same constellation,

1887
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:56,330
the southern cross right in front of 
them,

1888
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,020
so they're all looking in different 
directions on the flood earth,

1889
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:05,490
but on the round earth,
they're all just looking towards the 

1890
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:05,900
southern cross.
So see what you're sayIng.

1891
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:10,930
It's literally impossible to do that on 
the flat earth and you can actually see 

1892
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:13,000
this and take photographs of the 
constellations and compare.

1893
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:18,370
And that's something I was talking about
with the ground truth thing with 

1894
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:18,370
malaria.
And like you can,

1895
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:23,080
you could go virtually yourself to these
places and see what the sky looks from 

1896
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,310
that position.
Uh,

1897
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:27,800
so either solarium is lying or these,
you know,

1898
01:28:27,801 --> 01:28:31,790
the southern cross does actually appear 
from these three different positions.

1899
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:37,240
Well that's another thing that these 
flatters people keep bringing up as 

1900
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,180
polaris.
The idea that this one star puts a great

1901
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:43,181
one and that all these other stars 
rotate aroUnd it and that this is 

1902
01:28:43,181 --> 01:28:43,181
somehow or another proof that they're 
not spinning.

1903
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,570
What are there?
We're on a flat earth.

1904
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:49,571
What's so stupid about that is that 
people in Australia have a completely 

1905
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:52,721
different constellations and the stars 
rotate the other direction around from 

1906
01:28:52,721 --> 01:28:56,650
the start.
They're all coming towards us from the 

1907
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:56,650
east.
So if you look north,

1908
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:57,860
they're going that way.
If you look south the going that way.

1909
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:03,180
So the rotating around the north star,
which actually isn't anything special,

1910
01:29:03,181 --> 01:29:05,970
it's just the stuff that happens to be 
closest to the point,

1911
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,980
the north point,
and it changes all the time.

1912
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:13,010
If you zoom in,
you can actually see there are stars 

1913
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:14,100
that are even closer and if you take a 
time lapse of the north star,

1914
01:29:14,101 --> 01:29:15,710
it actually makes a little circle.
But,

1915
01:29:15,711 --> 01:29:20,711
and also that north star is not the same
north star is in the past because the 

1916
01:29:20,711 --> 01:29:20,860
axis of the earth,
uh,

1917
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,770
there's this thing called procession 
where they,

1918
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:24,150
uh,
every 26,000

1919
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:26,110
years and wobbles away.

1920
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:27,090
Yeah.
But yeah,

1921
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:28,500
the south,
the south team,

1922
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:33,530
everyone's looking at the same thing in 
the south and the stars are rotating in 

1923
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:33,530
that direction.
But yeah,

1924
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:38,511
polaris,
polaris is a good one for a number of 

1925
01:29:38,511 --> 01:29:38,511
reasons.
One is not really fixed.

1926
01:29:38,511 --> 01:29:42,670
It's one degree off from the center of 
the celestial sphere,

1927
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,630
but if you look at a time lapse 
photograph of the earth,

1928
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:48,510
if they point a camera up like say from 
north America,

1929
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:52,420
what you get is the illusion that all 
these stars are spinning around that one

1930
01:29:52,421 --> 01:29:53,250
star.
It's fixed,

1931
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:58,670
but it's because you're looking at a 
time lapse of only a few hours where 

1932
01:29:58,670 --> 01:29:59,890
it's dark at night.
Whereas this procession of the equinoxes

1933
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:04,891
is a very slow process that takes 26,000
years and you're just not going to get a

1934
01:30:05,011 --> 01:30:10,011
26,000
years time lapse photo of you could 

1935
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:10,510
simulate it.
You could still area.

1936
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:12,750
And I was going to believe that.

1937
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,430
What's interesting is that some 
cultures,

1938
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:17,730
it's been pretty much observed that some
cultures were aware of.

1939
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:19,770
The procession of the equinox is 
thousands of years ago.

1940
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:22,610
Somehow that they kind of knew,
you know,

1941
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,940
quite impressive.
It will.

1942
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:28,941
A lot of old coaches did actually take 
records of the stars because stars we 

1943
01:30:28,941 --> 01:30:30,240
used for navigation.
Yeah.

1944
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,390
Uh,
the post,

1945
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:35,640
you know,
obviously is something that gives you,

1946
01:30:35,641 --> 01:30:39,180
this fixed north a degree,
but the other stars as well,

1947
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:40,780
like if you know,
you know what,

1948
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:42,890
how long it takes to go from one place 
to another.

1949
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:45,240
You don't really understand the exact 
math,

1950
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:49,170
but you can use it for navigation.
It's called celestial navigation.

1951
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:53,220
What other ridiculous things can we 
point out before we wrap this up?

1952
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,700
My head's starting to hurt.
I had food poisoning yesterday,

1953
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:57,960
folks.
I don't know what happened.

1954
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,240
I ate something bad at a greasy diner.
Well,

1955
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:05,420
polaris is a good thing because you can 
actually look at the angle of polaris 

1956
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,010
was at a bang.
Do you hear banging?

1957
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:11,230
I heard banging.

1958
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:19,290
Oh,
it's next door.

1959
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,790
He is putting something on the wall.
It sounds like they shut down the stream

1960
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:25,320
twice on us already.
Oh really?

1961
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,550
Yeah,
it's flat earth.

1962
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,560
I'm recording the whole thing.
God dammit.

1963
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:35,620
Um,
what are the things that were they to 

1964
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:36,090
us,
the others wonder why they.

1965
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,040
Earth's atmosphere isn't sucked off into
space.

1966
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:39,060
Uh,
well,

1967
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:40,830
how about the one where that's a good 
one,

1968
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:43,590
but it's a good one because I've 
wondered that myself.

1969
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:47,340
I know now why,
why that is.

1970
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:52,341
I know why it's such going to get stuck 
in this space because you think you 

1971
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:53,020
think that a vacuum sucks things,
right?

1972
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:56,190
It's going to suck.
Everything sucks everything away.

1973
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:57,840
So if there's this atmosphere on the 
earth,

1974
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:02,900
the vacuum of space suck it away.
But the thing is like vacuum doesn't 

1975
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:03,500
actually suck.
Vacuum is nothing.

1976
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:05,230
He has no energy.
It doesn't do anything.

1977
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:10,230
There's no power.
The reason that things flow into vacuum 

1978
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:11,650
is air pressure and air pressure as a 
function of gravity.

1979
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,870
So gravity is pulling everything down 
towards the earth.

1980
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:21,250
So there's no,
there's no nothing that can push it out.

1981
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,320
If you see.
You see what I'm saying?

1982
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:28,350
If,
if you imagine like if the universe was 

1983
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:28,350
suddenly filled with loads and loads of 
gas like oxygen.

1984
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:30,810
So.
And then you stick a big planet in the,

1985
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:36,130
all the gas would kind of like gravity 
would bring it down towards this planet.

1986
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:39,810
Will they don't believe in gravity.
Electromagnetic.

1987
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:43,300
This is my favorite new one.
Didn't see the font one.

1988
01:32:43,301 --> 01:32:45,430
Whether they show that if the earth was 
a globe,

1989
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:46,690
that all the water would be on the 
bottom.

1990
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,580
Yeah.
That's wonderful.

1991
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:51,010
I think that was a joke.
It's a joke.

1992
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:52,310
How?
How can you show?

1993
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,890
What about the other ones as well,
but.

1994
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,190
No,
no,

1995
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:55,000
no.
Bring it up.

1996
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:56,800
Jamie.
This one's wonderful.

1997
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:58,740
I think they're being serious.
Yeah.

1998
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,920
Now the gravity thing though,
it's kind of like almost irrelevant 

1999
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,160
because yeah,
we know that things fall down,

2000
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:11,270
right,
but it's electromagnetic something or 

2001
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,270
another.
Well,

2002
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:14,360
it's magic.
It's a magical force that's making 

2003
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:14,360
things hold down.
It doesn't really matter.

2004
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:14,360
You know?
Gravity.

2005
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,721
We could say we don't really understand 
what gravitates lava lava as part of 

2006
01:33:18,721 --> 01:33:20,140
gravity to write lava.
Well,

2007
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:25,141
it's the idea that all these rocks are 
pushing down and there's extreme heat 

2008
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,440
and buoyancy,
buoyancy and density and density.

2009
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:32,450
The functions of gravitate,
like if you stick something in the 

2010
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:35,131
water,
it's all the water is flowing into the 

2011
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:35,530
bottom.
This we're looking at this image folks.

2012
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:40,710
It says gravity is not strong enough to 
stop a small stream from flowing to its 

2013
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:45,091
lowest point.
Then what is stopping the oceans north 

2014
01:33:45,091 --> 01:33:46,510
of the equator from emptying into the 
ocean south of the equator.

2015
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,500
This is what the earth would look like 
if we lived on a globe.

2016
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:53,290
Gravity is pseudo science,
dot,

2017
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:56,360
dot,
dot a theory that can't be proven.

2018
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:01,400
They forgot the apostrophe and can't you
fucking don't look at that image though.

2019
01:34:02,321 --> 01:34:05,320
It's hilarious.
Why is there water on the top at all?

2020
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:06,550
How about that?
You stupid.

2021
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:09,340
Fuck it's raining.
It rains on top.

2022
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:11,040
Only separates from the bottom and comes
around.

2023
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:16,190
I'll would be kinda cool if half the 
planet was dirt and have plant was 

2024
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:16,630
watering word,
whether that be any weirder than what it

2025
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:21,631
is now.
You know the reason they didn't like 

2026
01:34:21,631 --> 01:34:22,951
gravity is that if you actually apply 
the lows that gravitates to a flooded 

2027
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:24,400
flooded with actually scrunch up into a 
bowl.

2028
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:25,300
Oh,
okay.

2029
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,020
Oh yeah.
Right.

2030
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,700
There's no way it can.
It can lay flat.

2031
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:30,970
It would.
It would.

2032
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,670
It would either be like gravity.

2033
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:35,350
It would be an intensely lodge because 
you've got an infinite abundance of rock

2034
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:36,040
underneath.
Yeah.

2035
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:41,340
Or it's like something on the back of a 
turtle or something and it will just 

2036
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:41,340
scrunched up into a bowl.
What do they think?

2037
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,180
Lava is?
Molten rock.

2038
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:48,240
I mean they just think it's brilliant 
because it heats up and becomes less 

2039
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:48,240
dense than the other rock.
Why is it?

2040
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:53,160
Why is it down there?
And the bottom was a core of the fires 

2041
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:53,160
of hell.
A heating it up.

2042
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:55,240
The fires of hell.
Look at this.

2043
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:56,770
What is this?
Tennis ball?

2044
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,330
Why doesn't water fly off the earth 
spins because the,

2045
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:05,710
this for suspending this is a,
this is a fundamental misunderstanding 

2046
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:05,710
that they will have.
They,

2047
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,980
they,
uh,

2048
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,210
misinterpret angular velocity and linear
velocity.

2049
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,530
Like we know the earth is spinning 
around a thousand miles an hour,

2050
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:18,130
right?
They think if this bowl was spinning 

2051
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:18,130
around at a thousand miles an hour,
then the water would,

2052
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:19,070
would,
would fly off.

2053
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,800
But it's not flying off because of the 
surface of the bowl going a thousand 

2054
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,780
miles an hour,
it's flying off because it's rotating it

2055
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:30,110
like 50 times a second or whatever,
and 10 times a second,

2056
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:34,100
it's the angular velocity which creates 
the outward force.

2057
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,630
Linear plots has got nothing to do with 
it.

2058
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:37,280
He's anyone.
You're actually turning,

2059
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,680
you know when you're driving in a car,
like you'd be driving really,

2060
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:41,780
really fast.
You didn't really feel any forces act on

2061
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:42,920
you,
but when you go around the corner,

2062
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:48,400
you get slumped over to one side.
So it's the the rate of your angular 

2063
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,620
velocity.
Now the earth rotates once,

2064
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,600
once every 24 hours.
So it's going really,

2065
01:35:53,601 --> 01:35:54,860
really,
really slow.

2066
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:59,300
Put that back up please.
And if you imagine that tennis ball,

2067
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:01,280
and if you take it and stick in a little
turntable,

2068
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:03,110
the rotates,
once every 24 hours,

2069
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:08,500
the water is not going to fly off.
And it's the exact same force acting on 

2070
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,650
the earth because the earth rotates once
every 24 hours.

2071
01:36:09,651 --> 01:36:11,570
The fact that it's like you're going a 
thousand miles an hour,

2072
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:16,571
it's completely irrelevant because it's 
essentially going in straight lines 

2073
01:36:16,571 --> 01:36:16,610
around the edge.
Jamie,

2074
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:18,650
go to that photo on the upper left hand 
side.

2075
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:19,980
Scroll up

2076
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:25,670
satan's globe earth like this.

2077
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:30,770
This,
this bottom picture here is a great 

2078
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:30,770
example of how ridiculous things are.
It's hold on

2079
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:33,460
satan's globe earth lied.
The big bang and evolution.

2080
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:35,530
Explain life.
You were an accident.

2081
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:40,150
We evolved from primordial soup.
We are specs in the universe.

2082
01:36:40,151 --> 01:36:42,460
Some people are more valuable than 
others.

2083
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:46,150
Foundation for the new world order you 
are worthless.

2084
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:51,180
Next image.
God's flat earth creation is the only 

2085
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,720
explanation.
We are incredibly valuable.

2086
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:57,990
The bible is 100 percent true.
We live on an unmoving firm foundation.

2087
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,840
You were created by god in all caps.
God loves you and that that

2088
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,710
seems better.
That's probably a true believer.

2089
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:11,711
The oh yeah.
You think that image there is a is a 

2090
01:37:11,711 --> 01:37:14,710
good example of things that are just 
completely ridiculous on the flutter 

2091
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:18,310
earth.
You see they have the sun on one side 

2092
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,310
and it's eliminating healthier and the 
way,

2093
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:21,350
the way it's cooked like that.
The thing that runs way closer to.

2094
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:21,830
Right?
Yeah.

2095
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:24,290
They think the.
The son acted like a spotlight.

2096
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:29,800
He's looking at that.
It's not like a spotlight is 

2097
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,190
illuminating all of the ice wall.
Where's the ice wall?

2098
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,580
That's the white stuff,
right?

2099
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:35,030
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2100
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:40,180
Which is actually.
It's just a antarctica stretched into 

2101
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,881
this projection.
Why doesn't one of those dickheads 

2102
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:42,881
getting a boat and take a photo that 
wall?

2103
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:42,881
Well,
that's another thing.

2104
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:44,230
They think they'll go god's all the way 
around it.

2105
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,050
Oh,
there are guards.

2106
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,440
Yeah.
That's a.

2107
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,940
What is that?
That's true for like 36,000

2108
01:37:49,941 --> 01:37:54,941
miles of guards of gods in the ocean 
with on a freezing ice

2109
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,230
wall.
Is the wall from it.

2110
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:01,620
Game of thrones is that 36,000
miles.

2111
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:05,760
They make up facts and then they use 
those facts to kind of stayed there.

2112
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:09,030
Point like you can't.
It's illegal to fly over antarctica.

2113
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:12,990
Yeah.
That's kind of based on like half.

2114
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,330
Well a quarter truth like you have to 
have.

2115
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:20,400
You can't fly to engine jet over 
antarctica because if an engine fails 

2116
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,080
you wouldn't be able to get to an 
airport.

2117
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:24,930
So they only allow a four engine jets,
seven,

2118
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:25,470
four,
seven,

2119
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,600
zero,
eight,

2120
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,080
three eight is to fly.
So all those,

2121
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:31,650
those flights that you see that go over 
at the antarctic ice,

2122
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:32,300
they're all seven,
four,

2123
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:33,810
seven.
Yeah.

2124
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:35,670
Because if it fucks up your doomed.
Yeah.

2125
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:38,600
Yeah.
it's a long way with nothing because set

2126
01:38:38,601 --> 01:38:43,601
of regulations called itar,
which is all about how far you can go 

2127
01:38:43,601 --> 01:38:47,901
away from an airport and what 
configuration of plane that you have to 

2128
01:38:47,901 --> 01:38:47,901
do.

2129
01:38:47,901 --> 01:38:49,920
See now I wonder how many people are 
listening to this and it's turning their

2130
01:38:49,921 --> 01:38:51,960
mind.
Do you think it's possible?

2131
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:57,050
Do you think there's.
There's gotta be a spectrum of people 

2132
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:57,050
that believe there is a spectrum and 
some people will,

2133
01:38:57,050 --> 01:39:01,760
will be turned.
This will cause a lot of ruffled 

2134
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:01,860
feathers.
Are you ready for the shill tweets?

2135
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:03,150
Are you ready?
Well,

2136
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:08,151
you were around her.
She'll shirt if we get you one and 

2137
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:08,730
jamie.com.
I actually done like.

2138
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,290
It's very complicated.
I know it's all,

2139
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:13,170
it's all in good humor.
Soft people like joking around,

2140
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:14,950
but take it seriously.
Oh yeah.

2141
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:20,280
With that said,
I make stuff up that my wife got me 

2142
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:20,790
because I'm always making stupid jokes.
Right.

2143
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And someone saw a photograph of me 
online wearing this tee shirt that said 

2144
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,061
I make stuff up and says make west.
I'd missing a completely serious.

2145
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,470
Yeah.
But there stupid.

2146
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:31,630
Um,
yeah,

2147
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:34,770
but it's part of the mesa to reach 
people if,

2148
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:35,940
uh,
if,

2149
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:38,070
you know the,
the pointing the been,

2150
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,420
it's a distraction,
right?

2151
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,290
Something like that.
Yeah.

2152
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,790
I guess I guess I hear what you're 
saying.

2153
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:43,860
I'm pretty easy to dismiss.
Um,

2154
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,900
they always say that you work for the 
government.

2155
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,970
That's the big one.
you're a government employee.

2156
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:50,690
You made video games,
video game programmer.

2157
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:55,840
I helped make the tony hawk series of 
video games and made enough money to 

2158
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,331
retire on.
And now I just pushed her around the 

2159
01:39:59,331 --> 01:39:59,940
house.
Do gardening and do a debunking stuff.

2160
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,750
Do fun experiments in the village.
You live in the goddamn american dream.

2161
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:08,780
It's where you're doing.
You made enough money to not have to 

2162
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,301
slave away.
And these assholes who want to think 

2163
01:40:11,301 --> 01:40:13,911
that you're some government shill,
like the governments involved in the 

2164
01:40:13,911 --> 01:40:13,911
tony hawk video games.

2165
01:40:13,911 --> 01:40:14,520
They recruited you.
They said,

2166
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:19,521
listen,
I know you're doing a good job making 

2167
01:40:19,521 --> 01:40:19,521
these video games.
We've got a better place for you.

2168
01:40:19,521 --> 01:40:23,040
I need to do is cover up the flat earth 
and chem trails and you have photos.

2169
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:24,480
And what else?
What else you cover up?

2170
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:28,520
Morgellons.
Morgellons disease is a fascinating one.

2171
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:32,250
It's one of the ones that we introduced 
that we investigated on that show.

2172
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:37,490
And do you know that one of the guys 
that we interviewed was a doctor and 

2173
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:42,321
what he thinks is that everyone who has 
more gallons also has lyme disease and 

2174
01:40:43,111 --> 01:40:45,660
lyme disease has a neuro toxicity 
effect.

2175
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:50,661
And he was talking to himself about his 
own hallucinations that he sees things 

2176
01:40:50,661 --> 01:40:51,780
like crawling crosses eyes that he knows
aren't there.

2177
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:54,010
Oh yeah.
He was a very rational and he

2178
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,970
was also saying that lyme disease,
when you get it from ticks,

2179
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:00,460
that you're not just getting this one 
disease,

2180
01:41:00,461 --> 01:41:05,461
but you're getting a host of pathogens 
and sometimes these pathogens will 

2181
01:41:05,461 --> 01:41:09,690
interact with each other.
In very different ways and that you 

2182
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:09,690
know,
some are more extreme,

2183
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:14,191
some are less extreme,
but he's like you might be dealing with 

2184
01:41:14,191 --> 01:41:16,171
hundreds of different pathogens that are
an undiscovered or are undefined and he 

2185
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:21,721
thinks that what's going on with a lot 
of these people that have more jealous 

2186
01:41:21,721 --> 01:41:24,840
is lyme disease and whatever these other
diseases are that's causing them to 

2187
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:27,400
hallucinate and think that fibers are 
growing out of their skin would really.

2188
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:31,360
What it is is they're scratching 
themselves and then they get like carpet

2189
01:41:31,361 --> 01:41:36,361
fibers or clothing fibers on their skin 
and then they think it's coming out of 

2190
01:41:36,361 --> 01:41:36,820
there.
He was very reasonable and he made a ton

2191
01:41:36,821 --> 01:41:41,821
of sense because we went to this more 
jealous convention and we talked to all 

2192
01:41:41,821 --> 01:41:43,450
these people that had it and they 
fucking all have lyme disease.

2193
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:44,350
They all have it.

2194
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:44,960
Well,
they'll.

2195
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:50,020
They'll get tested positive for it.
That's a bit of controversy about that 

2196
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,870
because the test that you can do,
you can basically keep doing it and it's

2197
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:55,900
kind of a very inexact test for lyme 
disease and it gives a lot of false 

2198
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,450
positives.
There's a bunch of different tests,

2199
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:57,310
but there's so many people

2200
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:02,380
with lyme disease,
which is where it's interesting because 

2201
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:02,380
lyme diseases,
it's.

2202
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,040
I know a lot of people that have gotten 
it from ticks and it's fair

2203
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,270
thing.
It's a real thing that's devastating.

2204
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,730
There's a lot of controversy.
Well,

2205
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:13,900
yeah.
It's one of those things that the 

2206
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,370
medical community as a mainstream 
opinion about whether the longterm 

2207
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:19,940
effects from lyme disease and then 
there's people who think that there is 

2208
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:20,220
the longterm effects,
so there's some dispute.

2209
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:20,810
There is some.

2210
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,660
Let me clArify from people that I know 
that have gotten it.

2211
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,720
One of the things about the medical 
community is the ignorance of the of 

2212
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:30,270
lyme disease and that you go to a lot of
different doctors and they.

2213
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,650
They poo poo it.
They say,

2214
01:42:31,651 --> 01:42:33,180
oh,
this is nothing to worry about.

2215
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,270
My friend's son got it and he developed 
bell palsy,

2216
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:41,630
bell's palsy.
His face went numb and that was when 

2217
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:44,301
they took it seriously and they finally 
gave him this intense round of 

2218
01:42:44,301 --> 01:42:47,691
intravenous antibiotics,
but my friend was on antibiotics for 

2219
01:42:47,691 --> 01:42:47,691
months.
I mean,

2220
01:42:47,691 --> 01:42:51,441
he was devastated and we had a guy in 
here that had it for three years and he 

2221
01:42:51,441 --> 01:42:53,260
had it for a full year where he was 
undying.

2222
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:56,070
Steven kotler it a full year where,
who's undiagnosed?

2223
01:42:56,071 --> 01:42:58,050
And his body just was ravaged

2224
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,050
by this stuff.
Well,

2225
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,960
I used to do write a lot about 
morgellons,

2226
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:06,230
which is related to lyme disease.
And one of the reasons I stopped doing 

2227
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:09,201
it was the,
it's such a personal thing for the 

2228
01:43:09,201 --> 01:43:09,201
people involved,
uh,

2229
01:43:09,201 --> 01:43:12,690
and I just really wasn't comfortable 
like calling them liars.

2230
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:14,790
Not that,
but just trying to,

2231
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:19,970
trying to figure out what's really going
on and raising possibilities that it 

2232
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:23,391
might not be like these bugs living 
under their skin because they just get 

2233
01:43:23,391 --> 01:43:24,320
very upset and you,
you really,

2234
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:27,510
you weren't reaching a lot of them.
So eventually I stopped that and I moved

2235
01:43:27,511 --> 01:43:32,511
on to chem trails,
which I thought would be a more 

2236
01:43:32,511 --> 01:43:33,230
reasonable people involved.
But uh,

2237
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:37,370
it's another one where people or 
initially invested in that idea.

2238
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:39,590
And then once they become initially 
invested,

2239
01:43:39,591 --> 01:43:41,960
it's so hard to shake them off.
It's so hard.

2240
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,850
They just are absolutely convinced that 
the government is spraying things.

2241
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:49,851
So yeah,
I had a conversation with a friend of 

2242
01:43:49,851 --> 01:43:49,851
mine.
I was like,

2243
01:43:49,851 --> 01:43:50,990
dad has got to be the most ineffective 
use of money ever.

2244
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:53,840
like they're spraying things and what 
the fuck has changed?

2245
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:55,310
Nothing.
Nothing's changed.

2246
01:43:55,730 --> 01:44:00,730
They're spending all this money spraying
things in the sky that just happened to 

2247
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:01,400
look like clouds,
but yet we know that you can make clouds

2248
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:04,550
with a jet engine and a certain amount 
of condensation in the atmosphere.

2249
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:06,620
The heat of the jet engine causes 
clouds.

2250
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:08,570
Like we know that,
but they don't think that's what

2251
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:09,150
it is.
Yeah.

2252
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:14,490
Yeah.
This is established science established 

2253
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:14,490
nine.
Well,

2254
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:14,490
like,
you know,

2255
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:18,471
the flood earth is just steadily.
The lack of flatness of the earth is 

2256
01:44:18,471 --> 01:44:20,220
established science that's been going on
for a real long time.

2257
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:25,670
Uh,
and people just pick and choose which 

2258
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:26,760
science they went to to you.
What keeps you going with all this stuff

2259
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,440
for the running metal bunk?
Well,

2260
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:33,450
I,
I enjoy like doing this little little 

2261
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:33,450
experiments.
Uh,

2262
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:33,450
I do a lot of stuff like,
you know,

2263
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:35,280
going into my backyard and testing 
things out,

2264
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,410
uh,
like a lot of this stuff you,

2265
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,630
there's pictures of ufo was and things 
like that and you can,

2266
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,330
you can duplicate them because some of 
them are like,

2267
01:44:42,130 --> 01:44:44,490
like reflections or things in the 
canberra and yoU can go out and say,

2268
01:44:44,491 --> 01:44:45,360
well,
this did this.

2269
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:50,780
Or people are saying that certain 
photograph is a indication that it's 

2270
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:51,780
false or these shadows go this way.
You know,

2271
01:44:51,781 --> 01:44:54,480
the moon landing has lots of fake shadow
claims made about it.

2272
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:58,050
What do you think happened at roswell,
New Mexico?

2273
01:44:58,051 --> 01:45:00,260
the one that's the big one,
July,

2274
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,390
1947.
A ufo crash.

2275
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:02,570
Yeah.
I think it's what the,

2276
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,810
what it said it was,
it was,

2277
01:45:03,811 --> 01:45:05,250
uh,
that uh,

2278
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:10,550
those balloons that they were using to 
detect a russian nuclear bombs in the 

2279
01:45:10,681 --> 01:45:15,681
atmosphere.
And it was a secret program so they 

2280
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:15,681
weren't allowed to tell anybody about 
it.

2281
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:19,550
So they came in,
they picked up the remains of the 

2282
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:19,550
balloon and then the story just took 
off.

2283
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:21,740
That's a funnY one though.
Boy,

2284
01:45:21,741 --> 01:45:23,300
that's,
that's made a whole town.

2285
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:25,190
Yeah.
Famous for ufo,

2286
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:29,180
if you go there noW,
they have like alien themed gift shop,

2287
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,900
so the milking it and it's like you said
earlier,

2288
01:45:30,901 --> 01:45:35,901
like people make money out of something 
and then they get stuck into that just 

2289
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:40,090
because they're making money out of it.
They're motivated to promote whatever it

2290
01:45:40,291 --> 01:45:42,030
is,
a big foot or if it's aliens.

2291
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:47,330
Have you ever seen anything and all of 
your years of trying to debunk these 

2292
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:50,130
things that made you question whether or
not this was a legitimate phenomena,

2293
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,990
the chem trail,
anything?

2294
01:45:51,991 --> 01:45:52,830
Anything,
anything.

2295
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:55,730
Bufo chem trail thing.
It's like with ufo.

2296
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,510
There's all things that you can't 
explain.

2297
01:45:57,511 --> 01:46:02,511
There are things that are identified,
but there are usually plausible 

2298
01:46:02,511 --> 01:46:03,980
explanations for them.
I like to,

2299
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:06,300
whenever I'm given something that can be
mysterious thing,

2300
01:46:06,301 --> 01:46:11,301
I like to list all the explanations that
I can think of and maybe none of them 

2301
01:46:11,301 --> 01:46:16,101
are a perfect fix that fits that you can
guarantee this is what the explanation 

2302
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:19,701
is,
but like it being like a ghost or an 

2303
01:46:19,701 --> 01:46:20,670
alien spacecraft as an explanation is 
usually pretty close to the bottom.

2304
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:21,780
Like you started out saying,
oh,

2305
01:46:21,781 --> 01:46:26,781
it's a balloon or a bird,
or it's a drone or at cgi or it's 

2306
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,420
something,
something somebody faked afterWards,

2307
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,960
or it's an alien spacecraft or in 
between that like always something else 

2308
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:39,981
that we don't know what it is.
Is there any evidence like in terms of 

2309
01:46:39,981 --> 01:46:40,380
ufo?
That's interesting.

2310
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,710
I haven't to be honest,
I haven't really looked into the,

2311
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:47,730
the whole sphere of ufo biology.
Uh,

2312
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:52,770
I know a lot of people have,
but just looking at the quality of the 

2313
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:54,600
best cases they put forward.
Like I mentioned earlier,

2314
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:56,940
like you know,
some guy in 1964,

2315
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:02,360
like got his car beat up on a road a,
these are like the top 10 best cases.

2316
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:04,680
And this was like number two or 
something.

2317
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:05,500
What about bob?
LiZ,

2318
01:47:05,501 --> 01:47:10,501
are you ever looking at that guy and ah,
which was he as the guy who supposedly 

2319
01:47:10,501 --> 01:47:15,320
know,
supposedly worked at area 51 and became 

2320
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:15,320
a whistle blower.

2321
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,020
no,
I haven't,

2322
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:19,350
but a lot.
It's something You see.

2323
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:25,260
And the nine slash 11 community is.
and in the chem trail community is 

2324
01:47:25,771 --> 01:47:28,960
people kind of becoming celebrities.
Yeah.

2325
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,820
And then they kind of start going on 
road shows and you know,

2326
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:37,070
they go to conventions and they speak 
and then they write books and then they 

2327
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:38,440
start doing things and they,
they get sucked into the,

2328
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,540
the,
the beliefs.

2329
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:44,720
And there's been lots of examples in the
past of people who made claims like 

2330
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:45,180
this.
And then eventually,

2331
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:46,270
uh,
you know,

2332
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:47,410
owned up to it,
you know,

2333
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:52,420
the classic one really classic one is 
the cost tingly fair is where these 

2334
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,650
girls and continually england sound I 
went to school in,

2335
01:47:55,651 --> 01:47:59,430
but it's still world famous thing,
a fake these photographs of fairies.

2336
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And they,
they convinced a large number of people 

2337
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,000
in including,
like arthur conan doyle,

2338
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,600
a really guy wrote tarzan.

2339
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,020
Yeah.
He believed in fairies.

2340
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:09,120
Well,
no,

2341
01:48:09,121 --> 01:48:13,280
the guy who wrote sherlock holmes did 
arthUr conan doyle,

2342
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:18,320
right.
Turns out that was a william burroughs 

2343
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:18,320
and I went,
no,

2344
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:18,480
no,
someone else.

2345
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:21,300
Anyway,
but they look at that.

2346
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:26,270
They stuck to that.
So they obviously fake out of a magazine

2347
01:48:26,271 --> 01:48:28,280
or something.
Uh,

2348
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:33,710
and then they owned up like basically on
their deathbeds live 70 years later.

2349
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:39,700
But they were,
they were milking it because once they 

2350
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,800
get into it is embarrassing to admit 
that you made something up,

2351
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,750
plus you're getting all this attention.
Right.

2352
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:46,800
And in some cases you're getting money.
I don't know if they get any money and I

2353
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:48,880
wonder how many people were so duped by 
that,

2354
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:53,890
that changed their life and they started
looking for ferries and wasting their 

2355
01:48:53,890 --> 01:48:53,890
time when I was growing up.
That was,

2356
01:48:53,890 --> 01:48:56,400
that was put out as being a genuine 
fairy citing.

2357
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:57,420
Really?
Yeah.

2358
01:48:58,410 --> 01:48:59,630
And you believe it?
Pull them?

2359
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,430
No.
Well I probably did when I was like,

2360
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:02,610
you know,
13.

2361
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:08,060
Oh six people.
People get sucked in and they become 

2362
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:10,840
celebrities.
Uh,

2363
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:13,290
and then they like,
there it is.

2364
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:19,350
Yeah.
Tna reveals the fIrst time letter which 

2365
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:21,680
ended the cotton hundley pleasingly 
here.

2366
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:22,950
Emily hoax.
Yeah.

2367
01:49:22,951 --> 01:49:24,230
I went to school,
just retail,

2368
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:27,570
just behind the house.
So for 70 years this lady kept lie.

2369
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:31,200
Yeah.
there was two of them I think what bitch

2370
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:36,230
and people like that in the ufo 
community who like made up stories of 

2371
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:40,140
abductions and things.
And then later the stories either become

2372
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,560
so ridiculous and contradictory.
You know that they were lying.

2373
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:48,740
There's a wonderful one from this guy 
from the 19 fifties where it's a great 

2374
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:48,740
old black

2375
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:53,160
and white footage and they talked to him
about his ufo experiences and all the 

2376
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:57,181
different aliens that he communicates 
with and he just seems so obviously 

2377
01:49:57,181 --> 01:50:01,261
crazy and yet this was heralded as one 
of the most important cases of ufr log 

2378
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,700
and you know,
the guy I'm talking about,

2379
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:08,730
I forget the guy's now as many.
There was a thing called hubcaps and 

2380
01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:09,250
shit.
The montauk chronicles,

2381
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:12,530
which I think you would do the segments 
on that.

2382
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:17,610
it was like an island where they have an
underground thing where they really 

2383
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:21,580
meant to be experimenting on children.
Plum island wasn't plum island.

2384
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,230
Anyway,
there was,

2385
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:26,680
there was something like that.
This guy basically said he had all these

2386
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:29,360
remembered memories of working on this 
secret government base.

2387
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:31,690
Uh,
and he became like pretty famous.

2388
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:36,691
You'd read loads of books,
but I think he might have just been a 

2389
01:50:36,691 --> 01:50:36,691
bit crazy.

2390
01:50:36,691 --> 01:50:36,691
But.
well,

2391
01:50:36,691 --> 01:50:38,200
there's a lot of that out there for 
sure.

2392
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:42,670
Is there anything else in your pile of 
notes over there to get people to?

2393
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:47,940
I think the thing I would really 
encourage people to do is look closely 

2394
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:51,130
at things like it's really hard to do,
but if people who are on the fence,

2395
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:56,600
they they need to look very,
very closely at the claims that people 

2396
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,940
are making claims that the bay is 
making.

2397
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:00,100
If eric debase say something like,
you know,

2398
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:04,540
the horizon always rises to eye level.
This is something you can actually check

2399
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:09,930
and it's not easy.
He got to be reasonably careful with us 

2400
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:13,290
$2 level,
but you can actually check to see 

2401
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:15,751
whether that is correct.
You can check for yourself if something 

2402
01:51:15,751 --> 01:51:20,461
reappears over the horizon when you zoom
in and which is something that he 

2403
01:51:20,461 --> 01:51:24,121
claimed,
something that as ridiculous claim that 

2404
01:51:24,121 --> 01:51:26,761
has been made for like over a hundred 
years that when things move away from 

2405
01:51:26,761 --> 01:51:28,120
you,
they disappear from the bottom up and if

2406
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:29,470
you zoom in,
they will reappear.

2407
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:31,980
He doesn't actually happen.
When you zoom in on something,

2408
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:33,360
all it does is it makes the picture 
bigger.

2409
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:36,040
It makes the image bigger and you can 
check this for yourself.

2410
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:41,041
You can go down to santa monica pier,
you can focus on like the north shore 

2411
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:46,201
like malibu,
and you can zoom in and you can see the 

2412
01:51:46,201 --> 01:51:49,380
picture does not change at all 
throughout the entire zone and when 

2413
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:49,900
you're fully zoomed in so you can see 
the cars whizzing along,

2414
01:51:49,901 --> 01:51:53,190
pca,
you will see that the bottom part of,

2415
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:53,810
uh,
of,

2416
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:58,940
of the road is,
and the buildings are obscured and you 

2417
01:51:58,940 --> 01:51:59,290
can do it with catalina.
You can turn around and look at catalina

2418
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:04,291
and you can zoom in on that and you can 
see that two thirds of catalina island 

2419
01:52:04,291 --> 01:52:08,611
is missing.
I think a lot of what you're saying is 

2420
01:52:08,611 --> 01:52:10,540
very important because what we're 
talking about is just being able to look

2421
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:15,541
at things objectively and use facts to 
determine that this one theory in 

2422
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:20,311
particular flatter theory is not true.
But I think what's really going on is 

2423
01:52:20,311 --> 01:52:23,770
the thought process.
There is a way the human mind gravitates

2424
01:52:23,771 --> 01:52:26,680
towards these puzzles and these problems
and these,

2425
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:29,990
these undiscovered truths,
these,

2426
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:34,540
these mysteries that people just want to
be the person that knows they want to be

2427
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:39,541
in the know and it's very intoxicating 
and that's what really this stuff's all 

2428
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:44,791
about more than anything.
It's about the way the mind works and 

2429
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:45,680
about the way your mind can be tricked

2430
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
and it's an information issue that we're
dealing with today with things like 

2431
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,700
youtube where no one can stop you from 
making like you don't have to go through

2432
01:52:52,701 --> 01:52:55,430
the people that work at nbc or fox or 
whatever.

2433
01:52:55,610 --> 01:53:00,610
You'd have to go through the wall street
journal or the New York times editorial 

2434
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:01,460
board where they have to review your 
paper and go,

2435
01:53:01,461 --> 01:53:02,510
hey,
you wrote a bunch of stuff.

2436
01:53:02,511 --> 01:53:05,360
ThAt's not true.
That doesn't have to happen anYmore.

2437
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:10,690
Now you can just make a video and it can
be really well done with good music and 

2438
01:53:10,911 --> 01:53:15,911
good images and the way it's done can 
really influence a lot of people who 

2439
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:21,161
don't have a background in science or 
not curious about looking into the 

2440
01:53:21,161 --> 01:53:21,960
debunking version.
Of it,

2441
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,830
whenever,
when someone sends me something,

2442
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:30,160
I always say,
just google that whatever you sent me 

2443
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:31,250
and then debunked,
just do that first and then look at both

2444
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:32,360
sides,
you know?

2445
01:53:32,361 --> 01:53:34,940
But people don't want that.
debunk that debunks not sexy.

2446
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:37,060
Yeah.
That's pretty sexy.

2447
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:40,230
I know people are turned off by the 
debunking thing.

2448
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,260
I hate it.
Yeah,

2449
01:53:41,261 --> 01:53:44,560
and that's why I do tell people to go do
their own research,

2450
01:53:44,561 --> 01:53:49,561
but really actually do some real 
research as in do some actual 

2451
01:53:49,561 --> 01:53:50,380
observations and experiment.
Boring.

2452
01:53:50,410 --> 01:53:52,330
Youtube videos are fun.
You know,

2453
01:53:52,331 --> 01:53:54,540
you watch a youtube video about 
dinosaurs being faked.

2454
01:53:54,541 --> 01:53:56,090
That's fun.
What?

2455
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:57,640
They're fake.
I can't believe it.

2456
01:53:57,641 --> 01:54:00,490
They fucking got me.
Just like watching a youtube video about

2457
01:54:00,491 --> 01:54:05,491
roswell rods or any of these other silly
things and kind of excited about the 

2458
01:54:05,491 --> 01:54:09,331
eclipse.
I think that's an opportunity to get 

2459
01:54:09,331 --> 01:54:10,750
people excited about a scientist though.
Not thinking like a loon.

2460
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:12,970
I know like I get excited about the 
eclipse,

2461
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:14,280
but not everyone does.
Well,

2462
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,550
it's exciting.
It is exciting.

2463
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,870
It's pretty rare.
Solar eclipse.

2464
01:54:16,930 --> 01:54:18,960
The moon is going to come of the sun.
Yeah.

2465
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:20,080
Get your camera.
What does that happen?

2466
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:21,820
Check it.
August 21st.

2467
01:54:22,570 --> 01:54:27,570
It's going to be totality in Oregon,
but you had to see it from all of a lot 

2468
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:29,020
of people going to go to Oregon just to 
see it.

2469
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:29,920
Yeah,
I'm going to Oregon.

2470
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,000
Are you?
Wow.

2471
01:54:31,001 --> 01:54:32,920
Look at you.
You don't fuck around type relative.

2472
01:54:32,921 --> 01:54:37,921
So it an excuse.
They're going to try to schedule some 

2473
01:54:37,921 --> 01:54:38,890
sort of a dinner time.
They,

2474
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,690
we're going to be out of the campsite.
Yeah.

2475
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,560
Looking at the eclipse.
um,

2476
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,600
anything else?

2477
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:47,370
And I saw the same.
oh,

2478
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:49,170
uh,
uh,

2479
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:54,910
and it's kind of complicated,
but let me just run right by you real 

2480
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:54,910
quick.
maps,

2481
01:54:54,910 --> 01:54:54,910
maps,
maps,

2482
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:57,340
and you hit the maketa projection.
No,

2483
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:01,120
the standard map that you see in school 
rooms has this really stretched out.

2484
01:55:01,121 --> 01:55:03,280
Iceland,
greenland,

2485
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:05,980
it looks like kind of distorted.
It's not like the real world.

2486
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:11,360
And the reason that we use these maps,
this particular type of map is that if 

2487
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,400
you draw a line between two points on 
the map,

2488
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:15,190
uh,
and then you sail along that heading,

2489
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:19,030
you will end up at that point.
Now this,

2490
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:24,080
uh,
this is a type of navigation called a 

2491
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,480
rum line navigation that's been used for
like hundreds of years,

2492
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:31,050
and the thing is that the map,
the makeda matt gets stretched out to 

2493
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:34,501
the top but also get stretched out at 
the bottom because the navigators have 

2494
01:55:34,501 --> 01:55:38,880
from hundreds of years ago knew that the
world was round and that they knew if 

2495
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,751
they drew a line between two points in 
the southern hemisphere using the same 

2496
01:55:42,751 --> 01:55:45,641
map,
it would get you to that destination 

2497
01:55:45,641 --> 01:55:48,741
using rum navigation,
which is basically just one more piece 

2498
01:55:50,161 --> 01:55:51,000
of evidence.

2499
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:56,210
That's the actual,
the global map matches reality because 

2500
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:59,220
people have used rum navigation for 
hundreds of years,

2501
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:04,221
if not thousands of years.
So you're saying that the image of the 

2502
01:56:04,221 --> 01:56:04,221
continents is in some way stretched out 
and distorted?

2503
01:56:04,221 --> 01:56:04,470
Yeah.
Well,

2504
01:56:04,471 --> 01:56:05,790
if you take a glider,
they do that.

2505
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:07,620
We will.
If you take a globe and like just,

2506
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,200
you can't just put it onto a flat 
surface,

2507
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:15,340
right?
Because you're gonna have to distort it 

2508
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:15,340
somehow.
Uh,

2509
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:15,550
so there's various different ways people
use of,

2510
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,000
of,
of putting it on,

2511
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:18,390
on the surface.
You could just take,

2512
01:56:18,391 --> 01:56:20,220
you know,
you love to do to longitude and just map

2513
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:22,470
it into a rectangle and that,
that works out fairly well.

2514
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:25,440
that's a nice thing that's called 
equirectangular map,

2515
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:28,350
but the most common map that was used 
like before,

2516
01:56:28,351 --> 01:56:31,770
like say 30 years ago was this maketa 
projection,

2517
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:34,260
which is the map that people use.

2518
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:39,300
Navigating ship routes.
So you can get from point a to b if you 

2519
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,430
wanted to go from england to,
uh,

2520
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:43,980
you know,
north America across the ocean,

2521
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:47,370
you just draw a line between the two 
points and then you say,

2522
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,590
oh,
that's the heading I've got to go in.

2523
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:53,610
And so you head off in that heading.
Now that doesn't take you in a straight 

2524
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:56,811
line.
It actually takes you into kind of a 

2525
01:56:56,811 --> 01:56:59,301
curved line because if you,
if you're going on a constant compass 

2526
01:56:59,301 --> 01:57:03,711
heading on a globe,
you actually kind of curve in towards 

2527
01:57:03,711 --> 01:57:04,350
the poles or away from the pole 
depending which way you're going.

2528
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:05,820
I really don't understand what you're 
saying,

2529
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:12,530
but all it is,
is that this method of navigation that 

2530
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:13,800
people use that relies upon the earth 
being a globe.

2531
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:18,860
And it's this really,
really simple map that is in thousands 

2532
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:21,681
of homes,
millions of homes and schools that 

2533
01:57:21,681 --> 01:57:21,681
everybody uses,
and you can see that on the map,

2534
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:24,930
the lines get smaller towards the top 
and it gets more towards the bottom.

2535
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:26,220
And if people are doing,
uh,

2536
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:31,340
a voyage around the world,
they're going to use this map and it 

2537
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:34,701
only works on,
it works on there around the globe 

2538
01:57:34,701 --> 01:57:34,701
world.
That's another issue too.

2539
01:57:34,701 --> 01:57:35,250
People have circumnavigated the globe.
Yeah.

2540
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,500
Well they think they do sail around the 
outside,

2541
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,350
which of course would take a lot longer.
Uh,

2542
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:45,400
that's another thing like the Australia.
Have you seen Australia on the flood 

2543
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:48,471
earth map?
It's like a no on the image that was up 

2544
01:57:48,691 --> 01:57:50,160
earlier.
It's like this kind of squish thing,

2545
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:55,161
you know,
where to Australia it looks like it's 

2546
01:57:55,161 --> 01:57:55,161
more or less like,
this looks like it's kind of like this,

2547
01:57:55,161 --> 01:57:59,871
it's all stretched out.
It's like twice as long and half as 

2548
01:57:59,871 --> 01:57:59,871
wide.
Have you seen the theory,

2549
01:57:59,871 --> 01:58:01,290
the conspiracy theory that Australia is 
scooby doo a?

2550
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:03,510
No.
Give it to his head.

2551
01:58:03,570 --> 01:58:04,470
Yes.
Yeah,

2552
01:58:05,090 --> 01:58:06,360
I can say that it's just a joke.

2553
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:07,380
Italy as a boot.
Yeah.

2554
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:09,390
They just.
It's one of those joke names.

2555
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:13,620
The distances between places in 
Australia don't work.

2556
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:15,500
Is that the flatter?
Yeah.

2557
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:17,390
that's the flat earth map and that's 
Australia and Australia.

2558
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:22,460
It looks nothing like that and if you 
live in Australia you would know it 

2559
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,580
looks nothing at all like that.
It's just hilarious that there's so many

2560
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:28,581
versions of this similarity.
There's so many people who've taken the 

2561
01:58:28,581 --> 01:58:31,881
time in front of a computer to create 
this flat earth map and put this ice 

2562
01:58:31,881 --> 01:58:34,200
wall and the idea that.
How do they know?

2563
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:35,700
It's a nice wall.
Like where?

2564
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:40,970
Where's the pictures?
There's pictures of ice shelves from 

2565
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:45,560
antarctica,
so they think that that's the whole 

2566
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:45,560
wall.
I think that's the wool.

2567
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:45,650
Yeah,
so that you'll see memes like,

2568
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:47,740
yeah,
globally what?

2569
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:51,520
Flat ice wall and they'd be like this 
and they show you.

2570
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:55,320
they suck on an ice shelf,
which is like 200 feet high.

2571
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:57,250
What'd you could fly over?
That's the mentality,

2572
01:58:57,251 --> 01:59:02,251
right?
It's a bunch of little kids or a bunch 

2573
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:02,251
of dumb people or a bunch of people that
have very little education or a bunch of

2574
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:04,990
people that are also speaking.
They're preaching to the choir.

2575
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:08,440
It ties into like a misconception.
Is that a natural,

2576
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,380
like a funny thing like when I worked in
the video game industry,

2577
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:16,860
there was a platform games.
You jumped from little platforms and 

2578
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:19,240
some of the times the platforms and move
around and like mario type things,

2579
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:19,850
right?
Uh,

2580
01:59:19,890 --> 01:59:24,890
in some video games when you jump up on 
a moving platform and then jumped down 

2581
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:29,330
and fall down,
you will fall down because the platform 

2582
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:32,551
moves out from underneath you.
Sometimes you jump up and you move with 

2583
01:59:32,551 --> 01:59:32,551
the platform and you land on it.

2584
01:59:32,551 --> 01:59:37,240
It depends on what the program did.
Right now a friend of mine was doing a 

2585
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:39,910
video game and I wanted the program and 
said like,

2586
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:41,470
oh,
he jumped up and then jump down.

2587
01:59:41,471 --> 01:59:43,210
The platform should have moved out from 
underneath you.

2588
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,250
So you should be able to like,
hey,

2589
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,570
you should be able to,
uh,

2590
01:59:47,690 --> 01:59:52,690
you know,
this is the way we should program the 

2591
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:52,690
physics.
And then my friend matt said,

2592
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:52,690
no,
that's wrong.

2593
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:54,640
And uh,
he couldn't convince this other guy.

2594
01:59:54,641 --> 01:59:56,320
So eventually what happened?
He says,

2595
01:59:56,321 --> 01:59:57,880
right,
what we're going to do is we're going to

2596
01:59:57,881 --> 02:00:01,240
go out onto the road with my pickup,
my pickup truck,

2597
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:04,240
I'm going to get in the back and you're 
going to drive along at 30 miles an hour

2598
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:09,650
and I'm going to jump straight up in the
air and we're going to see whether I 

2599
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:10,600
land in the truck or a land on the road.

2600
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:16,320
So they did this experiment and the guy,
the other guy who was driving the truck 

2601
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,871
was totally expecting him to like jump 
up and pull out the back of the truck 

2602
02:00:18,871 --> 02:00:21,961
because the truck went and moved on 
because he's moving the same speed as 

2603
02:00:21,961 --> 02:00:22,330
the truck.
So he jumps up and then he lands back in

2604
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:24,290
the tRuck.
And this,

2605
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:29,420
that.
This is illustrating that this video 

2606
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:31,801
game program,
I had the exact same misconception that 

2607
02:00:31,801 --> 02:00:31,801
the flat earth is due because they say,
well,

2608
02:00:31,801 --> 02:00:36,481
what if the earth is moving so fast?
Why can't you just go up in a 

2609
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:36,481
helicopter,
hover a bit,

2610
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:36,970
wait for the earth to move underneath 
you,

2611
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:39,460
and then go back down again.
It's just,

2612
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:44,520
you know,
it's completely backwards physics 

2613
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,171
because you are already moving,
so you'd have to slow down to zero a 

2614
02:00:46,171 --> 02:00:47,710
which is the same as speeding up and 
relatively speaking.

2615
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:49,350
So,
uh,

2616
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:54,340
the point is that anyone can make 
misconceptions about physics like that.

2617
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:59,500
Yeah.
And it's easy to get sucked into that 

2618
02:00:59,500 --> 02:00:59,520
and it's actually quite hard to break 
them even play.

2619
02:00:59,521 --> 02:01:01,820
This is reasonable guy.
It was like a video game program,

2620
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:04,060
but who presumably knew something about 
physics.

2621
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:09,420
He was convinced that matt was going to 
fall out to the back of the truck and 

2622
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,780
quite possibly die,
but he still didn't do the experiment.

2623
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:15,930
Well,
let's end it on that because this is 

2624
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:15,930
literally hurting my brain,
right?

2625
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:17,290
But what you're doing is very important 
and I really want to thank you.

2626
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,060
Thank you.
Your website is very important.

2627
02:01:19,061 --> 02:01:24,061
It's very important for people who are 
curious and concerned and don't 

2628
02:01:24,061 --> 02:01:24,910
understand the physics and the logic and
the science behind it all,

2629
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:27,460
but I've.
I've sent your site to many,

2630
02:01:27,461 --> 02:01:31,840
many people that believed or don't 
believe and we're trying to figure out a

2631
02:01:31,841 --> 02:01:34,060
way to explain it,
so thank you.

2632
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:34,990
Thank you.
Thank you.

2633
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:36,940
Thanks for being.
All right folks,

2634
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:38,480
that's it for the week.
Syria.
