1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,483
You don't feel,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,140
oh,

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,690
it is filming.

4
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,590
You're filming right now,

5
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:06,510
but you are online.

6
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:06,871
Eddie,

7
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:08,520
if this is real,

8
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,510
this is live.

9
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm nervous now,

10
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,130
whenever we're live in your heart skips
a beat thinking it's people listening to

11
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:17,964
this shit.

12
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,880
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,350
You know all about it.

14
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:22,741
By now.

15
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,150
If you tune into this podcast,

16
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,170
if you don't know about it,

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,670
it looks like a flashlight,

18
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,840
but you can fuck it.

19
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:28,711
John.

20
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,060
Half Ron had the best line.

21
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:30,780
He said,

22
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,320
it's great they should incorporate it
with a flashlight because nobody ever

23
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,580
knows where the flashlight is,

24
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,000
but everybody knows where their
fleshlight is and he's so right.

25
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,863
It's so true.

26
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,200
It's a genius analysis by Mr Half.

27
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:43,440
Ron,

28
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,760
a fine comedian.

29
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,080
Follow him on Twitter.

37
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,260
All right.

38
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,770
How much?

39
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,030
15% God damn.

40
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:57,570
Are you serious?

41
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:57,841
Yes,

42
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:58,470
I am.

43
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,040
Go.

44
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,120
This is the tipping point.

45
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:01,800
This is it's time to make the decision.

46
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,530
John Heffrons been in in my,

47
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:03,721

00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:04,580
where the fuck is that dude?

49
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:05,310
It's been on the road for like,

50
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,143
he's 32.

51
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,373
He's an animal.

52
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,570
He's,

53
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,040
he's somewhere doing pushups
in the fucking parking lot.

54
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:11,911
Uh,

55

immune Alpha brain being the most
famous and also the most controversial.

64
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,260
It is a cognitive enhancing supplement,

65
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,100
a nootropic.

66
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,040
If you go online and Google nootropic,

67
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,630
that's and o,

68

O,

71
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,194
you could spell the rest.

72
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,130
It's a,

73
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,560
uh,

74
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,570
they're what they are as vitamins that
have been shown to improve your body's

75
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,260
ability to produce neuro transmitters
that don't make you smarter if you're

76
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:40,651
stupid,

77
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,570
but they do enhance the
way your brain works.

78
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,590
I use them,

79
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,880
I believe in them and we have a 100%
money back guarantee on your first order.

80
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,460
If you were to 30 pills
and you don't like it,

81
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:51,780
you don't even have to return the product.

82
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,580
We're not trying to rip anybody off.

83
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:57,030
This is all stuff that before
we were selling in this,

84
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,520
I used all of it and I used
all of it cause it works.

85
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,570
I'm a big believer in
vitamins and supplements and
I'm a big believer in that.

86
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,570
What you take into your body affects
the way your brain works for sure.

87
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,500
Um,

88
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,151
puts you brains.

89
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:08,984
Yeah you do.

90
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,620
He's taken a lot of pussy in your body.

91
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,233
How you doing that?

92
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:12,941
Really Long.

93
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,190
Something creepy about singing,

94
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,440
eating pussy like age.

95
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,610
I'm thinking of chewing and swallowing.

96
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,420
It's something you know a girl can
suck a cock and that's totally right.

97
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,160
When you're eating pussy it's like,

98
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,450
it just sounds like you're chewing,

99
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,500
especially when it's like a fat guy and
you think of him like being hungry and

100
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,970
he's eating pussy and he's just like,

101
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,760
you think he's just going
to take a bite out of it.

102
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,800
I wonder if like if he really ate pussy,

103
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,570
if it was like the most delicious piece of

104
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:38,570
bolts,

105
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,560
probably print a tender season.

106
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,930
You'd have to make sure you
didn't cook it very fast.

107
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,130
He like salt and vinegar.

108
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:44,910
Potato chips.

109
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,380
You would have to be like a searing,

110
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,650
just black and blue it.

111
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,780
Yeah.

112
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,320
I found out about blue sticks this
weekend in Atlanta for the first time.

113
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,430
How do you order at a restaurant?

114
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:53,790
And they,

115
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,760
there was rare and then it
said blue and I was like,

116
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,960
what the fuck is blue?

117
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,500
So this is the coolest shit ever.

118
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,700
I tweet Anthony Bordain and Anthony
Bordain tweets me the answer.

119
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,534
I'm like,

120
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,680
wait a minute.

121
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:05,930
I'm like,

122
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,050
how great is this world that we live in?

123
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,570
Yeah.

124
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:08,850
What?

125
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,910
What was the steak place?

126
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,850
So it was twice in the
four seasons in Atlanta.

127
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,661
I don't remember the name.

128
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,920
I know it or no,

129
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,310
wait,

130
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,180
is it chop?

131
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,343
I don't remember.

132
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,451
I don't remember.

133
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:19,180
But he's really good.

134
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,811
He's placed in Atlanta.

135
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,190
You've got to be a member to get in.

136
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,560
Oh,

137
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,010
cheese.

138
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,590
And it's got like at the restaurant,

139
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,700
but then there's a member's room.

140
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,440
It's the best steak I've
ever had my whole life.

141
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,250
Anyway,

142
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,600
this is the end of the commercial.

143
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,341
We always do this,

144
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:30,521
don't,

145
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:30,761
oh,

146
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,380
sorry.

147
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,900
No,

148
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,650
don't apologize.

149
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,020
This is every single week we do it.

150
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,810
The the,

151
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,170
yes,

152
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,800
do it.

153
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,850
We try not to make our commercials too
commercially and in the process they

154
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,780
become conversations about shit sometimes
like eating pussy and the best take in

155
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,230
Atlanta,

156
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:44,680
but I,

157
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,420
but I still want to take the product now.

158
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,680
It's good stuff.

159
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,620
I'll get it for you on
a.com go check it out.

160
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,130
And again,

161
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,930
if you order something you don't like it,

162
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,940
you don't have to even return the product.

163
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,670
We are absolutely not
trying to rip anybody off.

164
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Everything we're selling is the highest
level ingredients that are possible to

165
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,240
acquire.

166
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,950
It's the best stuff we know how to make.

167
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,551
It's real.

168
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,300
I use it.

169
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,420
Go check it out on and.com and enter
in the code named Brogan and you'd get

170
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,520
yourself 10% off any and all orders,

171
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,420
not just the first one.

172
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:13,931
All right.

173
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,280
You dirty fucking bitches

174
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,770
experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.

175
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,560
Nick Diaz is will always be the greatest.

176
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,900
Shout out the Roivant.

177
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,400
Donald wanted people who were
criticizing it and like you crazy bitch.

178
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,920
That's Rory Macdonald
talking about my podcast.

179
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,070
That must stay in,

180
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,290
but Nick Diaz just nailed it.

181
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,330
Train by day.

182
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,600
Joe Rogan podcast.

183
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,000
I always wondered who that was.

184
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,220
Nick motherfucking is

185
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,080
my favorite fighter to ever
test positive for weed,

186
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,703
but a good guy

187
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,240
fucking so stupid.

188
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,821
Not only that,

189
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:54,710
he didn't even really
test positive for wheat.

190
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,890
He tested positive for
an inactive metabolite.

191
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,870
It's not a psychoactive,

192
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,410
it's evidence that some cannabis
has been in this system,

193
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,480
but it's not evidence of marijuana.

194
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,030
It's evidence of an inactive metabolite.

195
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:08,864
That's all it is.

196
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,470
So it does.

197
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,930
You could have taken
this inactive metabolite,

198
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:15,860
which isn't even prevented or a
prohibited by the Nevada State Athletic

199
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:16,250
Commission.

200
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,810
So why so it didn't matter.

201
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:18,411
It's also be,

202
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,660
besides the possibility
of taking it that way,

203
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:21,950
you can also get some,

204
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,380
you can,

205
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,551
no,

206
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:22,631
no,

207
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:22,760
no.

208
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,990
You can get it from marijuana.

209
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,280
It's not a masking issue.

210
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,900
I think it's a flushing issue.

211
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,120
I don't think you can
mask marijuana approved.

212
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:29,540
I mean,

213
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,410
I know you're out there.

214
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:31,430
There's something that can tell me,

215
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,660
but I'm saying why would that,

216
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:34,610
that's not a performance enhancing drug.

217
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:34,911
Well,

218
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,640
it's a PR somehow or another.

219
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,461
What they're saying.

220
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,430
I believe if I understand
the legal language,

221
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,990
I think what they're saying is that the
metabolites shows that he has had it in

222
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:45,824
his system.

223
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,060
But what's really crazy is it's so
stupid because they know he's a patient.

224
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,640
He's a medical marijuana
patient in California,

225
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,190
and if you don't know that
Nick Diaz smokes weed,

226
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,750
Jesus Christ,

227
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,040
are you paying attention at

228
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,640
all?

229
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,810
You don't know he smokes weed.

230
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,620
So what?

231
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,410
It's okay if he stops 13 days,

232
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,240
but not 1211 days,

233
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,800
but not ten nine days,

234
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,391
but not age.

235
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,450
Shut the fuck up.

236
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,410
It's fucking stupid.

237
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,220
You know why?

238
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,090
Because what you're talking about is
not him being high inside the octagon.

239
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,590
The psychoactive effects of marijuana
don't exist when he's in that octagon

240
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:18,890
with,

241
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,671
with those levels,

242
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,570
it's impossible.

243
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,980
So he's 100% sober.

244
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,330
That should be the question.

245
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,450
You know he was taking it before
that because he's got a card.

246
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,410
So when is it?

247
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,150
Where's this logical cutoffs?

248
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,060
That's crazy.

249
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,530
Like the HGH thing,

250
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:34,690
you know the NFL is trying to good luck.

251
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:34,891
Yeah,

252
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:35,910
it's so fucking crazy.

253
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,850
I've been reading so much about it because
I do a podcast called Wad cast about

254
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:40,620
crossfit.

255
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,990
Oh Dude.

256
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,261
Yeah.

257
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:44,910
And across the place just opened up
like 10 miles away from their opening

258
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,960
fucking bathrooms at Starbucks.

259
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,040
They're everywhere.

260
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,240
But they,

261
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,230
their tests,

262
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,550
they say they tested the games and like
68,000 people tried out for the games

263
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:55,100
this year.

264
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,540
Right.

265
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,373
And uh,

266
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,251
these guys,

267
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,560
like if you look at the guys
that are the top crossfitters,

268
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,780
some people say they don't use,

269
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,070
some people say they could.

270
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,140
I'm not here to say if they do or don't,

271
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,770
but they're doing like four
and five workouts a day.

272
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:09,910
They're just insane.

273
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:10,061
They're,

274
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:10,261
they're,

275
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:10,481
they're,

276
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,370
they're inhuman and,

277
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,750
and just the recovery rate I'm looking
at going fucking HGH would be amazing.

278
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,100
But when they test,

279
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,720
they test the same way the NFL does,

280
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,650
which you can't,

281
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,510
you can't catch it in the urine test.

282
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,400
Only like one time in the world.

283
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,620
Has anyone gotten caught in an HGH?

284
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:27,131
You're in test.

285
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,760
It was like a rugby player in the UK.

286
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,190
Oh,

287
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,950
at one time.

288
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,820
One time in a year.

289
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,520
And totally crazy levels or something.

290
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,490
Yeah.

291
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:35,520
Something was wrong was
just completely white.

292
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,530
So they have this new system that they
think they're going to be able to test.

293
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,800
But we had Sean Waxman who is
the Olympic weightlifting code.

294
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,690
He's got Waxman's Jim down by the airport.

295
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,290
We had him on the other day and
he was talking about how it's,

296
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,153
it's uh,

297
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,690
more of like a moneymaking thing.

298
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,120
Like there's money being made in the,

299
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,010
in the testing world is,

300
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,690
so there's like lobbying being done to
make more testing and more testing so

301
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:02,390
they can make more money because
it's just this ridiculous,

302
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,650
I'm a firm believer.

303
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,900
Why would you prevent people
from enhancing themselves?

304
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:06,290
Like,

305
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,800
like you let people take protein
supplements that's coming from a cow.

306
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,640
We're taking the way from a cow and
we're eating it to make ourselves better.

307
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,500
Why can't we take the growth
hormone from a cadaver and use that?

308
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,000
We don't do that at first of all.

309
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,950
Because if you did do that,

310
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,580
you can get really sick and you
can get fucking mad cow disease.

311
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:26,690
What we were talking about earlier,

312
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,460
you can get all sorts of crazy diseases.

313
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,641
Well,

314
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:28,971
where did,

315
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,140
you might say it's a synthetic,

316
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:30,430
right?

317
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,870
Yes,

318
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,390
but it's actually made by bacteria.

319
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,410
It is bacteria.

320
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,330
Bacteria constructed well,

321
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,500
but it's so,

322
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,950
it's a s anything that simulates the
amazing process that you and I would never

323
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:40,550
figure it out.

324
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,280
Give it a billion years at
all the books in the world.

325
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,620
You and I would still be sitting
around telling fart jokes.

326
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,860
We would never figure it how to make
a lot further ahead than I would.

327
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,694
I were moans,

328
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Syria.

329
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,770
Oh my God.

330
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,041
Fuck it.

331
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,600
I can't figure out how a toilet works.

332
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,310
It's an amazing how some
people's minds just can do that.

333
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,850
Like there's,

334
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,830
it's a variation in the way that the
human mind works is so spectacular.

335
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,510
I tried to figure out,

336
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,810
I was watching the way they're
testing to figure out how the,

337
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,150
the human growth hormone load the weight.

338
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,170
They've got this like thing that locks
onto it so that they can test and I was

339
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,240
watching over and over trying to,

340
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,470
trying to comprehend it.

341
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,100
I could,

342
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,550
unlike,

343
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,780
I'm fucking retard.

344
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,790
I can't get this in my head.

345
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,260
Rick Ross would have figured it out.

346
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,320
You probably would have went the real
request that we had on yesterday.

347
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,930
Genius Guy that the,

348
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:27,590
the uh,

349
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,680
the drug dealer,

350
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,370
it was a yeah,

351
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,720
till he was 28 years old.

352
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,190
He couldn't read really.

353
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,280
Not only did he teach himself how to read,

354
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:38,910
but he also taught himself the law
and found loopholes in the law.

355
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,710
So he went from being like,

356
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,030
can't even read a book,

357
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:46,140
Jack and Jill to fucking getting
himself out of a life term in prison.

358
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Fucking what was,

359
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,740
um,

360
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,990
one of the most amazing,

361
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,370
I think the best podcasts.

362
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,000
It's just the story wise,

363
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,050
it was just amazing.

364
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,090
And then some rubbers,

365
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,220
kind of his identity.

366
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,670
One rappers stole his identity.

367
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,890
That would piss me off.

368
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,341
Yeah.

369
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,174
You'd think,

370
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,820
I mean they thought it was going to
be in jail for life is what it was.

371
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,410
He was a legend out on the street.

372
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,040
Uh,

373
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,641
like you know,

374
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,420
I had heard his name,

375
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,170
so he's very heard his name
when I was living in La.

376
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,480
I wasn't even living in la
rather when I heard his name,

377
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,860
like he was that legendary.

378
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,191
Oh yeah.

379
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:16,650
He was legendary as far as like
drug dealers in this country.

380
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,390
You would hear him on them
and the new stores and stuff,

381
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:19,860
when he won his trial was going on.

382
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,761
So huge,

383
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:21,420
huge deal.

384
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,500
Nationwide was a huge,

385
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,363
how'd you guys find him?

386
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:23,701
Cause he,

387
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,050
he's look now

388
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,770
it was at Rick Ross or
did the wrapper of that?

389
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,311
It was a,

390
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:32,730
no,

391
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,600
he's a freeway.

392
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,530
Ricky on Twitter.

393
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,760
That's what his nickname was,

394
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,690
freeway Ricky Ross.

395
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,280
But he,

396
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,560
uh,

397
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,100
you know,

398
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,050
it's really interesting to see this guy
who was 20 years old in this terrible

399
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:47,700
situation and sort of just kind of found
his way through the system to success.

400
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,080
And then it all came,

401
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,530
fallen apart and then he built himself
back up again and now he's like a really

402
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:53,130
cool dude.

403
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,701
It's amazing.

404
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,690
Really intense,

405
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,560
intense story.

406
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Pissed off about the guy
stealing his identity.

407
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,310
Fuck yeah.

408
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,500
Yeah.

409
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,820
You should be the then,

410
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,450
well,

411
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,380
we can't talk about it.

412
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,861
There's,

413
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,350
there's part of it that we can't
talk about for legal issues.

414
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,180
So there's a,

415
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,440
there's a guy in Australia,

416
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,090
I don't know if you've ever
seen the movie chopper.

417
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,571
Yes,

418
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:09,991
I have.

419
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:11,220
I love that fucking movie.

420
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,810
It's Eric Bana.

421
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,670
[inaudible]

422
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,460
supposedly all true.

423
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,030
Yeah.

424
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,391
I mean,

425
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:18,960
this guy,

426
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,460
if you haven't seen the film,

427
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,110
the guy got thrown in prison,

428
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:22,620
he was like,

429
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,660
he was like a hit man
kind of for drug dealers.

430
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,620
He gets thrown in prison and they're
going to send them to like the wing of the

431
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,080
prison where the guys
that want to kill him are.

432
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,460
So instead of going there,

433
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,360
he cut his own ears off so that
they'd put them in the crazy ward.

434
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,730
And now he's got these
like fucked up years.

435
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,230
But what a great idea.

436
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,093
But he's,

437
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,600
he's just crazy,

438
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,610
legendary Australia and
the people kind of like,

439
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:44,941
he's,

440
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,340
he's like a folk hero on that.

441
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,490
But there was,

442
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,380
there's a guy now on the fuck up,

443
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,520
there's a guy who does a parody
of them and does a show and tours

444
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,860
to like sold out shows everywhere.

445
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,790
And,

446
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,623
and uh,

447
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,340
and I just did his show,

448
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,080
like he does a show
where he hosts it and he,

449
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,720
I did the Adelaide comedy
festival and I did his show.

450
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,621
It's a late night.

451
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,940
It's a heath.

452
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,930
Franklin is the guy.

453
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:08,920
He does chopper it,

454
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,221
but he,

455
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:13,120
he plays chopper and he's in
character doing standup and it's good.

456
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,193
It's good.

457
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,741
It's good.

458
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:15,550
Stand up.

459
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,240
And then he's doing it as chopper and
every joke is about like misogyny and

460
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,790
fucking harden the fuck up and,

461
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,180
and he's got the mustache on and the
sunglasses and I set afterwards because I

462
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:25,901
had heard rumors,

463
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:26,734
I said is,

464
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,540
has he ever contacted you?

465
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:28,931
And he goes,

466
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,500
yeah,

467
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,333
yeah.

468
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,900
Apparently he's not very happy.

469
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:32,680
I go,

470
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,600
why don't you fuck with a guy like that?

471
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,370
Christ the guy who will come in.

472
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,470
You're not in your wheelhouse.

473
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,201
Crazy.

474
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:38,890
It's fucking crazy.

475
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,760
If you watch the movie,

476
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,061
by the way,

477
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:40,691
if you haven't seen it,

478
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,910
it's a great movie.

479
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,820
It's really fun.

480
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,440
Amazing.

481
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,490
You're rooting for this.

482
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:49,491
Psychopath Australia makes great co
like criminal can crime films like that.

483
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,140
They have,

484
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,500
they have a show or they had a
movie called Animal House Watch.

485
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:54,880
Animal House about this family.

486
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,431
I have the,

487
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:55,800
yeah.

488
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,050
Yeah.

489
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,980
It's fucking great.

490
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,780
Explain how he gets to do that.

491
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:00,250
If choppers still alive.

492
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,210
I don't know.

493
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,691
I said,

494
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,100
do you have to pay him a commission?

495
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,360
Do you nothing.

496
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,090
Tours and sells out shows everywhere.

497
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,963
Reason.

498
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,920
That seems crazy.

499
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,810
That seems like you're asking for trouble.

500
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,340
You should give that guy a piece.

501
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,031
Well,

502
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,440
I mean I guess it's kind of the same.

503
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,220
Well,

504
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,110
I mean it's like guys that do impressions.

505
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:18,100
I mean that's the way he does it,

506
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,690
but it's a full sun impression.

507
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,760
That's why I'm just
going to change my name.

508
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,690
Did Louie Anderson?

509
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,710
If I have to do anywhere else,

510
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,590
I'll come down hard on you.

511
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,803
Louie.

512
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,213
Louie.

513
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,310
Louie will come down hard on your son,

514
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,483
both of you.

515
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,960
What are you saying and why are
you saying it on the Internet?

516
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,273
Like spanking.

517
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,550
I was getting nervous on your show
because your fans are so diligent about

518
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,563
facts.

519
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,381
Too brutal.

520
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:48,214
They're brutal.

521
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,760
Twitter's like last time I was here I
was talking about grass fed meat stuff.

522
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,320
He's like,

523
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,510
cows or pigs can't be grass fed.

524
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,344
They get sunburned.

525
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,060
They do some of that.

526
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,521
They do.

527
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,240
If you think about it,

528
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,420
this pink pigs he's like so they have to
be under so they can't be eating grass

529
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,210
all the time.

530
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,400
That totally makes sense.

531
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,391
Yeah.

532
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,190
I would think where the
real pink like that.

533
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,890
What kind of protection
from the sun is that you?

534
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,560
I don't know.

535
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,910
They'd probably get all fucked up.

536
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,871
Cause imagine ribbons,

537
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,490
Suntan lotion all over the cow.

538
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,751
Pig Man.

539
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:17,584
A Perry got a cow.

540
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,210
Pigs are so weird because pigs are the
only animal that we know of that becomes

541
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,044
feral.

542
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,050
Meaning it becomes wild almost immediately
from the release from a farm and it

543
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,280
actually physically changes shape.

544
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,480
It's real weird.

545
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,130
There are for changes,

546
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:36,760
it becomes like darker and thicker and
Busher and their tusks grow longer and

547
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:38,710
their snout actually grows long.

548
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,780
Maybe that's how they should naturally be.

549
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,040
But so weird though that.

550
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,930
Why doesn't that happen when
they're in the best case?

551
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,660
Cause they're probably
feeding them shitty food.

552
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,860
I don't know if that's it,

553
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:48,251
man.

554
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:50,950
Somebody told me what's the
best way to get rid of a body?

555
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,160
It's just

556
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,700
pigs in the way the movie snatch.

557
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:53,920
Okay.

558
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,320
Did they do it?

559
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,610
Not.

560
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:54,881
Yeah,

561
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:57,500
I remember the guy was a eeky or I'm like,

562
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:57,721
all right,

563
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:58,554
we keep some pigs.

564
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,360
Yeah,

565
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
that guy was a great action with those
shoot super coke bottle glasses like I

566
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:06,840
was the shit wasn't in the sopranos
also or am I just thinking match?

567
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
I definitely in snap,

568
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:08,840
but you know,

569
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,620
but that's a,

570
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,421
I asked a guy once,

571
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:11,540
he's gotten rid of a body,

572
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,320
I said,

573
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,210
what's the best way to get rid of a body?

574
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,110
And he said go fishing.

575
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,131
And I said,

576
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:16,370
what?

577
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:16,670
He goes,

578
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,250
go fishing and throw them in the water.

579
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,000
Like you go far enough out
in the ocean if you're lucky,

580
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,530
if you're not lucky,

581
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,431
not lucky.

582
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:28,210
That bitch floats to shore
up your tying up here.

583
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,090
You got to tie him up.

584
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:29,924
Dexter style,

585
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,510
pubic hair of yours doesn't it?

586
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,680
But if you think about it,

587
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,270
I mean it's probably a good bet.

588
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,280
I mean there's a lot of God
damn real estate out there.

589
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,020
What people are buried out there.

590
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,510
How many people do you think are
buried on the weight in Nevada?

591
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,371
Oh God,

592
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,071
that's crazy.

593
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:43,904
Dirt road.

594
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,680
Those off to the side where you see like
we're dirt roads through the chicken

595
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,101
wire.

596
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,270
Like what is that?

597
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,560
What's going on back there?

598
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,800
Who owns that checks that for bodies.

599
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,870
Who skins that they
were the fucking metal.

600
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,140
The sexy looking for watches.

601
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,360
The people that got burnt up.

602
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,740
I think it's funny when they find one,

603
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,030
remember that bodybuilder?

604
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,200
I was just about to bring that up.

605
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,981
Chris Titus.

606
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:04,310
Yes.

607
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,170
Didn't he tried?

608
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,331
No.

609
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,890
Chris Titus was no immediate immediate.

610
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,720
Craig situs said it.

611
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,883
What's his name?

612
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,530
No,

613
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,660
it's all on my shit wrong.

614
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,880
He killed his personal assistant.

615
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,900
He and his wife,

616
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,490
because he was fucking her I think.

617
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,473
And his wife,

618
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,880
his wife caught them and so I guess he
and his wife decided to get rid of her.

619
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,420
Yeah,

620
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,770
that's,

621
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,650
that's the best way to handle
getting caught cheating.

622
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,490
And they killed her and then
they took her out to the desert.

623
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:30,200
Craig Titus and they were
going to like light the Er.

624
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,790
They were lighting on fire and air or,

625
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,031
yeah,

626
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,620
the car and her and me.

627
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,050
I remember this guy,

628
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,980
he was,

629
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,510
he was so juice to the gills.

630
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:40,050
You're so crazy that he would actually,

631
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:44,990
it was like challenging Phil Baroni who
was saying that he wanted to fight Phil

632
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,040
Baroni when Phil Baroni was,

633
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:46,760
uh,

634
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,450
you know,

635
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,010
feel brony when he was young was one of
the scariest knockout punches in the,

636
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,520
in the UFC middleweight division.

637
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,590
He didn't beat like a lot of the top guys,

638
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,830
but he's a tough motherfucker for some
crazy body builder to come along and say

639
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,680
that,

640
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,040
you know,

641
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,660
go watch that Dave [inaudible] fight.

642
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,880
Go Watch Phil Baroni light.

643
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:09,320
Dave Manet up with like 15 punches in
a row while standing while he's already

644
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,154
unconscious.

645
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,010
He doesn't even have a chance to
hit the ground and broke his hip.

646
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,721
I'm not kidding,

647
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:14,901
man.

648
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,550
It's one of the greatest highlight,

649
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:21,551
real chaos of all time and this fucking
Douche bag Jews head who just lifts

650
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,760
weights,

651
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,050
thinks he's going to fuck with that.

652
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,430
Like it's hilarious.

653
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,181
This guy's,

654
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,520
they get so full of
testosterone and there's so,

655
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:28,881
I mean,

656
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,890
they're literally not even human anymore.

657
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,370
If you see as some of those guys
when they hit those crazy levels of

658
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,410
testosterone that you
need to get that big.

659
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,560
I used to work out at that goal.

660
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,660
Jim and his,

661
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,310
his picture was on the wall.

662
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,030
He was one of the guys they
want to in Venice and not human.

663
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,570
Like the day that happened,

664
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,460
I think I was in there and the guy
was on a ladder pulling the picture.

665
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,573
Oh yeah.

666
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:48,881
Oh,

667
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:49,500
I'm sure.

668
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,831
Yeah,

669
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:49,980
that

670
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,820
he's a disgrace.

671
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,250
But I mean like when
you get like that big,

672
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,540
like Lee Haney big,

673
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,381
come on man.

674
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:56,310
That's not human.

675
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,391
It's not,

676
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:57,840
you can't,

677
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:57,991
it's,

678
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:58,950
it's an insult.

679
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,690
But it would also feel like,

680
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,730
like I'm a little guy,

681
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,010
I weigh like 170 pounds and I,

682
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,821
I work out a lot.

683
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,220
I do crossfit like six days a week.

684
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,020
And when I started here frequently,

685
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,351
yeah.

686
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:13,800
When I start to work out where I'm
doing a lot of Olympic lifting and power

687
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,491
lifting and stuff,

688
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:18,300
where I start to get a little
heavier and up to blink 180 my,

689
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,160
I feel uncomfortable,

690
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:20,821
you know,

691
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,640
just like losing all my
mobility and everything.

692
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,803
I can't,

693
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,330
they're,

694
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,830
they,

695
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,930
they're like handicapped.

696
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,390
That's also an issue of what
you're doing for exercise.

697
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,590
If you wanted mobility,

698
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,424
you should be nodded.

699
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:32,800
Yeah.

700
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah,

701
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,070
but not at that size.

702
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,420
Do heavyweights.

703
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,701
Sure.

704
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:36,880
But I do a lot everything,

705
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,350
you know,

706
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,520
I do a lot of metcons and stuff,

707
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,354
but they,

708
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm saying when you get
to that bodybuilder size,

709
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,860
like Lee Haney size,

710
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,480
you lose,

711
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,710
you're almost like a handicapped person
when you're taking your shirt on.

712
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,120
You'd be amazed at how well some guys
can move with a lot of muscle that have

713
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,013
stretched out.

714
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,290
Yeah.

715
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,280
That's really what it is.

716
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:58,410
It's all about like
flexibility and it's all,

717
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,161
there's guys like,

718
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,720
there's this kid named Todd Duffy,

719
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,170
he's a heavyweight contender
and he probably weighs,

720
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,300
I'd say weighs around two 40 ish,

721
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,900
somewhere in that looks like
a fucking like some sort of a,

722
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,970
an action comic hero.

723
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,630
It doesn't really,

724
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,790
we were real human and he's huge.

725
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,410
He's just swollen muscles everywhere.

726
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,270
And this mother fucker moves like a cat.

727
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,710
Like it's creepy to watch them.

728
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,560
It's creepy to watch them jump on
dudes and punch them cause you're like,

729
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,011
Jesus,

730
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,360
he's not supposed to move that quick.

731
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,500
Like it's uncomfortable and one of the
reasons why he can move so quick as he's

732
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,330
a real athlete stretches everything and
he doesn't just do you if you're doing

733
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
Olympic cleans,

734
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,020
if you're doing dead lifts and if you're
doing like power squats you at whatever

735
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,400
time you spend doing that,

736
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:45,120
you should spend twice that amount of
time stretching out and getting deep

737
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:45,950
tissue massage.

738
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,410
Yeah.

739
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,180
So for every two hours you're lifting,

740
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:49,080
it should be four hours,

741
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:51,000
two hours deep tissue
in two hours stretching.

742
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,080
That's not bullshit.

743
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,170
You like you really need
to stretch everything.

744
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,440
It takes a long time.

745
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,390
I that I don't fuck around cause when I
first got into crossfit I thought it was

746
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:03,750
cool that you'll need to work out
for like sometimes three minutes.

747
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,490
The workouts are sometimes three minutes.

748
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,290
Yeah.

749
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,570
If you,

750
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,470
if you're good at it,

751
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:08,304
like a friend,

752
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,460
a good friend time is three is three
minutes of Fran Fran who would be a 95

753
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:17,070
pound thruster 21 times.

754
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,720
Then 20 a thruster has a structure,

755
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:19,081
is a,

756
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,740
is a,

757
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,760
we got to clean it first.

758
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,850
Then you go into a squat and then
end up push press over your head.

759
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,270
Okay.

760
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,620
So you do that 21 times,

761
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,020
then you go straight to
the pull up bar 21 times,

762
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,030
then you do 15 thrusters,

763
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,020
15 pull ups,

764
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,980
then nine thrusters,

765
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,820
nine pullups.

766
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,271
Okay,

767
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:35,070
so that's like 90 reps or something.

768
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,810
But you're doing who'd done,

769
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,260
yeah,

770
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,491
you're,

771
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:38,880
you're fucking done.

772
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,920
And,

773
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,890
and uh,

774
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,060
you know,

775
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,420
they have that scheme rep gain with
like you could do it with like handstand

776
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,100
pushups and dead lifts,

777
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:47,980
which

778
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,550
is,

779
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,690
is a pretty tough one to,

780
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:49,900
uh,

781
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,820
and it was all just blowing it out,

782
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,331
blown out.

783
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,190
Some of them are up to 20 minutes long,

784
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:54,910
some of them are,

785
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,840
some of them are,

786
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,230
you know,

787
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,490
like fight gone bad.

788
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,090
Uh,

789
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,631
what's his name?

790
00:20:58,631 --> 00:20:58,871
The,

791
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,430
the wrestler or the the UFC fighter did,

792
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,200
I think it was Dana White
did it with the crossfit.

793
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,220
They put it together and they said,

794
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,800
let's simulate a UFC fight.

795
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:09,371
So it's like,

796
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:09,641
what are you,

797
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:10,690
five minutes and then,

798
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,190
or what's around three five minute rounds?

799
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,950
So it's,

800
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,381
and how many?

801
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,620
Three three in them,

802
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,580
the regular fights and five and
championship and main event fights.

803
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,690
So this is like five,

804
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:23,800
five minute rounds with one minute break
and in between each one and you row.

805
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:24,790
Then you do push presses,

806
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,451
box jumps,

807
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,950
everything and you do as many reps as
you can get in of these things like a

808
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,350
minute each and then you switch to the
next thing for a minute and it's five

809
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,150
things in five minutes.

810
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,540
Then you take a minute break five and
they asked him afterwards and they're

811
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:37,631
like,

812
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,464
what was that like?

813
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,313
Was that like a fight?

814
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:39,791
He goes,

815
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,640
it was like a fight gone bat and it just,

816
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,050
it beats the fuck out of you.

817
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,590
But I used to go into the gym without
warming up thinking I could do it.

818
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,460
Oh God.

819
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:48,780
And,

820
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,990
and I could.

821
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,760
But then I developed so many
issues with like bad back bad.

822
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,310
Let me bring this up
then because tendinitis,

823
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:01,660
Steve Maxwell is a guy that I trained
with a bunch of times of a brilliant guy,

824
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,240
really well known for
being a fitness guru,

825
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,150
and he thinks that those high repetition,

826
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,180
dead lift things that get
done a lot in crossfit.

827
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,600
He said,

828
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,770
you're not supposed to do that.

829
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,970
That's not how those
exercises are designed.

830
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,030
Yes,

831
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,411
yes.

832
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:16,390
Potential for injury.

833
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,081
Yes and no.

834
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:17,321
I mean,

835
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,580
I'm sitting here right now with,

836
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,960
I've got a bad disc because I did
155 pound power clean or squat,

837
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,770
squat.

838
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,250
What was it?

839
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,510
155 pound dude.

840
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,520
Once you stop fucking
around and take Jujitsu,

841
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,020
just learners,

842
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,681
triangle people.

843
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,300
I don't like the roll around with men.

844
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:31,871
I'm the little,

845
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,860
when you choke the fuck,

846
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,270
listen man,

847
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,130
I do have aggression.

848
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,250
I do have aggression.

849
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,480
I do probably like that.

850
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,080
Well,

851
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,381
yeah,

852
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,214
you would love it.

853
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,150
You're a man.

854
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,780
You,

855
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,190
it would help you tremendously.

856
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,180
You're so into fitness,

857
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,500
but you're not even getting the rewards.

858
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,600
I know they're getting a skill.

859
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,740
These workout I did the other day,

860
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:52,741
it was 155 pound a squat clean and jerk
30 times as fast as you can do it to see

861
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:56,321
that's where it,

862
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,520
Maxwell has an issue with it.

863
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:58,000
He's,

864
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,750
he's his issue is that when you're
doing these high rep exercises,

865
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,180
there's just too much
potential for fuckups.

866
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,100
Here's he's right then,

867
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,180
and I hurt myself because I am talking
to Sean Waxman who was an Olympic lifting

868
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,014
like expert,

869
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,321
you know,

870
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:12,970
he was like a national
champion or whatever.

871
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,983
He,

872
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,120
I don't have my technique.

873
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,950
I mean that's a high technique thing.

874
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:19,150
If you're an Olympic weight lifter,

875
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,190
it has to be so precise.

876
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,540
It's like fucking ballet.

877
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,710
How good you have to be.

878
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,510
[inaudible] when they have that woman,

879
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,970
they locked her arms
overhead and squatted,

880
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,010
it's overhead press and the fucking
bar is like way too heavy for them.

881
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:33,371
You know,

882
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,840
they just got up there with trickery.

883
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,441
You know,

884
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,274
they did some,

885
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,550
they did that crazy Natchez
fucking unbelievable.

886
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,780
It's wiggling over the head.

887
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:40,991
You're like,

888
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:41,421
my God,

889
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,490
if that falls in your skull,

890
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:44,920
your duns dead done dead.

891
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,321
And,

892
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:45,800
uh,

893
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,440
I saw a GoGet

894
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,020
crushed by a a bench ones.

895
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,840
He was benching and went away
over his head and he fucking,

896
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:54,530
his arm just gave out and
it comes down on him hard.

897
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,400
It goes to his neck,

898
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,300
everybody's screaming,

899
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,340
they're running over and pull
up the weights off of them.

900
00:23:58,341 --> 00:23:59,130
It was fucking pen

901
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,520
pneumonia.

902
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
You can spend five hours on youtube
crying your eyes out laughing at

903
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,670
weightlifting nails.

904
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,520
And the best is the guys
passing out after a lift.

905
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,740
That's the funniest dude.

906
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,070
Like a big dead lifted
fall forward on his face.

907
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,560
Guys have died from that.

908
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,740
Guys have had hernias or rather aneurysm.

909
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,900
I had a one time in the
middle of a workout I had,

910
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,480
I think it was an exertion
headache or something.

911
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,314
We're just,

912
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,880
I knew like an,

913
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,080
I try never to quit.

914
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,820
I just looked at everyone and I went,

915
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,683
I'm out,

916
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,330
I'm out.

917
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,260
Cause my head started like pulsating.

918
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,740
Ooo,

919
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,680
and and it was a lot that
they teach you to like,

920
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,281
you know,

921
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,970
a lot of times you were taught like
breathe in and then on the downward,

922
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:41,300
on the,

923
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,590
on the ecentric and on the concentric you,

924
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,630
you exhale.

925
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,650
But a lot of times in our kind of lifting
they say hold your breath because it

926
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:49,820
locks your core.

927
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,130
If you hold your breath
throughout the whole lift,

928
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,630
like bogged down.

929
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,490
And then once you finish the lift,

930
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,443
exhale,

931
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,180
it locks your core together,

932
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,380
locks your spine and
it keeps more control.

933
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,390
So like just hold,

934
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,261
take a deep breath,

935
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:04,430
hold on the way down.

936
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,293
Hold on the way up.

937
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,133
Exhale.

938
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,380
So I was doing that and
all of sudden it was like,

939
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,230
like I popped something
in my head and I went,

940
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,621
fuck,

941
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm going to die.

942
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,200
I really thought aneurism or something
and I went to was just a little mini one.

943
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,250
Don't tell me that.

944
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,173
Cause aneurysms.

945
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,500
Well actually that's the way to go.

946
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,334
That's the,

947
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:22,821
you're out.

948
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,211
You're dead,

949
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,044
you're gone.

950
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,670
You learned my grandmother.

951
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,670
Aw.

952
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,930
My grandmother had an aneurysm.

953
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,310
They gave her 72 hours.

954
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,600
She lived 12 years.

955
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,570
But she has Sicilian peasant genetics.

956
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,360
There's fucking those peasant genes,

957
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,720
those brick carrying savages that's uh,

958
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,050
a hardy people.

959
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,100
She survived.

960
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,700
Aw.

961
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,200
Yeah.

962
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,630
You know,

963
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,770
no one ever took care of them.

964
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:44,490
How their health,

965
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,170
everyone's just eating Italian food.

966
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,360
It was always meat balls and Lasagna.

967
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,351
I would go over their house.

968
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:50,400
It was just ridiculous.

969
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,040
My grandmother always made homemade pasta,

970
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,461
homemade,

971
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:53,940
everything.

972
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,310
Everything was fucking sausages.

973
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,270
[inaudible] sauce.

974
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:00,060
And it was just aneurisms.

975
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,610
It was just called cholesterol.

976
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:01,861
It's like,

977
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,320
oh wait.

978
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,470
Natha how's the,

979
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:03,930
she,

980
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,010
she lived for 12 years.

981
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,240
My grandfather had to take care of her.

982
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,230
It was a,

983
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,790
it was amazing to watch,

984
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,260
man.

985
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,410
It was amazing to watch.

986
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
It was one time,

987
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:12,114
this is really,

988
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,860
I mean it's very sentimental,

989
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:14,694
but it was,

990
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,270
he was standing over and
she couldn't wipe her ass.

991
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,051
She couldn't do anything.

992
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:19,261
Man.

993
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,100
She had bed sores.

994
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,010
He had a Turner to make sure
that she didn't have bed sores.

995
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:23,844
You had to,

996
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,810
and she would still get them.

997
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,201
You know,

998
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,400
she's in bed all the time.

999
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,190
It's constantly rubbing up for 12 years,

1000
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,040
12 years.

1001
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,640
And she could barely,

1002
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,030
she was barely lucid and she would make
crazy noises and sometimes she was there

1003
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:33,930
and sometimes she wasn't.

1004
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,350
But she was essentially trapped in
her own body for the rest of her days.

1005
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,580
And um,

1006
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,121
it was hard,

1007
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:39,331
man,

1008
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,630
because I was living with them at the
time for a little bit when I first moved

1009
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:43,230
to New York,

1010
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,190
didn't have enough money for my own
apartment and my grandparents lived in New

1011
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,910
Jersey,

1012
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,840
north New Jersey.

1013
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,480
They had been there since like the 30s
when it was an all Italian neighborhood.

1014
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:55,410
And now it's become this like hodgepodge
of like third world people and really

1015
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:56,340
poor black people.

1016
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,940
It's like,

1017
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,490
it's not a good neighborhood at all
by any stretch of the imagination.

1018
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,481
And My,

1019
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:00,750
uh,

1020
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,021
you know,

1021
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:01,860
they'd just stayed,

1022
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:04,530
it just had become their neighborhood
and they just dealt with it.

1023
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,650
And my grandmother was
just in a bed all the time,

1024
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,513
moaning.

1025
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:08,890
Oh,

1026
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,350
just in agony and pain.

1027
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,480
And one time she says to my grandfather,

1028
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,100
liked you too good to me.

1029
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,390
Like,

1030
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,330
I don't deserve you.

1031
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,270
Like she,

1032
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:16,641
she,

1033
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,510
she was lucid and like she could,

1034
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:18,891
yeah,

1035
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:19,820
some code talker.

1036
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,450
Sometimes she would say
something like that,

1037
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,980
but it was really garbled.

1038
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:23,220
I got,

1039
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,080
want to do an impression
of it out of respect,

1040
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,000
but it sounded like someone
who was pretty fucked up.

1041
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,440
It didn't sound like
the way I just said it,

1042
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:28,561
like,

1043
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:29,394
you're too good to me.

1044
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,540
She couldn't talk like that.

1045
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,230
It was,

1046
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,720
it was a long drawn out.

1047
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,820
It was difficult to get the sentence out.

1048
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,121
You know?

1049
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,070
He told her he loved her
and she was his wife.

1050
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:38,791
It was pretty crazy.

1051
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,610
It was made me cry and then she died.

1052
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,350
It was one of those classic
things when she died,

1053
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:44,280
he died a year later.

1054
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:44,671
Yeah.

1055
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:45,620
My grandparents did that.

1056
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,340
My grandmother is 96,

1057
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,971
96.

1058
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,740
They both lived to and uh,

1059
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,510
and uh,

1060
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,580
he died and she went right after,

1061
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,641
right after.

1062
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:54,841
No,

1063
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,610
we'll just went all the way to 96.

1064
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,001
And it was like,

1065
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:57,990
what else is there?

1066
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,591
There's no,

1067
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:58,891
well,

1068
00:27:58,891 --> 00:27:59,220
I mean,

1069
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,581
you know,

1070
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:00,360
and it's like,

1071
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,680
that's what life was supposed to be.

1072
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,690
It's supposed to be get to
a point where it's really,

1073
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:04,021
you know,

1074
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,291
you're,

1075
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,960
you're accepting the fact that it's
over because it's not good anymore.

1076
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,220
Yeah.

1077
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,070
You ever read the book?

1078
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:08,904
Uh,

1079
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,120
oh.

1080
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,571
What's his name?

1081
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,430
The guy who wrote man's
search for meaning?

1082
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:11,991
No,

1083
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:12,760
I'm okay.

1084
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:12,860
It's

1085
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,181
a guy.

1086
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:13,380
He,

1087
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,611
he,

1088
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:14,030
he,

1089
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,631
victor,

1090
00:28:14,631 --> 00:28:15,464
Victor,

1091
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,581
Victor Hugo.

1092
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:17,600
I think he,

1093
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:18,140
uh,

1094
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,710
he was in a concentration camp and he
made it all the way through and he wrote

1095
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:23,630
this book on Low logo therapy,

1096
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:25,120
I think it's called our logo therapy.

1097
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,233
And he,

1098
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:26,900
he,

1099
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,080
it was amazing because he talked about
all the people that survived and how they

1100
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:33,560
survived the concentration camp
been like stripped completely naked,

1101
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,210
having your hair shaved off your head,

1102
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,100
put in like losing your identity,

1103
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,620
having no identity and
being able to survive that,

1104
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:43,460
like being stripped of everything in
life that you ever had and you're having

1105
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:43,940
your whole,

1106
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,571
most of these people,

1107
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:45,800
their whole families were killed,

1108
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,663
were murdered.

1109
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,200
So like what do you live for?

1110
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:49,280
And I think that happened to him.

1111
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:50,750
His entire family was killed.

1112
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,090
So some people would still have someone,

1113
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,350
they'd be like,

1114
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,130
I want to live to get back to my wife or
I want to live to get back to my child.

1115
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,330
His was,

1116
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,270
I want to live to get back to help people,

1117
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,210
to show people how to get
through something this atrocious.

1118
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,840
Like,

1119
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,440
like that.

1120
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,400
That was his will.

1121
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,410
But he said you had to have something.

1122
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,260
If you didn't have something
you wouldn't make it.

1123
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,650
And he talks about the,

1124
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,860
the most amazing thing he
talked about was going,

1125
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,730
uh,

1126
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,590
how he said sufferings,

1127
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,520
like a gas.

1128
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,710
It'll fill a room no matter how big it is.

1129
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,630
And he said like,

1130
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:26,930
they were on the one train going
to one of the concentration camps.

1131
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,210
And like if you go over this bridge,

1132
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,300
you were going to the
one where they kill you.

1133
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,550
But if you make like a right turn,

1134
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,330
you're going to the one where you're
going to stay alive for a couple more

1135
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:38,331
weeks.

1136
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:41,770
It's a work camp and they're in
the truck and he said like cattle,

1137
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:41,981
you know,

1138
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,270
they've got them all pressed together.

1139
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,200
You can't breathe your smell like
shit and you're smothered and,

1140
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,160
and it's all these other like
concentration camp victims and uh,

1141
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:51,970
you're,

1142
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,970
you're in there and it's the worst like
worse like place you could ever be in

1143
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:57,820
your life.

1144
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,420
Like,

1145
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,141
like mentally,

1146
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:03,880
physically and you're going over this
and you thinking I'm going to die.

1147
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,340
I'm going over this bridge and
we're going to the death camp.

1148
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,450
But they made like a right turn to go
to the work camp for two weeks and there

1149
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:12,640
was like a cheer in,

1150
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,601
in the truck,

1151
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:14,150
like in the,

1152
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,690
the car,

1153
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,523
the train car.

1154
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,910
That was like the greatest feeling in
the world because they had two more weeks

1155
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:21,491
to live.

1156
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:21,821
Like they,

1157
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,020
they weren't going to die.

1158
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,770
And he said it's amazing that like you
can be in that shitty of a position in

1159
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:27,604
your life,

1160
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,140
but experience have that like
elation that so high like,

1161
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,581
and it's,

1162
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,780
it's kind of Buddhist about
like live in the moment.

1163
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:35,230
I mean,

1164
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,310
you're in a horrible,

1165
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,001
horrible place,

1166
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,890
but you can have these levels of like,

1167
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,760
like,

1168
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,151
fuck,

1169
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:42,010
that was like fucking amazing.

1170
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:43,260
I just fucking like,

1171
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:43,840
like,

1172
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,950
like you remember the high highs of your
life and one of them was at the lowest

1173
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:48,910
point of your life.

1174
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,260
Yeah.

1175
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,760
It's a fucking amazing book.

1176
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:52,594
It's Eh,

1177
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,350
is it,

1178
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,111
did you look it up?

1179
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:55,030
Is it Victor Hugo?

1180
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,230
You know victor,

1181
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,071
I don't know.

1182
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:57,880
I can't remember his name.

1183
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,380
It's called man's search for meaning.

1184
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,390
It's an old book.

1185
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,280
That famous book.

1186
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,440
It is a weird question when you
try to figure out like what were,

1187
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,390
what are you here for?

1188
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,021
Like what is,

1189
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:07,040
what is meaning,

1190
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,430
you know,

1191
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,360
if it is,

1192
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:08,760
if you,

1193
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,310
the human mind looks at the future and
figures out that this is a certain amount

1194
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:15,500
of time left is only a
certain amount of time left.

1195
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,140
If you're to believe that
this world is real and all,

1196
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,710
you really have a finite time as you,

1197
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,330
if you believe this world is real.

1198
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:24,111
It's funny you say that,

1199
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:24,680
cause I,

1200
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,200
I had lunch with my sister the
other day who's very intelligent.

1201
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:30,950
She's a partner in like the biggest law
firm and we started talking about it and

1202
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,060
we disagree on a lot.

1203
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:32,211
Like,

1204
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:32,841
she's actually,

1205
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,150
she still believes in
God and all this stuff.

1206
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,450
And I said something about if
you believe this world is real,

1207
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,130
and she kind of gave the Descartes,

1208
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:40,731
you know,

1209
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:41,990
I think therefore I am.

1210
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,390
And I'm like even how does he know?

1211
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:45,920
He was fucking thinking.

1212
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,221
You know,

1213
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:46,830
like

1214
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,690
how does he know when it becomes entirely
more possible as technology increases

1215
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:56,340
to envision a world some point in the
future where it's going to be possible to

1216
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:59,280
recreate reality in an
indistinguishable form.

1217
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,290
And it may have already happened.

1218
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,880
We may be in it right now.

1219
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,900
And then maybe one of the reasons why
life is so ridiculous is because sometimes

1220
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,190
like in a lot of movies,

1221
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:09,270
there's some shitty writing.

1222
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,430
And then this is a dude named wiener who
likes to pull his dick out and show it

1223
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:15,360
to girls on the Internet.

1224
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,920
He just happens to be a senator,

1225
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,850
you know,

1226
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,930
or John Edwards,

1227
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:19,310
he's what?

1228
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,471
What?

1229
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,430
Your wife's got cancer,

1230
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,780
why don't you go fuck another chicken?

1231
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:22,680
Should a load inside of her.

1232
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,660
That'd be good for your
presidential aspirations.

1233
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,180
You,

1234
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,621
I mean there's,

1235
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:27,330
this is a real John Edwards,

1236
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,310
not only that he's on trial right now,

1237
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:30,900
but following his trial,

1238
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:32,100
they want to put that guy in jail.

1239
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,480
He almost became the president.

1240
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,070
He was a real,

1241
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,083
like,

1242
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,680
he had a real good shot at being
the vice president with [inaudible].

1243
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,070
It look like the all American

1244
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,530
piano.

1245
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,750
He's a liberal,

1246
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,130
he's an intelligent guy.

1247
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:44,270
He's a lawyer,

1248
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,770
he's fucking looks great.

1249
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,880
But he fucked around.

1250
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:48,440
But he was,

1251
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,610
he was bagging this camera woman
tripped over on its own deck and yeah,

1252
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:53,750
and they're there.

1253
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,730
Apparently what happened wasn't just that,

1254
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:56,870
that's not why he's in trouble.

1255
00:32:56,871 --> 00:33:01,130
Why he's in trouble is because
of his campaign finances.

1256
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,930
He apparently use some of the money to
finance her living and him hiding her.

1257
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,400
So that's what he's,

1258
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,930
it's amazing.

1259
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,220
It's amazing.

1260
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,940
As has as scandalous or not scandalous,

1261
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:17,570
but as corrupt as campaign financing
is that they'll go after him.

1262
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,111
Well,

1263
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:22,130
I think they want to go and after a guy
for stealing money from a drug dealer,

1264
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,220
like right.

1265
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,640
That's fun.

1266
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,121
The money.

1267
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,580
So shitty in campaign financing,

1268
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:30,590
the way it's coming in
and how illegal and how,

1269
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,380
how all these corporations
are financing campaigns.

1270
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,280
It's the,

1271
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,630
it's the fundamental
problem with American.

1272
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,031
You're right.

1273
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:37,460
But in the,

1274
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,480
in this instance,

1275
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,350
one of the state,

1276
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,820
one of the things about it is this to
very specific wealthy donors that he had

1277
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,654
courted.

1278
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,770
And so it was really like he bribed them
of my day yet he knew that his campaign

1279
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:51,690
was going to fall apart because
he knew that I was getting,

1280
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,551
I understand,

1281
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,890
but those fuckers are buying influence.

1282
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,120
So that's what you get.

1283
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,240
You,

1284
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,631
you know,

1285
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:59,330
you're maybe one of them
was a wealthy individuals.

1286
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,164
A woman.

1287
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,470
Yeah.

1288
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,720
But like if you saw the guy that was
financing new to campaign or Santorum's

1289
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,563
campaign,

1290
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,230
these are just EGOMANIAC
fucking rich people.

1291
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,831
Super,

1292
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:10,461
super,

1293
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:12,070
super rich that,

1294
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,780
that have done everything and
it's on their bucket list.

1295
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:16,370
And then they also have ideals like,

1296
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:16,911
you know,

1297
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,320
I think the world should be run like this.

1298
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,910
So I'm going to put
money in the pocket of a,

1299
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,140
of a politician,

1300
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,351
you know,

1301
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,720
with these super pacs
now and the way they,

1302
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,610
they do it and they go,

1303
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,190
they're buying influence politicians.

1304
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,630
I just read a great book,

1305
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,464
Lawrence Lessig,

1306
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,180
a republic lost and I've felt
this way for years cause I,

1307
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:37,190
I traveled all over the world doing
comedy in every country I went to,

1308
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,960
everybody yelled at me about America,

1309
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,780
like every single green
room of every comedy club.

1310
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,010
No matter where I went,

1311
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,550
it was like I was the representative for
America and everybody wanted to fucking

1312
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,840
yell at me about my country.

1313
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:48,590
And,

1314
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,780
and there was a lot I see
wrong with America ton,

1315
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,870
but at a certain point I started snapping.

1316
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,180
I'd be like,

1317
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,200
fuck off,

1318
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,980
fuck off.

1319
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,660
Do you buy Coca Cola will cocacola pays
for the politicians to get elected.

1320
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,330
So stop drinking coke and
then you can come bitch at me.

1321
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,480
Like if you're putting money
in the corporation's pockets,

1322
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,440
your pain for these politicians and make
the decisions people are born into a

1323
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:09,981
system of,

1324
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:13,970
they have no control of and to to blame
us for what's going on with the military

1325
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:14,840
industrial complex.

1326
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,190
I have a joke,

1327
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,360
my first album about it,

1328
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:19,310
like English people saying
you're responsible for this,

1329
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,240
you're responsible for that.

1330
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,130
Like country.

1331
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,831
Well me,

1332
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:23,870
I don't even vote I steel cable.

1333
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,131
Okay,

1334
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:26,240
you're not talking about me.

1335
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm just a dude who got shot,

1336
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,341
you know,

1337
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:30,440
shout out of a vagina some,

1338
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,910
some odd years ago and here
I am and now we're talking.

1339
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,260
This is number responsible for this
crazy fucking machine and I can't fix it

1340
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:36,471
either.

1341
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,680
I'm 24 years old.

1342
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:37,950
Yeah,

1343
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,220
okay,

1344
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,180
go fuck yourself.

1345
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,710
But there is a,

1346
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:41,311
there's this,

1347
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,410
that feeling when you go
places and you feel like

1348
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,270
I got it.

1349
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,700
I ended up making a documentary film
about it called America the punchline and

1350
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,200
about how white everywhere
I was going Comedians,

1351
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,340
I'd be in Hong Kong,

1352
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:52,270
I'd be in Dubai,

1353
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:53,260
being South Africa,

1354
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,700
they're all fucking making.

1355
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,240
I always apologize,

1356
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,060
apologize and say that I
come to you from America.

1357
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:02,240
I come to you from the balls of
the dictus fuck in the world.

1358
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,643
That's where I live

1359
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,130
and that's a very common
thing for Americans,

1360
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,650
American comedians to apologize
because it's that you have to,

1361
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,750
you get there and there.

1362
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,620
I used to go on stage in England,

1363
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,930
like back around 2003 2004 I would
walk on stage and they go to the next

1364
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:19,060
comedians and American
and I would do it for fun.

1365
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:19,601
I'd tell him,

1366
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:19,841
he'd go,

1367
00:36:19,841 --> 00:36:20,651
what do you want as your intro?

1368
00:36:20,651 --> 00:36:21,220
I'd go,

1369
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,300
just say I'm American.

1370
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,800
And they go to the next comedians.

1371
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:24,634
American.

1372
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,290
Ooh,

1373
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,330
the whole crowd would boo.

1374
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,490
Wow.

1375
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,610
Before they saw my act,

1376
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:29,911
I'm like,

1377
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:30,740
now I'm used to it.

1378
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,231
I have to.

1379
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,064
I go on,

1380
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,650
not,

1381
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,001
not in.

1382
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,530
So you did this on purpose and
then would you go up and just,

1383
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,633
I would do it.

1384
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,070
Yeah.

1385
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,321
No,

1386
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:37,471
no,

1387
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:37,740
no.

1388
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,480
In the beginning I would apologize,

1389
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,880
like when I first started going
to England and all over the world,

1390
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,571
I would apologize.

1391
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,040
And then I got to the
point where I'm like,

1392
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,440
I knew where I could stand.

1393
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:46,980
And I was like,

1394
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,880
and I liked that.

1395
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,110
I just wrote them in on it.

1396
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,720
Like,

1397
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:49,800
Oh,

1398
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,970
you just booed me now.

1399
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,600
Now,

1400
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,040
now I'm able to come after you.

1401
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,260
Because it was funny like I was,

1402
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,300
I wasn't doing well over
there when I would be like,

1403
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:57,661
oh,

1404
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:58,351
I'm sorry.

1405
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:58,780
You know,

1406
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,550
I'm sorry.

1407
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,330
But when I'd be like,

1408
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:00,781
really?

1409
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:01,440
You know who,

1410
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,310
who's our ally?

1411
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,750
You know?

1412
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,200
How are you pointing the finger
at us when you're fucking right?

1413
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,211
But even that,

1414
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:07,421
I mean,

1415
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:08,740
you're talking about we're really,

1416
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:09,220
man,

1417
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,640
you think AAA age doesn't
work for the alliance deal?

1418
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,051
I'll tell you what,

1419
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:15,520
when you're talking nonsense,

1420
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,500
I mean,

1421
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,201
even saying that,

1422
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,370
I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1423
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,360
Do you know what they're doing?

1424
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,201
Who's allies?

1425
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:21,034
What does that even mean?

1426
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,890
What's evolved in this
alliance where the lines,

1427
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,590
cheese,

1428
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,630
I just was watching yesterday,

1429
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,660
they're saying Pakistan
and Afghanistan are about,

1430
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,900
they might go to war with,

1431
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,581
well,

1432
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,830
there was a theory that
someone said to me,

1433
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:32,891
Oh,

1434
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:35,170
it was Duncan Duncan Trussell
said there's a theory.

1435
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,550
I believe he was quoting it,

1436
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:41,110
but the what it was was that the idea
is that as the world falls apart,

1437
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,260
really it's your own reality
that's falling apart.

1438
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,700
It's just the reality of the world
is that it's really a piece of your

1439
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:53,020
imagination and that as the world gets
more and more chaotic and we move closer

1440
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,250
to the end of the Mayan calendar
and there's nuclear wars,

1441
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,190
a threatened about what all that really
is Fukushima's meltdown the pollution in

1442
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,024
the oceans.

1443
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,030
It is really your own reality of your
temporary existence in this plane is

1444
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:06,994
coming to an end.

1445
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,010
I believe that to sort of maybe,

1446
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,530
I mean that's what we were talking about
earlier when we're talking about like

1447
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,510
whether or not life really
is a work of fiction.

1448
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,051
I mean,

1449
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:15,310
I wouldn't say that I believe it,

1450
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:16,390
but I don't not believe that.

1451
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,981
That's what I said,

1452
00:38:17,981 --> 00:38:19,890
because I don't know what I know I've,

1453
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,290
I've,

1454
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:20,901
I mean I,

1455
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:23,380
I get a lot of shit about these crazy,

1456
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:26,620
what if scenarios where you stop
and think about it and you're like,

1457
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,910
what if this and what if,

1458
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,863
what if this is a,

1459
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,770
this is artificial,

1460
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,510
but at a certain point in time,

1461
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,340
we know that's going to happen.

1462
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,100
If you look at like what you now what,

1463
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,540
just look at this,

1464
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,160
the fact that I can get on this laptop
and I can just watch movies and I can

1465
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:42,271
and,

1466
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,900
and interact with people and
exchange information and,

1467
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,460
and the graphics are incredible
and the photos are high definition.

1468
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,610
This is just one step in a process that
is not going to stop unless resources

1469
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:54,310
run out.

1470
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,830
And we all wind up being
fucking zombies and cannibals.

1471
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,330
I mean,

1472
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:01,150
it was really the only way civilization
is going to have to fall apart for us to

1473
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:04,630
lose our obsession with the
direction that technology is moving.

1474
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,160
There's never gonna be a time when we go,

1475
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:06,910
you know what?

1476
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,380
We have enough technology.

1477
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:09,310
We're cool with this.

1478
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,960
Well we have to do is clean up our mess.

1479
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,883
No,

1480
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,090
but there also could be the chance of a
solar flare or something that just wipes

1481
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:20,440
it all out where then the earth starts
over again like an ice age or something

1482
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,790
where we start from ground one again
where we start super possible and then you

1483
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:28,240
and you think about if we evolve
from or not if we have all,

1484
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,360
but as we evolved from apes
or were apes camp originally,

1485
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:35,860
what they came from and that whole
millions and millions of year process that

1486
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:39,540
has to start all over again
and they might not get like,

1487
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,410
we don't even know it.

1488
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,640
How do we even know if we have
gotten the the furthest along?

1489
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:45,851
You know,

1490
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:46,870
it's really fucked up man.

1491
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:49,600
When you look at those pictures
of like what we evolved from,

1492
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,650
you know,

1493
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,890
I'll steal your pithy kiss and all these
dudes that live like a million years

1494
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,460
ago.

1495
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,570
That's not that long ago.

1496
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,730
It's amazing that it go from a million
years to today and look how much

1497
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,091
different,

1498
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,560
we looked at every other ape
like one ape started standing up,

1499
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:06,161
and by the way,

1500
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:07,210
there wasn't just one of us.

1501
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,380
There was a gang of us,

1502
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:09,250
different species,

1503
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,620
a lot of them that never
made it like the Flores,

1504
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:15,970
the hobbit man that they found recently
that has recently as I think it was

1505
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:17,230
10,000 years ago,

1506
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,780
they were living coinciding
with human beings.

1507
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,620
What's the hobbit?

1508
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,730
The little hobbit people,

1509
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:22,690
a little tiny people,

1510
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,810
a tiny race of human beings on an island.

1511
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,820
Are they are,

1512
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,800
they may be like a complete set.

1513
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,980
What's the wharves are today?

1514
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,190
No,

1515
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,271
no,

1516
00:40:30,271 --> 00:40:30,400
no.

1517
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,810
There,

1518
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,080
there are tiny people there.

1519
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,070
They're in proportion.

1520
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,150
A dwarf is,

1521
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,540
the idea is that it's a genetic anomaly
in their body of they have short arms

1522
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,130
and a large head.

1523
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,760
We had on talking shit my pockets
with the other day we had a,

1524
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,510
I think it's door.

1525
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:43,661
No,

1526
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:44,441
midgets would,

1527
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:44,591
no,

1528
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:46,160
you're not allowed to say that.

1529
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,811
They explained it.

1530
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,230
We had,

1531
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,063
I had,

1532
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,490
I had as our guests,

1533
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:50,410
I had three dorms.

1534
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,830
I know it was a dwarf it
proportionate person who's very tiny.

1535
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,430
No.

1536
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,520
Which one is the proportionate?

1537
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:55,940
It's rare.

1538
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,400
So many different types of it that
they were explaining all their types,

1539
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:01,280
like a tenure,

1540
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:05,200
Lee Davis and a nickname Nicky and Brad
Williams were all in the show and they

1541
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,760
were all explaining that they all had,

1542
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,940
I think the three of them had
three different types of dwarfism.

1543
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,720
And then they talked about if they
were to have sex and have a child,

1544
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,490
like there's a 25% chance that
it could acquire like that.

1545
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,770
And they know all this because they go
to like the little people of America

1546
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:21,520
Convention,

1547
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,720
which I went to this year,

1548
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:24,160
which is fucking amazing.

1549
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,233
Um,

1550
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,460
and they,

1551
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,950
they study all this stuff
and they know like they've,

1552
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,340
I think they've isolated the
gene that causes it causes and

1553
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:34,690
uh,

1554
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,060
they know what it is and they
threw like gene therapy and every,

1555
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,220
not gene therapy or we'll,

1556
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:39,470
you know,

1557
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,071
whatever they do,

1558
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:40,940
like stem cell or whatever,

1559
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,320
they might be able to prevent it from
happening in the future and reverse it.

1560
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:45,981
No,

1561
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:46,731
they can't reverse it,

1562
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:48,470
but they might be able to
prevent it from happening.

1563
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,340
And I think a lot of doors were
upset about this saying like,

1564
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,720
you're going to kill our spaces.

1565
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,593
Yeah.

1566
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,720
It make them wrong.

1567
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,640
So you're going to just modify the
gene to make it like a sexy doors.

1568
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,840
Cause I think if they did it right,

1569
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:00,674
it would be cool.

1570
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,533
Well,

1571
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,430
I have a friend in Australia,

1572
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:04,791
this guy,

1573
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:05,240
he,

1574
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,590
uh,

1575
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,590
he Monae who is 41 pounds and he's full
grown and he is the smallest manual

1576
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:12,081
ever.

1577
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:12,680
See.

1578
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,850
And he's a standup comedian
and he is fucking tiny.

1579
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,931
And he is a thing,

1580
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:19,580
I think it's called Rhema disorder if I'm,

1581
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,473
if I'm right.

1582
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,340
And the only other person
in the world that has it,

1583
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:24,350
it is his sister and her name's Rema.

1584
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,700
And uh,

1585
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,640
he just looks like a miniature person.

1586
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,680
Everything's proportionate,

1587
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,753
everything,

1588
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,130
even his cock and uh,

1589
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:34,880
no,

1590
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,900
he claims it's big.

1591
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,743
Jose.

1592
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,810
He's a back pedal toughie.

1593
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,980
I would say

1594
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,010
he's t's,

1595
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,240
he's about up to your thigh,

1596
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,470
midway up your thigh.

1597
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,873
And uh,

1598
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,601
that's crazy.

1599
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:47,961
I mean,

1600
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:49,100
he's tiny.

1601
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,180
He's a funny comedian.

1602
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,020
Really funny.

1603
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,853
Yeah.

1604
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:52,851
Hilarious.

1605
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:54,080
And I've gotten them wasted,

1606
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:54,830
which is fun.

1607
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,490
Like I,

1608
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,390
I'm asking you to drink,

1609
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:57,650
he had wine one wine cooler.

1610
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:58,484
He smokes pot,

1611
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,000
like of what I've seen
like a fiend and drinks,

1612
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,320
like I saw him one night,

1613
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:07,220
probably have six gin
and tonics and I was,

1614
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,480
he's got long hair too,

1615
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,800
which is funky.

1616
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,440
And I had to hold his hair because
he was puking and I ended up class.

1617
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,570
I ended up carrying him
about 20 blocks home,

1618
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,053
like red,

1619
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,450
like a baby.

1620
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,250
Like I had to carry him in my arms

1621
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:26,531
first.

1622
00:43:26,531 --> 00:43:27,170
I had them on budget,

1623
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,950
like a sandbag.

1624
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,060
Did you get them in a gable grip?

1625
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,270
First item on my shoulder,

1626
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:33,000
like a parrot.

1627
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,660
Do you get them in the Guillotine group?

1628
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:35,600
It's an odd group.

1629
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,230
This to palm outward and
the other one inward.

1630
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:40,230
It's really good for kids,

1631
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:40,940
teens.

1632
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,570
And then,

1633
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,820
and then I just took it
back to my house and uh,

1634
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,370
and I let him pass out
on my couch because,

1635
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:46,730
uh,

1636
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,040
he was just so fucked up and
he would add to get home.

1637
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:49,874
And I was like,

1638
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,211
you know,

1639
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,400
you don't want like a stumbling
door for walking around the street.

1640
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:53,750
What is,

1641
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,430
he technically is not a door frame.

1642
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,350
He has this thing called Rhema disorder,

1643
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,390
but what does what what I'm getting at,

1644
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,120
they don't like the word
[inaudible] the word midget,

1645
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,090
but he used to be that there was like
midgets and dwarves and there were two

1646
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,790
different Midge Midge it comes
from the word image or something,

1647
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:08,750
which is an insect.

1648
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,500
So you're calling them an insect and they
also don't like it because their whole

1649
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:13,334
lives,

1650
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,770
they've been identified
as look at the midget.

1651
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,260
And so it's not like,

1652
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,370
it's just seems so weird that the name
change is going to change anything,

1653
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,031
isn't it really?

1654
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:24,950
The intent with you know mean I agree,

1655
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:25,784
but I think,

1656
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,440
I think it's like when you look at,

1657
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:29,150
like when I said like cracker,

1658
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:30,830
the word cracker doesn't hurt anyone.

1659
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,190
Nobody's ever gone.

1660
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,290
That upsets and I'm,

1661
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,010
I'm one for like I say on stage,

1662
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,440
I say absolutely every word
I can possibly think of.

1663
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,030
I have a joke about him.

1664
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:39,211
I go,

1665
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,160
my best friends is a,

1666
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,041
is a midget,

1667
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,590
he's a real life du Du du Lu
and he hates the word midget.

1668
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:44,190
He,

1669
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,370
he says that's the most offensive
thing you can call a little person.

1670
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,941
And I'm like,

1671
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:49,140
what about Nigger midget?

1672
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,810
And that's a,

1673
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:54,870
that's a lot more because it's not like
your people are enslaved except in the

1674
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:55,704
wizard of Oz.

1675
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,110
But they like,

1676
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,340
I understand where they're coming from
that their whole life because I've been

1677
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,860
with and I feel like you've got to just
give it to them just because they've got

1678
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:05,700
Delta shitty hand.

1679
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:08,130
If that's going to make you happier
that we won't say major that I won't say

1680
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,973
man,

1681
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,973
I've walked home,

1682
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,960
I've walked down the street
with them and it's amazing.

1683
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,490
Like when you're with a black person,

1684
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,920
people aren't pointing
it this day and age,

1685
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,491
yelling,

1686
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:18,420
look at the n word,

1687
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,460
but when you're with a little person,

1688
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,130
people fucking point and yell.

1689
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,150
Do you watch game of Thrones?

1690
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:24,780
No.

1691
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,480
Everyone's telling me I have to
go one little dude who's on the,

1692
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:28,380
I don't know his name.

1693
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,000
I should probably look at the purpose.

1694
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,841
Fucking brilliant.

1695
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,790
And he steals the show that got shows.

1696
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,590
God Damn is that the famous,

1697
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,060
the famous little guy.

1698
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,730
Dinklage Peter.

1699
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,201
Just one,

1700
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:40,771
something like that.

1701
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,420
That he's really good.

1702
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:42,631
Yeah,

1703
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:43,381
he's a great actor.

1704
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:44,880
He's the best actor in the show.

1705
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:45,931
Well,

1706
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:50,760
Nikki was on nick who was on our podcast
the other night is in boardwalk empire.

1707
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:51,630
He's the fighter.

1708
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,120
Do you know Dick Nickname?

1709
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,953
Vicky?

1710
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:55,580
No,

1711
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,110
I thought he said Lipnick he before,

1712
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,570
like

1713
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:00,780
he's,

1714
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,850
he's kind of a midget,

1715
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:04,581
isn't it?

1716
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:05,120
Your buddy?

1717
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,950
Yeah,

1718
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:06,710
right buddy?

1719
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,543
I don't want to park couch.

1720
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,620
No.

1721
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,510
John Headphones Buddy.

1722
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,633
Oh yeah,

1723
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,890
he chokes out front apparently.

1724
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,340
You know,

1725
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,510
I would do Jujitsu,

1726
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,320
like I'm kind of with you on that,

1727
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,960
that in a couple of other reasons,

1728
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:21,080
but I would do Jujitsu if
somebody like Rhonda Rozy,

1729
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:21,610
uh,

1730
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,830
it took like five other of the
hottest girls and it was just like,

1731
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,980
you have to choose one
of these girls every day.

1732
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:29,060
You get to choose kind of like,

1733
00:46:29,061 --> 00:46:29,241
you know,

1734
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:29,511
like,

1735
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:29,840
uh,

1736
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,150
like,

1737
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,330
uh,

1738
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,030
the bunny ranch and then you choose
which one you want and it's Nogi and you,

1739
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,390
they will teach you Jujitsu.

1740
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,410
I would do it that way.

1741
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:36,920
Teach you,

1742
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,131
yeah,

1743
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:37,670
but listen,

1744
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,503
I've wrestled,

1745
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,520
I wrestled women and if
you're just training,

1746
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:41,301
if they're just being,

1747
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:42,160
teachers won't know.

1748
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:42,570
No,

1749
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:42,920
fuck it.

1750
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,890
I wrestled two girls in a Jello.

1751
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,470
I wrestled two girls in a jello
wrestling contest for a radio promotion.

1752
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,813
And uh,

1753
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,560
I said to the girls beforehand,

1754
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:52,310
I go,

1755
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,060
hey,

1756
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,740
and these weren't UFC girls.

1757
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,640
They're just girls.

1758
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,240
And I go,

1759
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,421
Hey,

1760
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:57,231
let's take it easy.

1761
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,430
No one needs to get hurt here.

1762
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:58,881
Like,

1763
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:00,160
I know I can't be,

1764
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,910
I can't fucking beat the shit out of them.

1765
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:02,241
Everybody's,

1766
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:02,511
and you're like,

1767
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:03,344
you're an asshole.

1768
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,170
So I know they're just going
to club the shit out of me.

1769
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:07,004
So I'm like,

1770
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,290
I had watched during the Jello wrestling,

1771
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,470
I was the only guy in it.

1772
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,090
It was all chicks and me and the,

1773
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:14,480
the round before me,

1774
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:15,890
a chick,

1775
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:16,840
the bottom of the,

1776
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,330
uh,

1777
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:17,730
it was like,

1778
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,430
just like one of those inflatable pools,

1779
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,910
right?

1780
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,920
The bottom of the pool was just on cement.

1781
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,840
So they're wrestling on,

1782
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,890
on a piece of nylon over cement.

1783
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,211
Oh,

1784
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:26,600
Jesus.

1785
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,920
And I watched this girl pick up a girl
slammer and her hits the ground and I

1786
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:30,100
hear

1787
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,933
the girl goes,

1788
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,200
oh,

1789
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,440
I'm going to go broke my jaw.

1790
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:33,820
And I'm like,

1791
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,870
this is fucking,

1792
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,620
and then I'm going in next and the
girls are taunting me and they're going,

1793
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:41,730
we're going to kick your ass is
after you can watch it on you if you,

1794
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,890
if you Google Eddie gift,

1795
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,320
a Jello wrestling,

1796
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:45,100
you can watch.

1797
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,790
So the girls are fucking
beating the fuck out of me.

1798
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:49,870
Beating the fuck.

1799
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,250
Like I had scratches
and blood coming like,

1800
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,760
and I'm going calm the fuck down.

1801
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:54,911
Like,

1802
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:55,780
this is a show,

1803
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,673
not like,

1804
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:57,460
and,

1805
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,510
and they're gouging it,

1806
00:47:58,511 --> 00:47:59,110
me and all that.

1807
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,220
So finally I just was like,

1808
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:00,521
all right,

1809
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:00,881
that's it.

1810
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,330
So I thought,

1811
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:01,901
what can I do?

1812
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,910
I can't fucking hurt them.

1813
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,860
So I just started like pulling off their,

1814
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:06,310
their,

1815
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,020
their bikini tops and bottoms.

1816
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,831
And I was like,

1817
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,740
at least that's where
there'll become defensive.

1818
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,350
So if I just start showing
their titties to everybody,

1819
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:15,430
you know,

1820
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,641
I,

1821
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:17,200
when I look like the good guy,

1822
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:19,870
the crowd likes me and sure enough,

1823
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,823
uh,

1824
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,870
I accidentally fingered one of them.

1825
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:23,704
I think

1826
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,910
one of the chips you can watch,

1827
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,420
I pick her up and body
slammer and you just hear ago,

1828
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,220
I broke my fucking nose.

1829
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:34,540
You blood everywhere.

1830
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,520
Body slammed her and she broke her nose.

1831
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,250
They were beating the fuck out of me.

1832
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,300
Oh Wow.

1833
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:41,621
Oh my God,

1834
00:48:41,621 --> 00:48:41,921
Dude.

1835
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:43,180
They're beating the shit out of you.

1836
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,111
What is the name of this?

1837
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:46,150
How to run youtube,

1838
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:46,451
Eddie,

1839
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:47,830
if a jello wrestling.

1840
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,491
Oh my God,

1841
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:48,671
dude,

1842
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:50,080
they're trying to fuck you up.

1843
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,550
So you weren't on the offensive,

1844
00:48:58,551 --> 00:48:59,960
you were just being defensive here.

1845
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,731
Cause I gotta tell you,

1846
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,990
I think I could take these two bitches.

1847
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,723
Yeah.

1848
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,631
What do you do?

1849
00:49:06,631 --> 00:49:07,051
Oh yeah,

1850
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:07,920
you got her Bra.

1851
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:08,803
No mouse.

1852
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,571
You know what dude,

1853
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,060
you tried to be gentlemanly
even how you took off her bra.

1854
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,370
Oh Shit.

1855
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,850
Oh that bitch totally broke her
nose and she's laughing about it.

1856
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,870
And what a psycho.

1857
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:20,611
Oh my God,

1858
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:21,420
that checks a psych.

1859
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,641
What,

1860
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:23,040
what do you do in that situation?

1861
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,030
I don't do that.

1862
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,863
I wouldn't know.

1863
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,710
I don't like,

1864
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,180
I don't like me when I get mad.

1865
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:27,940
You try to finger,

1866
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,980
it's that sounded like the hulk.

1867
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:29,970
He wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

1868
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,090
I don't want to get a physical vehicle.

1869
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,080
I don't want to ever put
myself in a position where
I'm physical with a check at

1870
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:37,914
all like that.

1871
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,610
Me Neither.

1872
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,870
And I like in high school,

1873
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:40,770
one time I had a girl,

1874
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,690
I beat up her brother and uh,

1875
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,130
luckily he's a fair fight kind of thing.

1876
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:44,790
I beat him up.

1877
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,660
We need a fist fight.

1878
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,610
I won and she was older,

1879
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:50,580
like two years older and she
was like the biggest burnout,

1880
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:54,390
fucking hardcore like crazy bitch
in the school and everybody's like,

1881
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,140
you're dead.

1882
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,590
She came to get me and she beat me
up in front of the whole high school.

1883
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,560
Like she was just slapping me in the
face and punched and I just had to sit

1884
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:05,550
there and take it and I just sat
there and just took every po like,

1885
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:05,940
and just,

1886
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,130
I just kept calling her a con.

1887
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,100
There's a woman,

1888
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,260
there's this woman who was a lesbian and
she was also a like a really high level

1889
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,360
taekwondo players.

1890
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:14,940
She was,

1891
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,880
she had fought in a lot of
national tournament's placed.

1892
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:18,600
She had been,

1893
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,260
she was like,

1894
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,100
she was very good.

1895
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,150
And um,

1896
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:25,200
she was a in the class and
she had this hard on from men.

1897
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,250
Like she would especially
that weren't as good as her.

1898
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,290
She would beat the fuck out of that.

1899
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,250
She would be,

1900
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,360
she'd beat the fuck out of Steve.

1901
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,571
You know,

1902
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,350
Steve Graham,

1903
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,183
remember Steve,

1904
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,560
my buddy Steve beat the fuck out of Steve.

1905
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,090
And then I had to go with our next and
the only reason why my instructor paired

1906
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:44,150
me up with her was to punish her because
she shouldn't have been going with me.

1907
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:44,541
I was,

1908
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,740
that was when I was like,

1909
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,200
I was a US Open champion for time,

1910
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:49,240
Massachusetts state champion.

1911
00:50:49,241 --> 00:50:53,270
It was a man and I was just a lot faster
and stronger than us and bigger and she

1912
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,650
fucking attacked me.

1913
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,080
She screamed like it was sparring.

1914
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:57,351
Okay,

1915
00:50:57,351 --> 00:50:58,190
this is not a fight.

1916
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:03,191
This is sparring and she screamed and
just charged at me and I put a whooping on

1917
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:05,354
this bitch.

1918
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,220
I don't,

1919
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,150
I never usually beat girls up,

1920
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:09,590
but I put a beat on that girl.

1921
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,641
I didn't hit her,

1922
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:11,870
I didn't hit her in her face.

1923
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,750
I only hit her in her body
and but I clowned her.

1924
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,660
I would like oh do things to her
that I knew she couldn't do to me.

1925
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:21,110
I like double kicker would kick with my
left foot and the kick or my rifle at

1926
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,470
the same time about to
stand right in front.

1927
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,750
I just did a bunch of shit that she
couldn't do to me because you're at such a

1928
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,650
disadvantage.

1929
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,180
Like I've always thought I'm,

1930
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,051
yeah it was,

1931
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:31,150
it was all a,

1932
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:31,521
yeah,

1933
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,840
cause like I've seen that work.

1934
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,410
Girls want to enter like that kind of
sport and I'm all for women playing

1935
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:36,711
sports.

1936
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:37,340
If you're,

1937
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,230
if you're an equal that's fine.

1938
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,770
But in a sport like this that there's
a cultural exchange there that makes it

1939
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:43,470
like,

1940
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,211
like football.

1941
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:44,421
You know,

1942
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:45,560
when a girl wants to play football,

1943
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,693
you know,

1944
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,730
how do you feel about him?

1945
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,440
Like a god,

1946
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,131
it's going to get,

1947
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:50,630
it's like girls in the military.

1948
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,130
Well let me explain it to you.

1949
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,240
When it comes to martial arts,

1950
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:53,960
it's real simple.

1951
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,060
You don't take advantage of
anybody that's below you.

1952
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:56,421
You,

1953
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:59,720
you try to be as nice as possible
to the underclass when you don't,

1954
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:01,580
I mean occasionally when you're sparring,

1955
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:02,810
especially with the contact,

1956
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:03,800
like kicking and punching,

1957
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,140
someone gets knocked out and,

1958
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,690
but you don't ever try to knock out
someone who's a lower ranked than you.

1959
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:09,950
You always try to control yourself.

1960
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:10,831
Sit Happen.

1961
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:13,910
Sometimes people running things or
you catch someone funny and it just,

1962
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,920
you didn't know you're gonna knock
'em out and they go unconscious.

1963
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:16,640
That would happen,

1964
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,980
but you should never do it on purpose.

1965
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,260
And when someone who's a black belt,

1966
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:25,640
like this woman was went after this guy
who had like fucking 20 knee surgeries

1967
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,620
can't move that good and he's not,

1968
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:27,861
you know,

1969
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:29,660
he's only a green belt to just start off.

1970
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,080
And she went and attacked him like
it was a god Damn Street fight.

1971
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:33,561
It was.

1972
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:33,951
There's a,

1973
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:38,150
there's a level of aggression that people
sometimes will take out on people in

1974
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:38,601
sparring.

1975
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:40,880
The only reason they do
it is because they can,

1976
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,020
it's just bullying.

1977
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,011
That's all it is.

1978
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:44,030
It's straight bullying.

1979
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,000
She would go after guys and
beat the shit out of him,

1980
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,380
but I see her spar women,

1981
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,490
nothing like that.

1982
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:49,930
Man.

1983
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:50,990
When she would spar women,

1984
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:52,490
she would take it easy on them.

1985
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:53,120
She would,

1986
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,710
she would pull her punches and kicks.

1987
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,600
She was trying to knock guys out.

1988
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,441
There was a,

1989
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,770
there was a real aggression to what she
charged after me may like screamed at

1990
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:00,861
me.

1991
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,800
I was like 19 and when I was 19 I was,

1992
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,780
I was half crazy and I was
not taking it from some bitch.

1993
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,910
I put a beating on this check.

1994
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,520
I stomped her in the chest.

1995
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,550
I remember like not not knowing how to
hit her so that it was more of a push

1996
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:19,880
than a kick,

1997
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,930
but just to let her know what's up.

1998
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,120
Launched her to the air
and she's skid on her butt.

1999
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,560
And then I chased her
down and they stood over

2000
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,680
and then I let her get back up and
then I just started beating on her.

2001
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,480
I'll never forget this because I was,

2002
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:33,240
it was a real moment in
my life where I said,

2003
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,650
I am not going to hurt her.

2004
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,040
I am not going to hurt her because my
instincts were to knock on unconscious.

2005
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,690
My instincts were to kick her in the face.

2006
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,111
I was like,

2007
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:41,130
I'm gonna kick this pitch in the face,

2008
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,211
but I can't.

2009
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:42,301
I,

2010
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:42,660
there's like,

2011
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,800
there's no way you can do that.

2012
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,431
So it was a,

2013
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:44,791
it was a,

2014
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,450
it was a battle because I was in a fight
with a woman because if it was a guy

2015
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:50,310
and he took advantage of
another guy like that,

2016
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:50,700
you would,

2017
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,010
that's your thought is I'm
going to knock this guy out.

2018
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,150
I'm gonna kick him in the face.

2019
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:55,650
He deserves this.

2020
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,910
But then you go,

2021
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:00,780
I have to make a concession
here because this is a woman.

2022
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,640
So he said,

2023
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,473
you have to like,

2024
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,380
I mean,

2025
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,711
there were,

2026
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:07,750
there were times in the gym where
it just became all out fights and,

2027
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:08,010
uh,

2028
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:08,470
luck.

2029
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,670
There was two times that I could
really remember one of them.

2030
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:12,301
Unfortunately,

2031
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:14,250
it was when we had concrete floors,

2032
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,000
we only had office carpeting
over concrete floors,

2033
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:19,980
and we would spar full contact.

2034
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,090
This is no bullshit.

2035
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,280
And this was a hardcore fucking school.

2036
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,273
We would fight in these,

2037
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,740
these taekwondo tournament,

2038
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:26,431
and they were scary.

2039
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:30,240
But the training was scarier than the
fucking fights because at least the f the

2040
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:30,900
training,

2041
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,411
you know,

2042
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:32,010
would,

2043
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,180
you would be with your friends.

2044
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,170
It sounds like fight club,

2045
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,281
you know,

2046
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:38,250
all their shit and they're all preparing
and you're gonna have to find a four or

2047
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:38,461
five,

2048
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:39,900
six times when you're fighting,

2049
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,910
you're probably going to find someone
who's not as good as your training

2050
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,700
partners and you're not going
to have to fight as many times.

2051
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:44,930
You know,

2052
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,170
it's like it was way easier,

2053
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:50,190
but like new guys would come in all the
time and it would wind up being just a

2054
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:50,791
brawl.

2055
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,660
That's all it was.

2056
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:52,470
It'd been,

2057
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,650
I can't remember how many times we had
to drive people to the hospital after we

2058
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:56,460
fucked them up.

2059
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,820
Cause we would get in these situations
where a guy would come in from another

2060
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,770
school and a year usually
weren't that good,

2061
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:02,281
you know,

2062
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:03,060
and they would get,

2063
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,230
they would get cocky or insulin and then
the instructor would let them go join

2064
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:07,621
class.

2065
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:07,771
Like,

2066
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,460
go ahead,

2067
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,001
put your club.

2068
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,020
Would you like to join our class?

2069
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,460
We can have the first class for free.

2070
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,830
And we know we were just supposed
to beat the fuck out of this guy.

2071
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,873
So it was like,

2072
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,010
it was completely irresponsible.

2073
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,570
But that's how it was handled when
anybody was a Adeline and they came to the

2074
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:21,871
school,

2075
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:24,900
he wound up being a street
fight and Hong Kong Crete.

2076
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,690
It was a thin office carpet on concrete.

2077
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,310
So this is how I essentially
grew up from age 15 to 21.

2078
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,330
That's all I did.

2079
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,610
So when some chick is screaming at me,

2080
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:36,630
chasing after me,

2081
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,510
like she's going to like attack me after
I watched her just beat up my friend,

2082
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,141
you know,

2083
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:40,470
there was,

2084
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,520
that was not happening,

2085
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,540
but it was,

2086
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,350
it was a milestone for me where
I was able to not hurt her.

2087
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:46,831
You know,

2088
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:47,970
it was like very important.

2089
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:49,530
So it was like 20 pounds
heavier than I was.

2090
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:50,364
Totally unfair,

2091
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,200
but I was able to not hurt her.

2092
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,250
Very important.

2093
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:53,581
Well,

2094
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:54,061
I was,

2095
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:54,540
uh,

2096
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,790
I don't know if it was the
night we did your show,

2097
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,011
but,

2098
00:55:57,011 --> 00:55:57,844
uh,

2099
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,940
I was at a comedy club one night,

2100
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:00,600
uh,

2101
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,140
and afterwards there was a,

2102
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,240
there was an argument I was,

2103
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,330
I had headlined there or something.

2104
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,400
There was an argument about
buying drinks or something,

2105
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,040
and a couple of argued
with a waitress and the,

2106
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,510
the women were fighting the,

2107
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:12,850
the,

2108
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,160
the,

2109
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,160
the girl that didn't want to pay our
bill was arguing with the waitress at the

2110
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:18,420
comedy club and they were screaming,

2111
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:19,254
yelling at each other.

2112
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,840
It pours out kind of into the street.

2113
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,483
And

2114
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,570
the,

2115
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:24,680
uh,

2116
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,680
waiter stands up for the waitress.

2117
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,530
This black dude standing
up for the waitress going,

2118
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:29,801
hey,

2119
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:30,460
you know,

2120
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,870
you need to back off,

2121
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:32,051
blah,

2122
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:32,201
blah,

2123
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,034
blah.

2124
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,790
And so then her husband gets in.

2125
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,750
So it's the black guy and the
husband who's a Mexican date,

2126
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,391
so black guy,

2127
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:41,224
Mexican dude,

2128
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,100
and the Mexican guy's wife is standing
behind them and they're arguing and

2129
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:45,791
they're about the,

2130
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,200
it's escalating into a fight.

2131
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,430
And you can tell the Mexican
dude does not want to fight,

2132
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,300
but he's,

2133
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,740
he standing his ground,

2134
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:54,820
but he doesn't want to fight.

2135
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:55,001
You know,

2136
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:56,230
when two guys are going in,

2137
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:57,064
the black dudes like,

2138
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,490
Yo,

2139
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,690
get the fuck outta here.

2140
00:56:58,890 --> 00:56:59,380
You know,

2141
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,750
you pay your bill,

2142
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,481
get the fuck out,

2143
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:01,601
blah,

2144
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:01,751
blah,

2145
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:01,991
blah,

2146
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:02,830
and the Meccan fuck you.

2147
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:03,281
Fuck you.

2148
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:04,170
A lot of fuck yous,

2149
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:04,751
you know,

2150
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:05,670
in a fight to escalate.

2151
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,120
But you can tell,

2152
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,800
no one really wants to fight.

2153
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,100
He's wife comes over to the shoulder and
punches the black dude from the comedy

2154
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:15,274
club that works there.

2155
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,140
Oh No.

2156
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,420
And I see the whole thing
and I thought to myself,

2157
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,730
I've never an and an what I thought
should have happened right there is the

2158
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:27,880
black dude and the Mexican
dude should a high fived and

2159
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,120
the Shit Outta his wife.

2160
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:30,763
Like she,

2161
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,790
cause she just got two guys in a fight
who like one guy didn't want to find him,

2162
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:37,800
probably was going to
get his ass character.

2163
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,620
Yeah.

2164
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,910
Her husband didn't want to fight.

2165
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,521
The black,

2166
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:43,250
didn't just wanting to break
up and now she's got now there,

2167
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:44,470
they have to fight each other,

2168
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:45,370
which they did.

2169
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,630
And by the way,

2170
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,650
the black dude got a good punch in
on her really because she hit on me.

2171
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:51,640
He hit her right back.

2172
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,940
He hit both of them as
he should copy craziness.

2173
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,170
Cops show up and they're like,

2174
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:56,651
what happened?

2175
00:57:56,651 --> 00:57:56,980
I'm like,

2176
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,813
take her,

2177
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,773
take her.

2178
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,340
There's your,

2179
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,130
I had an ex girlfriends or a
swing at me that's assault.

2180
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,130
If you ever had an ex girlfriend.

2181
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,491
Oh yeah.

2182
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:04,324
I've had a couple of,

2183
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,890
that's the darkest moment ever.

2184
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:06,401
When you really,

2185
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:07,010
oh my God,

2186
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,290
someone is fucking punching me.

2187
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:11,020
A girl punched me on set once
to just didn't quite catch me.

2188
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,370
I put my hand up just in time.

2189
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:13,600
I was doing this show.

2190
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,390
It was for Merv Griffin and um,

2191
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,080
uh,

2192
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,700
it was a law show,

2193
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,140
like a,

2194
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,260
like a courtroom show.

2195
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,510
We were going to call it like Rogan's law.

2196
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,290
It was like,

2197
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,340
I wasn't really a judge,

2198
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:25,720
but I would like decide your cases.

2199
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,590
It's been done since then again.

2200
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,910
I think Paul Mooney did it.

2201
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,211
No,

2202
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:30,880
no.

2203
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,840
I rarely does it.

2204
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:32,921
Comedy quarter.

2205
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:33,101
Yeah,

2206
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:33,730
exactly.

2207
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,870
And then someone else did it too.

2208
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,733
There was another one,

2209
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:37,930
I don't remember who
the other comic was too.

2210
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,710
But anyway,

2211
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,841
the,

2212
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:40,030
so it's a funny idea.

2213
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:40,953
It could have been fun,

2214
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,670
but they had a bailiff or whatever.

2215
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:44,530
It was a court reporter,

2216
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:45,364
the court reporter,

2217
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,720
and she was this chick
professional hot check,

2218
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,990
a little worn out,

2219
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:50,863
little weathered,

2220
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,370
you know,

2221
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:55,150
not a bad girl but was
partying fucking hard.

2222
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,600
I mean just red lining it.

2223
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,720
And she was one of those girls that would
come over and she would flirt with all

2224
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:02,920
the writers.

2225
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:04,090
And I mean this is like,

2226
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:05,680
she hadn't really done anything yet.

2227
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,690
She had a star on her back and I go,

2228
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:08,261
why do you have a star?

2229
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:09,880
She'll self fulfilling prophecy.

2230
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,373
She actually said that,

2231
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,100
which is,

2232
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,900
that's how I mean you say whoa man.

2233
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:15,430
But that's all a lot of actors think.

2234
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,620
And I tell you before I had children,

2235
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,730
I looked at it completely differently
cause I used to look at it and go through

2236
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:23,870
this fucking crazy bitch fucking
self fulfilling prophecy.

2237
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:24,980
I would go agro with it,

2238
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:25,191
right?

2239
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:25,520
Yeah.

2240
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,460
But now I look at it and I see a little
kid that was just raised all fucked up.

2241
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:30,290
You know,

2242
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,930
she was only like 29 or 30 years
old or something like that.

2243
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,120
And she looked like she
was closing in on 40.

2244
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:38,330
She looked 10 years older than her
age and she was just hitting it hard.

2245
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:38,660
And two,

2246
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,980
I probably was a great girl.

2247
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:43,490
She probably wasn't batches
they all need love or something.

2248
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:46,340
They're all broken and damaged on little
children that just didn't get enough

2249
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:46,701
attention.

2250
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:49,580
They should change the Hollywood
sign to daddy didn't love me.

2251
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,220
Yeah,

2252
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,053
it's true.

2253
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,160
That's my problem.

2254
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:52,821
So,

2255
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:53,240
um,

2256
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,750
anyway,

2257
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,110
um,

2258
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:54,470
she,

2259
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:58,010
she goes out the night before
we have to film and uh,

2260
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,050
I don't know if she's nervous
because this is like a,

2261
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,500
you know,

2262
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,030
this is like the first
thing that she's ever done,

2263
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,780
this pilot and she gets coke,

2264
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:05,990
does it to the gills.

2265
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:09,950
She stays up all night and she shows up
in the morning to film with no sleep,

2266
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,740
no sleep and crashing hard,

2267
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,380
crashing hard and going full psycho mode.

2268
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,131
And you know,

2269
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:18,200
I'm the one who's got to take these cases.

2270
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,490
So they tell me,

2271
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,060
um,

2272
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,190
what the subject of each cases,

2273
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:22,750
right?

2274
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,310
I before I meet the people and they
actually come up with the case.

2275
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,740
I sit down with a notepad
and I started going,

2276
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:28,080
okay,

2277
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,000
these are real problems.

2278
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,230
These people are like real issues.

2279
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:30,620
It's like,

2280
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:30,831
you know,

2281
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:34,160
I have to really figure out what this
is and what's funny about it and I'm

2282
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,900
trying to make it so some
sitting there writing,

2283
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:36,590
it's like,

2284
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,460
Oh God,

2285
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:37,951
I'm so tense,

2286
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:38,161
Joe,

2287
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:39,290
can you give me a massage?

2288
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,150
Can you give me [inaudible]?

2289
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:40,761
I go,

2290
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:41,960
you don't even have to do anything,

2291
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,290
are you?

2292
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,280
You're just sitting there.

2293
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:43,821
I go,

2294
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:44,870
you don't have to worry about it.

2295
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:45,081
I go,

2296
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:45,831
don't be tense.

2297
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:46,071
I go,

2298
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:47,360
I have to write all this stuff down.

2299
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:47,781
I have to,

2300
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,614
I have to ad Lib.

2301
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,101
I go,

2302
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:49,460
we only,

2303
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,630
we're going to film in like two hours.

2304
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:51,470
I really can't

2305
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,300
you fucking asshole you fucking house all.

2306
01:00:55,301 --> 01:00:56,680
I just asked you to be nice.

2307
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,950
I just asked you to read.

2308
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:59,940
Now it's like I'm
fucking nervous and I am,

2309
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,540
and it was just complete 100% psycho.

2310
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:04,900
Yeah.

2311
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,960
She just did not have any
connection with reality.

2312
01:01:07,961 --> 01:01:12,850
There was no rational response to
the way the conversation was going,

2313
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,211
you know,

2314
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,740
you should like if someone says,

2315
01:01:14,741 --> 01:01:15,910
can I have a massage?

2316
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:16,691
You know,

2317
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:18,220
and then you tell them
that you're working,

2318
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:18,790
they should be like,

2319
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:19,180
oh,

2320
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,511
okay,

2321
01:01:19,511 --> 01:01:20,260
sorry,

2322
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:20,861
what am I doing?

2323
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:21,730
Asking you for a massage.

2324
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,270
You know,

2325
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:23,230
laugh about it.

2326
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,220
Like silly me,

2327
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:24,371
I'm,

2328
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:25,031
you're the one that needs,

2329
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:26,320
I'll get somebody else to rub my back.

2330
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:27,154
Don't worry about it.

2331
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,600
But it was like this weird thing
where she wanted attention.

2332
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,050
She wanted like sexual attention.

2333
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:33,610
She wanted to be attractive.

2334
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:34,720
She wanted someone to,

2335
01:01:34,721 --> 01:01:34,900
uh,

2336
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,120
to dote on her so that
she would feel better.

2337
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:41,080
But she was just whacked out from the
coke or whatever the fuck she was doing

2338
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:42,190
math or whenever it was.

2339
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:46,180
But she was clearly up all night and she
was with her friend and her friend just

2340
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:46,900
had these,

2341
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,290
these,

2342
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,060
this thousand yard stare,

2343
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,270
this just lost look in her eye.

2344
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:52,631
Like,

2345
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:52,871
you know,

2346
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:57,460
like these bitches had just been to nom
and came back with their shoes and their

2347
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:59,770
hands barefoot walking to the parking lot,

2348
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,341
looking at it,

2349
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,330
take a hooker bath.

2350
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:03,850
And the dressing room sink
and I'm not bullshitting.

2351
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,530
So she's like throwing makeup on.

2352
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:08,260
But she's super frustrating cause
she's got heavy bags under her eyes.

2353
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,970
She's just gacked out of her head.

2354
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,600
Yeah.

2355
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,141
And so,

2356
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:11,291
uh,

2357
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:13,720
they wound up using a
girl who was an extra,

2358
01:02:13,721 --> 01:02:14,381
they fired her.

2359
01:02:14,381 --> 01:02:15,310
She took a swing at me.

2360
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,810
That's what I didn't get to the point.

2361
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,260
She took a swing at me.

2362
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:19,590
And when you no,

2363
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,100
I said,

2364
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,341
well,

2365
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:20,761
I was like,

2366
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:21,960
what are you talking about?

2367
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:22,770
I go,

2368
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,030
you're acting crazy.

2369
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:24,631
I go,

2370
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:25,110
we're,

2371
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,400
we're about to film this thing.

2372
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:26,830
I go,

2373
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:27,391
why do you,

2374
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:29,190
why are you demanding so
much attention from me?

2375
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:29,701
I go,

2376
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:30,510
please.

2377
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,700
And she fucking just hauled back.

2378
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:33,061
And I'm like,

2379
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:33,271
no,

2380
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:34,980
this bitch is not hitting me right now.

2381
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,030
And I'm like halfway.

2382
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:36,630
And I'm like,

2383
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:36,901
Dude,

2384
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:38,100
you better get your fucking hand off.

2385
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,180
She's going to hit you in the face.

2386
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:39,750
Full swing.

2387
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:40,111
Yeah.

2388
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:40,831
Full swing.

2389
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:41,161
Yeah.

2390
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:41,421
She,

2391
01:02:41,421 --> 01:02:42,450
she took a swing at me,

2392
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:42,840
man.

2393
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,760
And I caught it like last one.

2394
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,030
I was like,

2395
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,571
oh my God,

2396
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:46,171
you're hitting me.

2397
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:46,800
Really?

2398
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,690
I don't understand that because that's,

2399
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,010
that's fucking a salt.

2400
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,161
Yeah,

2401
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:50,994
that's what I said to her.

2402
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,491
Which way to,

2403
01:02:52,491 --> 01:02:52,891
or even more,

2404
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:53,130
I go,

2405
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,700
excuse me,

2406
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,630
that's illegal.

2407
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,051
I go,

2408
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:55,884
that's a assault.

2409
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:57,060
You can go to jail for that.

2410
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,200
You shouldn't be hitting people.

2411
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:58,770
You know?

2412
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,310
Look man,

2413
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,430
a man should certainly not hit a woman by,

2414
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,850
by any stretch of the imagination.

2415
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:04,260
And then she,

2416
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:04,741
exactly.

2417
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:05,880
And men shouldn't hit men,

2418
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,660
but women,

2419
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:06,891
you're,

2420
01:03:06,891 --> 01:03:07,740
you're hitting a man.

2421
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:08,910
You're crazy.

2422
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,330
That's like if I went over and punched
a monkey or a gorilla or something like

2423
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:12,541
that,

2424
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:13,530
the thing that kill you,

2425
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:14,581
what are you doing?

2426
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:15,600
You're going to hit a man.

2427
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,260
Somebody,

2428
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,700
I just saw something that somebody said,

2429
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,920
those bumper stickers,

2430
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,470
there's never an excuse
for a man to hit a woman.

2431
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,200
And it's like there's never an
excuse for anyone to hit anyone.

2432
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:25,470
Yeah,

2433
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,100
exactly.

2434
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,780
Unless it's self defense.

2435
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:30,420
Unless you're trying to save your
life or your consciousness or,

2436
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,820
or stop someone from
beating somebody else up.

2437
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:33,061
But yeah,

2438
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:33,300
I mean,

2439
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:33,931
I had a girlfriend,

2440
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,580
her doing that to a girl doing that.

2441
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:35,821
To me,

2442
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:38,400
it's like me going up to Alistair
Overeem and punching him.

2443
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,301
I'd want to do that.

2444
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:40,410
He's going to fucking kill me.

2445
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,530
I had a girlfriend punch me
while I was in bed sleeping.

2446
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,483
Oh my

2447
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,040
drives.

2448
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,873
I tagged.

2449
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,540
I didn't pay for it though.

2450
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,250
Brian's all like whatever,

2451
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:51,084
whatever.

2452
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,570
I woke up with this just wailing on me.

2453
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:54,960
Yeah,

2454
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,040
that's kind of what mine was.

2455
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,190
I kicked the girl like I,

2456
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:58,930
she was living with me.

2457
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,581
I kicked her out.

2458
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:00,160
I was like,

2459
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:00,630
she was just,

2460
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:04,620
she was like out all night doing coke and
not coming home and shit like that and

2461
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:04,861
I go,

2462
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:05,790
just fucking move.

2463
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:06,650
Just get your shit out.

2464
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,600
So I come home one night and her
dog has shit all over my house,

2465
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,100
like everywhere I go.

2466
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:13,380
And she was supposed to be home
and she just stayed out all night.

2467
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,281
Like I was out.

2468
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:17,730
I come back and her dog shit all
over my house and she didn't like,

2469
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:18,331
and I go,

2470
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:18,900
that's it.

2471
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,231
That's it.

2472
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:19,740
And she was up,

2473
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,491
she was hot.

2474
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:21,301
She was super hot.

2475
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:22,111
She was a stripper.

2476
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:23,340
And if my fault,

2477
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:23,820
I know,

2478
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,151
you know,

2479
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,680
like you know what he's talking about.

2480
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:26,610
It sounds perfect.

2481
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:27,031
I know that.

2482
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:27,400
I mean,

2483
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,800
everything sounds like it's in place.

2484
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:29,630
Yeah.

2485
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,280
But like we've got it all when you were,

2486
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:32,041
when you,

2487
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:32,970
when your data's stripper,

2488
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:34,620
it's like doing heroin the first time.

2489
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:34,891
It's like,

2490
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:36,330
all this is fucking amazing.

2491
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,860
And then the next time and your
friends are all shaking your head did,

2492
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,681
you don't want to do this.

2493
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:42,420
It always ends up ugly.

2494
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:42,931
And you're like,

2495
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:43,111
no,

2496
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:43,231
no,

2497
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:43,471
no,

2498
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:43,860
this is,

2499
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,910
this one's different.

2500
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:45,990
This one's different.

2501
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,610
So I've dated strippers,

2502
01:04:47,611 --> 01:04:48,900
it turned out to be very nice girls.

2503
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,210
But I saw,

2504
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,440
and I'm friends with some
girls that are dancers,

2505
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:54,600
but this one was fucking
the psycho she has,

2506
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:55,800
there are a lot of schools out there.

2507
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,370
So I go,

2508
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:56,611
I go,

2509
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:56,920
you gotta,

2510
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,840
you gotta go,

2511
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:58,380
you gotta get out.

2512
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,610
I called her on the front.

2513
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:02,130
I go and put in your shit
outside my house and,

2514
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,930
and just come and get it and go.

2515
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:04,980
She doesn't have a lot of stuff.

2516
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:05,281
I was like,

2517
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:07,510
just come get your stuff
and go somewhere and go,

2518
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:07,571
oh,

2519
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,110
that's what you fucked up because you,

2520
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,200
you made her come to you.

2521
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,070
You should never do that.

2522
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:14,370
We were supposed to do is have it
brought to her by the blackest dude,

2523
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:15,120
you know,

2524
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,010
and I didn't realize the biggest,

2525
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:17,370
yeah.

2526
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:18,210
I not scared,

2527
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:19,211
whatever,

2528
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:19,481
you know,

2529
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:19,690
it's,

2530
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,160
if you don't get a black Samoan,

2531
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:23,380
we'll do angry looking Simone,

2532
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,590
hopefully with some fucking
visible tattoos near his neck.

2533
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:27,810
I,

2534
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:28,540
I,

2535
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,860
I came home and I was just like,

2536
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:31,060
fuck the dog and shit.

2537
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:31,721
I was so mad.

2538
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:32,350
I was like,

2539
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,370
but I didn't do it.

2540
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:34,540
I didn't put her stuff outside,

2541
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:40,090
but she came home and raged and I'm
just in bed sleeping and she just starts

2542
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,110
wailing on me.

2543
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:41,891
What the fuck?

2544
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:42,161
She goes,

2545
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:42,970
you're lucky.

2546
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:43,420
She goes,

2547
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,000
I almost called the cops
and told them you had a gun.

2548
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:47,230
And I'm like,

2549
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,210
they would have taken me to
jail like w how crazy are you?

2550
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,210
And a funny thing is I broke
up with her since then and,

2551
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:55,630
uh,

2552
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:56,530
like years ago.

2553
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,280
And uh,

2554
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,010
I just googled her to see what's going on.

2555
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,130
The only thing I could find,

2556
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,220
he said she was arrested for assault.

2557
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,860
I'm like some other dude.

2558
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:06,510
Got It.

2559
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:06,660
Yeah.

2560
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:06,761
Well,

2561
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:09,310
some people grow up thinking
it's okay to hit people,

2562
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,940
you know what I mean?

2563
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,410
Especially like in the household,

2564
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:13,450
if they see their mom and her
dad beating each other up,

2565
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:16,270
they grow up in that environment and
they think that that's how relationships

2566
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:16,780
are.

2567
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,740
You get mad at someone,

2568
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:19,630
you lash out at them like a child.

2569
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,240
I have one girlfriend do it,

2570
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:23,530
but she didn't really do it.

2571
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:25,090
She kind of halfheartedly did it.

2572
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,570
She just is mad at me and she was young
and we were both young and she was like

2573
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:31,210
20 I was like 21 she
sorta took a swing at him.

2574
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,980
He kinda ducked under it.

2575
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:33,910
I had a girl,

2576
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,140
I had a girl kick me.

2577
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:36,600
I think the only time I,

2578
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:37,210
I've,

2579
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:42,210
I think I've called a girl a contar face
like a couple times in my life in New

2580
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:43,421
York.

2581
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:47,860
I'm getting a taxi was not living
unless you have too many to count.

2582
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,870
I said to their face,

2583
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:53,831
oh really?

2584
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:54,760
That doesn't mean anything.

2585
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:55,870
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

2586
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,440
I'm standing on the
street in New York City.

2587
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:00,221
It's five in the morning.

2588
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:01,150
I've just come out of a bar.

2589
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:05,560
I've been drinking all night and I hail
a cab and you know how like sometimes

2590
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:09,100
you'll be standing there and somebody
else has been waiting longer than you,

2591
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:10,420
but they're down the street a bit.

2592
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:11,920
I'm waiting.

2593
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,230
I held his cab and it stops for me.

2594
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,530
So I opened the door but she sees it
stopped for me and she's been waiting.

2595
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:21,760
She comes running up the street to
where I am and she's like screaming.

2596
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:26,761
So I like stop and look and she pulls
back and she's got on those fucking New

2597
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,101
York City,

2598
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:27,911
fuck me boots.

2599
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:30,220
You know that they all wear
the black leather high,

2600
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:30,551
you know,

2601
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,150
like,

2602
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,380
like knee high boots.

2603
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:37,590
She pulls back and kicked me in the Shin
as hard as she can and it felt like a

2604
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:42,370
chip on my bone came out of my Shin
and I just looked at her and I wait,

2605
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:47,430
you [inaudible] and as
[inaudible] was coming out,

2606
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:49,110
I,

2607
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,340
it didn't even get to
fully come out cause her,

2608
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:54,550
her right fucking hook
hit me right in the face.

2609
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,140
Like she punched me as I said,

2610
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:56,974
God.

2611
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,813
And I'm like,

2612
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,350
you fucking psycho.

2613
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,810
And I was so angry that I
did not know what to do.

2614
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:05,260
I look at her boyfriend and I
go and I look at her and I go,

2615
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,940
and I had like a bunch
of dudes with me too.

2616
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:07,630
I go,

2617
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:10,150
I'm going to beat the
fuck out of him right now.

2618
01:08:10,151 --> 01:08:12,310
He's going to die because you did that.

2619
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:12,761
I'm like,

2620
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,140
I'm going to fucking kill him.

2621
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:14,711
I'm like,

2622
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:15,650
you're fucking dead,

2623
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:15,791
dude.

2624
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:16,010
You're

2625
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,843
fucking dead.

2626
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,390
And,

2627
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,290
and he just grabbed her.

2628
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:18,501
He goes,

2629
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:18,801
come on,

2630
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:19,221
let's go,

2631
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:19,940
let's go.

2632
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:22,070
Because I couldn't like
do anything to her.

2633
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,220
I should add or a rescue
palm struggler right.

2634
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:26,054
And then those

2635
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:28,401
open hand,

2636
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:29,810
like this map,

2637
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,860
just a good gorilla slap.

2638
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:33,630
The nose goes bad.

2639
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:34,540
And you know,

2640
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,430
I've have these conversations
before with people and there's,

2641
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,370
there's some people that have this
really black and white thing with women.

2642
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:41,690
Like you cannot ever hit women,

2643
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,250
which is crazy.

2644
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:44,450
A women will stab you.

2645
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:46,130
[inaudible] a woman will kill you.

2646
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:46,261
I,

2647
01:08:46,261 --> 01:08:47,990
I know a dude who got killed by his wife.

2648
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:48,201
Okay.

2649
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:49,910
Don't tell me you should cause guess what?

2650
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:50,840
If a woman pulls a gun on,

2651
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:51,890
you should punch her in the face.

2652
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:52,620
If you can't,

2653
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,160
it's the way to save your life
to say that you shouldn't.

2654
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:55,251
Oh,

2655
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:57,140
of course you shouldn't go
out of your way to do it.

2656
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:57,951
And you know,

2657
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:59,030
and when I say that,

2658
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:01,550
I've called a lot of women constants
cause I've lived motherfucker,

2659
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:02,361
okay.

2660
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:05,870
I've been a God standup comedian
working in bars for 23 years.

2661
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,920
You don't think I ever run across a few
days and count on stage melamine for

2662
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:10,311
some,

2663
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:11,300
for some people,

2664
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:12,040
you know,

2665
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:16,100
like I get accused sometimes of being a
misogynist because I'm just honest about

2666
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:16,191
it.

2667
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:17,900
But no one loves women more than me.

2668
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,130
My house is filled with women.

2669
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,540
My daughters are all women.

2670
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,440
I have women everywhere.

2671
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:22,610
I mean I wrote a girl cat.

2672
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,473
I love women.

2673
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,200
I just don't,

2674
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,470
I just don't like I do girls ever.

2675
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,650
My house has half pink,

2676
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,860
but I don't like cons.

2677
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,410
I love,

2678
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:31,101
I love women,

2679
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:32,120
I love Nice people.

2680
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:33,140
I love Nice men.

2681
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:34,290
I don't like Douche bag.

2682
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,520
But it's a weird thing and
we've brought it up before,

2683
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:39,920
but it bears noting and re repeating.

2684
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,100
Why is it that if you
have a problem with guys,

2685
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:44,570
nobody ever says you hate men.

2686
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,230
Yeah,

2687
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:45,920
there's not even a,

2688
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,880
there is a word for it.

2689
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:47,870
Because I brought this up once.

2690
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:48,111
I said,

2691
01:09:48,111 --> 01:09:48,801
there's no word.

2692
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:49,760
I tried to write a joke about it.

2693
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:50,390
I said,

2694
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,631
you know,

2695
01:09:50,631 --> 01:09:52,190
there's a word for hating women saw,

2696
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,980
but there's no word for
hating men other than lesbian.

2697
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,143
And uh,

2698
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,400
and like somebody,

2699
01:09:58,401 --> 01:09:59,420
there is a word,

2700
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:00,290
whatever the word is,

2701
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,124
nobody knows it.

2702
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,440
But the important thing
is it's not respected.

2703
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,761
It's a weird thing.

2704
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:07,190
It's like when women are allowed to,

2705
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:07,570
uh,

2706
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,010
you're,

2707
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,620
you're allowed to say things like that.

2708
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,500
[inaudible] week dude's are allowed
to say things to when a guy says,

2709
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,190
you hate women,

2710
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:13,941
God damn it,

2711
01:10:13,941 --> 01:10:15,200
that it's one of my pet peeves.

2712
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:15,621
Like,

2713
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:16,760
you fucking pussy.

2714
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:18,020
You goddamn trader.

2715
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,340
What team are you want?

2716
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,860
A guy gets in an argument
with a con and you're like,

2717
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,180
Ooh,

2718
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,361
I've,

2719
01:10:22,361 --> 01:10:23,510
I've seen it happen man.

2720
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:24,890
There was a guy who did it to me once.

2721
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:25,850
We were at a club.

2722
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,121
Okay,

2723
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:26,661
this is bad.

2724
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:30,920
And this is after a friend of mine had
killed his best friend in a drunk driving

2725
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:32,870
accident when I was in high school.

2726
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,303
I don't want to say his name,

2727
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,210
Tim.

2728
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:35,480
Uh,

2729
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:35,931
he,

2730
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:36,230
uh,

2731
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,350
lived right down the street from me.

2732
01:10:37,351 --> 01:10:39,260
He killed his buddy in a
drunk driving accident.

2733
01:10:39,261 --> 01:10:40,160
It was devastating.

2734
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,851
And I remember,

2735
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:41,631
I'll never forget,

2736
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:42,200
Tim and I,

2737
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,600
we lived in the same neighborhood and I
was walking down the street and it was

2738
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:45,830
like a couple of weeks after it happened,

2739
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:47,720
he still had the marks all over his face.

2740
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,060
He was walking up the street.

2741
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,270
I was walking down the street.

2742
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,140
I looked at him and I said,

2743
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,710
oh,

2744
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,011
I said,

2745
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:55,700
what's up to him?

2746
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,533
He goes,

2747
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,200
and he just walked past me and I,

2748
01:10:59,260 --> 01:10:59,630
I,

2749
01:10:59,630 --> 01:10:59,871
I,

2750
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:04,871
the fucking palpable feeling of sadness
and regret and shame and horror.

2751
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:11,040
And the story was he was drunk and he
crashed his car and the cops were standing

2752
01:11:11,721 --> 01:11:13,590
over him when he woke up in the hospital

2753
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,630
and he said,

2754
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,830
the cop said something,

2755
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:17,461
something like,

2756
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:18,450
congratulations.

2757
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:18,781
And he goes,

2758
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:19,220
what?

2759
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:19,650
What?

2760
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,720
He goes and regulations
that you killed your friend,

2761
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:22,621
you're,

2762
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:25,020
you're a fucking murderer because you
were drunk and he killed your friend.

2763
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:28,650
So he tried to jump out the window and
they grabbed him and stopped him from

2764
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,730
trunk jumping out the window.

2765
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:30,600
So it was,

2766
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,860
this was right after this happened.

2767
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,161
Okay,

2768
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:36,900
I'm doing standup and I'm on
Martha's vineyard and there's people,

2769
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:40,290
not Martha Sweet Cape Cod and
people down the Cape would get food.

2770
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,213
Good.

2771
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,670
And it was me and a couple

2772
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,520
other dudes and I'm,

2773
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,500
one of them was this guy who
was not a very funny guy,

2774
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:49,670
but he was like one of those guys.

2775
01:11:49,671 --> 01:11:51,650
It was always trying to be like,

2776
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,980
he is always trying to pick
women's sides on everything.

2777
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:55,251
It was like,

2778
01:11:55,251 --> 01:11:55,671
it was not,

2779
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:56,270
it was a guy,

2780
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,500
he was like super captain,

2781
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,520
left wing liberal.

2782
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,181
Right.

2783
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,140
And these girls are,

2784
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:02,690
I'm hackle on the show
and they're hammered,

2785
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,650
they're fucking hammered
and we're outside and um,

2786
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:06,960
uh,

2787
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,251
we're,

2788
01:12:07,251 --> 01:12:07,760
we're,

2789
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,091
we've,

2790
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:08,960
we've done our gig.

2791
01:12:08,961 --> 01:12:09,890
That gig was a hell Gig,

2792
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,370
you know,

2793
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:10,971
it was terrible.

2794
01:12:10,971 --> 01:12:13,310
There was a hockey game going on
in the refuse to turn the game off.

2795
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:14,930
Instead they just turn the volume down.

2796
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,510
So the hockey games on it

2797
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,710
people every couple of months.

2798
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:18,880
Oh,

2799
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:20,200
they would yell for the hockey game.

2800
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:21,450
It was just one of those gigs that you had

2801
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,333
do when you were young.

2802
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,270
These girls were outside and they are
about to get in their car and they're

2803
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:27,530
fucking slosh.

2804
01:12:27,531 --> 01:12:28,790
And I am so angry.

2805
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:29,661
I'm so angry.

2806
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:31,910
Cause I'm just thinking about my friend
Timmy walking up the street and I'm

2807
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:32,031
like,

2808
01:12:32,031 --> 01:12:32,864
what the fuck?

2809
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:33,501
And I go,

2810
01:12:33,501 --> 01:12:33,710
dude,

2811
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,210
these fucking drunk pigs.

2812
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:35,661
I go,

2813
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:36,051
it's not,

2814
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:39,230
it's not bad enough that you've got a
heckle at a comedy show and scream and

2815
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:41,450
yell and ruin everybody's night
now you're going to go drunk,

2816
01:12:41,451 --> 01:12:43,070
drive you fucking pig.

2817
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:43,821
You know?

2818
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:48,080
And they were just fat slopping
gross and just mutants and,

2819
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,280
and this guy turns to me,

2820
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:49,580
he goes,

2821
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,031
hey man,

2822
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:52,040
I don't appreciate you
talking about women like that.

2823
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:53,181
I go,

2824
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,380
I'm not talking about all women.

2825
01:12:54,381 --> 01:12:54,801
You'd dump.

2826
01:12:54,801 --> 01:12:55,520
Fuck yeah.

2827
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,930
And these drunk pigs.

2828
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:57,500
I go,

2829
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,520
if those were guys,

2830
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,820
would I be allowed to
captain vagina and be,

2831
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,750
I'd be allowed to call them pigs the fuck.

2832
01:13:02,751 --> 01:13:03,491
Of course I would.

2833
01:13:03,491 --> 01:13:03,740
Yeah.

2834
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:04,790
These are cut humans.

2835
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:05,740
These are human.

2836
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,630
If I get five guys walking down the
street and Klu Klux Klan outfits,

2837
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,650
you know you're allowed to.

2838
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,430
He like,

2839
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,260
he like confronted me with it.

2840
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,600
Like I really don't appreciate
you talking about women like that.

2841
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:14,840
Yeah,

2842
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,720
I've been in that argument in Boston.

2843
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:19,400
Have a lot of that man.

2844
01:13:19,401 --> 01:13:20,450
There was a lot of like,

2845
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,220
I always feel that's,

2846
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,600
there's that guy,

2847
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:25,730
that type of guy that tries to get laid.

2848
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:26,750
He can't get laid.

2849
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:27,584
That's the problem.

2850
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:28,370
But that's his,

2851
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:33,050
that's his thing and he thinks
that's his angle into it and it's so,

2852
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:34,790
he's just as bad as anyone.

2853
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,380
Like it's his it.

2854
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,700
It's fucked up.

2855
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:38,870
Yeah,

2856
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:40,760
but I said what I said earlier,

2857
01:13:40,761 --> 01:13:41,720
it's really true.

2858
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,490
A Garden and tells you that is a trader.

2859
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,210
That's what he is.

2860
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:48,200
He's selling out as gender for a couple
of Brownie points with women so he could

2861
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:49,034
be close to them.

2862
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:49,491
Mrs,

2863
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:50,720
can I sit by the fire?

2864
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:52,370
You've been such a good boy.

2865
01:13:52,371 --> 01:13:53,450
Sit by the fire.

2866
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,630
Thank you my love.

2867
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:55,843
Thank you.

2868
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,220
He just wants to be close and
get scraps from the table.

2869
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,380
That's a guy who never
gorilla fucked a girl.

2870
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,950
He's never ripped a girls' panties off
or stuffed or under the corner of a couch

2871
01:14:03,951 --> 01:14:04,620
and sweat.

2872
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,320
Honor when you're fucking her so hard,

2873
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:08,870
you're dripping sweat off
your chest under a face.

2874
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,910
My contacts and my chest hair.

2875
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,040
Then she puts her hands

2876
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,873
through it and just,

2877
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:17,890
you got to get some furious fucking going
on to achieve those kind of levels of,

2878
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,211
of cool,

2879
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:20,050
off sweat,

2880
01:14:20,051 --> 01:14:20,800
whatever.

2881
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,640
Some dude's just,

2882
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:21,930
they,

2883
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:22,170
they,

2884
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:22,961
they're born in this,

2885
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:25,840
this crazy life with a weak hand.

2886
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:26,890
Everything's week.

2887
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,120
Their parents are weak.

2888
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,320
Their genetics are weak,

2889
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:30,640
their situations week or out,

2890
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:31,280
it looks weak.

2891
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,320
Their characters week,

2892
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:33,490
their discipline is weak.

2893
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,780
They don't accomplish what they want.

2894
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:35,920
They don't have the courage to go after.

2895
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,330
They want what they want to achieve.

2896
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,400
That I'd ever become the
man they wish they could be.

2897
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,180
So all they do along the way is try to
define the boundaries for everybody else

2898
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:45,340
and tell everybody else how they
should think it should not behave.

2899
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,270
And the guys that they hide behind
unfortunately is a good one.

2900
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,920
The guys that you should be a nice person.

2901
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,330
It shouldn't be an asshole.

2902
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,051
Hates women.

2903
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:53,470
I mean,

2904
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:54,040
I've had,

2905
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,390
I've been around people that hate women.

2906
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:55,931
It's an ugly,

2907
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:57,700
ugly thing when you hate all women.

2908
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:58,990
That's a really gross thing.

2909
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:00,130
I don't like that at all.

2910
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,100
We've got a lot of those fans
on our podcast that you do.

2911
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:04,870
Oh and hey has the most,

2912
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,310
they're the,

2913
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,530
when they used to have this fucking
hater shows where they would do these

2914
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:08,851
comments,

2915
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:10,780
so they booed dom Irrera in Philadelphia.

2916
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:11,711
I've seen that.

2917
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:14,680
That's the famous one where bill burr
went out and shit on Philadelphia for like

2918
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:15,840
10 minutes fast.

2919
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,070
It's one of the greatest
comedy performances of all.

2920
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:20,080
It really is and it keeps
going back to the time,

2921
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:20,861
seven minutes,

2922
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:22,210
and I'm doing all my time.

2923
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,460
The best line is when he
makes fun of the flyers,

2924
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:26,560
the Philadelphia flyers
for wearing slacks.

2925
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:27,760
How build the best line is,

2926
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:29,230
fuck you and fuck the liberty.

2927
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:34,521
Oh,

2928
01:15:34,521 --> 01:15:35,161
that's funny.

2929
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:35,850
Glasses.

2930
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:36,980
I've had those,

2931
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:41,480
those shows where it's gone
that wrong and you're like,

2932
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,200
no.

2933
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,990
Like none of them have ever been
close to as good as bill birds.

2934
01:15:44,991 --> 01:15:46,280
Like what he did up there,

2935
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:51,350
because mine by ramp will
last two a minute maybe.

2936
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:52,203
You know,

2937
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:53,360
I hate all of you.

2938
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:54,260
I hope the fucking,

2939
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,210
I hope the fucking ceiling collapses.

2940
01:15:56,211 --> 01:15:57,830
Like where the Indiana state fair.

2941
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:58,843
You know I've,

2942
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:59,660
I've set it up,

2943
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,010
but that's a dated reference on Jab.

2944
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:02,863
Nobody remembers.

2945
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:08,770
He kept going and going and
going and going and it was like,

2946
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,760
and he was pulling out every reference,

2947
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,840
every Philadelphia think
the bridge and the rocky.

2948
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:15,970
He goes,

2949
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,090
you've got real world champions.

2950
01:16:17,091 --> 01:16:17,360
You're like,

2951
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,021
Joe Frazier,

2952
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:20,210
who you worship a fake
guy from a fucking movie.

2953
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,010
So fucking amazing.

2954
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:22,844
He killed it.

2955
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,400
I can't leave with how
often comedians snap.

2956
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,390
There's not more videos of
the solo videos or snaps.

2957
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:29,721
Man,

2958
01:16:29,721 --> 01:16:30,430
there's a lot.

2959
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,430
This is a gang,

2960
01:16:31,431 --> 01:16:32,660
a heckler videos from me,

2961
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:33,494
man.

2962
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:38,830
There's one firm from last
time I was up in Edmonton.

2963
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:40,723
There's a,

2964
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,020
the river Cree,

2965
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:42,921
there's one,

2966
01:16:42,921 --> 01:16:43,460
there's some,

2967
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,060
some check.

2968
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,140
She wouldn't sit down.

2969
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:46,880
I think I fucked with her for 20 minutes.

2970
01:16:46,881 --> 01:16:47,690
It was ridiculous.

2971
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,860
Where are you playing
in a theater up there.

2972
01:16:48,861 --> 01:16:49,694
Where you at?

2973
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,630
Cherry Creek Casino.

2974
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,620
Yeah,

2975
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,520
that place is great.

2976
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,150
That's funny.

2977
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,320
They do fights up there a lot too.

2978
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:55,430
It was a lot of MMA fans.

2979
01:16:55,431 --> 01:16:56,750
They have the MFC is up there.

2980
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:58,130
I've been to Edmonton a couple of times.

2981
01:16:58,131 --> 01:17:00,020
They have these crazy
shows they'd take like,

2982
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,560
you know,

2983
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,410
pretty high level talent like a lot of
those guys come up through there and wind

2984
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:04,490
up being UFC guys,

2985
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,290
you know,

2986
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:06,260
high level guys.

2987
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:10,070
So they have like a good base
of mixed arts fan up there

2988
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,341
too.

2989
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:13,550
And this plus China
gotten into MMA at all?

2990
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,091
Yes.

2991
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:15,610
They're getting into it now because uh,

2992
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,311
the dude,

2993
01:17:16,311 --> 01:17:16,821
the weight lifter,

2994
01:17:16,821 --> 01:17:17,461
Sean Waxman,

2995
01:17:17,461 --> 01:17:19,580
who was telling us how China is a,

2996
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:19,911
he's like,

2997
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:23,030
just wait til they get into
crossfit because he said,

2998
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,481
you know,

2999
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,980
Olympic weightlifting is massive there.

3000
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:29,930
He was claiming the Olympic weightlifting
is like second to a soccer around the

3001
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:30,890
world as a sport.

3002
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,900
And it's just not recognized
really in America.

3003
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:35,360
It's not a big sport in
America and around the world.

3004
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:35,961
It's massive.

3005
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:38,360
Like in Russia and China,

3006
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,281
China will,

3007
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:42,920
there's 2 billion people in China and
it's a fucking massive sport in China and

3008
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:43,191
he's like,

3009
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,680
just wait till these
fuckers get into crossfit.

3010
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:46,251
He's like,

3011
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:48,760
just wait cause they're
there and it's all,

3012
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,330
I was thinking the same thing with MMA.

3013
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,313
I mean are they,

3014
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,520
do they have a history because,

3015
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:53,810
because China also,

3016
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:54,650
the way they,

3017
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,680
they put money into a sport and
they like pull you out of your life.

3018
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:57,891
You know,

3019
01:17:57,891 --> 01:17:59,720
it's Kinda like Russia
used to and they're like,

3020
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,720
you are going to be a javelin thrower.

3021
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,510
That's what you're going
to do for the rest of you.

3022
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:06,080
You are going to be known
as a javelin thrower.

3023
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,790
Like if,

3024
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,150
if they start doing the same kind of
thing with MMA where it's like they're

3025
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:14,210
taking young kids that look like they
have the size to build the speed,

3026
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,290
everything and going,

3027
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,180
all right,

3028
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:16,460
you know,

3029
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,071
here we go.

3030
01:18:17,071 --> 01:18:17,960
Have time to train you.

3031
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,220
That doesn't always work though.

3032
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:19,761
Really.

3033
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:22,190
The funny thing is it's
like giving someone welfare.

3034
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:24,410
A lot of times you got to
have the drive yourself.

3035
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:24,621
Yeah.

3036
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:24,981
You got it.

3037
01:18:24,981 --> 01:18:25,681
Sometimes the,

3038
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:30,540
the guys who make it through like having
shitty jobs and getting to the top

3039
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:30,771
though.

3040
01:18:30,771 --> 01:18:32,720
So like Anderson Silva
worked at Mcdonald's.

3041
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:33,913
You know what I mean?

3042
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:34,980
There's,

3043
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,270
there's something about that,

3044
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:36,840
you know,

3045
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,760
Jon Jones was a bouncer with a,

3046
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:41,310
a young girlfriend who with a child,

3047
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:41,970
you know.

3048
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:42,803
You know what I'm saying?

3049
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:46,590
That's why that dude like
gutted it up and became warrior.

3050
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:47,130
Yeah.

3051
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:47,790
But it's true.

3052
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,750
I mean that's the real story.

3053
01:18:48,751 --> 01:18:51,020
John has two children
and that's what he would,

3054
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,350
that's why he dropped out of it

3055
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:52,741
college.

3056
01:18:52,741 --> 01:18:54,360
He was going to wrestle for Iowa.

3057
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:55,201
Yeah,

3058
01:18:55,201 --> 01:18:55,430
but,

3059
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,263
but if,

3060
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,840
if you gave them like more of a,

3061
01:18:58,841 --> 01:18:59,250
uh,

3062
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,920
like a foundation as a young kid,

3063
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,710
let's say they had it as
a kid and they weren't,

3064
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:05,810
they weren't pushed into it,

3065
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,490
but they were doing it a lot
younger at w what age do kids start?

3066
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:09,430
Like a damage?

3067
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:09,810
It too.

3068
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:10,950
Some of them start really young.

3069
01:19:10,951 --> 01:19:11,460
Some stuff,

3070
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,870
four or five really.

3071
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:16,380
Somebody told me it's not good to have a
kid do it cause they don't have the uh,

3072
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:17,543
the cognitive,

3073
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,030
a two year olds and my four
year old choke each other.

3074
01:19:20,031 --> 01:19:21,050
I teach them that chose each other.

3075
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:24,680
I teach them how to tap
out cause they knew.

3076
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,600
They naturally start
wrestling on the yeah.

3077
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,740
So while the rest of them on the bed,

3078
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:30,560
I teach them what this is I control and
this is how you get out of the guard.

3079
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,140
You don't want to be here because
he or she can control you.

3080
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,170
I teach them really young
so this is a part of their,

3081
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:36,561
their way,

3082
01:19:36,561 --> 01:19:37,670
their body's moving.

3083
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,340
Like what if you see my two
year old and my four year old,

3084
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:44,360
they have Jiu Jitsu matches my two year
old Mount Sir and my four year old hip

3085
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:46,370
escapes and she'll pull guard.

3086
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,170
It's fucking pretty wild to see.

3087
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,050
But it's just from showing
them little natural moves.

3088
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,450
I don't teach them how to finish
each other but they do anyway.

3089
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:54,320
They choke each other.

3090
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,730
Especially the two year old,

3091
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,600
the two year old,

3092
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,400
she favors a fade or a million encode
style rear naked choke where she grips

3093
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,440
like this and pulls it across the trake.

3094
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,690
She likes to trick,

3095
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,533
choke you.

3096
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,010
She doesn't go for like
the Jujitsu leverage.

3097
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:08,490
Once she,

3098
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:11,850
she goes for a real nasty
catch lock sort of choke

3099
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,393
is cats.

3100
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:16,470
They just,

3101
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,303
it's natural.

3102
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:17,941
It's natural.

3103
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:21,600
The kids roll around and play together
and teach them how to get into better

3104
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:22,210
positions.

3105
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:23,970
That's another reason
I wouldn't do Jujitsu.

3106
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:24,973
I,

3107
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,510
I used to when I was a kid,

3108
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:29,190
when guys would like wrestle in the pool.

3109
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,310
I hated that because I
always had this like fear,

3110
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:37,020
like I surf a lot and when I get hold
downs it makes me go fucking like,

3111
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:37,860
I gotta go sit.

3112
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:42,940
What do you think about that guy that
got killed recently in South Africa?

3113
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,980
Oh yeah.

3114
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,530
I've surfed down there.

3115
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,060
You ever Seen Sharks while you're surfing?

3116
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:52,320
The other day I was surfing and I
went to a duck dive under a wave.

3117
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:52,680
It was,

3118
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,960
and it was about four to
six feet or something.

3119
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,790
I go to duck dive and you ducked out,

3120
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:00,330
you dip your board
below you so it doesn't,

3121
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:04,430
the wave doesn't catch it and then you
go kind of under the wave and the waves

3122
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:09,440
coming up on me in the face of the wave
and I just see a fucking giant fish

3123
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,940
shoot across in front of me.

3124
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:16,900
So it's like pulling away from me and
all I can do is rather than like continue

3125
01:21:16,901 --> 01:21:17,521
my duck dive,

3126
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:20,010
which would have been probably
the smartest thing to do,

3127
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,130
I lifted like back then,

3128
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,460
thus like throwing me into a
back flip like the board May,

3129
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,131
Oh my God,

3130
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:28,170
like board first,

3131
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:29,520
then my legs back over,

3132
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:29,941
boom,

3133
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:30,121
boom,

3134
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:30,421
boom.

3135
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:31,980
Like getting held down.

3136
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:33,330
You know what is a duck dive?

3137
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:38,220
You pushed the board under the nose of
the board under the wave and so that the

3138
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:40,620
wave goes over you and
doesn't take you with it.

3139
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,300
You actually don't take the force of the
wave and you get through the wave and

3140
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:46,230
you end up on the other side.

3141
01:21:46,231 --> 01:21:47,310
This is on your paddle out.

3142
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:47,951
Oh,

3143
01:21:47,951 --> 01:21:48,271
I see,

3144
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:48,541
I see,

3145
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:48,960
I see.

3146
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,140
So as I'm about to duck dive
through it on the face of the wave,

3147
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:53,160
I see the fish go,

3148
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:55,260
how big,

3149
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:55,830
how many feet?

3150
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:59,610
It must've been like four or five feet
and I went away from you or long long.

3151
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,470
And I just went ah,

3152
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:03,690
and went backwards and flip.

3153
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:06,600
Then as I'm getting tumbled in the
Whitewater and going through the wash,

3154
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:07,830
I'm like fuck,

3155
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:08,490
like I'm,

3156
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,530
I'm getting held down so no breath.

3157
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:11,131
And I'm like fuck,

3158
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:14,820
trying to get to the surface so I
can start swimming as fast as I can.

3159
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,043
And uh,

3160
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,160
I pull up and I looked back to see if I
see a fin or something and it's a seal

3161
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:21,443
and it's like,

3162
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,830
it's like laughing at me.

3163
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,960
I caught a seal once accidentally.

3164
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:25,560
Oh,

3165
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,380
I cut the line when I saw was a CEO.

3166
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:29,200
We're were fishing and uh,

3167
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:29,701
we were,

3168
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:32,730
I forgot what we're trying to catch when
we were fishing with bait also on the

3169
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:33,391
line poles.

3170
01:22:33,391 --> 01:22:35,280
Big giant fish.

3171
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:35,401
Yeah.

3172
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:36,234
That's fucking big.

3173
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:36,690
Yeah,

3174
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,440
it's a seal.

3175
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,540
But I've seen a of sucks though.

3176
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,380
You feel like shit,

3177
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:42,780
it'd be terrible to sketch burger king.

3178
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,450
What is it as a seal or a sea lion?

3179
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:46,981
What do they see?

3180
01:22:46,981 --> 01:22:47,580
Lines or see,

3181
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,720
I think there are two different things.

3182
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,930
The things that you see off of California,

3183
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:52,141
right?

3184
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:53,580
Aren't they see sea lions?

3185
01:22:53,581 --> 01:22:53,790
Yeah.

3186
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:54,031
No,

3187
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:55,950
but I think what I saw
the other day was a seal.

3188
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,180
I'm pretty sure it was a seal.

3189
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,290
You know what's really fucked up,

3190
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:58,561
man?

3191
01:22:58,561 --> 01:22:59,730
Those leopard seals.

3192
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,260
Have you ever seen those things?

3193
01:23:01,261 --> 01:23:02,580
See Leopard sharks all the time?

3194
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:03,220
Yeah.

3195
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:04,530
Leopard seal is like,

3196
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,070
it doesn't seem like a real animal.

3197
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,140
Leopard seal seems like
something from Star Wars.

3198
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:13,410
It's a seal that's super predatory and
as giant teeth and it's fucking hugely,

3199
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:13,951
yeah,

3200
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:14,890
it was in that movie,

3201
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:15,724
happy feet.

3202
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,511
It was like the,

3203
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:16,631
uh,

3204
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:17,770
the enemy in the movie.

3205
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:18,604
Happy feet.

3206
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,910
And that's how I found out about it.

3207
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:21,730
Real.

3208
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:22,040
Yeah.

3209
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:22,420
No.

3210
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:22,841
Or it was,

3211
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:22,931
it,

3212
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:23,820
was it happy feeder was,

3213
01:23:23,821 --> 01:23:24,011
no,

3214
01:23:24,011 --> 01:23:26,170
it was the actual march of the penguins.

3215
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:28,210
It was actually march
of the penguins because,

3216
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:28,361
uh,

3217
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:28,810
that's,

3218
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:29,361
that's their,

3219
01:23:29,361 --> 01:23:30,190
their main enemy.

3220
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,750
That's what leopard seals eat.

3221
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:33,100
Penguins.

3222
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,180
That's like their main food.

3223
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,650
They're so scary.

3224
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,550
They kill people.

3225
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,910
They've killed people that they
recently killed a photographer,

3226
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:40,330
someone that got attacked and mauled.

3227
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:40,481
Yeah.

3228
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:41,314
There's all kinds of things.

3229
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,730
I've got clients or photography,

3230
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:43,750
lazy stories of a Dolphin.

3231
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:44,650
I've seen a,

3232
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:45,760
have you ever seen a leopard seal?

3233
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:45,900
Now?

3234
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:46,460
I've never told him.

3235
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,290
Pull up a photo man.

3236
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:47,650
It's Kinda,

3237
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,371
it's kind of freaky.

3238
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:51,550
I had the shark alarm went
off on me in Bondai Australia.

3239
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:51,881
What's,

3240
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:52,714
what does that mean?

3241
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,090
I'm surfing and all of a sudden I hear

3242
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:56,853
and I'm like,

3243
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:57,520
what?

3244
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,300
And I just start looking around and
every surfer's paddling out of the water.

3245
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,800
And so my heart started beating.

3246
01:24:02,801 --> 01:24:04,480
I start paddling as fast as I can,

3247
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,700
and I'm thinking it's
probably a regular current.

3248
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:08,680
I've surfed in Australia
probably a hundred times.

3249
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:09,760
I'm,

3250
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,510
I'm like,

3251
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,130
I've never heard of shark alarm,

3252
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,680
but maybe this is a common
thing on a crowded beach.

3253
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,850
So I started paddling.

3254
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,010
I look over at the guy
next to me and I go,

3255
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:18,700
uh,

3256
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,980
and just to see what his reaction is.

3257
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,193
And he goes,

3258
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:24,040
he goes,

3259
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:24,910
oh my God,

3260
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:25,840
that's so scary.

3261
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:27,130
That doesn't even look real.

3262
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:27,701
Yeah,

3263
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:28,870
that does look scary.

3264
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:32,230
The one of them click on the one with
the big mouth because most people can't

3265
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:33,040
see what the fuck that is.

3266
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:33,221
Yeah,

3267
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:34,054
that one in the center.

3268
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,200
That does look scary.

3269
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,090
Looking at those fucking teeth,

3270
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:38,320
that shit is ridiculous.

3271
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:40,090
It doesn't seem like a real animal.

3272
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:41,090
That's what's weird about it.

3273
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,200
It seems like some something
that someone invented in a movie.

3274
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,360
Well a seal that the,

3275
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,373
the uh,

3276
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:48,461
the alarms going off.

3277
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:49,540
I look at this dude and I go,

3278
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:50,230
uh,

3279
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,220
I look at him and he goes,

3280
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,900
haven't heard that in a long time.

3281
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:54,430
So I just start paddling.

3282
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:56,890
It was like when you think
you'd like fly out of the water,

3283
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,780
it just seemed like an eternity,

3284
01:24:58,930 --> 01:24:59,261
I'm sure.

3285
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,240
And then I got out and they said somebody,

3286
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:04,480
somebody called and said they spotted
like a four foot shark or something and

3287
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:06,100
they have to get you out of the water.

3288
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:06,731
But they're out there.

3289
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:10,750
Like I've pictures a guy that owns
horizon surf shop in Santa Monica,

3290
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:12,130
took pictures in sunset,

3291
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,200
the end where sunset comes out to the PCH,

3292
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,520
a fucking giant,

3293
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:17,440
great white breaching right there.

3294
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,281
Oh my God.

3295
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:18,821
And My iPhone.

3296
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:19,540
I'll show you.

3297
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:23,200
Please show it to me and I've gone
down where that guy died last week.

3298
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,400
That's in Cape Town.

3299
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,421
I've gone there.

3300
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:28,960
I went down in the cage with
the great whites and saw them.

3301
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,730
I would never surf there.

3302
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,833
I know it's crazy.

3303
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:36,490
There's only like five
deaths a year worldwide from
sharks and three of them are

3304
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:36,940
there.

3305
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,230
South Africa's fucking,

3306
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:39,240
they're all over the,

3307
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,400
they happen here to the Santa Barbara
Guy got killed just two years ago.

3308
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,340
Even seriously five people a year.

3309
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,070
I mean more people died by
dogs in California here,

3310
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:48,611
but you know what?

3311
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:52,660
You don't think how few people are in the
fucking ocean tiny number and you look

3312
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:52,841
at it.

3313
01:25:52,841 --> 01:25:54,100
If the whole world was in the ocean,

3314
01:25:54,101 --> 01:25:55,090
God dammit dude,

3315
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:57,760
it would be a thousand
deaths if you can find it.

3316
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:58,630
Some guy,

3317
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,560
they talked about your odds.

3318
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:03,980
It's like one in 7 million are worth
700 billion of attacked by sharp.

3319
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,250
Some guy did the odds then like he said,

3320
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,360
if you're wearing a wetsuit,

3321
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,691
okay,

3322
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:09,950
you look more like a seal.

3323
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,560
If you're on a surfboard,

3324
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,950
it looks more like a fish.

3325
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,760
So if you're by a river mouth
where there they go to feed,

3326
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,200
you're increasing your chances.

3327
01:26:18,201 --> 01:26:19,280
If you're alone,

3328
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:20,143
you're increasing your,

3329
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:23,140
he does the odds and
increases a cha and it's,

3330
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:24,080
it's fucking not,

3331
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,510
it's like one in 10,000 La,

3332
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,230
one in like 5,000 and this guy met.

3333
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:31,850
So like I surf every,

3334
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:34,010
but like I've gone through logical man,

3335
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:35,720
whoever you are it where they go,

3336
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,310
this place is Sharkey.

3337
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:37,731
And I'm like,

3338
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:38,291
well how shark?

3339
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:39,230
He is it like,

3340
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,011
and they're like,

3341
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:40,844
well there's this,

3342
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,860
there's a salmon feed out there and,

3343
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,270
and,

3344
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:46,730
and they feed off salmon or this one
place I went to this place called green

3345
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:51,410
island in Australia where we had to
swim across the shark pit to get to the

3346
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:52,244
break.

3347
01:26:52,270 --> 01:26:52,700
Yeah.

3348
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:56,000
We just swim across the shark pit where
the guys I was surfing with had seen a

3349
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:59,540
great white and they told me about how
they got off and got out of the water and

3350
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:00,800
they'd climb up on the rocks.

3351
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,731
And I'm like,

3352
01:27:01,731 --> 01:27:02,110
too.

3353
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:03,020
So the whole time I was out there,

3354
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:03,231
I'm like,

3355
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:04,370
I'm not enjoying this.

3356
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:04,850
And the Bar,

3357
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:08,570
I was surfing with Brazilians and
they don't give a fuck fucking crazy.

3358
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:09,621
And they're just like,

3359
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:10,850
stop being such a pussy.

3360
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,480
And I'm like,

3361
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:11,811
oh,

3362
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:12,650
you're so crazy.

3363
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,191
I'm like,

3364
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:14,150
I just don't,

3365
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:16,940
I'm not fucking feeling good about this.

3366
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:18,620
This is just so used to the water,

3367
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,210
especially if they're from Rio.

3368
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,530
So used to surfing,

3369
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:23,240
so such a part of the culture down there.

3370
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:24,470
When Ari and I were there,

3371
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,150
we went to the UFC in Rio.

3372
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,200
Great fucking time though.

3373
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:27,860
It's a God damn.

3374
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,850
The food was delicious.

3375
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,390
Woo.

3376
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:30,260
They love their meat.

3377
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:30,960
Oh my God.

3378
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,850
Fucking Brazilian.

3379
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,300
The navy,

3380
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:36,140
we eat Brian and I eat it like
Fogo de Chao all over the country.

3381
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:36,860
And they're there.

3382
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,161
Those,

3383
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:37,281
the,

3384
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:38,570
that's like one of our favorite places.

3385
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:39,320
We find out,

3386
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:39,620
you know,

3387
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:40,580
we pull into a town,

3388
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,780
we find out there's a fogo.

3389
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:42,350
We're always like,

3390
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:42,811
oh,

3391
01:27:42,811 --> 01:27:44,270
well it's mark this one off the list.

3392
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,021
But these,

3393
01:27:45,021 --> 01:27:46,070
these places in Brazil,

3394
01:27:46,071 --> 01:27:47,270
this is the motherland.

3395
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:47,721
It's got the,

3396
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:47,990
you know,

3397
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,400
Chew Husker Maria style.

3398
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:49,741
Oh yeah,

3399
01:27:49,741 --> 01:27:50,091
yeah,

3400
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:50,540
I fucking,

3401
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,770
I ain't so good.

3402
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:52,610
And you plug that in to you,

3403
01:27:52,611 --> 01:27:54,410
but it like at nine
o'clock in the morning,

3404
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:54,770
man,

3405
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,450
not even like seven
o'clock in the morning,

3406
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:57,440
we were up and we were,

3407
01:27:57,441 --> 01:27:57,651
you know,

3408
01:27:57,651 --> 01:27:58,640
cause we're all jet lagged.

3409
01:27:58,820 --> 01:27:59,900
We're looking out on the beach,

3410
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:00,830
seven in the morning,

3411
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:02,630
people were planned swimming,

3412
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,830
running on the beach.

3413
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:06,590
They're like so much more active
and healthy than Americans.

3414
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,060
And you know what's
funny about Brazilians,

3415
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,470
the men dance to,

3416
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,490
they're like black dudes,

3417
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:11,151
they dance.

3418
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:11,931
There's nothing wrong with it.

3419
01:28:11,931 --> 01:28:12,950
They love dancing.

3420
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,530
And they look at like white dudes
that don't like it and they're like,

3421
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:16,364
you're an idiot.

3422
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:16,760
They're like,

3423
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,320
you'll never get so much pussy.

3424
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,940
But then it's fun.

3425
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,113
They're there.

3426
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,180
I hang out with Brazilians in Australia.

3427
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,690
And it's funny because there's kind of
like an Australian Brazilian kind of

3428
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:28,260
clash and there is,

3429
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:28,841
yeah,

3430
01:28:28,841 --> 01:28:29,030
it's,

3431
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,660
it's,

3432
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:30,040
yeah.

3433
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:30,870
Is that,

3434
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:34,970
because a lot of Brazilians come to
Australia and then they surf and they're

3435
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:38,600
kind of aggressive and there's a whole
like culture clash between the two of

3436
01:28:38,601 --> 01:28:38,990
them.

3437
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:40,760
But I thought of aggression on the beach,

3438
01:28:40,761 --> 01:28:41,090
right?

3439
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:41,341
Yeah,

3440
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:41,501
yeah,

3441
01:28:41,501 --> 01:28:41,781
yeah.

3442
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:45,350
Like supposedly like I serve
Venice breakwater every day,

3443
01:28:45,351 --> 01:28:48,080
which is supposed to be legendary for,

3444
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:50,090
for all this fucking crazy,

3445
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:51,680
a localism.

3446
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:56,740
And I've probably had like three or four
incidents in my life where we've almost

3447
01:28:56,991 --> 01:28:58,220
gotten out of the water and fought,

3448
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,031
this is my friend,

3449
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:00,680
you need to take some Jujitsu.

3450
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:01,140
Yeah.

3451
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,220
Have Your Brazilian

3452
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,510
friends sit down with you and
just show you basic position.

3453
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:08,790
One Dude was fucking give me shit
one day and all I did was he goes,

3454
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,241
oh yeah,

3455
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:10,021
let's get out of the water.

3456
01:29:10,021 --> 01:29:11,340
I'm going to beat the fuck out of you.

3457
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:12,301
And I was like,

3458
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:12,840
really?

3459
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,890
You're gonna beat the fuck out of me?

3460
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:14,161
He's like,

3461
01:29:14,161 --> 01:29:14,401
yeah.

3462
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:14,791
I'm like,

3463
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:15,530
okay,

3464
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:15,850
uh,

3465
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,700
then you're going to jail cause I'm a cop.

3466
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:18,660
And he went,

3467
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:18,990
what?

3468
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:19,261
I go,

3469
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:19,951
LAPD,

3470
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:20,550
motherfucker,

3471
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,060
you just threatened to call your line.

3472
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,710
You Bitch.

3473
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,400
And he went,

3474
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,090
he went,

3475
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:24,923
he went,

3476
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,023
uh,

3477
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:27,043
uh,

3478
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:27,780
okay.

3479
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:28,350
So silly.

3480
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:31,410
It doesn't work like that off duty cops
don't have like some sort of a special

3481
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:32,490
license to be cons,

3482
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,200
but,

3483
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:33,751
but no,

3484
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:34,950
he was being the current.

3485
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:35,730
And there's,

3486
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:37,590
there's some locals that
just fucking take it like,

3487
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,330
hey sure he was,

3488
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:39,720
I mean this is our fucking area.

3489
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,530
You can't surf here.

3490
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:41,400
That's so silly.

3491
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,740
But I was as a cop ever done that.

3492
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,850
I've never personally had a problem
ever in Australia though with like

3493
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,650
Australians are totally cool about like,

3494
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:49,981
no,

3495
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:51,180
it's more of an American thing.

3496
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:54,890
I think it's the localism I've
seen in American way works.

3497
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:55,381
Why is it,

3498
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:57,000
is it because there's a shortage of waves?

3499
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:57,391
Yeah,

3500
01:29:57,391 --> 01:30:00,840
there's totally a shortage waves and
because everything's on the computer now,

3501
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,160
like there's all these sites,

3502
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:03,420
it'll tell you where the good waves are.

3503
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,670
Everyone has gone to the same places and
so really only one person can catch a

3504
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:09,210
wave.

3505
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:11,340
Does it easier to learn
how to surf now though?

3506
01:30:11,341 --> 01:30:13,960
Like cause you can kinda
like get lessons online.

3507
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,270
Are there more people surfing?

3508
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:20,100
It's somebody just twittered me today
and said tell Jody of Kelly Slater on the

3509
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:20,640
show.

3510
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:20,821
Yeah,

3511
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:21,511
I met Kelly.

3512
01:30:21,511 --> 01:30:23,790
I interviewed him at one
of the UFC is really,

3513
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:24,780
he loves you if say,

3514
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,081
yeah,

3515
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:27,990
he's a good friends with
Bj Penn and he trains too.

3516
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:28,350
That's,

3517
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:32,130
that's Bj Penn I think is the one
that did the crossfit workout.

3518
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,410
That named it fight gone bad.

3519
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:34,350
That might be who it was.

3520
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:35,101
It probably makes sense.

3521
01:30:35,101 --> 01:30:35,470
Yeah.

3522
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:35,840
Yeah.

3523
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,150
Yeah.

3524
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:36,983
Bj,

3525
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,180
Bj apparently is thinking
about making a comeback.

3526
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:42,300
He decided to take a lot of time
off after the Nick Diaz fight,

3527
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:43,710
but apparently the,

3528
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,630
the rumor is that,

3529
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:45,780
uh,

3530
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:46,710
Dana talked to him.

3531
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:48,150
I haven't spoken to day
and a couple of days,

3532
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,950
but Dana talked to him and
he said he wants to fight.

3533
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:50,880
That'd be awesome.

3534
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,560
That'd be nice if he wants to,

3535
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,730
if he actually wants to,

3536
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:54,450
you know,

3537
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:55,770
but if he's not motivated,

3538
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:56,110
you know,

3539
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:58,560
there's two Bj's is Bj the world beaters,

3540
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:00,060
like one of the greatest
fighters of all time.

3541
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,480
And then there's unmotivated Bj
who just doesn't find as well.

3542
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:04,560
I mean it's really that simple.

3543
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:05,790
It's like Tyson after,

3544
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,110
but it's hard,

3545
01:31:07,111 --> 01:31:07,670
man.

3546
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,630
Bj has been at the top for so long.

3547
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,410
You know how hard it must be to
try to keep the motivation up to,

3548
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:13,740
to train so hard.

3549
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:14,130
Your body,

3550
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:15,600
any supernatural too.

3551
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:16,171
He's not,

3552
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:18,840
he's not fucking around with
growth or anything funky.

3553
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:19,350
He,

3554
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,710
he's,

3555
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:21,000
he's 100% natural.

3556
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:22,590
I mean it takes vitamins and supplements,

3557
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:26,130
but he's not fucking around with anything
that's going to aid in his recovery.

3558
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:29,760
His motivation sucks because
everyone else is probably doing that.

3559
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:33,420
A lot of dudes do that Todd Duffy
guy that we were talking about,

3560
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,090
he's one of the youngest
guys that's a got a,

3561
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:36,361
a,

3562
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:38,670
an exemption for hormone replacement.

3563
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:39,001
You know,

3564
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:40,260
in some guys have it,

3565
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:40,530
uh,

3566
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:42,630
because of head trauma.

3567
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:43,440
You know,

3568
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,720
some guys have hormone
replacement because when you're,

3569
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:50,760
if you're in a sport like
football or boxing or MMA as well,

3570
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:52,200
when you're getting tagged in the head,

3571
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,150
it's very possible to damage the pituitary
gland and the studies that they've

3572
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,140
been doing on,

3573
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:57,410
uh,

3574
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:57,780
on,

3575
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,170
on,

3576
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,910
on high level combat athletes,

3577
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:05,560
those seem to indicate that there's a
certain amount of head trauma will lead to

3578
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:07,180
a drop in your testosterone,

3579
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:08,110
a significant drop.

3580
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,680
And it's not from guys that
abused it's guys that were clean.

3581
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:12,400
So it's not,

3582
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,750
there's two ways to damage your system.

3583
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:13,871
Well,

3584
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:14,501
there's a bunch of ways,

3585
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:15,850
but one of them is that you can,

3586
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:16,121
you know,

3587
01:32:16,121 --> 01:32:17,440
disease obviously get damage you,

3588
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:18,310
but one of them is,

3589
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:19,000
um,

3590
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,451
you can,

3591
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:19,630
uh,

3592
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:22,210
do steroids when you're young and you
do a lot of steroids in your balls,

3593
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:22,850
just quit.

3594
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:24,130
You just shut them down and break them.

3595
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,720
And so then you need hormones.

3596
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:26,910
Literally they have to ingest.

3597
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,450
These are strong.

3598
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:27,610
Yeah.

3599
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,301
But those guys,

3600
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:30,520
it's always like I'm stirred,

3601
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,420
you know,

3602
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,580
crazy looking dudes,

3603
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:35,980
Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime type
dudes where it's like there's no way to

3604
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:39,550
achieve those levels without like
completely jolting your body,

3605
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:40,451
you know?

3606
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:41,530
So that's one way.

3607
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,580
There's another way you could,

3608
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:46,480
if you get bit by the resilient and
wandering spider that kills your Dick shot

3609
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:47,210
up forever.

3610
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:51,550
Spider called the Brazilian wondering
spider called a Brazilian wandering

3611
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:53,890
spiders that when it stings you,

3612
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,040
it gives you an unbelievably
painful hard on where your body,

3613
01:32:59,351 --> 01:33:01,750
your dick is literally spliting like,

3614
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:05,110
like a hot dog that you sliced
and then put it on the grill.

3615
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:05,980
Oh,

3616
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:06,311
lumps.

3617
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:07,144
When you cook it,

3618
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,040
your whole body's in mass.

3619
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:10,563
In the Amazon.

3620
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,360
It's the most toxic spider known to man.

3621
01:33:13,361 --> 01:33:13,811
Really?

3622
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:13,990
Yeah.

3623
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:15,280
If it doesn't kill you,

3624
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,830
it breaks your Dick here that Australia,

3625
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:22,831
they even have the fucking and
that too because that's clearly,

3626
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:23,850
it's got some pretty bad ass.

3627
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:24,240
Wider.

3628
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,810
Australia is missing good drugs.

3629
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:26,980
That's what Australia is missing.

3630
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:28,150
You don't have the Iowasca there.

3631
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:28,993
Brazil,

3632
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:30,550
they have something similar.

3633
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:32,120
There's an aboriginal uh,

3634
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,230
Elixir that's,

3635
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:34,720
it's just not nearly as common,

3636
01:33:34,721 --> 01:33:37,270
but it's very similar in
the fact that it is a,

3637
01:33:37,271 --> 01:33:39,280
it's based on conduct.

3638
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:39,840
The,

3639
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,380
the two elements,

3640
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:44,540
having a Mao inhibitor and having a,

3641
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:46,300
a DMT that you can take orally.

3642
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:46,930
I've never,

3643
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:49,840
I haven't spent much time with like
aboriginal people in Australia,

3644
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:52,960
but my next trip over a and
I go about twice a year,

3645
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:53,200
uh,

3646
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,010
I've got a buddy who's decided he
was a pro basketball player and he's,

3647
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,260
he now has like his new thing,

3648
01:33:59,261 --> 01:34:00,100
he's filming documentary.

3649
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:00,934
He's about,

3650
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,890
he goes way into the Bush,

3651
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:06,100
into the fucking Bush and he's filming
documentaries and I'm going to go with

3652
01:34:06,101 --> 01:34:07,320
them and kind of,

3653
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:10,990
I've gone up to Darwin to the northern
territory and just like kind of

3654
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:13,720
like looked around and stuff,

3655
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,420
but I haven't gotten
into it and I lost it.

3656
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:18,550
Australia is a huge continent
and as big as American,

3657
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:20,650
but most of the people
live along the coast,

3658
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:20,940
right?

3659
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,280
Yeah.

3660
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,110
There's only 20 million
people like we have,

3661
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:23,681
what is it,

3662
01:34:23,681 --> 01:34:24,491
like 300 million?

3663
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:25,510
They have like 20 million.

3664
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:26,021
Oh my God.

3665
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:27,310
And they all live around the coast.

3666
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,210
So great there.

3667
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:31,200
It's amazing what a great
fucking contrasts plays ever.

3668
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:31,601
I love it.

3669
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:32,500
When we were in Sydney,

3670
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:33,334
I was like,

3671
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:33,761
Brian,

3672
01:34:33,761 --> 01:34:34,594
what did I say?

3673
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:35,501
What do you think?

3674
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:36,550
I would say if I was in Sydney,

3675
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:37,483
uh,

3676
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:39,340
you wouldn't go into the bush.

3677
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:39,701
No,

3678
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:40,660
I would say I could live there.

3679
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,840
Great place to me
because everywhere we go,

3680
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:44,231
that's cool.

3681
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:45,430
Like when we were in Atlanta,

3682
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:45,820
I was like,

3683
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,080
well you sit and I only say it,

3684
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:48,640
but you'd like to be on the
radio station that morning.

3685
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:48,881
We like,

3686
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:51,480
I think I might live
here fairly seriously.

3687
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:54,160
Head problems convincing.

3688
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:54,701
Mrs Rogan,

3689
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:55,540
obviously I moved,

3690
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:56,440
I moved to Colorado.

3691
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:57,190
I was ready to,

3692
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:58,023
how'd you read

3693
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,631
what happened there?

3694
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:00,380
I want to know that.

3695
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,400
Why you went to the Colorado?

3696
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:02,870
I did want to live in Los Angeles anymore.

3697
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:02,991
Yeah.

3698
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:03,824
I don't blame you.

3699
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:04,401
Well,

3700
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:04,791
first of all,

3701
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:05,624
travel for work,

3702
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:05,930
right?

3703
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:06,681
I do the UFC.

3704
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:07,101
I travel,

3705
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:07,611
I do comedy.

3706
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:07,971
I travel.

3707
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:09,290
I needed a local comedy scene.

3708
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,820
Denver has one of the best in the country.

3709
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,550
There's a club called the comedy
works in Denver and my friend Wendy,

3710
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:14,151
who runs it,

3711
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:15,440
she does an amazing,

3712
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:16,401
no,

3713
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:17,330
she's never booked me.

3714
01:35:17,331 --> 01:35:18,020
Ever.

3715
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,920
Never ever.

3716
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:19,460
Why?

3717
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,191
I don't know.

3718
01:35:20,191 --> 01:35:20,691
Talk to her.

3719
01:35:20,691 --> 01:35:21,321
You're hilarious.

3720
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:21,891
That's Wendy.

3721
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:22,724
How dare you,

3722
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:23,240
Edie,

3723
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,920
if does he find comedian?

3724
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,330
I've always talked to level.

3725
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:26,871
Well,

3726
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:29,510
you should be able to pack places
now because of your podcast,

3727
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:29,841
right?

3728
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:30,161
I mean it's,

3729
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:30,351
it's,

3730
01:35:30,351 --> 01:35:30,741
you don't know,

3731
01:35:30,741 --> 01:35:31,574
talking shit.

3732
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:32,660
Jim Jefferies,

3733
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,880
our friend and idiot,

3734
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,360
they have a podcast together.

3735
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:35,601
Yeah,

3736
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:36,350
it's doing,

3737
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,510
it's amazing how much fans come out now.

3738
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,310
What's funny and they're fucking idiots.

3739
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:44,510
Like I was in Atlanta and these guys
work shirts that said Eddie EFT has aids

3740
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:46,640
and show up at my shell,

3741
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:49,610
like a whole bunch of wearing these
eddy gift as aid shirts because Jim,

3742
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:50,360
you know,

3743
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,310
did that Google bomb,

3744
01:35:51,311 --> 01:35:51,850
right.

3745
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:52,570
And uh,

3746
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:53,121
what did he do?

3747
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:53,954
What was the Google bomb?

3748
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,580
He told all our fans to Google.

3749
01:35:55,581 --> 01:35:56,420
Eddie gift has aids.

3750
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:57,710
And if you do that,

3751
01:35:57,711 --> 01:35:58,850
if enough people do it,

3752
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:00,680
when you search my name,

3753
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:05,380
that's the first thing that
comes up in the cache and yeah,

3754
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,740
and I'm getting them back.

3755
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:07,970
I got a whole fucking plan.

3756
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:08,953
But uh,

3757
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:09,950
but so yeah,

3758
01:36:09,951 --> 01:36:10,850
if you type in MDF,

3759
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,320
it's the first fucking thing.

3760
01:36:12,321 --> 01:36:14,390
And even my mom asked me about it.

3761
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:14,631
Oh,

3762
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:15,500
that's hilarious.

3763
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:17,810
That's kind of why at other,

3764
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,200
well,

3765
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,610
she was like trying to get tickets
for her friends to my show and she'll,

3766
01:36:20,611 --> 01:36:22,740
she typed an idiot left in
any of those aids comes out.

3767
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:25,910
I've had ex girlfriends call me and go,

3768
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:27,650
we have to talk.

3769
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:29,430
It's,

3770
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:30,860

3773
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:36,650
at the Gibson amphitheatre
just before I go on stage.

3774
01:36:36,651 --> 01:36:36,891
You know,

3775
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:37,160
like,

3776
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,530
I'm not a big believer in intros.

3777
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:44,360
Like a lot of comedians
want their specific intro
or make me look good or when

3778
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,811
I'm like,

3779
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:45,411
if I'm funny,

3780
01:36:45,411 --> 01:36:46,070
I'm funny.

3781
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:47,480
It doesn't matter what the fuck you say.

3782
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,800
You could say ladies and gentleman,

3783
01:36:48,801 --> 01:36:48,981
Eddie,

3784
01:36:48,981 --> 01:36:49,960
if that's all I care about,

3785
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:51,140
I don't fucking,

3786
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:52,460
I seen him on this.

3787
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:53,294
You've seen him on,

3788
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,140
if they've,

3789
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,100
if they know who I am,

3790
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:55,700
they know who I am.

3791
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,533
They don't,

3792
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:57,730
it doesn't going to hell.

3793
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:59,080
And I hate community.

3794
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,630
You'll tell them I'm the guy from the
shattered and commercial or I'm the guy

3795
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:03,470
dot.

3796
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:04,303
No,

3797
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,570
and the one person that's going to go,

3798
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,433
oh yeah,

3799
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,370
that's not going to help you.

3800
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:09,140
So I just want Eddie gift.

3801
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,840
But they had these nice
interest for everybody.

3802
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,010
So beer mug that works on
the Kevin and been show,

3803
01:37:14,011 --> 01:37:14,510
it goes,

3804
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:14,841
hey,

3805
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:15,560
uh,

3806
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,311
you like slayer,

3807
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:16,581
right?

3808
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:16,940
And I'm like,

3809
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:17,773
no.

3810
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,590
He goes,

3811
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:19,610
I thought you like slayer.

3812
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,031
And I'm like,

3813
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:20,211
no.

3814
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:20,690
He's like,

3815
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:21,410
because I was going to go,

3816
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,243
he likes slayer,

3817
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:25,250
he likes Tequila and he
likes this and he has aids.

3818
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:27,321
Perfect.

3819
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,020
And I go do not intro.

3820
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:29,960
Really.

3821
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,870
I did not want this next
comedian come to the stage,

3822
01:37:32,871 --> 01:37:35,840
has aids perfectly taken
that and run with it.

3823
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:37,501
Run with it.

3824
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:40,100
So because thank God he told me too,

3825
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:42,440
cause you know when you're walking
the stage and you get hit with that.

3826
01:37:42,441 --> 01:37:43,100
Like,

3827
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,170
like when I did my first
comedy central TV show,

3828
01:37:45,171 --> 01:37:47,060
it was premium blend years ago.

3829
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:52,300
Harlan Williams hosting and my hey there
butter cup muffin top pumpkin biscuits

3830
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:56,100
and my whole closing joke all about star

3831
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,960
wars and Harlan right between
like goat from his to mine.

3832
01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:02,670
You know they have mine totally scripted.

3833
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:05,690
They know exactly what I'm going to say
but Harlan cause he's the host and he's

3834
01:38:05,691 --> 01:38:06,524
a celebrity.

3835
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,890
He's allowed to do whatever you want.

3836
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,870
Does this big star wars bit?

3837
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:14,950
No and that's my closer and I'm like
walking on the stage just going,

3838
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:17,043
it's over.

3839
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:17,801
But it's still,

3840
01:38:17,801 --> 01:38:18,300
yeah.

3841
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,440
Did that to Johnny
Sanchez during a TV table.

3842
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:24,330
This is Heartland's original men.

3843
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,320
See it did it on purpose.

3844
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:29,700
We do that are used to do guys bits right
before you would do their closing bits

3845
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:29,851
for,

3846
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:30,684
he'd bring them up.

3847
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,163
Why?

3848
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,833
Listen man,

3849
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,850
there's a reason why
we went after that guy.

3850
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:38,230
It was never heard that yeah,

3851
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:41,670
they were doing like local slam or
one of those fucking shows and uh,

3852
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:44,940
Johnny Sanchez is a very
funny guy and a great dude.

3853
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:45,451
Really,

3854
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:46,284
really nice guy.

3855
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:50,160
And he had this great joke about a
neighbor that actually really happened to

3856
01:38:50,161 --> 01:38:51,090
them like this.

3857
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,480
This is crazy Persian guy who would
always accused people parking in this

3858
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:55,640
parking spot and he,

3859
01:38:55,641 --> 01:38:58,110
he gets pissed and he
speaks his broken English.

3860
01:38:58,111 --> 01:38:59,040
It's really funny.

3861
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,030
This mother fucker does the
bit like as he's bringing,

3862
01:39:02,031 --> 01:39:03,270
oh it was Johnny's closing bits.

3863
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,280
So he's going on to a
television show that he does.

3864
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:07,260
He does his closing bit.

3865
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,780
That's beyond like,

3866
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,260
like just trying to get a laugh.

3867
01:39:10,261 --> 01:39:11,610
That's like sociopathic.

3868
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:11,851
Oh,

3869
01:39:11,851 --> 01:39:12,270
it's called.

3870
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:12,651
Totally.

3871
01:39:12,651 --> 01:39:12,960
Yeah.

3872
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,190
There's a pathology there for sure.

3873
01:39:14,191 --> 01:39:14,321
What,

3874
01:39:14,321 --> 01:39:14,820
that guy,

3875
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:14,980
yeah,

3876
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:15,813
unfortunately.

3877
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:16,411
But you know,

3878
01:39:16,411 --> 01:39:17,550
I haven't heard anything about it year,

3879
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:17,911
so I'm,

3880
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:19,230
I'm hoping he's not doing any morning.

3881
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:20,400
He's got his shit together now.

3882
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:21,510
But uh,

3883
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,751
yeah,

3884
01:39:21,751 --> 01:39:22,290
at the time.

3885
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,240
So when you would happen
just a total accident?

3886
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:24,301
Yeah,

3887
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:25,134
it was total accident,

3888
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:25,891
but you know,

3889
01:39:25,891 --> 01:39:28,710
at the time I'd probably only been
doing comedy like six years or so,

3890
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,430
and I'm just like,

3891
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,610
oh,

3892
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:31,150
that's devastating off fuck here.

3893
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:31,561
You know,

3894
01:39:31,561 --> 01:39:34,490
like you don't even have like good
stage legs in the first six years now.

3895
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:37,250
And I was throw it all wa but it's,

3896
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:38,041
it's more than that.

3897
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:38,341
It's the,

3898
01:39:38,341 --> 01:39:40,890
it's the whole fucking TV
aspect of it where you're like,

3899
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,020
well what if I change my final bit now?

3900
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,890
Are they going to get mad?

3901
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:45,540
Cause you have to have
everything approved.

3902
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:46,291
You do a bit.

3903
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,030
Can you do a star wars
bit after he does it?

3904
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:48,930
Is it possible?

3905
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:49,770
It was a,

3906
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:51,150
it takes a lot of window that sales.

3907
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:51,380
Right.

3908
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:52,081
I really did.

3909
01:39:52,081 --> 01:39:52,410
And it,

3910
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:53,880
and it was a shitty joke anyways,

3911
01:39:53,881 --> 01:39:54,091
but,

3912
01:39:54,091 --> 01:39:54,924
uh,

3913
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:55,321
you know,

3914
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:55,891
looking back,

3915
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:56,550
I'm like,

3916
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:57,780
we were in Vegas and,

3917
01:39:57,781 --> 01:39:58,380
um,

3918
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:01,350
it was me and I think it was Joey Diaz,

3919
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:02,340
maybe Eddie Bravo,

3920
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:02,760
I don't remember.

3921
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,360
But we were there for some fights
and Harlan was playing at the palms,

3922
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:07,403
so we went to see him.

3923
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:08,591
Great Guy.

3924
01:40:08,591 --> 01:40:09,424
I Love Harlem.

3925
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,680
Every time I see him,

3926
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:10,831
you know,

3927
01:40:10,831 --> 01:40:12,510
he's just say there fella.

3928
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:15,180
He's like super friendly
just as a warm guy.

3929
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:15,780
Anyway,

3930
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:17,760
he goes on and he's fucking killing.

3931
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:18,750
We're having a great time.

3932
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,141
Awesome.

3933
01:40:19,141 --> 01:40:22,160
The fire alarm goes on like a tension,

3934
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:22,860
you know something?

3935
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,460
It was like,

3936
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:23,761
it was,

3937
01:40:23,761 --> 01:40:24,150
it was a,

3938
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,940
was it a fire alarm or an emergency alarm?

3939
01:40:26,941 --> 01:40:28,500
I don't remember what
it was like there was,

3940
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:29,363
but there was a,

3941
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:32,870
oh,

3942
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:33,900
it's crazy.

3943
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:35,280
Really loud thing.

3944
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,580
And Harlan played through
it for 10 minutes.

3945
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:37,950
Wow.

3946
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:38,760
He's that he,

3947
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,060
yeah,

3948
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,680
I've watched him deal with every,

3949
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:42,090
like he's that guy that's funny.

3950
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:43,660
And every circumstance,

3951
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,371
you know what he is,

3952
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:45,780
he doesn't get mad about shit.

3953
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,351
You know,

3954
01:40:46,351 --> 01:40:47,580
like he really didn't get mad.

3955
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:47,790
Yeah.

3956
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:51,420
And it was kind of funny that this guy
was in the middle of his show and he was

3957
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:51,840
never like,

3958
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,400
but it was really fucked up was
we were just sitting there like,

3959
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,230
this ain't real like
a real terrorism drug.

3960
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:00,610
They could have been fucking oh Taliban
running in with machine guns and shit.

3961
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:00,890
Oh,

3962
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:01,571
fucking the,

3963
01:41:01,571 --> 01:41:05,950
the Japanese tsunami would happen and
I'd be sitting on the beach because I

3964
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:07,090
don't trust any,

3965
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:08,680
like anytime they're like,

3966
01:41:08,681 --> 01:41:10,120
we need to evacuate.

3967
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:10,510
I'm like,

3968
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:11,500
fuck off.

3969
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:17,020
Most of the time in college I stayed
eight like my 22nd floor dorm room.

3970
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:17,681
Well,

3971
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:18,940
a fire alarm was going.

3972
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:19,870
Oh my God,

3973
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:21,280
they're crazy.

3974
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,440
Because they would
always make her go down.

3975
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:24,280
Come back up.

3976
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,220
That's better than burning to death.

3977
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:27,103
Trust me,

3978
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:27,881
you're silly.

3979
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:28,750
You're a silly man.

3980
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,070
I didn't trust them.

3981
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,971
I want to know that.

3982
01:41:30,971 --> 01:41:32,670
Why you went to Colorado so that well,

3983
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:34,300
well I just didn't want
to live in la anymore.

3984
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:36,310
I think my theory is,

3985
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:37,780
this would have always
said is that there's,

3986
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:42,220
there's too many human beings in one
spot and it's just like rat population

3987
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:45,430
density studies where they take rats
and they put two rats in this cage and

3988
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:48,340
they're fine and they put four and
then by the time you have a bunch,

3989
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:49,130
you have all these,

3990
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:50,620
these crazy behaviors,

3991
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:51,401
you know,

3992
01:41:51,401 --> 01:41:54,670
rats sit in the corner
shaking and the nutty rats,

3993
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:55,481
aggressive rats.

3994
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:56,800
And I just think there's a,

3995
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:58,270
there's without a doubt,

3996
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,370
you get a certain amount
of energy from people.

3997
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,680
You get a certain amount of energy
from the people that you're around.

3998
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:03,940
And if you're in a tense neighborhood,

3999
01:42:03,941 --> 01:42:05,740
you absorb a certain
amount of that tension.

4000
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,270
It's very difficult to relax.

4001
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:10,720
And whenever I've been to places
that have a lighter population,

4002
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:12,220
like boulder for example,

4003
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:12,821
boulder,

4004
01:42:12,821 --> 01:42:16,240
Colorado is only a hundred thousand so
where you were living and they drive

4005
01:42:16,241 --> 01:42:16,691
around,

4006
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:18,010
everyone's driving slow,

4007
01:42:18,011 --> 01:42:18,940
no one's tense.

4008
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:20,360
There's no one running red lights.

4009
01:42:20,361 --> 01:42:23,740
It's not all the continents of
Los Angeles doesn't exist there.

4010
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:24,041
And Yeah,

4011
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:25,270
you've got to deal with some snow,

4012
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,460
but you deal with a nicer class of people.

4013
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:30,700
It's because it's people that aren't
under the gun and you take people out of

4014
01:42:30,701 --> 01:42:34,360
this environment like me and you put them
over there and you calm down cause you

4015
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:34,720
know,

4016
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,040
ask anybody about Los Angeles.

4017
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:39,250
There was just a study that people
hate people from Los Angeles and I said

4018
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,600
that's cause we always tell you,

4019
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,280
you know what the temperature is.

4020
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:42,521
People,

4021
01:42:42,521 --> 01:42:43,354
when you call someone,

4022
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:43,891
Hey I'm man,

4023
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:44,680
I'm in Boston,

4024
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,940
really 70 degrees here,

4025
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:46,750
I'm wearing shorts.

4026
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:47,531
You know there's that.

4027
01:42:47,531 --> 01:42:48,364
But please,

4028
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:50,710
this is a real issue with
why people come here.

4029
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:52,210
Like what you said they should call it.

4030
01:42:52,211 --> 01:42:55,600
Daddy doesn't love me on the side
and their shits taxing after awhile.

4031
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:57,670
It's taxing and it's also that,

4032
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,320
that overpopulation thing,

4033
01:42:59,321 --> 01:43:01,780
like you take away the traffic out of La,

4034
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:02,220
it,

4035
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,030
it take away the population.

4036
01:43:04,031 --> 01:43:05,020
It's a pretty nice place,

4037
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:08,560
beautiful mountains and
oceans and it's great.

4038
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:09,910
But fuck,

4039
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,170
it's not as nice as boulder though.

4040
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:13,150
Not as nice as Australian looking at the,

4041
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,800
the visuals of boulder.

4042
01:43:14,801 --> 01:43:17,860
But it was amazing to me was that you
could drive around and you'd look at these

4043
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:18,251
mountains.

4044
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:18,521
It was like,

4045
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:19,354
this is like,

4046
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:21,010
if this was a painting,

4047
01:43:21,011 --> 01:43:22,510
it would be worth $1 billion.

4048
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:26,200
It's like the most incredible natural
piece of artwork and it's in front of you

4049
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,034
every day.

4050
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:28,023
It's like that is,

4051
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:28,500
yeah,

4052
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,480
and it has a tangible effect
when you're looking at mountains,

4053
01:43:31,481 --> 01:43:34,120
like there's a place in Colorado
I really liked called evergreen.

4054
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:39,070
It's a suburb of Denver and my God,

4055
01:43:39,071 --> 01:43:39,461
the view,

4056
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:40,480
there's insane.

4057
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:43,780
I looked through this one house and I
just sat on the porch and I couldn't even

4058
01:43:43,781 --> 01:43:46,000
fucking believe that they
would allow you to live there.

4059
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:46,510
How long,

4060
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:49,810
how long did you stay for
months and why'd you leave?

4061
01:43:49,811 --> 01:43:50,800
So my wife got pregnant.

4062
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,330
Oh,

4063
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:51,660
you can't,

4064
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,280
you can't.

4065
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,470
We were way high in the
mountains we were at,

4066
01:43:54,471 --> 01:43:55,220
um,

4067
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:58,340
where we were was 3000 feet above boulder,

4068
01:43:58,460 --> 01:43:59,420
so it was 8,000,

4069
01:43:59,421 --> 01:44:00,171
500 feet.

4070
01:44:00,171 --> 01:44:01,004
It's really high.

4071
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:01,631
And you,

4072
01:44:01,631 --> 01:44:01,850
you,

4073
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:03,320
you can't be pregnant up there.

4074
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:04,100
First of all,

4075
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:07,580
even regular women that
live in boulder itself,

4076
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:09,260
which is 5,000 feet in Denver,

4077
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:09,590
they had,

4078
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,980
there's a really high
rate of premature births.

4079
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:13,490
Oh Wow.

4080
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:14,630
Because of the oxygen,

4081
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:15,200
like it's,

4082
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,250
there's no air up there,

4083
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:17,060
man.

4084
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:21,620
I would work out in my yard and do these
kettle bell drills that I do and it's

4085
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:22,060
you'd,

4086
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:24,440
you'd really feel like there's
not enough air in the world.

4087
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:25,330
You can't get any air.

4088
01:44:25,331 --> 01:44:25,971
It's thin,

4089
01:44:25,971 --> 01:44:28,400
like walk up the stairs and you're tired.

4090
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:30,140
Like it's really thin up there.

4091
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:32,060
So for her it was brutal.

4092
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:32,511
It was the,

4093
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:34,790
the morning sickness was intolerable.

4094
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:35,960
And then on top of that,

4095
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:39,380
it's just a real trick you up there
when it's snowing and we were in the

4096
01:44:39,381 --> 01:44:42,230
mountains and mountain
lions and bears and shit.

4097
01:44:42,231 --> 01:44:44,050
Like there's a lot of real study of cats.

4098
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,380
Why a dog got killed,

4099
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:46,340
killed by mountain lions.

4100
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:47,690
That happens a lot.

4101
01:44:47,691 --> 01:44:48,260
Drink.

4102
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:49,093
That sucks.

4103
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,570
It's just not,

4104
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:54,410
it's very rare that it happens because
there's so much for them to eat up there.

4105
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:54,800
You know,

4106
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,930
it's very rare that one
will attack a human.

4107
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,960
But you every now and then could be
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

4108
01:44:59,961 --> 01:45:01,670
And you find an old one that has like,

4109
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:02,520
you know,

4110
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,010
it doesn't have sharp teeth anymore,

4111
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:05,150
but it could still kill Ya.

4112
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:05,690
Ah,

4113
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,800
that would kill me if my dog,

4114
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:08,540
but it's so gorgeous up there,

4115
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:08,811
man.

4116
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:09,120
I was,

4117
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,150
my wife says is the
calmest I've ever been.

4118
01:45:11,151 --> 01:45:13,020
She's ever known me and my life
was when we were living at,

4119
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:14,120
you need to go to Australia.

4120
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:15,350
You know,

4121
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,951
Australia is cool,

4122
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:16,784
but you know,

4123
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:17,271
there's,

4124
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:17,721
first of all,

4125
01:45:17,721 --> 01:45:18,471
it's not America.

4126
01:45:18,471 --> 01:45:19,460
So that would bum me out.

4127
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,271
And then,

4128
01:45:20,271 --> 01:45:20,540
uh,

4129
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:22,040
it's Cunty as America could be.

4130
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:23,210
It's still where I was born.

4131
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,710
I'm used to it here.

4132
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:26,330
I could get used to it.

4133
01:45:26,331 --> 01:45:27,290
Like in terms of like,

4134
01:45:27,291 --> 01:45:29,690
if America was the apocalypse
in Australia was the way it is.

4135
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:30,583
Yeah.

4136
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,960
That kind of happened to me where
I went there and I was like,

4137
01:45:32,961 --> 01:45:33,111
oh,

4138
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:33,621
I could do this.

4139
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:35,360
I still have family here.

4140
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,111
And that's the thing.

4141
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:38,630
I can't be that far from
my family otherwise.

4142
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:39,200
Yeah.

4143
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:39,921
I like arches.

4144
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:40,680
There aren't.

4145
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,630
You went and he's,

4146
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,361
he lives there.

4147
01:45:42,361 --> 01:45:43,194
Right.

4148
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:47,440
He's got this big house and lives there
and he's a huge superstar with it.

4149
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:48,283
Right.

4150
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,630
People don't understand
what a big superstar he is.

4151
01:45:50,631 --> 01:45:53,150
Like if you walk down the street
here in America with like a famous,

4152
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:53,860
like,

4153
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:54,421
like even you,

4154
01:45:54,421 --> 01:45:54,561
you,

4155
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:55,550
how famous you are,

4156
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,650
you know you're going to get recognized.

4157
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,810
How like if you walk down the street,

4158
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:01,100
how often would you get recognized?

4159
01:46:01,101 --> 01:46:03,830
Depends on if there's a bunch
of young dudes with tattoos.

4160
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:07,640
Obviously young dudes tattoos most likely.

4161
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,020
Yeah.

4162
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,170
But him like we'll go through
a town like Adelaide and every,

4163
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:16,820
every five feet someone's going to
arch barker and it's like they saw,

4164
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,380
it's like chick seen Brad Pitt.

4165
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:19,100
Wow.

4166
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:22,070
And I go fuck like when you come to her,

4167
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:22,931
I started hanging out with them.

4168
01:46:22,931 --> 01:46:23,540
I was like,

4169
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:25,700
you're fucking like super famous.

4170
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:28,200
You're like Pauly shore in the 80s flavor,

4171
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,443
you know like,

4172
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:30,750
like use that right.

4173
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:32,683
Cause you,

4174
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:37,190
cause you think about it like that's
back before people had 500 channels and

4175
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:41,830
before people had the internet and before
like where you only watch like like

4176
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,250
five things on TV.

4177
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:44,570
That's what they had back then.

4178
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,640
Well they've just lately,

4179
01:46:46,641 --> 01:46:47,630
I mean they used to have,

4180
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:48,493
they don't have cable.

4181
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,490
They do have cable but not
a lot of people have it.

4182
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:51,390
Do they,

4183
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:52,560
do they get American channels?

4184
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:53,430
Yeah they do.

4185
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:54,470
And now everybody,

4186
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:55,440
because of the Internet,

4187
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:58,620
everybody's watching everything on the
Internet and DVDs and everything and,

4188
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,600
and they,

4189
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,570
they take a lot of our movies and put
Monte but shitty movies and Shitty sitcoms

4190
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:03,900
and stuff.

4191
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:07,380
Like when it was impossible or give you
at a DVD from there it was a different

4192
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,030
villages still is.

4193
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:12,090
What does that at pal
and NTSC I don't know.

4194
01:47:12,091 --> 01:47:15,420
But wait a minute pal and NTSC
doesn't not exist with a VHS.

4195
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:17,300
Isn't that VHS DVDs,

4196
01:47:17,301 --> 01:47:17,731
DVDs,

4197
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:18,564
DVDs,

4198
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,730
game with VHS.

4199
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:22,200
There was an issue with that too,

4200
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:22,580
right?

4201
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:23,413
Wasn't there?

4202
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,151
It's always been,

4203
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:27,550
it's a signal that I believe that
there are TVs you so I think,

4204
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:28,630
cause I remember I got a,

4205
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:33,640
an multi-region DVD player just so I
could watch the Ali g show from England

4206
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:37,590
cause this is a totally different kind
of DVD if you play like on my Mac,

4207
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:41,930
if I play a pal DVD it'll say
you only have five more feedback.

4208
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,230
And then it and my,

4209
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:43,980
my old,

4210
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:45,420
my old Max switched over.

4211
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:47,040
What the fuck is that man?

4212
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:50,520
What does that Bull Shit I had to
buy like software to convert it back.

4213
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,670
And it was like really you it
was a third party software.

4214
01:47:53,671 --> 01:47:54,750
It was fucking crazy.

4215
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,770
That's so stupid.

4216
01:47:55,771 --> 01:47:57,030
That doesn't make any sense.

4217
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,040
It has something to do with the cameras.

4218
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:02,040
Cause I remember we were
editing when I made my movie,

4219
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:06,150
we had some cameramen overseas and
then we'd have to have all those,

4220
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:09,340
all that tape we are shooting on mini
DV at the time we'd have it have a

4221
01:48:09,341 --> 01:48:10,660
converted and,

4222
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:12,690
and it was such a process and I'd go why?

4223
01:48:12,691 --> 01:48:13,110
And they're like,

4224
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:15,960
actually I think there's
more pixels or something.

4225
01:48:15,961 --> 01:48:16,770
And a pal.

4226
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:17,350
I'm not sure.

4227
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:19,890
It makes sense that there's two different
formats so it didn't agree on and

4228
01:48:19,891 --> 01:48:20,011
what,

4229
01:48:20,011 --> 01:48:22,380
it doesn't make sense as your
computer can switch back and forth,

4230
01:48:22,381 --> 01:48:23,550
but only five times.

4231
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:25,530
Why do you Brian,

4232
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:26,190
do you know?

4233
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:26,671
I have no idea.

4234
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:27,504
I never saw that before.

4235
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:28,470
I'm sure we're going to get,

4236
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:32,370
all of us are going to get emails and
twitters and I'm sure the tweets and I'm

4237
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:33,150
going to get to come roll.

4238
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:35,700
I'm going to get yelled at
for something was inaccurate.

4239
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:37,320
Well you should see the fucking

4240
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:39,900
well and gets the abuse Calli
guess when he comes on here.

4241
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,640
So I was talking about us history.

4242
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:47,020
Just Shit just misses a whole
chapter somewhere along the line,

4243
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:48,170
not this,

4244
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:48,460
you know,

4245
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,480
he's not super knowledgeable
about a lot of shipping.

4246
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:55,410
Is One of those dudes who would read a
book and then yell at you for not knowing

4247
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,840
this five minutes after you read it.

4248
01:48:58,540 --> 01:48:59,640
Do you realize,

4249
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:01,370
okay Chapin

4250
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,980
such a great impression,

4251
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:06,470
but you believe him too.

4252
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,140
Cause he,

4253
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:07,891
he tells he's right.

4254
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:09,450
A lot of times it's so passionate.

4255
01:49:09,451 --> 01:49:10,620
He's a great storyteller.

4256
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:11,251
You know,

4257
01:49:11,251 --> 01:49:14,600
that's the one of the beautiful things
about having friends like Callen or you

4258
01:49:14,601 --> 01:49:16,450
are Jodi is or Jim or anything.

4259
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,090
When you have friends that are comics,

4260
01:49:18,091 --> 01:49:18,901
it's like God damn it,

4261
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:19,860
it's so entertaining.

4262
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:22,890
You know when people talk about like
doing this podcast like well you guys are

4263
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:24,360
putting out so many podcasts,

4264
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:25,350
was it a lot of work?

4265
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:25,980
Well there's,

4266
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,000
there's work to it.

4267
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,340
You know,

4268
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:27,631
there's,

4269
01:49:27,631 --> 01:49:27,901
you know,

4270
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:30,330
you have to upload it like
Brian has to do the dirty work.

4271
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:33,660
But as far as like though the work
of actually sitting down and talking,

4272
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:36,510
it's like it's the funniest
time ever what we do anyway.

4273
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:36,870
Well it's,

4274
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:37,621
it's a crazy thing.

4275
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:42,240
It's like we never really took advantage
of the resource that was us in our

4276
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:44,880
friendships until podcasts came along.

4277
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:45,331
You know,

4278
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:45,630
pot,

4279
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:46,980
like when we had radio shows,

4280
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:47,980
if you would go on someone's

4281
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,521
radio show,

4282
01:49:48,521 --> 01:49:51,250
it's very rare that you could just bring
it all your friends with you on the

4283
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,690
radio show and put on,

4284
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:55,240
you have to interact with these djs.

4285
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,920
And that was their thing and that was it.

4286
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:00,910
So it's like you never really got a
chance to like sit down purposely.

4287
01:50:00,911 --> 01:50:02,500
Like we're gonna meet at three o'clock,

4288
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:03,430
we're all gonna sit down,

4289
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:04,570
we're going to smoke some weed,

4290
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:05,620
we're going to drink some coffee,

4291
01:50:05,790 --> 01:50:07,600
let's talk some shit
about all kinds of things.

4292
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,430
Like that would be a great thing to do.

4293
01:50:09,490 --> 01:50:12,100
But nobody ever schedule
shit talking sessions.

4294
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:16,030
But because the fact that everyone is
going to hear about this and it's going to

4295
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:18,700
be something that goes on the
Internet and people going to enjoy it.

4296
01:50:18,701 --> 01:50:20,620
And then we started doing it.

4297
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:21,640
And the coolest thing about it,

4298
01:50:21,641 --> 01:50:24,220
like what I love about
your podcast is you,

4299
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:27,160
you guys like you just talk.

4300
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,730
And comics are interesting people because
we have a lot of time on our hands.

4301
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:31,893
So we,

4302
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:35,020
most people have to do their
job and that's why they're
really good at their job

4303
01:50:35,021 --> 01:50:35,854
because they do it,

4304
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:40,290
we do our stand up and then we
have a lot of extra time and our,

4305
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:44,740
our standup comes from our extra time
of us thinking and philosophizing.

4306
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:45,910
And in doing so,

4307
01:50:45,911 --> 01:50:48,490
we all acquire lots of
hobbies and lots of things.

4308
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:50,080
We get into and we're,

4309
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:52,330
we're all of a kind of
weird kind of mindset.

4310
01:50:52,331 --> 01:50:55,300
Like to be a comic you
have to be a bit OCD,

4311
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:56,590
a bit neurotic.

4312
01:50:56,591 --> 01:50:58,180
There's all these different aspects of it.

4313
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,620
So you compile all that,

4314
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:02,320
you've got like a certain
type of individual.

4315
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:04,100
And so we all have a knowledge base.

4316
01:51:04,101 --> 01:51:06,040
It's like we have generalized knowledge,

4317
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:07,750
not a lot of specialized knowledge and,

4318
01:51:07,751 --> 01:51:11,170
but we have a general knowledge of all
these different things and then we're

4319
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:13,330
able to also spend humor into it.

4320
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:14,201
It's fucking,

4321
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:15,880
it's like the greatest
people that hang out with.

4322
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:16,080
It's,

4323
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:16,870
it's amazing.

4324
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:18,010
And I'm glad that everyone,

4325
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:18,311
people go,

4326
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:19,270
aren't there too many podcasts?

4327
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:19,571
No,

4328
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:20,560
it's fucking great.

4329
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,730
Well not only that,

4330
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:22,030
um,

4331
01:51:22,030 --> 01:51:26,080
I think it's really cool that right from
the beginning everyone has a sort of

4332
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:29,080
helped each other out and
everyone has promoted each other.

4333
01:51:29,081 --> 01:51:29,490
Yeah.

4334
01:51:29,490 --> 01:51:29,740
You know,

4335
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:30,431
from the beginning,

4336
01:51:30,431 --> 01:51:34,300
I mean Corolla and I'm doing Carolla
show a in a couple of weeks and when I'm

4337
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:34,930
doing it,

4338
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:36,760
we're going to record
these little things where,

4339
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:37,031
you know,

4340
01:51:37,031 --> 01:51:39,010
I do see an ad for his podcast.

4341
01:51:39,011 --> 01:51:40,390
He does an ad for our podcast.

4342
01:51:40,391 --> 01:51:40,900
That's awesome.

4343
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,711
But we always do that.

4344
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:41,921
I mean,

4345
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:42,090
you know,

4346
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:42,300
we,

4347
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:42,840
Ari,

4348
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,420
you know,

4349
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:44,020
texted me,

4350
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:44,201
said,

4351
01:51:44,201 --> 01:51:44,321
hey,

4352
01:51:44,321 --> 01:51:45,400
I got this gig coming up.

4353
01:51:45,401 --> 01:51:46,540
I'm recording in Denver.

4354
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:47,440
Can I do your podcast?

4355
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:47,681
Yeah,

4356
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:48,000
sure.

4357
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:48,430
Corner.

4358
01:51:48,430 --> 01:51:49,900
It's like we all work together.

4359
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:50,700
Yeah,

4360
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:51,533
I can't thank you.

4361
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,320
You helped me with the fund.

4362
01:51:53,321 --> 01:51:54,101
It's really cool.

4363
01:51:54,101 --> 01:51:54,471
I mean it's,

4364
01:51:54,471 --> 01:51:55,870
it's a beautiful thing to do.

4365
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:56,970
It's our podcast.

4366
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:57,641
This is no line.

4367
01:51:57,641 --> 01:51:58,301
I'm not blowing smoke.

4368
01:51:58,301 --> 01:52:01,240
We get to see the numbers on
Libsyn and how we're doing.

4369
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,390
We get our biggest spikes when we win.

4370
01:52:04,391 --> 01:52:05,380
Like I'll do your show,

4371
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:05,800
like,

4372
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:05,891
oh,

4373
01:52:05,891 --> 01:52:06,400
that's awesome.

4374
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,551
Oh,

4375
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:07,240
when I do,

4376
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,700
Jim gets on your show and
never talks about our podcasts.

4377
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:11,470
So fucking nothing happened.

4378
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:14,590
He sells more DVDs if got,

4379
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:15,850
but uh,

4380
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:18,270
but I get on here and
plug talking Shit and uh,

4381
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:19,720
seriously it,

4382
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:24,030
like you can see and what happens is
it spikes and then it'll plateau for a

4383
01:52:24,031 --> 01:52:27,850
while and then I'll do like your show
or Jamiel wars or Corollas or something

4384
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,990
and then it'll spike again.

4385
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:33,310
So it's showing that like the audience
is coming and they like it and they stay.

4386
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,860
And that's why I always tell
other guys with pockets,

4387
01:52:35,861 --> 01:52:36,250
I'm like,

4388
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,540
come on my show and be a guest.

4389
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:38,374
You'll get,

4390
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:41,050
our audience will then start
listening to your show.

4391
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:43,120
If they like you on our show,

4392
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:44,230
they're going to listen to you.

4393
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,213
Like there's a guy,

4394
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:45,980
McCarthy use

4395
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,480
a funniest fucking guy alive.

4396
01:52:47,481 --> 01:52:48,440
He's not a comedian.

4397
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:50,960
We have them on our podcast and he's just,

4398
01:52:50,961 --> 01:52:51,201
you know,

4399
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:52,580
you found these guys,

4400
01:52:52,581 --> 01:52:53,090
right?

4401
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:56,930
He's just a guy who found hanging out
in the comedy dude fucking the funniest

4402
01:52:56,931 --> 01:52:59,090
fucking crazy dude that skill.

4403
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:01,850
His gift in life as being an
interesting dude to be around.

4404
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:04,400
And he has a podcast
now on national lampoon,

4405
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,400
the Brian McCarthy interview
show and he's just fucking like,

4406
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:09,740
he came on our podcast
one time and just told us,

4407
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:12,410
he told three stories where three of
the best stories I've ever heard in my

4408
01:53:12,411 --> 01:53:12,830
life,

4409
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:13,101
one,

4410
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:17,600
he fucked a postop transsexual
and it tells the story.

4411
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:19,190
And the episode's called Amani Eat.

4412
01:53:19,191 --> 01:53:20,090
This dude's can't.

4413
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:25,670
And it's the funniest story you'll
ever hear because he's so brazen about.

4414
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,050
Then the next story he told,

4415
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:32,290
he got arrested smuggling pot from
Jamaica in a boom box when he was 20 years

4416
01:53:34,371 --> 01:53:34,810
old.

4417
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:35,643
Oh No.

4418
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:40,130
And stayed in prison for a month because
he didn't want to let his mom know.

4419
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:41,410
Oh No,

4420
01:53:41,410 --> 01:53:41,820
no.

4421
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:43,130
So he wrote it out,

4422
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:43,550
you know,

4423
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:44,690
you know they set your trial,

4424
01:53:44,691 --> 01:53:45,710
but you can have bail.

4425
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:47,120
You can post bail and get out.

4426
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:48,040
So I stayed in prison for,

4427
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:51,140
he just stayed in jail and the other
dude was crying every day that got caught

4428
01:53:51,141 --> 01:53:51,441
with them.

4429
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:51,861
One to call.

4430
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:52,101
He's like,

4431
01:53:52,101 --> 01:53:52,610
no,

4432
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:53,870
my mom will kill me.

4433
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:56,420
Oh my God says Mama's been terrible.

4434
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,050
Kidnapped his Mama.

4435
01:53:58,051 --> 01:53:58,990
Scary than JDA.

4436
01:53:59,000 --> 01:53:59,121
Yeah,

4437
01:53:59,121 --> 01:53:59,860
that's what he said.

4438
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:01,180
Imagine that hot.

4439
01:54:01,181 --> 01:54:01,451
He,

4440
01:54:01,451 --> 01:54:03,140
he's just the funniest fucking dude.

4441
01:54:03,141 --> 01:54:04,550
So I like that.

4442
01:54:04,551 --> 01:54:08,480
Like a guy like that who the
industry has turned their nose up.

4443
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:11,240
It won't fucking give him like Joey does.

4444
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,470
Yeah.

4445
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,520
Until Joey Diaz started
coming on this podcast,

4446
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:17,060
people didn't realize how brilliant he
really is because they see him on stage.

4447
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:18,320
He's talking about eating ass,

4448
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:20,500
touching new muffler and I'm like,

4449
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,850
we don't want to have nothing
to do with this guy's too crazy.

4450
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,290
But then from the podcast,

4451
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:25,340
people become like big,

4452
01:54:25,341 --> 01:54:26,980
big fans of his and they
realized that he's a,

4453
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:27,920
he's complex.

4454
01:54:27,921 --> 01:54:28,700
There's a,

4455
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:31,760
we're real lucky and having
a comedian's for friends,

4456
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:31,990
you know,

4457
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,721
for other people,

4458
01:54:32,721 --> 01:54:35,570
like I'm saying this right now and for
sure there's someone out there going,

4459
01:54:35,571 --> 01:54:38,240
I don't want to fucking needy
ass comedian as my friend,

4460
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,430
but we understand each other.

4461
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:40,671
Like,

4462
01:54:40,671 --> 01:54:40,941
you know,

4463
01:54:40,941 --> 01:54:43,760
like a guy like you or a guy
like count or me or like we,

4464
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,270
if,

4465
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:45,410
if you and I were,

4466
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:46,281
if you know,

4467
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:47,450
if I didn't even know you,

4468
01:54:47,451 --> 01:54:49,460
but we ran into each other in an airport,

4469
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,001
you know,

4470
01:54:50,001 --> 01:54:50,300
and I'm like,

4471
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:50,960
what do you do?

4472
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,560
I'm a comic.

4473
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:51,771
Ah,

4474
01:54:51,771 --> 01:54:52,640
I'm a comic too.

4475
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,473
What's up?

4476
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:54,780
Are you gigging?

4477
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,521
What's going on?

4478
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:55,711
If you do,

4479
01:54:55,711 --> 01:54:56,870
it would be instant.

4480
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:57,943
Like it,

4481
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,390
as long as you're not a Douche bag.

4482
01:54:59,400 --> 01:54:59,510
Well,

4483
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:00,770
Stan hope wrote that great,

4484
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:02,840
great fucking blog about that.

4485
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,230
I,

4486
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:04,160
we're running into comics,

4487
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:04,371
no,

4488
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:06,020
about why he hates Dane Cook.

4489
01:55:06,021 --> 01:55:07,010
And you're not allowed to.

4490
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:08,190
And,

4491
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:11,450
and it was fucking genius
and it was about like,

4492
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:14,150
but he said to his fans,

4493
01:55:14,151 --> 01:55:14,661
basically,

4494
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:14,931
he's like,

4495
01:55:14,931 --> 01:55:15,651
at the end of the day,

4496
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:20,180
if I saw Dane Cook in like an airport
lobby or whatever and I saw you,

4497
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:21,710
I'd go hang out with Dane Cook.

4498
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:22,130
Wow.

4499
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:22,461
He's like,

4500
01:55:22,461 --> 01:55:23,294
cause I'd have,

4501
01:55:23,470 --> 01:55:25,820
cause I'd have more in
common with Dane Cook.

4502
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:29,390
Then you and I could talk to Dane
and we have shit to talk about.

4503
01:55:29,391 --> 01:55:29,751
He's like,

4504
01:55:29,751 --> 01:55:30,291
where are you?

4505
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:30,481
You,

4506
01:55:30,481 --> 01:55:31,610
you know you're a fan.

4507
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,473
Like uh,

4508
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:32,961
sorry.

4509
01:55:32,961 --> 01:55:36,700
That's a weird way of separating
yourself from all your people.

4510
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:37,490
No,

4511
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:37,700
no,

4512
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:37,881
no,

4513
01:55:37,881 --> 01:55:38,030
no.

4514
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:41,420
The point Stan hope was making was
he was saying like that everybody,

4515
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:46,260
like he had a problem with Dane and his
problem was Dane called him a hater and

4516
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:47,220
said that he was jealous of him.

4517
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:47,581
And he's like,

4518
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:48,750
I'm not jealous of you.

4519
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:49,471
You know,

4520
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:49,990
I just,

4521
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,250
it,

4522
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:52,380
he explained why and it was a valid,

4523
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:52,711
he said,

4524
01:55:52,711 --> 01:55:53,130
look,

4525
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:56,490
nobody was jealous of Chris rock
or Jon Stewart or Dave Chappelle.

4526
01:55:56,491 --> 01:55:57,390
When they got famous,

4527
01:55:57,391 --> 01:55:58,110
he goes,

4528
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:01,740
we're not jealous of you were angry with
Annie and it was a problem because they

4529
01:56:01,741 --> 01:56:03,780
had this thing over stand up,

4530
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:05,880
calling them on the phone
and it was just does,

4531
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:06,750
it's a whole long thing.

4532
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:08,670
But at the end of the day he was saying,

4533
01:56:08,671 --> 01:56:08,911
you know,

4534
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:13,260
like here's my problems with them and
it's a comic having a problem with a comic

4535
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:14,430
over comic issues.

4536
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:15,091
Like you,

4537
01:56:15,091 --> 01:56:19,020
people that don't like Dane now like
you fans that don't like Dang you're

4538
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:21,870
jumping on the bandwagon not knowing why

4539
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:22,980
as sort of,

4540
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,181
I disagree though,

4541
01:56:24,181 --> 01:56:26,580
because I think a lot of people don't
like people cause it's just not their

4542
01:56:26,581 --> 01:56:27,151
style.

4543
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:29,490
And if you like a certain type
of music and I don't like it,

4544
01:56:29,491 --> 01:56:30,930
I'll shit all over that music.

4545
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:31,800
He goes,

4546
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,041
yeah.

4547
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:33,390
But I mean that's just what people do.

4548
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:33,600
Yeah.

4549
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,250
But I sounded lightened thing to do.

4550
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:35,611
No,

4551
01:56:35,611 --> 01:56:36,301
I think there's though,

4552
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:41,301
now in comedy there's so many
people are aware of not just comedy,

4553
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:43,151
like what they like,

4554
01:56:43,151 --> 01:56:44,310
but the clicks of comedy

4555
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:46,720
[inaudible] who's an easy target.

4556
01:56:46,721 --> 01:56:47,411
A safe target.

4557
01:56:47,411 --> 01:56:48,050
Yes.

4558
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:49,120
And it's like,

4559
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:50,990
it's like for a while
Dan was getting bashed,

4560
01:56:50,991 --> 01:56:52,270
show hard that I wanted,

4561
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:53,810
I just wanted to get on the other side.

4562
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:55,210
He'd be like Jane supporter.

4563
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,010
I'm sure people would
have loved to have bath.

4564
01:56:57,011 --> 01:57:00,550
Chris rock if he had like a chink
in his armor or even Dave Chappelle,

4565
01:57:00,551 --> 01:57:02,140
if he had something like
wrong with Woodward,

4566
01:57:02,141 --> 01:57:02,651
he was doing,

4567
01:57:02,651 --> 01:57:03,970
they'd like to go after him too.

4568
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:04,541
You know?

4569
01:57:04,541 --> 01:57:05,540
I think when,

4570
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:06,700
when people look,

4571
01:57:06,701 --> 01:57:08,410
when you're real successful and they look,

4572
01:57:08,411 --> 01:57:10,260
if they find something fucking other,

4573
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,113
they're going to harp on it.

4574
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:12,970
But if they don't find something,

4575
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:14,440
then you're Chris Rock.

4576
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,161
You know what I'm saying?

4577
01:57:15,161 --> 01:57:15,700
And you're just,

4578
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:16,830
you're just a brilliant comedian.

4579
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:17,721
That is what it is.

4580
01:57:17,721 --> 01:57:20,170
And not stealing is not not a bullshit.

4581
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:20,890
He's just,

4582
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:21,490
you know,

4583
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:25,330
and I think that's really where it's
at because it's not just black guys.

4584
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:27,580
It's what Louis C K
nobody hates on Louis Ck.

4585
01:57:27,730 --> 01:57:28,750
Nobody hates on Louis Ck.

4586
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:29,441
He's doing,

4587
01:57:29,441 --> 01:57:30,274
I'm sure

4588
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,553
Brian,

4589
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:33,280
you know what I mean?

4590
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,061
I know manager,

4591
01:57:34,061 --> 01:57:34,310
you've,

4592
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:35,860
you've might've been with
this guy at one point.

4593
01:57:35,861 --> 01:57:36,070
Dot.

4594
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:36,851
James Dixon.

4595
01:57:36,851 --> 01:57:37,040
You know,

4596
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:40,480
James Shore Know James when he,

4597
01:57:40,481 --> 01:57:40,870
uh,

4598
01:57:40,870 --> 01:57:42,220
he said to me when I was like,

4599
01:57:42,221 --> 01:57:42,790
great guy,

4600
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:43,840
great guy and wild man.

4601
01:57:43,841 --> 01:57:45,390
Some of the best advice
I've ever had in common,

4602
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:46,840
some smoke hash under glass,

4603
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:49,480
small cash under a glass.

4604
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:50,590
I didn't know identity,

4605
01:57:50,591 --> 01:57:51,430
put it on a pin.

4606
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,480
He lit the Hash.

4607
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:55,560
I thought he was a drug addict
because I was like 25 and shit.

4608
01:57:55,561 --> 01:57:56,970
I was like total straight edge.

4609
01:57:57,850 --> 01:58:01,410
Fucking just been able to see it like,

4610
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:06,500
like somebody smoking a joint around you
or somebody who this loser James James

4611
01:58:06,971 --> 01:58:07,750
said,

4612
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:08,760
best fucking advice I see

4613
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:09,141
goes.

4614
01:58:09,141 --> 01:58:09,810
Uh,

4615
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,160
he,

4616
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:10,470
I,

4617
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:11,420
I used to call them,

4618
01:58:11,421 --> 01:58:11,631
you know,

4619
01:58:11,631 --> 01:58:14,360
I was like 24 years old just
doing co it's debt starting.

4620
01:58:14,361 --> 01:58:14,781
Stand up.

4621
01:58:14,781 --> 01:58:15,501
Well what do I do?

4622
01:58:15,501 --> 01:58:16,160
I don't know.

4623
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:16,850
And he'd go,

4624
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:18,920
just be undeniably funny.

4625
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:19,731
And I'd go,

4626
01:58:19,731 --> 01:58:21,190
but what about like there's,

4627
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:22,760
they're coming to see me and should I,

4628
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,540
he'd go,

4629
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:26,180
just be undeniably funny.

4630
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:26,961
And I'd go,

4631
01:58:26,961 --> 01:58:27,190
what,

4632
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:30,830
what else should I go to
acting be undeniably funny?

4633
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:31,310
He goes,

4634
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,911
that's your job.

4635
01:58:31,911 --> 01:58:32,870
I'll do everything else.

4636
01:58:33,110 --> 01:58:33,980
Just do that.

4637
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:35,150
And a good agent.

4638
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,920
And then I said to him recently,

4639
01:58:36,921 --> 01:58:37,311
I was like,

4640
01:58:37,311 --> 01:58:37,911
you didn't mention,

4641
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:39,800
you got to be undeniably lucky too.

4642
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:40,371
He goes,

4643
01:58:40,371 --> 01:58:40,521
yeah,

4644
01:58:40,521 --> 01:58:41,950
I've seen a lot lucky guys

4645
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,390
and they've made it big,

4646
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,920
but they've never stuck.

4647
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:47,180
They don't stick around because
they're like lottery winners.

4648
01:58:47,190 --> 01:58:47,371
Yeah.

4649
01:58:47,371 --> 01:58:47,740
He's like,

4650
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:49,270
you got to really have it.

4651
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:52,160
And the guys that are like you're saying
like Chris Rock and well you should,

4652
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:52,901
you'd also,

4653
01:58:52,901 --> 01:58:54,730
it has to be a passion of yours.

4654
01:58:54,731 --> 01:58:55,031
You know,

4655
01:58:55,031 --> 01:58:58,890
I've spent a lot of time doing things
that were not a passion of mine and I

4656
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:02,560
spent a lot of time doing other people's
stuff like other people's TV shows or

4657
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:04,600
other peoples and was often times,

4658
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:08,410
but there's this just such a massive
difference between doing something that

4659
01:59:08,411 --> 01:59:09,700
you're really passionate about,

4660
01:59:09,850 --> 01:59:10,151
you know,

4661
01:59:10,151 --> 01:59:13,330
and and putting all that energy and
that reward that you get from that.

4662
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:14,560
There's nothing like that.

4663
01:59:14,561 --> 01:59:15,020
That's what,

4664
01:59:15,020 --> 01:59:16,540
that's where real success comes from.

4665
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:19,720
Real success comes from transferring
that passion and then people go and

4666
01:59:19,721 --> 01:59:21,910
experience it and they feel it
and it's pure and it's real.

4667
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:22,451
You know,

4668
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:22,960
when your,

4669
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,890
your standup is really just sort of a
vehicle for getting out the greatness.

4670
01:59:26,891 --> 01:59:28,720
It's not inside of all of us.

4671
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:29,111
You know,

4672
01:59:29,111 --> 01:59:33,130
whether that greatness manifest itself
in piano playing or the manifests itself

4673
01:59:33,131 --> 01:59:33,851
and you know,

4674
01:59:33,851 --> 01:59:33,991
you're,

4675
01:59:33,991 --> 01:59:34,181
you're,

4676
01:59:34,181 --> 01:59:37,840
you're a great basketball player or
you're fucking awesome and editing videos

4677
01:59:37,841 --> 01:59:38,200
that,

4678
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,030
that what that thing is just,

4679
01:59:40,031 --> 01:59:42,580
it's just finding that in yourself and,

4680
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:47,320
and providing something to other people
that gives them this energetic reaction.

4681
01:59:47,321 --> 01:59:47,510
You know,

4682
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:48,341
they're sitting in the audience.

4683
01:59:48,341 --> 01:59:49,240
It's laughter.

4684
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:49,600
You know,

4685
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:50,500
if you go to see like honey,

4686
01:59:50,501 --> 01:59:50,861
honey,

4687
01:59:50,861 --> 01:59:51,161
you know,

4688
01:59:51,161 --> 01:59:51,340
it's,

4689
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:53,170
it's not laughter but
it's this other crazy,

4690
01:59:53,171 --> 01:59:53,531
weird,

4691
01:59:53,531 --> 01:59:54,341
satisfying thing.

4692
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:55,390
What's beautiful music.

4693
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:56,111
You know,

4694
01:59:56,111 --> 01:59:56,950
it's like that,

4695
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:58,720
that is what it's all about.

4696
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:00,670
And unless you're doing that,

4697
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:04,570
you're not going to be happy unless
you're finding whenever the fuck it is in

4698
02:00:04,571 --> 02:00:06,790
life that makes you do something.

4699
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:10,180
And it always seems to have something
to do with how other people appreciate

4700
02:00:10,181 --> 02:00:10,960
your work.

4701
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,250
Cause it's like if you're a chef,

4702
02:00:12,251 --> 02:00:13,840
you want people to appreciate your food.

4703
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:14,950
If you're a carpenter,

4704
02:00:14,951 --> 02:00:16,510
you want to appreciate someone,

4705
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:17,600
appreciate what you've done.

4706
02:00:17,601 --> 02:00:18,610
And you built this house.

4707
02:00:18,790 --> 02:00:23,020
It always seems to have something to
do with giving something or producing

4708
02:00:23,021 --> 02:00:25,690
something and creating something
that other people feel good about.

4709
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:28,750
Whether you're a lawyer who gets guy
out of a tricky situation because you

4710
02:00:28,751 --> 02:00:29,710
really love the law.

4711
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:31,060
You have this passion for the law,

4712
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:32,051
like whatever it is,

4713
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:36,820
it always seems to come down to how much
passion do you have for for it and how

4714
02:00:36,821 --> 02:00:39,040
much does it have
positively affect people.

4715
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:42,400
That's like how you got to
kind of structure your life
and that's why a lot of

4716
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:45,070
people get really lost and they just
try to do things for themselves.

4717
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:47,860
They just try to get ahead for
themselves and just try to do well for

4718
02:00:47,861 --> 02:00:48,670
themselves.

4719
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:52,480
And in doing so you're like a person
who's got like this and massive vitamin

4720
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:52,991
deficiency.

4721
02:00:52,991 --> 02:00:55,000
Like you're taking all this vitamin
D and you're taking all those,

4722
02:00:55,001 --> 02:00:56,110
but you don't have any sea.

4723
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,150
There's no senior,

4724
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:57,611
your system,

4725
02:00:57,611 --> 02:01:00,280
you're missing vitamin love
like everything you're doing.

4726
02:01:00,281 --> 02:01:02,980
It's like a forward move me,

4727
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:04,640
myself and Ah,

4728
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:07,270
I will cause shellfish till you know,

4729
02:01:07,271 --> 02:01:08,140
till I make it.

4730
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:09,730
I don't have time to be nice,

4731
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:10,571
but you don't understand.

4732
02:01:10,571 --> 02:01:11,500
You don't have a choice.

4733
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,670
You will not be happy.

4734
02:01:12,671 --> 02:01:14,200
You won't be successful if you make it,

4735
02:01:14,201 --> 02:01:14,921
you'll be miserable.

4736
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:17,620
You wind up fucked up on
booze or drugs or whatever.

4737
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:18,040
You're,

4738
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,540
you're at an imbalance point.

4739
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:21,340
If you're thinking solely of yourself,

4740
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:25,570
it's like your greatest work and your
greatest feelings will all come and

4741
02:01:25,571 --> 02:01:28,540
creating something that you're passionate
about that other people are going to

4742
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:29,220
enjoy.

4743
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:29,981
It seems to be,

4744
02:01:29,981 --> 02:01:30,820
that's like the,

4745
02:01:30,821 --> 02:01:35,500
that is a big key to life that it has
to be to really truly be a happy person.

4746
02:01:35,501 --> 02:01:38,140
You have to be doing something that
other people are enjoying as well.

4747
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:38,830
Oh yeah.

4748
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:40,130
There's fucking doubt about

4749
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,410
that.

4750
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:42,710
That's because like when I hear
people take antidepressants,

4751
02:01:42,711 --> 02:01:42,951
I mean,

4752
02:01:42,951 --> 02:01:43,370
I don't know.

4753
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:44,390
I don't have any,

4754
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:47,060
any imbalance and he mental
about that I know of,

4755
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:49,130
but if I do it workable,

4756
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:49,760
you know?

4757
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:52,310
But when I hear people taking
things to make them happy,

4758
02:01:52,311 --> 02:01:52,640
I go,

4759
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,061
wow,

4760
02:01:53,061 --> 02:01:53,391
man.

4761
02:01:53,391 --> 02:01:53,641
Match.

4762
02:01:53,641 --> 02:01:55,520
Then imagine not being happy.

4763
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,830
Imagine like spending most
of your time not being,

4764
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,810
I don't feel that because
I'm happy all the time.

4765
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:00,561
No,

4766
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:01,960
I mean I'm not happy all the time.

4767
02:02:01,961 --> 02:02:02,171
I'm,

4768
02:02:02,171 --> 02:02:03,200
I'm pretty happy person.

4769
02:02:03,201 --> 02:02:04,130
And people have said that to me.

4770
02:02:04,131 --> 02:02:04,401
They're like,

4771
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:04,471
well,

4772
02:02:04,471 --> 02:02:05,301
for a comedian,

4773
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:05,691
you know,

4774
02:02:05,691 --> 02:02:07,090
comedians are all fuck you,

4775
02:02:07,091 --> 02:02:07,641
you're pretty happy.

4776
02:02:07,641 --> 02:02:08,240
And I go,

4777
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:08,391
well,

4778
02:02:08,391 --> 02:02:09,650
I look for happiness.

4779
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:09,940
Well,

4780
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:11,030
you're intelligent.

4781
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:12,710
You gravitate towards happiness.

4782
02:02:12,711 --> 02:02:12,860
Yeah.

4783
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:15,590
I tried to find all the
things that make me happy.

4784
02:02:15,591 --> 02:02:17,270
I go surfing and makes me happy.

4785
02:02:17,490 --> 02:02:18,440
I go workout at the gym.

4786
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,130
I like that.

4787
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:19,941
I love my girlfriend.

4788
02:02:19,941 --> 02:02:20,751
She makes me happy.

4789
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:21,350
I found her,

4790
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:21,591
you know,

4791
02:02:21,591 --> 02:02:22,850
like my dogs.

4792
02:02:22,851 --> 02:02:23,684
They make me happy.

4793
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:25,100
I go out and hang out with my friends.

4794
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:27,620
Like do the things that
make you fucking happy.

4795
02:02:27,730 --> 02:02:28,910
It's like when people go,

4796
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,751
I hate my job.

4797
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:31,340
I hate my life fucking chain.

4798
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,203
I can't.

4799
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:33,500
Yes you can.

4800
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:34,360
This way,

4801
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,193
it's not easy.

4802
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:36,200
It's certainly not easy to,

4803
02:02:36,201 --> 02:02:37,034
it depends on how,

4804
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:37,401
you know,

4805
02:02:37,401 --> 02:02:39,620
if you swam all the way out to
the middle of the ocean and go,

4806
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:40,610
I got to get back to shore.

4807
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:41,300
I can't you,

4808
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:41,870
well,

4809
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:42,703
you got here,

4810
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:44,000
it's going to take a long time.

4811
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:44,160
Yeah.

4812
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:45,950
You got to get better the
same way you got sick.

4813
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:46,220
Yeah.

4814
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:48,230
It's not easy to get back to shore,

4815
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:49,041
but you know,

4816
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:53,090
if you would swam only a few feet and
didn't get a mortgage and didn't have kids

4817
02:02:53,091 --> 02:02:55,280
and didn't have 20 years and
waiting for your pension,

4818
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:57,620
and then if you just get out in six years,

4819
02:02:57,621 --> 02:02:59,390
then you'll have full health
insurance until you're dead.

4820
02:02:59,660 --> 02:02:59,931
You know,

4821
02:02:59,931 --> 02:03:00,231
there's,

4822
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:03,710
there's people that like cannot ever
pull the trigger to jettison themselves.

4823
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:07,370
I just had this argument with a friend
who was telling me they're depressed and

4824
02:03:07,371 --> 02:03:07,851
I said,

4825
02:03:07,851 --> 02:03:08,480
well,

4826
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,080
like,

4827
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:09,531
look,

4828
02:03:09,531 --> 02:03:10,281
what do you need?

4829
02:03:10,281 --> 02:03:10,910
You know,

4830
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:12,140
what would be like,

4831
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:13,370
let's take the steps.

4832
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:14,180
And they're like,

4833
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:14,780
uh,

4834
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:15,980
can I get a coconut water?

4835
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:17,380
They're like,

4836
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,213
uh,

4837
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:19,213
you know,

4838
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,560
that's not the thing you say
to someone that's depressed.

4839
02:03:21,561 --> 02:03:21,800
That's,

4840
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,251
and I'm like,

4841
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:22,521
look,

4842
02:03:22,521 --> 02:03:23,720
I'm here to say let's,

4843
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:24,950
let's find the past.

4844
02:03:24,951 --> 02:03:25,371
I mean,

4845
02:03:25,371 --> 02:03:25,641
man,

4846
02:03:25,641 --> 02:03:26,091
what does that mean?

4847
02:03:26,091 --> 02:03:26,780
That's not the thing.

4848
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,261
This is not you.

4849
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:30,090
One universal thing you say to someone
that's depressed and I haven't yet.

4850
02:03:30,091 --> 02:03:32,960
I haven't read the book about what I'm
not supposed to say to people that are

4851
02:03:32,961 --> 02:03:33,500
depressed.

4852
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,550
I don't know what's going on in someone's
head cause I know for sure I'm wired

4853
02:03:37,551 --> 02:03:38,540
different than other people.

4854
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,870
I've reacted different and
how much of it is nature,

4855
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,990
how much of it is nurture
the fuck do I know?

4856
02:03:44,991 --> 02:03:46,760
I don't even think
that's an exact science,

4857
02:03:46,761 --> 02:03:47,211
by the way.

4858
02:03:47,211 --> 02:03:48,090
I think there's a lot,

4859
02:03:48,150 --> 02:03:49,530
a lot going on in the,

4860
02:03:49,830 --> 02:03:51,530
in the school of Psychology,

4861
02:03:51,531 --> 02:03:52,450
that's a lot of,

4862
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,200
it's theoretical and there's a lot of,

4863
02:03:54,530 --> 02:03:55,550
there's a lot of shit going on.

4864
02:03:55,551 --> 02:03:58,460
There's still don't know exactly
why a person is the way they are.

4865
02:03:58,461 --> 02:04:00,030
So I don't know what the
fuck makes somebody happy.

4866
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:02,630
Have you seen the stuff
that did the teachers,

4867
02:04:02,631 --> 02:04:04,040
the class on happiness at Harvard,

4868
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:05,770
he teaches a class.

4869
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:06,710
There's a class,

4870
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:07,281
it's a,

4871
02:04:07,281 --> 02:04:09,860
I think it's Harvard business school
and you can watch some of his stuff.

4872
02:04:09,861 --> 02:04:11,360
I'll tell you what would make me happy.

4873
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:15,470
Teaching a class on being
happy would not make me happy.

4874
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:15,861
Well,

4875
02:04:15,861 --> 02:04:16,250
this guy,

4876
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:16,420
no,

4877
02:04:16,420 --> 02:04:18,140
but when he talks about some cool shit,

4878
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:22,660
he apparently it's like the most
coveted class at Harvard like itself.

4879
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:25,790
Like it signs up and you can't get into
it cause it's the first one is easy

4880
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:26,790
credit that

4881
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,890
makes you happy.

4882
02:04:30,190 --> 02:04:32,020
But he's got something like he's young,

4883
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:34,850
he's done a lot of studies on happiness,

4884
02:04:34,851 --> 02:04:35,840
which is pretty amazing.

4885
02:04:35,841 --> 02:04:36,890
And he starts stuff like,

4886
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:37,560
uh,

4887
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,393
I think

4888
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:39,151
one of them was,

4889
02:04:39,151 --> 02:04:41,430
he said that after $70,000,

4890
02:04:41,431 --> 02:04:42,360
like in America,

4891
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:43,950
after you make so many thousand dollars,

4892
02:04:43,951 --> 02:04:44,760
your,

4893
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,280
your happiness is not congruent with your,

4894
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:48,810
with your financial level.

4895
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,530
That's bullshit.

4896
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:50,920
That means you've got a bad friend,

4897
02:04:52,870 --> 02:04:55,320
doesn't know what the
fuck you talking about.

4898
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:56,160
Who you hanging out with,

4899
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:56,760
dude,

4900
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:57,391
what else or something.

4901
02:04:57,391 --> 02:04:58,770
We can do some damage with some money.

4902
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,341
Hold on,

4903
02:04:59,341 --> 02:04:59,731
hold on.

4904
02:04:59,731 --> 02:05:01,170
I got a friend who has,

4905
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,610
who literally is a,

4906
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,350
I shouldn't even talk about this.

4907
02:05:04,351 --> 02:05:04,981
I'll let you say,

4908
02:05:04,981 --> 02:05:06,540
I've got to figure out how to filter it.

4909
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:08,460
I got a friend with a lot of money,

4910
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:13,730
like a lot of money and
this friend use the money.

4911
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:15,180
For awhile he didn't.

4912
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:16,141
And then I was like,

4913
02:05:16,141 --> 02:05:16,860
dude,

4914
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,440
do you know what you can
get with what you have?

4915
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:23,840
And then it clicked one day and then he
had slipped and slides on the top floor.

4916
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:26,400
The fucking win with chicks naked,

4917
02:05:26,401 --> 02:05:27,960
fucking running down the slip and slide.

4918
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:29,920
Well fucking uh,

4919
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:30,630
uh,

4920
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:35,580
midgets dressed in or little
people dressed in storm
trooper outfits are serving

4921
02:05:35,581 --> 02:05:36,330
him drinks.

4922
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:36,960
That's awesome.

4923
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,040
Like he went and did it as a no,

4924
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:39,990
but I mean he just,

4925
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:43,230
he just did the Michael Jackson
thing where you have so much money.

4926
02:05:43,231 --> 02:05:43,500
You're like,

4927
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,610
I want to live in a tree and I want
to have a monkey and I want to have,

4928
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,071
you know,

4929
02:05:47,071 --> 02:05:49,890
like you just started going
fucking crazy and like,

4930
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:53,170
let's see how we can just
spend this money and you know,

4931
02:05:53,190 --> 02:05:53,941
the next thing you know,

4932
02:05:53,941 --> 02:05:55,500
he's just totally fucked up.

4933
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:55,831
You know,

4934
02:05:55,831 --> 02:05:56,530
just,

4935
02:05:56,530 --> 02:05:57,141
you know,

4936
02:05:57,141 --> 02:05:57,974
there's just,

4937
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:00,090
it crippled a mentally and,

4938
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:00,541
you know,

4939
02:06:00,541 --> 02:06:02,430
he ended up in Rehab
and all kinds of shit.

4940
02:06:02,431 --> 02:06:06,090
Like I can't happen when you're looking
for that empty happiness or you're

4941
02:06:06,091 --> 02:06:08,040
looking for happiness through substances.

4942
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:08,941
You know when people say,

4943
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:09,150
Oh,

4944
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:10,070
you're a hypocrite dude,

4945
02:06:10,071 --> 02:06:11,160
you're getting high all the time.

4946
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:12,480
First of all,

4947
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,710
I take weeks off.

4948
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:15,120
I don't have to get high all the time.

4949
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:16,050
I liked it in high.

4950
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,333
It's good for you.

4951
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:17,660
I think.

4952
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:21,660
I think marijuana is one of the only
vices that I really don't have any problem

4953
02:06:21,661 --> 02:06:21,830
with.

4954
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:25,440
As long as you'd get all your other
shit done in your life and you use it to

4955
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:27,300
enhance things that your
dad was just going to say.

4956
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:32,130
But my agent in Australia is the fucking
greatest guy that's ever lived and my

4957
02:06:32,131 --> 02:06:37,131
agent gets everything done on all
the time and he's fucking amazing.

4958
02:06:37,171 --> 02:06:37,431
And,

4959
02:06:37,431 --> 02:06:37,670
and,

4960
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:38,640
and he joked with,

4961
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:42,200
he wants and he said about like getting
high like you can be productive on ma.

4962
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,650
I know so many math,

4963
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,470
like productive fucking
people with marijuana,

4964
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,670
super productive.

4965
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:52,940
A lot of writers beyond like people
get you to like the mentality I am.

4966
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,380
If I smoked pot,

4967
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:59,400
I'd be way more productive because
when I used to smoke it I was better.

4968
02:06:59,460 --> 02:06:59,750
But I,

4969
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:00,583
I just can't smell.

4970
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:02,810
When you said one bad thing that too,

4971
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:03,713
did you uh,

4972
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:05,400
what did you tweet me about this?

4973
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:08,130
We talked about this on the green room.

4974
02:07:08,670 --> 02:07:09,341
He tweeted me,

4975
02:07:09,341 --> 02:07:10,320
he was in horror,

4976
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:12,020
just couch law.

4977
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:16,800
Joe was my go to guy and I thought here's
a guy that's going to talk me down off

4978
02:07:16,801 --> 02:07:17,520
the ledge.

4979
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,750
Like you just need your,

4980
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:19,111
your,

4981
02:07:19,111 --> 02:07:20,330
your medicine like,

4982
02:07:20,331 --> 02:07:21,164
and it could be like,

4983
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:24,540
like a lot of people say milk helps
you when you have like a bachelor from

4984
02:07:24,541 --> 02:07:26,250
Sherman and even if it doesn't,

4985
02:07:26,251 --> 02:07:27,061
you have that in your head.

4986
02:07:27,061 --> 02:07:29,070
Somebody told you milk milk around,

4987
02:07:29,071 --> 02:07:29,910
you ever have that happen again?

4988
02:07:29,911 --> 02:07:30,750
You drink a glass of milk,

4989
02:07:30,751 --> 02:07:31,584
you'll feel it.

4990
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:34,380
I started getting panic attacks
from it and people told me,

4991
02:07:34,381 --> 02:07:36,190
like Bert told me to get

4992
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:38,410
a w with Xanax and I'm like,

4993
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:39,910
I'm not taking Xanax.

4994
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:40,973
And he's like,

4995
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:42,293
stick with the milk.

4996
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:43,121
He's like,

4997
02:07:43,121 --> 02:07:43,631
take Xanax.

4998
02:07:43,631 --> 02:07:43,871
I'm like,

4999
02:07:43,871 --> 02:07:44,681
I'm not taking Xanax.

5000
02:07:44,681 --> 02:07:45,101
And he goes,

5001
02:07:45,101 --> 02:07:46,270
he just put in your pocket.

5002
02:07:46,271 --> 02:07:46,870
He goes,

5003
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:47,860
you don't ever use it,

5004
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:48,010
you,

5005
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:49,150
but you know it's there.

5006
02:07:49,151 --> 02:07:50,940
It's like it's silly bitch.

5007
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,350
I think Burt was the one who
told me that sounds like,

5008
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:54,060
oh no,

5009
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:54,893
no,

5010
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:59,223
I go,

5011
02:07:59,320 --> 02:07:59,970
do you ever,

5012
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:00,220
I go,

5013
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:02,950
you ever have a panic attack
and you guys fuck every day.

5014
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:03,760
And I go,

5015
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:04,810
what do you do to stop them?

5016
02:08:04,811 --> 02:08:05,260
He goes,

5017
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,160
have kids.

5018
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:07,600
Wow.

5019
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:08,500
Cause I said I was having,

5020
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:09,191
that's what it was.

5021
02:08:09,191 --> 02:08:10,730
I was self indulgence has get,

5022
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:11,773
it's a back seat.

5023
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:12,370
I was at,

5024
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:13,780
yeah I was having trouble getting it.

5025
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:17,980
A lot of the like fuck the anxiety was
happening on planes and stuff and like

5026
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:20,600
when I'm claustrophobic
and they locked the doors,

5027
02:08:20,601 --> 02:08:21,434
so the plane,

5028
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:22,090
I'm like,

5029
02:08:22,090 --> 02:08:23,210
I want off this fucking plane.

5030
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:24,550
I look flipped out.

5031
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:25,360
I'm like,

5032
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,150
I get it.

5033
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:26,380
Yeah.

5034
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,990
I'm always afraid I'm gonna
be that guy they're holding.

5035
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:28,451
Yeah.

5036
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:30,430
I have like a claustrophobia
thing of like,

5037
02:08:30,710 --> 02:08:32,680
like you couldn't have fly so much,

5038
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:33,461
so much.

5039
02:08:33,461 --> 02:08:33,601
And,

5040
02:08:33,601 --> 02:08:33,970
and,

5041
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:34,803
and I don't like,

5042
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,280
I don't like sitting on a runway.

5043
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:37,690
I like when we take off.

5044
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:38,920
I like when I don't,

5045
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:40,360
like when we pull up the
gate and they're like,

5046
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:40,871
oh,

5047
02:08:40,871 --> 02:08:43,480
we're not gonna be able to pull into
the gate for another 20 minutes.

5048
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,740
That's when I'm like,

5049
02:08:44,741 --> 02:08:47,170
what is it about complete fucking control?

5050
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:48,251
That's what it is.

5051
02:08:48,251 --> 02:08:49,240
It is a control freak.

5052
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,113
He got to,

5053
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:52,130
someone said something
to me a long time ago,

5054
02:08:52,131 --> 02:08:53,320
this comedian Tony v,

5055
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:54,310
and it literally,

5056
02:08:54,311 --> 02:08:56,440
it became a tool that I use in my life.

5057
02:08:56,710 --> 02:09:00,220
He was driving back and forth from
Boston to New York on a regular basis and

5058
02:09:00,221 --> 02:09:01,120
that's a long drive.

5059
02:09:01,121 --> 02:09:02,230
A couple hours at least,

5060
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:03,220
even if you're going fast.

5061
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:04,061
And I said,

5062
02:09:04,061 --> 02:09:04,271
uh,

5063
02:09:04,271 --> 02:09:04,511
I go,

5064
02:09:04,511 --> 02:09:06,130
how are you doing that every day?

5065
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:07,120
And he goes,

5066
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,230
I just go zen.

5067
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:08,771
I just,

5068
02:09:08,771 --> 02:09:09,820
I'm in my car and I go,

5069
02:09:09,821 --> 02:09:10,810
this is what I'm doing.

5070
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:11,800
I'm driving the car.

5071
02:09:11,890 --> 02:09:12,460
And I just,

5072
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:13,180
that's,

5073
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:15,580
that's how much time it takes
and I don't worry about it.

5074
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:16,413
I just do it.

5075
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:16,961
And I was like,

5076
02:09:16,961 --> 02:09:17,141
wow,

5077
02:09:17,141 --> 02:09:18,700
that is the way to think about it.

5078
02:09:18,701 --> 02:09:19,451
Because you know,

5079
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:20,360
it's like you'd start doubling,

5080
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:20,951
God dammit.

5081
02:09:20,951 --> 02:09:21,760
Why don't they pull this thing,

5082
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,240
then you realize like how much energy
is wasted on something that you're never

5083
02:09:25,241 --> 02:09:27,070
going to have any effect on it whatsoever.

5084
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:28,870
And if it takes two
hours to drive somewhere,

5085
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:32,830
it takes two hours to drive somewhere
unless you hit a fucking wormhole and find

5086
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:34,180
yourself on the other side somehow,

5087
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:35,230
you know,

5088
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:36,730
it takes two hours to drive there.

5089
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:37,950
You just have to go zen.

5090
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,321
And he,

5091
02:09:38,321 --> 02:09:39,130
it's a tool.

5092
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:40,330
It's a tool I use now.

5093
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:43,390
So whenever I'm in any
sort of a situation where,

5094
02:09:43,391 --> 02:09:43,890
you know,

5095
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:46,330
if it's bad weather or
if it's what I just go,

5096
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:47,500
this is what I'm doing now.

5097
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:51,130
I heard some fucked up shit
recently about flying and pilots.

5098
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:52,860
This girl I know told me that like,

5099
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,800
I can't say who it is,

5100
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:55,210
I can't say what airline or whenever,

5101
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:58,270
but she knows it's a pilot and uh,

5102
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:59,231
she,

5103
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:01,360
he was talking about how like
how you had to go to work and he,

5104
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:01,970
and she goes,

5105
02:10:01,970 --> 02:10:02,061
oh,

5106
02:10:02,061 --> 02:10:02,681
that sucks.

5107
02:10:02,681 --> 02:10:03,790
I get tired and she goes out.

5108
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:04,241
He goes like,

5109
02:10:04,241 --> 02:10:06,220
that's why I can't wait to
go flying's like that's what,

5110
02:10:06,221 --> 02:10:07,360
when I get the best sleep,

5111
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:09,400
I guess like when they take off the,

5112
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:12,130
and then the copilot is fucking
sit there and push a button,

5113
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:13,180
go to sleep,

5114
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:14,560
and they get wake woken up,

5115
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:15,131
you know,

5116
02:10:15,131 --> 02:10:15,780
when her,

5117
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:16,570
uh,

5118
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:17,710
like near the city.

5119
02:10:17,970 --> 02:10:18,803
Why is it scary?

5120
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,870
Because that's just like,

5121
02:10:19,871 --> 02:10:22,180
if you imagine like going
into a cockpit of an airplane,

5122
02:10:22,181 --> 02:10:23,490
everyone's fucking sleeping.

5123
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:24,840
One

5124
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,550
guy stays awake at a time.

5125
02:10:26,551 --> 02:10:27,930
I think they probably do shifts.

5126
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:28,411
But,

5127
02:10:28,411 --> 02:10:28,710
um,

5128
02:10:28,710 --> 02:10:29,330
I think the,

5129
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:32,010
the way those autopilot things work,

5130
02:10:32,011 --> 02:10:34,670
unless there's a situation where they're
running the crazy weather and they wake

5131
02:10:34,671 --> 02:10:35,504
right the fuck up.

5132
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,950
I don't really think
it's that big of a deal.

5133
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:37,850
It seems like it should be,

5134
02:10:37,851 --> 02:10:38,780
but I mean,

5135
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:39,501
it's just all like,

5136
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:40,940
you're driving on a windy road,

5137
02:10:40,941 --> 02:10:42,470
you're just flying in a direction.

5138
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:44,930
They put it on autopilot
and it just fucking guess.

5139
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,110
I knew a chick who's a pilot who,

5140
02:10:48,490 --> 02:10:49,210
uh,

5141
02:10:49,210 --> 02:10:49,430
uh,

5142
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:50,720
and I'm not going to tell you the airline,

5143
02:10:50,721 --> 02:10:51,441
but she,

5144
02:10:51,441 --> 02:10:52,220
uh,

5145
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:57,220
she fucked another pilot while they
were flying commercial airline.

5146
02:10:57,501 --> 02:10:58,280
What a dirty,

5147
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:59,630
and she wasn't flying the big ones,

5148
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:03,170
but she was flying like maybe like a two
and a one like two seats on one side,

5149
02:11:03,171 --> 02:11:05,420
one on the other leagues.

5150
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:09,800
She's up there fucking riding a dude
who I know and I thought about that.

5151
02:11:09,801 --> 02:11:10,310
I'm like,

5152
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:11,090
I would like that.

5153
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:13,910
I would like to know that if
there's a female pilot up there,

5154
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:15,380
she's fucking up there.

5155
02:11:15,381 --> 02:11:16,430
That makes me feel good.

5156
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:17,330
Are you should,

5157
02:11:17,330 --> 02:11:20,630
if you're an hour on
a plane was the woman,

5158
02:11:20,690 --> 02:11:22,670
the woman comes on over the loudspeaker.

5159
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:23,061
Hello,

5160
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:24,460
this is your pilot and Argos.

5161
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,880
What a woman.

5162
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:27,433
What

5163
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:30,920
it real like.

5164
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:31,940
Oh No,

5165
02:11:33,230 --> 02:11:34,580
I hate that uncomfortable shit,

5166
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,391
dude.

5167
02:11:35,391 --> 02:11:36,230
Don't do this.

5168
02:11:36,231 --> 02:11:37,170
Don't do this right now.

5169
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:38,750
Jim Jefferies was on a plane.

5170
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:41,040
That dude died.

5171
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:42,240
Whoa.

5172
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:45,320
On the plane with his wife.

5173
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:46,010
Oh my God.

5174
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:50,600
And he dies and it's like fucking leg
England to Australia or something.

5175
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:51,141
Oh my God.

5176
02:11:51,141 --> 02:11:52,850
So He's dead and the dead.

5177
02:11:52,851 --> 02:11:55,280
I go start to smell or
did they do and he goes,

5178
02:11:55,281 --> 02:11:59,540
they like took him to the back and
covered them with like a blanket and I'm

5179
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:00,020
like,

5180
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:00,561
oh my God,

5181
02:12:00,561 --> 02:12:01,280
what did she do?

5182
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:01,581
He goes,

5183
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:02,660
she has sat there.

5184
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:06,080
Oh my God fucking car.

5185
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:07,490
I can't imagine.

5186
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,430
I watched the lady go into a
seizure and was really creepy man.

5187
02:12:10,431 --> 02:12:11,264
It was weird.

5188
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:14,630
It was right after September 11th
so she was right behind on a plane.

5189
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,300
Yeah.

5190
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:17,840
She starts to start seizuring and they go,

5191
02:12:17,841 --> 02:12:18,381
it's okay.

5192
02:12:18,381 --> 02:12:19,190
It's okay.

5193
02:12:19,190 --> 02:12:19,821
It's okay.

5194
02:12:19,821 --> 02:12:22,460
This happens sometimes I
guess epileptic people,

5195
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:22,940
they just,

5196
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:24,110
they just go into seizures.

5197
02:12:24,130 --> 02:12:24,590
Yeah,

5198
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:24,861
yeah.

5199
02:12:24,861 --> 02:12:25,680
I've seen that a bunch.

5200
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:26,570
My friend Jay,

5201
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:27,660
Jay Helfrich,

5202
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:32,540
he's a a pool player and spent most of
his life like gambling and playing pool

5203
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:34,970
is playing this guy and the middle is set.

5204
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,410
The guy falls down to the
ground and starts bucking
and kick in and making these

5205
02:12:39,411 --> 02:12:43,280
noises and the guy was losing
and he assumed that the
guy was doing it to try to

5206
02:12:43,281 --> 02:12:44,120
get out of the game.

5207
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:45,140
Cause like,

5208
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:45,520
you know,

5209
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:45,650
yeah,

5210
02:12:45,650 --> 02:12:45,831
it was,

5211
02:12:45,831 --> 02:12:47,180
dudes will do things to shark.

5212
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:49,340
You sure they'll do
things to distract you.

5213
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:50,390
And he was looking at it like,

5214
02:12:50,391 --> 02:12:50,691
wow,

5215
02:12:50,691 --> 02:12:51,381
this is a new one.

5216
02:12:51,381 --> 02:12:52,970
This guy is faking a seizure.

5217
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:56,630
But really the guy was an epileptic
and it was like a normal occurrence.

5218
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:59,840
Like he'd be in the middle of his day
and he would just fall to the ground and

5219
02:12:59,841 --> 02:13:02,810
start bucking and twitching
and they didn't help him.

5220
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,490
He didn't help him die.

5221
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:05,121
Someone helped him.

5222
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:05,940
Someone came over there.

5223
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:06,330
There's a,

5224
02:13:06,330 --> 02:13:07,460
there's a video on youtube,

5225
02:13:07,461 --> 02:13:09,950
I think you can find it and
we played it on our podcast.

5226
02:13:09,951 --> 02:13:12,290
There's a comedian that
died on stage in England,

5227
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,080
died,

5228
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:14,480
fell off the stage and died.

5229
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:15,470
Well fucking Gallagher's.

5230
02:13:15,471 --> 02:13:16,980
I like 18 heart attacks offstage.

5231
02:13:17,110 --> 02:13:19,670
Know this guy just fell
off the back of the stage.

5232
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:21,560
But he was that kind of comic too.

5233
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:26,950
So they think it's part of his act and
then eventually his son runs on stage and

5234
02:13:28,701 --> 02:13:29,451
kind of is like,

5235
02:13:29,451 --> 02:13:30,410
this isn't a joke.

5236
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:32,160
That'd be kind of a cool way to go.

5237
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,143
I agree.

5238
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,320
You know why not?

5239
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:38,490
It's better than you would
kind of ruin the show.

5240
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:39,330
Yeah,

5241
02:13:39,330 --> 02:13:43,410
maybe it would make it better with your
bombing and that was how you pulled

5242
02:13:43,411 --> 02:13:44,244
yourself out of it.

5243
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:45,540
Um,

5244
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:47,730
I saw a guy do that on a golf course.

5245
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:48,810
Once he died,

5246
02:13:48,811 --> 02:13:52,800
he stayed at God know somebody misses
a Putt and he just does a faint.

5247
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:56,130
And I thought that's a
fucking cool trick that like,

5248
02:13:56,160 --> 02:14:00,210
like you're going pretty far to
like show how bad that affected you.

5249
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:04,680
And I'm sitting there and all of a sudden
I see a woman jump off like over the

5250
02:14:04,681 --> 02:14:06,570
railing of like a six foot high porch,

5251
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:09,420
jump over it and just sprint down to it.

5252
02:14:09,421 --> 02:14:10,254
And I went,

5253
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:10,591
oh,

5254
02:14:10,591 --> 02:14:11,190
that's,

5255
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:13,800
and so I just ran and called
nine one one and I was like,

5256
02:14:13,801 --> 02:14:14,640
fuck man.

5257
02:14:14,641 --> 02:14:15,900
Amazone uh,

5258
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:16,530
he died.

5259
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:18,690
They said he was dead
when he hit the ground,

5260
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:19,830
which is heart attack or something.

5261
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:20,100
Yeah.

5262
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:21,270
Sometimes it just stops,

5263
02:14:21,271 --> 02:14:21,620
man.

5264
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:25,260
If a blow a piston in your car and just
driving on the highway and bang black

5265
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:26,094
smoke,

5266
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,050
you pull over the side of the road.

5267
02:14:28,110 --> 02:14:30,420
Have you ever thought you were having
a heart attack and then you burped?

5268
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:31,690
No.

5269
02:14:31,690 --> 02:14:34,650
I get indigestion and I've gotten a bad,

5270
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:37,110
I've gotten into gestures
so bad where I'm like,

5271
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:37,471
fuck,

5272
02:14:37,471 --> 02:14:39,300
I'm getting these like
crippling chest pains.

5273
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:40,350
And I'm like,

5274
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:40,471
Oh,

5275
02:14:40,471 --> 02:14:41,161
I guess this is it.

5276
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:41,880
I'm going,

5277
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:42,601
that's crazy.

5278
02:14:42,601 --> 02:14:44,550
And then all of a sudden
I'll burp and I'll be like,

5279
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:45,623
I'm going to live.

5280
02:14:45,630 --> 02:14:45,841
Whoa,

5281
02:14:45,841 --> 02:14:46,051
Whoa,

5282
02:14:46,051 --> 02:14:46,550
whoa.

5283
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:47,910
We really have you ever had that?

5284
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:49,073
I get it all the time.

5285
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:52,830
I get my heart every day.

5286
02:14:52,831 --> 02:14:53,310
I'm pretty good.

5287
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:55,740
The heart beats freaks out.

5288
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,530
It's,

5289
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:58,950
it's mostly all because of like,

5290
02:14:58,951 --> 02:14:59,581
oh yeah,

5291
02:14:59,581 --> 02:15:00,930
I had onions on my subway,

5292
02:15:02,890 --> 02:15:04,170
spoons can fuck shit.

5293
02:15:04,171 --> 02:15:05,220
Like that fucks me up.

5294
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:06,090
I don't know.

5295
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:07,600
I don't get it anymore cause I'm,

5296
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:08,910
I'm a nerd about my diet.

5297
02:15:08,911 --> 02:15:10,890
I eat the Paleo Diet and uh,

5298
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:12,570
and I fucking am religious.

5299
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:15,930
How did you become this
fitness nut mean because you,

5300
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:19,020
your choice of attack is like crossfit.

5301
02:15:19,021 --> 02:15:20,190
Like how did that I,

5302
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:23,730
I ran track in college like all
my life and then got into like,

5303
02:15:23,731 --> 02:15:28,200
I was an ocean lifeguard and I was doing
like ocean lifeguarding competitions

5304
02:15:28,201 --> 02:15:28,921
and stuff like that.

5305
02:15:28,921 --> 02:15:32,970
And then I got into like triathlons
and I was always doing it on the slide.

5306
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:35,430
It was almost like I'd go out
and party really fucking hard,

5307
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:37,620
like really hard for like two weeks.

5308
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:38,880
And then I would go like,

5309
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:40,950
feel shit about myself
and try to clean up.

5310
02:15:41,490 --> 02:15:42,500
And then I'd go like,

5311
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:44,190
and it was like here and there,

5312
02:15:44,191 --> 02:15:44,671
here and there.

5313
02:15:44,671 --> 02:15:46,380
And then finally I just said,

5314
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:46,831
all right,

5315
02:15:46,831 --> 02:15:48,060
this has got to fucking stop.

5316
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:48,893
I'm a mess.

5317
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:50,190
I'm a mess.

5318
02:15:50,191 --> 02:15:51,024
Like I was,

5319
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:51,780
I,

5320
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:52,980
when I'd go to the UK,

5321
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:56,760
I'd spend three months over there where
I would drink at lunch and we would go

5322
02:15:56,761 --> 02:15:59,360
out for lunch for beers and
I would drink til show time,

5323
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:00,270
drink,

5324
02:16:00,270 --> 02:16:00,511
you know,

5325
02:16:00,511 --> 02:16:03,090
they bring me a couple of
pints backstage at the show,

5326
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:03,931
do the show,

5327
02:16:03,931 --> 02:16:05,250
and they go out and party all night.

5328
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:08,850
And I'd come home from England
just feeling like a piece of shit.

5329
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:10,073
And uh,

5330
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:10,801
and I was like,

5331
02:16:10,801 --> 02:16:11,210
all right,

5332
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:12,300
I better do something.

5333
02:16:12,301 --> 02:16:13,230
So I started,

5334
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:13,560
uh,

5335
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:15,570
I started working out and then,

5336
02:16:15,571 --> 02:16:16,380
uh,

5337
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,580
I found that I was,

5338
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,650
I liked bodywork.

5339
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:21,120
Heck a body like body weight
exercises like pull ups,

5340
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:21,541
push ups,

5341
02:16:21,541 --> 02:16:22,374
sit ups stuff.

5342
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:25,260
Cause I didn't want to get big and
because I liked the run still and,

5343
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:27,150
and I found the navy seal workouts.

5344
02:16:27,151 --> 02:16:30,370
So I started doing navy seal
workouts online and then they said,

5345
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:31,360
uh,

5346
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:31,720
Eh,

5347
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:32,740
we don't have a workout today.

5348
02:16:32,741 --> 02:16:33,640
Go to crossfit.

5349
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:34,001
And I was like,

5350
02:16:34,001 --> 02:16:35,140
what's this fucking crossfit thing?

5351
02:16:35,141 --> 02:16:36,160
So I went to crossfit.

5352
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:36,911
I'm like,

5353
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:39,160
what is this fucking
weird community of there?

5354
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:40,840
And it's fucking weird dude.

5355
02:16:40,841 --> 02:16:41,770
I mean it's a weird group of,

5356
02:16:41,771 --> 02:16:43,570
it was a weird group of people.

5357
02:16:43,571 --> 02:16:44,110
The ideas,

5358
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:45,510
there are different exercises every day,

5359
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:46,490
every day you're shopping,

5360
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:49,330
you're just a shocking your system
with metabolic conditioning.

5361
02:16:49,331 --> 02:16:50,740
It's combination of gymnastics,

5362
02:16:50,741 --> 02:16:52,030
weight lifting and sprinting.

5363
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:53,380
And uh,

5364
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:55,120
and it's,

5365
02:16:55,310 --> 02:16:58,090
it's the whole idea is the
prepare for the unknowing.

5366
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:59,800
Like you never know what
you're going to get.

5367
02:16:59,801 --> 02:17:00,670
Like in weightlifting,

5368
02:17:00,671 --> 02:17:03,880
you might do your legs one day and
then you take a week break to let your

5369
02:17:03,881 --> 02:17:04,840
muscles recuperate.

5370
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:05,853
But if you're a,

5371
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:06,580
an uh,

5372
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:10,360
mixed martial arts guy or a cop
or fireman or a military guy,

5373
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:12,330
you don't know what's happening day to.

5374
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:17,310
So they might throw fucking legs at you
day two and day three like you don't,

5375
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:18,170
so you,

5376
02:17:18,170 --> 02:17:19,010
it's not good though.

5377
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:21,130
Not good in one aspect
but good in another.

5378
02:17:21,131 --> 02:17:24,640
Your adaptation levels start
getting higher and higher.

5379
02:17:24,670 --> 02:17:25,480
Your ligaments,

5380
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:25,750
no,

5381
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:26,650
not necessarily.

5382
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:28,540
Because if you learn good form,

5383
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:32,290
which is what they try to teach you is
learn the proper technique and then you

5384
02:17:32,291 --> 02:17:35,560
won't have the injuries and you won't
have the problems but aren't you like the

5385
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:36,720
whole idea about working out,

5386
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:38,410
he's supposed to give
your body time to recover.

5387
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:40,060
Well they use it like a battle,

5388
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:42,280
a seesaw if you like.

5389
02:17:42,281 --> 02:17:43,180
I'm a three day on,

5390
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:43,991
one day off guy,

5391
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:44,651
three days on,

5392
02:17:44,651 --> 02:17:46,690
one day off three which
is what they prescribed.

5393
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:49,690
But you look at the guys who
are now the competitive level,

5394
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,260
the guys that are competing on that
are the top crossfitters in the world.

5395
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:57,460
Like if you look up this guy rich Froning

Brion pull up.

fucking crazy dude who came in second at

5412
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:21,400
They calm the toughest
athlete on the planet.

5413
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:24,310
This dude like regularly runs.

5414
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:26,013
Um,

5415
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:26,531
where's it say,

5416
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:27,760
does it say Goggins iron man,

5417
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:28,690
the upper left hand corner?

5418
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:29,000
Yeah.

5419
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,320
Yeah.

5420
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:30,070
Click on that.

5421
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:33,310
This dude ran a 48 hour race.

5422
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:37,540
It's a mile track and
you run for 48 hours.

5423
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:40,050
Just wrapping your head around it.

5424
02:18:40,051 --> 02:18:41,060
That's ultra Merrick's.

5425
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:41,930
No breaks.

5426
02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:42,710
The guys,

5427
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:44,350
the guy that runs crossfit and endurance.

5428
02:18:44,370 --> 02:18:45,550
But what it is is it's your,

5429
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:48,040
you're pushing your limits.

5430
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:49,263
Listening.

5431
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:50,523
I know on the blacklist,

5432
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:53,510
just to test my soul to see it.

5433
02:18:53,511 --> 02:18:58,511
I'm about to see in 150 mile race in
[inaudible] 75 when I feel really bad,

5434
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:02,810
that's when you know that's
the only time you can find out.

5435
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:04,480
What do you mean by is all about what,

5436
02:19:04,481 --> 02:19:08,450
what you're made of to find out and
seeing this dude a lot to myself,

5437
02:19:09,210 --> 02:19:14,160
limits of the human soul and every day
I'm trying to see if I have limits.

5438
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:26,010
I run anywhere from one
25 one 50 in a week,

5439
02:19:26,310 --> 02:19:28,700
so I'll try put him
about 450 miles a month

5440
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:31,160
running.

5441
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:32,080
Usually every day.

5442
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:35,660
I wake up at three o'clock in the morning
and I run anywhere from 10 to 15 miles

5443
02:19:35,661 --> 02:19:39,320
in the morning and then I
live about 25 miles from work.

5444
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:40,480
So I,

5445
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:41,540
I get my bicycle,

5446
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:42,680
commute into work,

5447
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:48,370
do a normal work day at lunchtime around
noon I'll run again and he's an ultra

5448
02:19:49,611 --> 02:19:50,151
marathon,

5449
02:19:50,151 --> 02:19:50,730
eight miles,

5450
02:19:50,730 --> 02:19:51,530
whatever it may be.

5451
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:56,530
Come back work and around five 30 I
arrived back home 25 miles on my bike.

5452
02:19:57,620 --> 02:19:58,640
If I'm feeling good,

5453
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:00,070
I've considered doing one in the house,

5454
02:20:00,210 --> 02:20:03,980
get off the bike and do like a short
three or four or five mile run.

5455
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:06,710
That's my everyday life.

5456
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:09,140
So I don't this train like an hour or so.

5457
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:13,130
I tried it until something is
uncomfortable and then national,

5458
02:20:13,131 --> 02:20:13,970
you know who you are,

5459
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:16,790
she's fucking Christ.

5460
02:20:17,830 --> 02:20:19,290
There's a thing called crossfit and

5461
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:21,920
it just never ends.

5462
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:22,581
This for me.

5463
02:20:22,581 --> 02:20:27,581
I've done some races where you're on
a one mile track and you around for 48

5464
02:20:27,951 --> 02:20:28,784
hours straight.

5465
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:30,170
So imagine reminder,

5466
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:32,030
48 hours of running my mile track.

5467
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:33,850
It's not like you're sleeping.

5468
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:34,091
You're,

5469
02:20:34,091 --> 02:20:35,800
you're running for 48 hours,

5470
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:36,860
70 miles you can get,

5471
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,570
I want to talk about mine torture.

5472
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,820
I think it's so fast.

5473
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:47,830
Any of those dudes that are constantly
trying to explore the limits of what you

5474
02:20:47,831 --> 02:20:48,664
can pull off.

5475
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:50,530
We were just talking about this yesterday.

5476
02:20:50,531 --> 02:20:54,400
We had Andy Petranek on who owns crossfit
La on our show and he was talking

5477
02:20:54,401 --> 02:20:56,620
about where it's come
from and what it goes.

5478
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:58,360
It used to be the guys,

5479
02:20:58,750 --> 02:20:59,170
uh,

5480
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:03,220
they used to give awards for if you
could do like 40 pull ups like that was,

5481
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:08,520
there's guys that blow out 107 in a row
now like I can do for your straight arm.

5482
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:12,820
No we do a kipping pull up but I can
do 40 in a row like w without even

5483
02:21:12,821 --> 02:21:13,151
thinking.

5484
02:21:13,151 --> 02:21:14,600
Can you really simple?

5485
02:21:14,620 --> 02:21:15,341
Do you grab it,

5486
02:21:15,341 --> 02:21:17,530
a palms outward or pumps towards you?

5487
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:21,730
I go palms outward and it's just like
when we jumped rope you jumped two at a

5488
02:21:21,731 --> 02:21:22,121
time.

5489
02:21:22,121 --> 02:21:22,571
Always a,

5490
02:21:22,571 --> 02:21:27,571
now it's advancing to three at a time and
like three swings under your feet each

5491
02:21:27,641 --> 02:21:29,770
jump and it's just,

5492
02:21:29,771 --> 02:21:33,970
you're learning that like man just evolves
and gets better and better and adapts

5493
02:21:33,971 --> 02:21:35,920
that things like we have a workout called,

5494
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:38,770
we have a workout called
Murph where you run a mile,

5495
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:40,180
then you do 100 pull ups,

5496
02:21:40,181 --> 02:21:41,440
then you do 200 pushups,

5497
02:21:41,441 --> 02:21:43,210
300 air squats,

5498
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:46,900
and then you run 300 air
squats and then you run,

5499
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:48,280
you can break it up in any order.

5500
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:50,260
So like we do like five 10 15 five,

5501
02:21:50,261 --> 02:21:50,900
10 new,

5502
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,210
you talking about Hindus squats,

5503
02:21:52,211 --> 02:21:53,710
we'd go all the way down to your heels.

5504
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:53,980
Oh,

5505
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:56,590
you're the crease of your hip has
to break the crease of your knee.

5506
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,510
So your hip has to go,

5507
02:21:57,511 --> 02:21:58,060
but you're not.

5508
02:21:58,060 --> 02:21:59,440
Your acid is not touch your heels,

5509
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:00,070
your,

5510
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:00,490
your,

5511
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:00,940
your,

5512
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:01,601
your hips.

5513
02:22:01,601 --> 02:22:03,400
They'll have to go below your knee crease.

5514
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:06,880
And it's not quite as
hard as Hindu squats,

5515
02:22:06,881 --> 02:22:10,630
but I can't imagine that you can do
all that and do 300 so you run a mile,

5516
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:12,130
then you do a hundred pull ups.

5517
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:12,993
Oh my God.

5518
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:14,650
200 pushups,

5519
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:15,640
which we do chest,

5520
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:16,900
a hand release,

5521
02:22:16,901 --> 02:22:17,590
pushups.

5522
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:18,880
So your chest touches the ground,

5523
02:22:18,910 --> 02:22:22,060
you release your hands and then go
up and you're thinking that's easier.

5524
02:22:22,090 --> 02:22:22,271
No,

5525
02:22:22,271 --> 02:22:23,320
it's harder to trust me.

5526
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:25,560
Your chest is touching the
ground on every pushup.

5527
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,780
And then you do 300 air squats.

5528
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,650
Then you run a mile.

5529
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:29,610
That's called Murph.

5530
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:30,743
That's a workout.

5531
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:34,800
Now add to it now a 20 pound weight vest.

5532
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:35,940
Uh,

5533
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:37,710
but without a 20 pound weight vest.

5534
02:22:37,711 --> 02:22:42,711
A guy in our gym did it in like 24 minutes
and he did it like it takes me like

5535
02:22:43,081 --> 02:22:44,790
36 minutes or something to do it.

5536
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:47,700
He didn't like 24 minutes and he did it.

5537
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:48,840
Uh,

5538
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:52,380
he was doing his miles in
like five 15 or five 20,

5539
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:54,000
like a mile.

5540
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:56,190
He would run in five
and then go do all that.

5541
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:58,500
No he didn't do that one
with the 20 pound vest.

5542
02:22:58,810 --> 02:23:02,010
[inaudible] it goes substantially
higher with the vest on,

5543
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:05,910
but the times are just coming
down and down and down.

5544
02:23:05,911 --> 02:23:06,171
And the,

5545
02:23:06,171 --> 02:23:08,050
the pull ups and the Po and the weight,

5546
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:09,840
the injuries are people getting more,

5547
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:14,190
I think people do sustain injuries just
like they wouldn't MMA and everything

5548
02:23:14,191 --> 02:23:14,460
else.

5549
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,730
And we have a big problem with that.

5550
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:16,693
And then,

5551
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:17,880
and I think it was the NFL,

5552
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:19,260
we talk about that on my show a lot.

5553
02:23:19,261 --> 02:23:20,010
Cause like my,

5554
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:24,900
my girlfriend's dad's an ex NFL football
player and he's got two artificial

5555
02:23:24,901 --> 02:23:25,734
hips,

5556
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:29,130
two knee surgeries and two
shoulder surgeries there.

5557
02:23:29,131 --> 02:23:31,380
They become like bionic men cause dome.

5558
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:33,361
He's pretty good.

5559
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:34,650
He's a very successful businessman.

5560
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,310
But like,

5561
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:38,850
like I got a buddy who's a crossfitter
who's a super bowl fucking,

5562
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:39,960
he's a crossfitter now,

5563
02:23:39,961 --> 02:23:41,130
but he was in the Superbowl,

5564
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:42,660
this guy's won the super bowl,

5565
02:23:42,661 --> 02:23:46,470
he's won national championship in
football and Nash and the High School

5566
02:23:46,470 --> 02:23:47,303
Championship and football.

5567
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:48,630
And he is a,

5568
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:49,081
you know,

5569
02:23:49,081 --> 02:23:53,910
he's got all these injuries from football
but like he'll tell you that crossfits

5570
02:23:53,911 --> 02:23:57,630
like keeping them in the game because
like there's nothing better for your back

5571
02:23:57,631 --> 02:23:59,490
they say then doing deep back squats.

5572
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:00,150
Huh.

5573
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:00,421
You know,

5574
02:24:00,421 --> 02:24:00,801
like it,

5575
02:24:00,801 --> 02:24:01,020
it,

5576
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:02,910
that's fundamentally
what's good for your spine.

5577
02:24:02,911 --> 02:24:04,500
Now if you're doing it with improper form,

5578
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:05,880
you're going to fuck yourself up.

5579
02:24:05,881 --> 02:24:06,360
You're going to find,

5580
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:07,290
you're going to go deep.

5581
02:24:07,630 --> 02:24:09,600
And when you do a deep squat,

5582
02:24:09,601 --> 02:24:10,151
like how,

5583
02:24:10,151 --> 02:24:11,630
how far down is your asco?

5584
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:12,490
Um,

5585
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:12,920
same,

5586
02:24:12,920 --> 02:24:14,200
same kind of thing where I'm going to,

5587
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:17,790
mine goes really deep because that's
where you're going to get your

5588
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:18,990
explosiveness at the top.

5589
02:24:18,991 --> 02:24:19,950
Like people don't understand,

5590
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:20,460
they think,

5591
02:24:20,460 --> 02:24:20,581
oh,

5592
02:24:20,581 --> 02:24:21,510
I don't want to go that low.

5593
02:24:21,511 --> 02:24:21,960
And I'm like,

5594
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:25,200
I want to get as low down as I can
because right there is where your,

5595
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:28,850
your nerf are going to fire and you're
gonna be able to explode on and we need

5596
02:24:28,851 --> 02:24:30,020
to get you to do Jujitsu.

5597
02:24:30,350 --> 02:24:35,070
You're overflowing was manly exercises
and you don't have an outlet for them.

5598
02:24:35,071 --> 02:24:35,151
Well,

5599
02:24:35,151 --> 02:24:37,700
you can see your progress other
than the exercises themselves.

5600
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:38,910
You know,

5601
02:24:38,910 --> 02:24:40,260
we've got to get you in and
you want to come tonight.

5602
02:24:40,261 --> 02:24:41,094
What are you doing today?

5603
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:41,820
I'm loving it.

5604
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:42,601
You know what it'll be.

5605
02:24:42,601 --> 02:24:44,070
It'll be the fucking panic of me.

5606
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:45,420
I've been choked out before.

5607
02:24:45,421 --> 02:24:45,571
Like,

5608
02:24:45,571 --> 02:24:45,721
Oh,

5609
02:24:45,721 --> 02:24:46,530
you won't know son.

5610
02:24:46,530 --> 02:24:48,120
You don't spar your first day,

5611
02:24:48,121 --> 02:24:48,390
man.

5612
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:49,650
You learn some moves and you,

5613
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:49,981
you,

5614
02:24:49,981 --> 02:24:51,570
you're learn positions with people.

5615
02:24:51,571 --> 02:24:53,260
It's not like you're just
allowed to get mauled.

5616
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:57,690
Also Callen told me once I was dogging
account cause I wanted to take Krav Maga.

5617
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:02,580
I dinner one night with John
Mayer and a John Mayer was,

5618
02:25:02,610 --> 02:25:04,570
is a big fucking Krav Maga.

5619
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:05,423
He loves it.

5620
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:06,343
He loves that chip.

5621
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:07,680
And I had just been robbed.

5622
02:25:07,681 --> 02:25:09,660
I had a guy break into my
house while I was there.

5623
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:10,470
Whoa.

5624
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:11,580
I'm upstairs in my house.

5625
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:14,130
I come down the steps is this
black dude standing in my house.

5626
02:25:14,131 --> 02:25:14,611
And I go,

5627
02:25:14,611 --> 02:25:15,211
what's up dude?

5628
02:25:15,211 --> 02:25:15,751
Which he trusted us.

5629
02:25:15,751 --> 02:25:18,300
It was an inside joke,

5630
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:19,723
sorry.

5631
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:21,691
He goes,

5632
02:25:21,691 --> 02:25:22,470
ah.

5633
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:23,303
He goes,

5634
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:24,040
I'm

5635
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,090
looking for David King.

5636
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:26,013
And I go,

5637
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:27,010
uh,

5638
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:27,731
who's David King?

5639
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:28,564
He goes,

5640
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:29,020
no,

5641
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:29,490
it goes,

5642
02:25:29,490 --> 02:25:30,191
is this his house?

5643
02:25:30,191 --> 02:25:30,431
And I go,

5644
02:25:30,431 --> 02:25:30,581
no,

5645
02:25:30,581 --> 02:25:31,180
he goes off,

5646
02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:32,290
it must have the wrong place.

5647
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:33,910
And he walks out the door and I'm like,

5648
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:35,320
fuck.

5649
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:37,480
So I kind of walked out and my
dog was a puppy at the time.

5650
02:25:37,481 --> 02:25:38,500
I didn't want to run it around.

5651
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:42,250
So I follow him out and then I take
the dog back up as I come back out,

5652
02:25:42,251 --> 02:25:42,461
I go,

5653
02:25:42,461 --> 02:25:43,061
Yo Dude,

5654
02:25:43,061 --> 02:25:43,894
what,

5655
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:44,890
what?

5656
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:46,000
Who's David King?

5657
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:51,190
And he kind of looks at me and then
he starts to run and he's already,

5658
02:25:51,191 --> 02:25:53,730
he's got about 150 meters on me and I,

5659
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:54,670
I was like,

5660
02:25:54,910 --> 02:25:58,420
I ran a division one track and
in college and I was a sprinter.

5661
02:25:58,421 --> 02:25:59,190
And I'm like,

5662
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:02,810
this dude has no idea how fast this white
guy is and I'm going to fucking catch

5663
02:26:02,811 --> 02:26:02,950
him.

5664
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:03,783
Why would you,

5665
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:05,350
I'm like,

5666
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,990
I'm going to catch this because he,

5667
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:07,281
you know,

5668
02:26:07,281 --> 02:26:08,200
he was just in my house.

5669
02:26:08,201 --> 02:26:09,400
He just fucking robbed me.

5670
02:26:09,550 --> 02:26:10,031
And I'm like,

5671
02:26:10,031 --> 02:26:12,430
what did he have two when
I took the dog back in,

5672
02:26:12,850 --> 02:26:13,960
as I go inside,

5673
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:17,140
I see my pants were on the
couch and I look in the wallets,

5674
02:26:17,141 --> 02:26:19,270
out of the pants and everything
stripped out of the wallet.

5675
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:21,340
So when I go back out,

5676
02:26:21,341 --> 02:26:21,910
I go,

5677
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:22,091
I,

5678
02:26:22,091 --> 02:26:23,230
that's when I sprinted after.

5679
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:24,490
And uh,

5680
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:25,900
so I started to die for your critical,

5681
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:26,771
no,

5682
02:26:26,771 --> 02:26:26,951
no,

5683
02:26:26,951 --> 02:26:27,200
I,

5684
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,641
I don't know.

5685
02:26:27,641 --> 02:26:28,420
It's the fucking,

5686
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:30,310
this is what I'm telling
my aggression problems.

5687
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:31,360
You should really,

5688
02:26:31,361 --> 02:26:32,680
so I chased this dude,

5689
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:33,460
I'm like fuck,

5690
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:33,970
like,

5691
02:26:33,970 --> 02:26:35,590
and when I turned the corner,

5692
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:36,700
he had just disappeared.

5693
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:40,210
Thank God cause I live in
Venice and my buddy's like,

5694
02:26:40,211 --> 02:26:40,391
dude,

5695
02:26:40,391 --> 02:26:41,320
he's a shoreline crip.

5696
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:43,960
He would've come back that night
and put a bullet in your head.

5697
02:26:43,961 --> 02:26:44,920
You're an idiot.

5698
02:26:46,490 --> 02:26:47,260
So,

5699
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:48,490
so you know,

5700
02:26:48,850 --> 02:26:49,631
in retrospect,

5701
02:26:49,631 --> 02:26:49,840
but,

5702
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:50,650
so I,

5703
02:26:50,650 --> 02:26:54,310
I tell John Mayer about this is you
got to read the book gift of fear.

5704
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,331
He's like,

5705
02:26:55,331 --> 02:26:56,170
read that book.

5706
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:56,950
And he's like,

5707
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:58,270
and then go take Krav Maga.

5708
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:01,570
So I tell Collin I'm going to
crawl in the and Callen cause no,

5709
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:02,733
no,

5710
02:27:02,950 --> 02:27:03,783
not you.

5711
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:07,810
You will bring it on yourself.

5712
02:27:07,811 --> 02:27:08,141
He's like,

5713
02:27:08,141 --> 02:27:09,310
if you know how to use it,

5714
02:27:09,311 --> 02:27:10,360
it's like having a gun in your house.

5715
02:27:10,390 --> 02:27:10,631
Yeah.

5716
02:27:10,631 --> 02:27:11,200
He's like,

5717
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:12,033
why?

5718
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:13,540
So I don't have a gun.

5719
02:27:13,630 --> 02:27:14,920
I don't have fucking anything.

5720
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:16,660
That's good to tell
people on the Internet.

5721
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:18,471
I'll tell you what.

5722
02:27:18,471 --> 02:27:19,091
I got guns.

5723
02:27:19,091 --> 02:27:19,751
You'd come to my house.

5724
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:22,390
I'm gonna choke the fuck out
of you if I got a hold of you.

5725
02:27:23,810 --> 02:27:24,131
I don't,

5726
02:27:24,131 --> 02:27:25,120
I disagree with count.

5727
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:25,770
Um,

5728
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:26,550
I,

5729
02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:29,070
if anybody had a lack of
self control as a young man,

5730
02:27:29,071 --> 02:27:29,551
it was me.

5731
02:27:29,551 --> 02:27:32,070
And it's one of the reasons my parents
didn't actually want me doing martial

5732
02:27:32,071 --> 02:27:34,230
arts cause they were worried that I
was going to start using it on people.

5733
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:36,050
That was the number one fear in our house.

5734
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:37,530
I had to convince them
they wouldn't do that,

5735
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:39,210
but you wouldn't do that.

5736
02:27:39,211 --> 02:27:40,220
You'd get self disciplined,

5737
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:41,430
but it allows you,

5738
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:42,250
you know,

5739
02:27:42,250 --> 02:27:44,400
at least if that guy jumped on you,

5740
02:27:44,420 --> 02:27:46,680
attacked you or it didn't
have a knife or something,

5741
02:27:46,710 --> 02:27:46,901
you know,

5742
02:27:46,901 --> 02:27:47,521
where was a weapon?

5743
02:27:47,521 --> 02:27:47,851
You're in trouble.

5744
02:27:47,851 --> 02:27:49,740
At least you could kind
of defend yourself.

5745
02:27:50,280 --> 02:27:50,481
You know,

5746
02:27:50,481 --> 02:27:50,741
you,

5747
02:27:50,741 --> 02:27:54,600
you put yourself in a better position
and it's a great way to exercise a great

5748
02:27:54,601 --> 02:27:55,381
way to blow off steam.

5749
02:27:55,381 --> 02:27:56,131
And it's interesting,

5750
02:27:56,131 --> 02:27:57,450
you're actually learning something.

5751
02:27:57,451 --> 02:27:58,800
You're learning a language.

5752
02:27:58,801 --> 02:27:59,790
The language of how to,

5753
02:27:59,970 --> 02:28:00,940
how to strangle people.

5754
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:02,460
How do we had a break arms?

5755
02:28:02,461 --> 02:28:04,750
How does he know how to
get to positions and you,

5756
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:06,150
you learn these moves.

5757
02:28:06,151 --> 02:28:09,510
I mean the interaction between two
human beings and they're grappling.

5758
02:28:09,511 --> 02:28:13,080
There's an infinite number of positions
and moves in different places to go to.

5759
02:28:13,081 --> 02:28:13,660
So it's like,

5760
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:14,880
it's a very intellectual,

5761
02:28:14,881 --> 02:28:19,560
Jujitsu is really completely under
appreciated as an intellectual exercise.

5762
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:21,890
I already threatened enough go.

5763
02:28:21,891 --> 02:28:22,010
He

5764
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,611
wouldn't do it,

5765
02:28:22,611 --> 02:28:22,881
man.

5766
02:28:22,881 --> 02:28:24,320
I never threatened people.

5767
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:25,341
You wouldn't do it.

5768
02:28:25,341 --> 02:28:25,701
I've been doing,

5769
02:28:25,701 --> 02:28:27,200
I've been doing martial
arts my whole life.

5770
02:28:27,201 --> 02:28:27,500
I've,

5771
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,160
I fucking have.

5772
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:30,840
I don't think I've ever said I'm going
to kick your fucking ass to I do it.

5773
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:33,230
I do it on stage once a year.

5774
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:35,210
That's crazy.

5775
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:36,140
I'll never do that.

5776
02:28:36,141 --> 02:28:38,740
At least once a year somebody
will push me like um,

5777
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:40,060
like you were saying Harlan,

5778
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:45,070
just like I laughed through everything
but at a certain point I have a snap

5779
02:28:45,411 --> 02:28:46,710
where I'm just like so dumb.

5780
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:48,440
That's going to get you hurt man.

5781
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,820
You'd come to Jujitsu with me tonight.

5782
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:50,654
What are you doing tonight?

5783
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:51,780
Come Watch.

5784
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:52,910
He doesn't want to touch other guys.

5785
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:53,803
That'd be silly.

5786
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:55,293
Where do you go?

5787
02:28:55,450 --> 02:28:57,420
Do you go to 10 Hollywood come to me.

5788
02:28:58,630 --> 02:28:59,110
I got,

5789
02:28:59,110 --> 02:28:59,943
I have to go to hell.

5790
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:01,573
Not Tonight.

5791
02:29:02,650 --> 02:29:03,380
There is no tomorrow.

5792
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:08,380
Rocky like Apollo creed said no tomorrow
and I got a bulging disc right now.

5793
02:29:11,790 --> 02:29:12,623
Just watch.

5794
02:29:12,930 --> 02:29:13,401
Just watch.

5795
02:29:13,401 --> 02:29:13,720
I'm not sure.

5796
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:15,440
I'm not telling you to get
in there and get crazy.

5797
02:29:15,441 --> 02:29:17,650
Do you have a bulging disc close on it?

5798
02:29:17,651 --> 02:29:18,484
Some guys,

5799
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:20,930
Ronald said someone
will take care of that.

5800
02:29:22,130 --> 02:29:23,180
Well listen man,

5801
02:29:23,181 --> 02:29:24,080
been a fun pause cat.

5802
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:24,600
The flood,

5803
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,090
we've done like three hours man.

5804
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:30,980
Totally free by pretty close to
hours in something I'm always doing.

5805
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:31,641
Always a good time.

5806
02:29:31,641 --> 02:29:32,001
My brother.

5807
02:29:32,001 --> 02:29:32,810
Always good to see you.

5808
02:29:32,810 --> 02:29:35,540
Always good to run it anytime you want to.

5809
02:29:35,541 --> 02:29:36,190
Come on man.

5810
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:36,700
Fucking awesome.

5811
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:37,640
I love it dude.

5812
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:38,793
And I got to come on here.

5813
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:40,581
We'll do it.

5814
02:29:40,581 --> 02:29:41,150
We'll work with fans.

5815
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:41,631
Ask Us,

5816
02:29:41,631 --> 02:29:43,790
constantly do it once a week now.

5817
02:29:43,791 --> 02:29:44,331
So what are you doing?

5818
02:29:44,331 --> 02:29:44,781
We do it.

5819
02:29:44,781 --> 02:29:45,830
What we've always done once a week.

5820
02:29:45,831 --> 02:29:47,380
We do Monday night and a,

5821
02:29:47,430 --> 02:29:48,080
that's the problem.

5822
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:50,390
Cause you wrestle on Monday
stuff most of the time.

5823
02:29:50,391 --> 02:29:50,671
But I'll,

5824
02:29:50,671 --> 02:29:51,080
I'll take,

5825
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:51,920
I'll take the night off.

5826
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:53,210
I'll do it in the day.

5827
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:54,170
Um,

5828
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:54,620
okay.

5829
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:54,830
Uh,

5830
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:58,250
Eddie left and Jim Jefferies
have a podcast on iTunes.

5831
02:29:58,251 --> 02:29:59,150
It's fucking awesome.

5832
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:00,051
Please check it out.

5833
02:30:00,051 --> 02:30:00,680
It's called Co.

5834
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:01,770
Come see me at the Hollywood improv.

5835
02:30:01,790 --> 02:30:04,220
How do you not talking shit
because they pulled it off.

5836
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:06,680
Talkings hit talkings hit.

5837
02:30:06,890 --> 02:30:07,101
Oh,

5838
02:30:07,101 --> 02:30:07,491
I get it.

5839
02:30:07,491 --> 02:30:09,040
So you just moved to space over this.

5840
02:30:09,060 --> 02:30:09,590
Very,

5841
02:30:09,590 --> 02:30:11,400
very clever and I'm talking,

5842
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:13,010
it hit hit.

5843
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:15,710
Talkings hit ladies and
Joe Hollywood improv.

5844
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:16,430
This,

5845
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:16,820
uh,

5846
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:18,750
this Saturday two shows I'm headline.

5847
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:18,981
Oh,

5848
02:30:18,981 --> 02:30:19,581
that's beautiful.

5849
02:30:19,581 --> 02:30:21,320
The Hollywood of Improv on Melrose,

5850
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:23,780
one of the best clubs
in the whole country.

5851
02:30:23,781 --> 02:30:24,980
It's an amazing spot.

5852
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:28,130
It's like really intimate seating
and it's going to sell out.

5853
02:30:28,131 --> 02:30:28,861
So if you're,

5854
02:30:28,861 --> 02:30:29,451
you're interested,

5855
02:30:29,451 --> 02:30:30,950
go online and just Google.

5856
02:30:30,951 --> 02:30:31,784
You know how to do that shit.

5857
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:32,733
You're smart.

5858
02:30:33,020 --> 02:30:33,980
You gotta rush the stage.

5859
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:34,401
Oh yeah.

5860
02:30:34,401 --> 02:30:35,780
Somebody's got rushed in the stage there.

5861
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:36,673
Randy can,

5862
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:37,401
do you know the story?

5863
02:30:37,401 --> 02:30:41,600
I don't know him but I saw the whole
thing and he has no idea why the guy went

5864
02:30:41,601 --> 02:30:42,030
up there.

5865
02:30:42,030 --> 02:30:42,863
I just went crazy.

5866
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,101
Yeah,

5867
02:30:43,101 --> 02:30:43,934
just fucking deck.

5868
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:47,720
What's he talking about when the guy is
doing a joke on California and the guy

5869
02:30:47,721 --> 02:30:48,080
had,

5870
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:49,940
the guy wasn't heckling previously.

5871
02:30:49,941 --> 02:30:52,790
There was no fucking
reason or I'm just crazy.

5872
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:53,330
Yeah,

5873
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:54,140
that happens.

5874
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:55,850
You go out there in the world,

5875
02:30:55,851 --> 02:30:57,940
you can run into crazy and
that's why I should know judges.

5876
02:30:58,040 --> 02:30:58,640
That helps.

5877
02:30:58,640 --> 02:30:59,061
It helps.

5878
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:02,150
It would help you tremendously
do especially telling me
threatening people once

5879
02:31:02,151 --> 02:31:02,984
a year.

5880
02:31:02,990 --> 02:31:03,561
Come on,

5881
02:31:03,561 --> 02:31:05,270

out to Atlanta this past weekend for my

5888
02:31:17,811 --> 02:31:19,040
filming could have been better.

5889
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,891
You guys are the shit.

5890
02:31:19,891 --> 02:31:20,250
We're,

5891
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:24,510
we're beyond lucky to be in the
situation where we have a show like this.

5892
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:25,530
I don't know how the fuck it happened,

5893
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:26,221
Brian.

5894
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:27,054
Do you know how it happened?

5895
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:29,093
The internets.

5896
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:29,371
Yeah,

5897
02:31:29,371 --> 02:31:30,204
but I mean,

5898
02:31:30,270 --> 02:31:31,320
something happened.

5899
02:31:31,321 --> 02:31:34,470
It all coalesced together in some
sort of a magical form and we're very

5900
02:31:34,471 --> 02:31:35,400
fortunate and we,

5901
02:31:35,401 --> 02:31:35,710
we,

5902
02:31:35,710 --> 02:31:36,960
we think about that all the time.

5903
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:37,890
We were very appreciative.

5904
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:40,230
So thank you very much
to everybody tomorrow.

5905
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,220
Mad Flavor,

5906
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:42,650
Aka Joe Diaz.

5907
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:43,320
Fuck.

5908
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:43,831
What the fuck?

5909
02:31:43,831 --> 02:31:44,664
Cock sucker.

5910
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:47,790
He's going to come down to regale us
with stories of old school criminal

5911
02:31:47,791 --> 02:31:49,980
adventures and his ball sack,

5912
02:31:49,981 --> 02:31:52,140
which by the way got him
kicked off of Facebook,

5913
02:31:52,170 --> 02:31:53,830
purple veins and Mary Eric.

5914
02:31:53,930 --> 02:31:54,380
Yeah.

5915
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:55,213
It's so funny.

5916
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:56,850
Cover of his documentary.

5917
02:31:56,851 --> 02:31:58,890
He decides this is Joe Rogan.

5918
02:31:58,891 --> 02:32:00,390
This is going to be the
cover of my documentary.

5919
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:01,760
It's gonna say it's gonna.

5920
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:02,400
This is it.

5921
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,031
It's beautiful.

5922
02:32:03,031 --> 02:32:08,031
It's my balls man hanging out there with
fucking does a vein of beautiful vein

5923
02:32:08,131 --> 02:32:08,401
in my,

5924
02:32:08,401 --> 02:32:11,490
and I'm pulling up and it
says where I got my balls.

5925
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,080
That's the name of my,

5926
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:13,980
of my special,

5927
02:32:14,010 --> 02:32:14,900
my documentary.

5928
02:32:14,910 --> 02:32:17,510
Like wouldn't that be
like dad's balls then?

5929
02:32:17,790 --> 02:32:18,001
Yeah,

5930
02:32:18,001 --> 02:32:18,950
you would assume vagina.

5931
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:19,561
I mean it's just,

5932
02:32:19,561 --> 02:32:20,394
it's a metaphor,

5933
02:32:21,010 --> 02:32:23,190
but so he's going to change
it and it's going to be the,

5934
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:23,391
the,

5935
02:32:23,391 --> 02:32:24,630
the actual picture.

5936
02:32:24,631 --> 02:32:26,130
He's a two pronged attack.

5937
02:32:26,131 --> 02:32:28,110
The first prong is show people's balls,

5938
02:32:28,230 --> 02:32:29,460
create a shock wave,

5939
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:30,540
which I guess he's achieved.

5940
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:34,710
And then pronged too is a different
photo than it has already prepared.

5941
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:36,990
Clever Joey d is,

5942
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:37,850
he's the man.

5943
02:32:37,850 --> 02:32:38,190
Can't wait.

5944
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:39,030
I'm going on tour with them.

5945
02:32:39,730 --> 02:32:40,350
Yes you are.

5946
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:41,170
And when and if,

5947
02:32:41,170 --> 02:32:43,800
and the first GIG and
Columbus is sold out right?

5948
02:32:44,090 --> 02:32:44,580
The first day.

5949
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:45,840
First show and Columbus is sold out.

5950
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:46,673
Second shows.

5951
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:50,340

May 17th May 18th that's Cleveland.

5952
02:32:50,341 --> 02:32:51,570
And how do people find out about this?

5953
02:32:51,571 --> 02:32:52,261
How they get their tickets?

5954
02:32:52,261 --> 02:32:52,561

5955
02:32:52,561 --> 02:32:52,921

I'll take it on the road.

5988
02:33:24,721 --> 02:33:25,554

5989
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:26,271

6005
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:48,630
Do your due diligence before
you take any supplements.

6006
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:50,100
Don't expect miracles,

6007
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:55,280
but expected to actually increase your
brain's ability to process information

6008
02:33:55,831 --> 02:33:56,664
and then it makes you,

6009
02:33:56,750 --> 02:33:57,930
it makes you talk cleaner.

6010
02:33:58,140 --> 02:33:58,651
It's a,

6011
02:33:58,651 --> 02:34:01,650
it actually pumps up your body's
ability to produce neurotransmitters.

6012
02:34:01,830 --> 02:34:03,390
It's all very controversial,

6013
02:34:03,391 --> 02:34:06,810
but something that I absolutely
stand by and believe in.

6014
02:34:06,990 --> 02:34:08,520
The first 30 pills when you order it,

6015
02:34:08,521 --> 02:34:10,710

6018
02:34:12,570 --> 02:34:13,141
You don't like it.

6019
02:34:13,141 --> 02:34:14,580
You try it like this isn't for me.

6020
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:15,690
You get all your money back.

6021

You don't even have to return the product.

6022
02:34:17,250 --> 02:34:17,770
All right,

6023
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:18,191
that's it.

6024
02:34:18,191 --> 02:34:19,300

02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:24,940
Kettlebells are common.

6028
02:34:24,941 --> 02:34:27,520
They should be here probably
in the second week of May,

6029
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:29,410
the first wave of Kettlebells,

6030
02:34:29,650 --> 02:34:32,470
the a the second way we're
going to blow your fucking mind,

6031
02:34:32,471 --> 02:34:32,711
but they're,

6032
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:34,120
they're taking a long time to build,

6033
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:35,870
but there are so ridiculous.

6034
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:38,330
How ridiculous that I just
can't wait to talk about it.

6035
02:34:38,331 --> 02:34:39,310
I'm not even exaggerating.

6036
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:40,240
You guys have your own kettle.

6037
02:34:40,241 --> 02:34:42,970
Then I'll show you something that's
going to blow your fucking socks off.

6038
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:43,780
MDF.

6039
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:44,171
That's it.

6040
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:44,891
You dirty bitches.

6041
02:34:44,891 --> 02:34:49,150
We love you from the bottom are
are our black monster hearts.

6042
02:34:49,470 --> 02:34:50,380
I don't even know what that means.

6043
02:34:50,381 --> 02:34:50,771
I'm stealing.

6044
02:34:50,771 --> 02:34:52,990
Lady Gaga has names now.

6045
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:53,650
