1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,230
Hello Freak bitches are doing the same
kind of things that had gotten like you

2
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:05,860
would do.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,700
That's what they think.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,953
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,850
But that's not the case.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,920
What is the big difference between body

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,620
builders allergic as a high purpose
each 40 do you have high reputations in

8
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:16,850
night?

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,650
You know they eat different and they
take other things different to get very

10
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,370
big.

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,640
And then we don't want to get vague or
just like we want to stay in the smallest

12
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:26,220
weight class we can and get
as strong as it was the same.

13
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:26,881
Big and strong,

14
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,181
strong,

15
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,014
strong.

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,850
So we just want to be strong.

17
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,760
So everything we do is not
to build larger muscle.

18
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,110
Like I've worked with track people,

19
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,123
mostly girls.

20
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,930
We don't want to put 10 pounds,

21
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:37,620
actually bodyweight,

22
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,900
almost 10 pounds of extra
weight that it had to overcome.

23
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,100
Gravity run down a track,

24
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,550
right?

25
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,100
So we keep keep your
body weight to a minimum,

26
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,870
you know the muscle mass.

27
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,010
We just want to make it strong.

28
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,330
You don't have to get bigger to be shown.

29
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,210
That's confusing to a lot of people.

30
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:53,990
Cause a lot of people think of big muscles
meaning stronger and that's the only

31
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:54,561
way to get stronger.

32
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:57,320
But I've seen some people and
power lifting competitions,

33
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,080
it just lift insane amounts of
weight and they're not that big.

34
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,970
Well how is that possible?

35
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,943
But muscle type,

36
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,281
you know,

37
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,550
you're always talking about you.

38
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,430
I've always mentioned you a few times.

39
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:09,320
You talk about like a
wooly as [inaudible].

40
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,600
He runs out of gas real quick.

41
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,673
Who?

42
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,491
Tyrone?

43
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:13,270
Tyron Woodley.

44
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah.

45
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,700
He has the same,

46
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,300
they've got a pretty,

47
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,830
pretty much the same
amount of muscle mass.

48
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,380
He just has very fast,

49
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:23,230
which muscle and our guy you're talking
about an endorsed may have board slow

50
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,630
twitch muscle and then so that that guy,

51
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,640
that's why he can fight
five rounds and Tyrone,

52
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,070
where to start from where out
somewhere in the second round.

53
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,720
Well it's also because a guy like
Tyron is capable of putting out so much

54
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,141
energy,

55
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:38,650
like the way he can attack
us and move so fast.

56
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,330
It's like having a 500 horsepower
engine versus having a 400 horsepower.

57
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,210
One's going to just use [inaudible]

58
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,660
gaps.

59
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:44,930
Right.

60
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,800
Well just fashion.

61
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,910
That's what you've got sprinters and
you've got marathon runners and it looked

62
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:50,744
totally different.

63
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,963
Yeah.

64
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,420
And so when someone looks at a bodybuilder
and they see this guy just covered in

65
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:55,721
muscles,

66
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:58,600
they assume that guy would be
able to lift a ton of weights.

67
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,980
But for the most part,

68
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:02,770
those guys can't lift nearly as
much weight as a guy like you can.

69
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,723
No,

70
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,180
that's,

71
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,200
that's crazy to people.

72
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,100
Like that doesn't even make sense.

73
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:06,941
Well,

74
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,500
like a lot of things are crazy.

75
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:08,971
People do,

76
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:09,251
don't,

77
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,990
aren't in and note came up.

78
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:12,250
What were Michigan,

79
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,780
what about this anabolic steroids?

80
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,280
Do you,

81
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,080
does it frustrate you?

82
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,070
The disc lack of understanding the
general public has about this stuff?

83
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,933
Absolutely.

84
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,600
Yo,

85
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,433
you ever,

86
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,880
you ever look at the Olympics?

87
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,660
Um,

88
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,140
we look at are weight lifters,

89
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:28,060
Olympic weight lifters.

90
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:28,960
We don't go to the Olympics.

91
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:30,110
I hope we never do hope.

92
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,280
I live to never get any letters.

93
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,910
They were sending the worst.

94
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,743
It's if there's ever,

95
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,810
but they said our,

96
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,930
when the team,

97
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,591
it's pretty bad.

98
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,750
We can't get a guy on the 18 all right.

99
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,880
And they're just not very good.

100
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,130
You look at our women gymnastics people,

101
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,570
they're extremely strong.

102
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,130
They blew her out of the water.

103
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,150
You go to China,

104
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,170
they're male weight lifters and female
archery ministry muscular and he killed

105
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:50,710
her body.

106
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,030
But your gym's look pathetic.

107
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
It's because they're all
in different systems.

108
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:55,140
You know,

109
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,120
there you got better coaches and,

110
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,750
and better systems that take stuff.

111
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,093
So

112
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,930
American doesn't have good Olympic

113
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,793
power lifters,

114
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,910
Olympic weightlifters,

115
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,570
weightlifters.

116
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,090
We rolled the world pout
of Jews in this country.

117
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,740
America went into twos are not very good.

118
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,090
They're not now terrible.

119
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,870
Really?

120
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,530
No,

121
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,251
I did not know that.

122
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,110
There was one girl what
got a bronze in Olympic.

123
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,630
One girl got a bronze.

124
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,360
We and my sport,

125
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:19,870
there's 12 male way classes.

126
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,290
Uh,

127
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,850
we hold seven of the total records.

128
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,840
My Jim Holtz too.

129
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,560
And,

130
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,161
and women,

131
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,600
there's 10 weight classes.

132
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,600
America holds nine of the
10 and my Jim holds five.

133
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,690
I have the strongest male
power lifter have ever lived,

134
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,590
period.

135
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,210
And the best and the strongest female.

136
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,030
It'll vary.

137
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,863
Same Gym.

138
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,970
Now what about shit late?

139
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,710
Those strongest men contests?

140
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,130
Oh,

141
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,450
well there's strong as guys,

142
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,330
but that's a different
thing entirely as well.

143
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
It's another defense.

144
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,660
Like boxing is different than him in May.

145
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,630
Yeah.

146
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,910
More,

147
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,170
you know,

148
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,800
more ties different in boxing.

149
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,430
He never said,

150
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,510
I'm going to say a Moitai guy that's
going to win a world boxing championships

151
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,733
and vice versa.

152
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,601
Well,

153
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:58,770
I think it has happened.

154
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,400
Um,

155
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,140
ty was,

156
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,270
what the fuck is his name?

157
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:03,451
Oh,

158
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,320
there was a kid though.

159
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,621
I mean,

160
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,450
I could pick gold metal and Thailand.

161
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,430
Pakia I think you shouldn't have your key.

162
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,050
Might've been a,

163
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,740
um,

164
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,110
um,

165
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,820
um,

166
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,170
white tie champions that right?

167
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,411
Oh,

168
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,244
Chris Algae area.

169
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,710
Yeah,

170
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,060
yeah,

171
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,241
yeah,

172
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:15,660
yeah,

173
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:15,871
yeah.

174
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:16,581
He was a,

175
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:17,690
a kickboxing champion.

176
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,580
One time to put work has a name.

177
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,780
So what's the fuck is his name?

178
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,293
Samsung,

179
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,031
I forget his name,

180
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:24,864
but there was the guy that,

181
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,900
he's the guy that John Claude van
Damme was always supposed to fight.

182
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,110
John Claude van Damme pretends
is going to have a fight.

183
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,650
It's going to have a
kickboxing fight with,

184
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:32,940
this is Thai guy.

185
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,350
But that guy won a world title as
a Meu tie fighter and as a boxer.

186
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:37,631
But that's,

187
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,520
that's pretty rare,

188
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,660
but I agree with you.

189
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,940
But now like what would be the difference?

190
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:42,181
See,

191
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,090
like if you see like if you got a
guy coming to you that wanted to win,

192
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,770
like a strongest man competition,

193
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,070
that seems like something that would be
right up your alley because you're so

194
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,550
good at preparing fighters
and understanding the
different demands of different

195
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:54,384
sports.

196
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,330
My friend and Finland's names car,

197
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,200
he's got four guys and that Jim had debt
of over 900 and they're all strong man

198
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,910
and he does well.

199
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,080
He trains a lot of Straw man.

200
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,681
All right.

201
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:04,610
I'm not in to that,

202
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,640
but told Tom and I that the one thing
in each sprint would thousand pound

203
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,493
wheelbarrows,

204
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,190
thousand pounds on the rhubarb.

205
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,170
We do a lot of wheelbarrow work and
all of a sudden he carry heavy yoke.

206
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,450
So that's two of the primary things.

207
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,630
You get them to be strong in.

208
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,913
What's a yoke?

209
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,671
A Yoga thing,

210
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:22,420
putting me back and you walk around
with it like if you walked around,

211
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,500
we do a normal amount of walking loop.

212
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,760
What bars with a badge and change
hanging off such an unstable cause.

213
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,870
That's what you have to be.

214
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,570
You'll,

215
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,510
you've got to be stable
and unstable environment.

216
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,700
So they walk a half a mile stuff like,

217
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:34,950
I don't know,

218
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,050
basketball or he gets his strong.

219
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,400
Is that why you like wheelbarrows?

220
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,820
Cause it's almost like a dead lift that
you've got to kind of walk with going in

221
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,500
price or we'll get more typewriter.

222
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,360
Don't thought that really helped
us up as plum color to clinch.

223
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:48,080
Yeah,

224
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,913
that makes sense.

225
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,251
Um,

226
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:54,251
so did you come up with the idea of
using wheel barrels for Gwar Berlin ninth

227
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,100
1990 and it's something that looked to you

228
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,020
like a good unstable platform for that
and it builds up your registry manager,

229
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,750
you're building up your back and,

230
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,270
and grew up you he got to have a grip.

231
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,661
Right.

232
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,494
So and you know,

233
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,870
most [inaudible] guys
got great grips anyhow,

234
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,500
but it builds up grip and it builds
up all your muscles and your walking.

235
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,610
See My,

236
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,881
you know,

237
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,740
a lot of guys do strength
and conditioning.

238
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,480
I believe it's got to be combined.

239
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,890
You don't have that much time
because fighting is a treatment,

240
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:21,340
a skill.

241
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,590
You need all your,

242
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,680
I mean the world's strongest man.

243
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,321
And he the dam,

244
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,390
the MMA champion,

245
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:26,780
Huh?

246
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:26,961
Right.

247
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,470
So I believe you got to
straight then Kadesia st time.

248
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,400
That's why we do so much outside walking.

249
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,631
We're doing heavy.

250
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:32,841
I,

251
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,090
I carry not objects walking.

252
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,830
She'll work conditioning
and strength training.
