1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,740
President United States 20,
24.

2
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:11,960
Dave Smith is with me.
Is that a real date?

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,630
What is that?
A date was 2024.

4
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:15,530
That wouldn't be it,
right?

5
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:16,364
16,
20 slash 20 slash eight when I'll be 

6
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:19,551
ready.
Dude.

7
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:20,384
You could pull it off when entered a 
real libertarian candidate that could 

8
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,120
fucking hang in there.
Someone who's going to break the mold.

9
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,370
Dave Smith and a stand up comedian as 
well.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,503
I didn't want this task,
but now that Joe Rogan's called you 

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,163
could do it.
You're immune to all the trappings that 

12
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,400
hit all those people.
Of course there's dirt on you.

13
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,390
You're a part of skank fest.
You know it's going to be.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
There's a lot of grabbing by the 
postseason.

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,130
You're on a podcast called the legion of
skanks.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,223
It's could be introduced in a 
presidential debate and then I have to 

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,210
go.
Yes,

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,290
that was my shower.
Yes,

19
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,780
but you would do it just like that and 
everybody would start laughing.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,660
We're realizing that this just do it 
like a politician or I'd be like,

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,553
I repudiated that show years ago.
I no longer associate with big joker 

22
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,520
seven dude speaking in which they put 
wiener in the pokey today.

23
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,890
Twenty one months in jail for sexting.
I believe it was a 15 year old.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,360
Well look,
I.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,833
That guy,
single handedly probably changed 

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,610
America.
Yeah.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,410
Yeah.
I don't think she really did,

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,470
but he changed it through Dick Pics.
Which.

29
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:26,570
How else were you going to change 
America in 2017?

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,320
The road edge,
Anthony Windier.

31
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,990
It gets hard time.
Is that the post?

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,150
The Post is hilarious.
Whoever writes for the post,

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,360
Goddamn they have some fucking great 
headlines.

34
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,150
Anthony Wiener gets hard time.
Oh,

35
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,850
you know what's horrible is before all 
this happened,

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,150
he was fantastic.
That guy could have been the president.

37
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,760
He was.
He had that politiciany thing.

38
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,590
I mean he was he and he was like for a 
young politician on the fast track.

39
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,460
Yeah.
But he,

40
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,310
I mean,
I really do think Hilary Clinton.

41
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,503
I mean,
I just think it was such a close race 

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,990
that any little thing probably could 
have made the difference.

43
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,820
So you could blame any number of 
factors,

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,953
but I mean the FBI coming out and 
reopening and investigation on you like 

45
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,123
less than two weeks before an election.
That's pretty tough to get over 

46
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,780
politically.
Like in any normal year,

47
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,630
any candidate would be buried by the.
After all that,

48
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,670
lock her up,
lock her up.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,640
There's no way you can survive that.
The FBI is looking into it.

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,670
All the people that don't want to look 
into it any further than the surface,

51
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,170
they immediately go,
oh,

52
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,700
we fucking got heads over.
And I,

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,753
you know,
like I think there's also just in terms 

54
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:33,050
of the politics and the way people work,
there was something about Anthony Wiener

55
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:33,884
were so it just,
it made the American public think about 

56
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,610
him again.

57
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,443
And trump was bringing the women who are
accusing Bill Clinton of rape to the 

58
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,000
debates.
And I think the average person just kind

59
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:43,850
of went like,
wait a minute.

60
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:46,330
So.
So your husband is a sexual Predator art

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,750
and your best friend,
her husband is also a sexual predator.

62
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,930
Like who the fuck are these people?
Who the fuck are you that the story for.

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,860
Yeah,
well that's one of the that got me about

64
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,694
Fox News because Fox News has always 
been the voice of conservative America 

65
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,510
on television,
right.

66
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,344
These staunch verse,
the staunch Voice of conservative 

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,573
America,
but yet all this sex stuff comes out 

68
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,383
like the bill o'reilly tapes where he 
was calling up as whoever the girl was 

69
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,940
and saying crazy shit with a loofa 
sponge.

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,410
Remember all that?
The,

71
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,850
I read about it.
It was crazy,

72
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,640
but they had recordings of it and then 
it was,

73
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,481
you know,
the,

74
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,314
all the women that accused him of sexual
harassment and sexual harassment with 

75
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,050
other people and other people are 
sending Dick pics and like,

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,820
wow,
you guys are freaks.

77
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,700
And you know,
it was really crazy about it was that so

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,100
Roger Ailes,
who is the head of the network,

79
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,443
she went down first for sexual 
harassment and then as soon as he was 

80
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,184
down like a whole bunch of other people 
started going back and then you really 

81
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,840
start wondering like,
Oh shit.

82
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,540
Like was it just like a new guy isn't 
letting us sexually harass anymore?

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,480
What's going on with this?
Well,

84
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,490
I think it was just there was a culture 
that they could get away with before the

85
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:04,324
Internet where they were the bosses and 
the women were the underlings and they 

86
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:07,804
all felt.
I'm sure there's probably a lot of 

87
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,890
dynamics plan there,
right?

88
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,930
There's a power situation.
The man,

89
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,063
the guy who's the boss is in position 
and then there's also women that are 

90
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,084
attracted to power figures and then 
there's also this conservative like 

91
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,870
really repressed environment,
which always leads to freak shit.

92
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,490
It always does.
Yeah.

93
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,700
We have like people buttoned down.
They always lead to frequently.

94
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,450
They have to find a way out that 
pressure.

95
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:35,290
It's got to go.
You're right.

96
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,970
I mean,
I always say to people,

97
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,740
if you're in a.
If you're in New York City,

98
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,010
if you go to a bar in the financial 
district,

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,230
like right after work,
it's a really crazy scene.

100
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,710
Something interesting like the exact 
dynamic you're talking about.

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,010
Whereas these people who are all day 
working in this crazy like this and then

102
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:51,844
like the ties are loosen.
Then it's this like drinking and they 

103
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,900
take their shoes off at the bar and I'm 
like,

104
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,734
whoa.
People are getting slapped on the ass 

105
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,470
like crazy shit is going on that you 
wouldn't think your banker,

106
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,383
you know the guy,
the guy who runs your retirement 

107
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,210
account.
You know why?

108
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,044
Because like we were talking about 
before with like before the podcast 

109
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,440
started with like these ancient reward 
systems,

110
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,780
there's an ancient reward system for 
plundering.

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,453
I really believed that.
I think these guys feel like their 

112
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,850
goddamn pirates,
like they're plundering,

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,310
makes sense.
They're part of the financial market and

114
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,144
then they're doing shots.
We're going to fucking check and take 

115
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,660
them down.
They grab each other,

116
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,520
we're going to fucking take them down.
We're going to take them down.

117
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,443
And if you think about,
I mean if you think about the 

118
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,514
acquisition of property of goods or 
anything like that throughout human 

119
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,290
history,
I mean the idea of like a,

120
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,124
just a theory of just acquisition of 
property is like relatively new and the 

121
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,900
way everything was acquired for all of 
human history was through conquest.

122
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,530
Just,
you know,

123
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,030
you take it,
you take other people's Shit and you got

124
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:47,864
to think that like a hostile takeover 
must feel incredibly like sacking the 

125
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:52,050
city.
Again,

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,110
these guys,
oh,

127
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:56,110
that's from Wall Street from uh,
what's his name wasn't Wall Street.

128
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,360
What the fuck was it called?
A wolf of Wall Street.

129
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

130
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,760
That was a great scene.
But people resonate.

131
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,600
That scene resonated with people.
I'm not fucking going.

132
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm not fucking going.
And everybody said it's like being above

133
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:15,041
the system kind of tapping in just same 
way football taps in.

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,593
It's tapping into this ancient reward 
system for plundering when men get 

135
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:21,554
together and they fuck up other men and 
take all their shit and then we kick 

136
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,240
ass.
It's unbelievable how much.

137
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,150
I thought about this a lot this last 
year through the election,

138
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,123
but like it's unbelievable how much like
that football team dynamic is just the 

139
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,574
whole thing.
Like it's like human beings love to get 

140
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:37,934
into a stadium to be like red team,
blue team identified with one team and 

141
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,154
lose their freaking minds.
Like literally lose their minds and 

142
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,150
that's when they know it's meaningless.

143
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,290
It's just about a ball crossing a line.
And this has absolutely no.

144
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,370
We'll still bring God into it with brand
team into all these.

145
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,473
And again,
you see like with this trump thing now 

146
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,284
that he just stepped on,
me and Jamie were joking around before 

147
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,950
we started like a,
or it's like he,

148
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,030
he liked threatening nuclear war and 
insulted Steph curry in,

149
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,150
in one thought I'd ever.
Everyone in America is like,

150
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,180
excuse me,
what was that second?

151
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,270
Excuse me?
What did you say?

152
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,323
And both sides,
like this is just what gets them 

153
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,550
interested.
Well,

154
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,640
we are a gossip country now,
like 100 percent officially,

155
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,520
like what we'd like is a squabble 
between the leader of the free world who

156
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,880
is a reality star and some of the best 
basketball players that have ever lived.

157
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,170
Like,
Oh shit,

158
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,213
it's on football players.
I mean Le Bron James is making videos 

159
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,620
about the president being a douchebag.

160
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,843
He's making videos about all these 
different people like expressing their 

161
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:44,330
right to free speech.
I saw one of the tweets that he,

162
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,490
uh,
he tweeted out at the president where it

163
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,324
was like,
just kind of like a broken English 

164
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,300
tweet.
Like he used the word ain't a lot in it,

165
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
just like.
And it's just him verse trump.

166
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,620
And I just had a moment where I was 
like,

167
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,170
so this is where the national 
conversation is at now,

168
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,991
like,
do you remember,

169
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:01,010
I just remember watching like a William 
f Buckley vs Gore v down to Bates.

170
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:01,844
And you're like,
how fucking retarded has our country 

171
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,420
gotten?
Have you seen the documentary?

172
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,070
Yeah,
it's amazing.

173
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:07,904
Really interesting.
If you haven't seen it focuses on 

174
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,070
Netflix.
What is it called?

175
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,550
Something I don't remember.
Bitter rivals.

176
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,080
Yeah.
No,

177
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,430
that's something that's called bitter 
rivals.

178
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:20,440
That might've been a UFC event back in 
the early two.

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,410
Thousands.
Sylvia,

180
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,100
best of enemies.
Enemies.

181
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,370
Thank you.
Stupid pattern.

182
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,370
I don't know.
50 four obliteration.

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,233
Yeah,
I was saying they're gonna run out of 

184
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,840
adjectives and they realized eventually 
we are.

185
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,840
This is so stupid.
But you don't ever say.

186
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,200
It's never like a verse.
Sixers slam fest.

187
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,730
Total slam fest.
Yeah.

188
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,390
Like you'd never have a name.
It's just the world series.

189
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,220
It's just the fucking super bowl.
It's never.

190
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,900
It was never a,
you know,

191
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,990
domination event.
Oh,

192
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,410
they figured it out somewhere along 
line.

193
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,160
But

194
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,030
what we're talking about.
Oh yeah,

195
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:57,864
how crazy it is to see that this is all 
going on while Puerto Rico has no power 

196
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,700
and only five percent of it has cell 
phone service.

197
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,230
Holy Shit.
You want to talk about.

198
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,393
There's some.
There's a weird racist thing that we 

199
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,280
will like if that was an island filled 
with white people,

200
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,293
do you really truly think it was an 
island filled with white people that 

201
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:21,510
spoke perfect English and it sounded 
just like us.

202
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Do you think we have so little coverage 
of Puerto Rico the way we do now?

203
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,240
Oh,
Puerto Rico is technically a part of the

204
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,620
United States.
It's not a state,

205
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,280
but it's technically like we had on 
Peter Schiff.

206
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,143
Yes.
We just had a mother who was was 

207
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:38,300
fantastic.
Amazon.

208
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,020
He just moved his whole team down there.
Boy,

209
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,130
Betty's regretting that now for a guy 
who's known for predicting the future,

210
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,613
he really,
really missed that one was like that 

211
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:53,241
moment and that that animated Gif with 
that black kid has got glasses and a and

212
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:57,380
everyone around us doesn't.

213
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,623
He just did Peter Schiff.
For guys knowing to predict the future 

214
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,023
where he did fucking do,
you don't see the destruction of your 

215
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,134
empire by God himself.
Turns out you can only predict the 

216
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,510
subprime mortgage crisis,
not acts of God.

217
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,520
Fuck Dude.
And there's another one along the way.

218
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,200
Look at this one,
this one over and over again.

219
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:20,070
This is great.
That kids faces fucking classic.

220
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,530
Like if he shut you down and gave you 
that face,

221
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:23,520
you'd be like,
fuck.

222
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,520
He got me.
There was no counter argument after this

223
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,770
has happened to you,
but you just accept that you lost.

224
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,693
Yeah,
I mean you might be able to like gain 

225
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:33,500
some ground afterwards with a couple of 
good insults,

226
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,530
but fucking contest is over.
If that's like a halfway through a roast

227
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,400
battle,
just call it for the judges to know when

228
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,234
to walk away to with a loss because it's
way worse if you stay there and keep 

229
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,074
swinging.

230
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,020
Just keep getting fucked up.
When that guy gives you that face,

231
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,280
you gotta go,
you gotta go get.

232
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,040
I'll come back and fight another blocks.
Pilots about.

233
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,180
Definitely can't believe it.
I mean,

234
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:05,940
that might be like one of the V perfect 
events in human history.

235
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,610
Forget about like,
uh,

236
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,930
you know,
planting the flag and Iud Jima,

237
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,003
this dude,
this dude making that face that will be 

238
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,070
used,
who knows how many,

239
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,590
countless hundreds of thousands of 
times.

240
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,410
How many times did that thing been used?
It maybe millions,

241
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,240
right?
If,

242
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,240
if a youtube video get millions of hits,
that's probably in the millions.

243
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,330
Millions of times used for sure.
Right.

244
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,573
But yeah,
so it's a weird fucking time with all 

245
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,010
this because we're concentrating so much
on weird stuff.

246
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,940
Like whether or not you should stand for
the flag or Neil and first of all,

247
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,840
I think what they're doing,
if correct me if I'm wrong,

248
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,230
they're protesting cops shooting 
innocent people.

249
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,153
That's what it's about.
So it's kind of ineffective on their 

250
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:52,290
part,
the message,

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,610
because you have to listen to them 
afterwards.

252
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,230
Right?
It seems like you don't like America,

253
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,093
right?
That's what people have a problem with 

254
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,324
and trump's plan on that,
that they get down on one knee and you 

255
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:01,601
know,
I mean,

256
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,410
it's kind of weird because it's kind of 
respectful as all.

257
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:05,244
Also getting down on one knee for the 
flag is actually more respectful than 

258
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:10,990
putting your hand over your heart,
which is really weird.

259
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,340
Right,
so they.

260
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,580
They're supposed to be protesting cops 
who have shot innocent unarmed people,

261
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,544
which have been a fuck load of them,
but that's a weird way to do it because 

262
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,210
you're doing it during the anthem.
The anthem isn't those cops.

263
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,140
The anthem is all of us,
so it's.

264
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,093
It's a shitty way to divide because it's
not really making a whole lot of sense 

265
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:31,894
because the people who wrote the star 
spangled banner who were singing it 

266
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,284
right now,
the people who have sung it all 

267
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,164
throughout the years and stood there,
they aren't the ones that shot those 

268
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,260
unarmed people.

269
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,070
What you have is a cop who was a 
probably a nervous wreck,

270
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,400
most likely has been operating with ptsd
for the past five,

271
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,040
six fucking years.
You have friends that are cops.

272
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,353
A few.
Yeah.

273
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,960
They tell you crazy shit,
right?

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,930
Yeah.
You know,

275
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,310
I know a bunch of cops,
especially from Jujitsu.

276
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:00,160
I know a ton of cops and and from the 
UFC as well.

277
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,850
They tell you some fucking horror 
stores,

278
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,120
things that they have to deal with,
like they stumble upon a crime scene.

279
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,460
Guys got half his fucking head missing 
people chopped up,

280
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
you know,
all sorts of dark,

281
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,690
dark,
dark shit and it's in their head all the

282
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,760
time.
They've had buddies get shot in the face

283
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,080
at,
you know,

284
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,650
routine traffic stops.
Everybody's freaked out because over the

285
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,360
course of 20 years,
you're a police officer.

286
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,120
You have seen a fucking amazing amount 
of shit,

287
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,640
probably unfit for the job.

288
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,690
These guys that are shooting people and 
we think about the vast number of people

289
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,310
that are cops that aren't doing this,
the Internet,

290
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,163
all the interactions were concentrating 
on these terrible things that obviously 

291
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,370
there's no defense for it,
right?

292
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:39,911
There's no,
no,

293
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:40,271
no,
no.

294
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,420
Defending someone shooting a 13 year old
boy with a plastic gun.

295
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,433
There's no.
There's no defending any of the crazy 

296
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,014
stuff that we saw.
The Guy who shot the guy and he had 

297
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,050
planted the Taser.
There's no defending any of this.

298
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:50,884
Right,
but how many interactions are cops 

299
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,240
having with people where this doesn't 
happen?

300
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,180
A fuckload man,
like let's keep some perspective because

301
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,014
the other end and if you live in a 
country with 320 million people and you 

302
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,570
see one incident or a few incidents 
there,

303
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:05,520
there's no perspective there so you can 
find it.

304
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:06,354
Any,
any example to paint whatever narrative 

305
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:08,530
you want to.

306
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,670
If you're just going off random 
examples.

307
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,100
God,
I really like it.

308
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,620
It's really frustrating for me because 
the whole.

309
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,280
It's like the whole trump thing and the 
whole moment we're in now,

310
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,160
it's all about a culture war.
Like that's what it's really about.

311
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,920
It's not about politics or policy or 
anything.

312
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:24,754
It's really a culture war and what you 
have here and this is why everyone gets 

313
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:27,784
so into the kneeling for the national 
anthem thing because it's symbolic of 

314
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,200
two cultures and to me it's like I,
I,

315
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,800
I see the worst in both,
which is really frustrating.

316
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:40,801
So it's like the left wing thing is just
this bash America with no perspective,

317
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,500
like no fucking perspective at all.
So it's like,

318
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,760
yeah,
I'm right.

319
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:46,594
So there'll be protesting,
say like cops being shot or something 

320
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:49,324
like that,
which you can say certainly there are 

321
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,040
legitimate cases of that and I'm a 
person who

322
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,390
believes we have like a real real police
problem in America and,

323
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:59,840
and we have like just insane amounts of 
arrests for nonviolent crimes,

324
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,060
really fucked up,
Shangri mass incarceration,

325
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,750
all these fucked up things.
Um,

326
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,203
uh,
that being said like there's also 

327
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,250
justifiable shootings,
shoot cops do,

328
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,363
you know?
Um,

329
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,250
but so,
so you have these people taking a neat.

330
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,084
But it's kind of like symbolic to people
who aren't on the left of this culture 

331
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:18,320
of like everything over the law on the 
left is just like anti America,

332
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,570
anti capitalist,
Anti White Man,

333
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:24,830
anti man in general and anti Western 
civilization with no perspective,

334
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,920
like no perspective of like,
you know,

335
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,880
just like Americans is white supremacist
country.

336
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,511
It's like,
well,

337
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,340
what does that mean?
Like compared to what,

338
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
you know what I'm saying?
And I'm not saying it doesn't exist,

339
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:35,780
it's like,
but it's like when they say like we live

340
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,760
in a rape culture,
it's like what does that mean?

341
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,440
If I'm like,
we live in a robbery culture,

342
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,690
there are robberies,
but compared to what?

343
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,820
So if you're going to say we're a white 
supremacy culture,

344
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,683
to me it's kind of like saying,
it's like saying America is a poor 

345
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:48,750
country.
I mean,

346
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:49,584
I,
I suppose compared to some richer 

347
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:51,204
country in the future that's figured 
some shit out that we haven't compared 

348
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,760
to everything else that's ever existed.
We're a rich country.

349
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,320
So if you're talking about white 
supremacy,

350
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,310
it's like,
well no,

351
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,840
by and large were probably the best like
melting pot and most diverse,

352
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,310
most inclusive,
most,

353
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,860
uh,
like we feel more guilty for the sins of

354
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,910
our past than pretty much any other 
country commercial.

355
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,730
And I don't know any country that like,
you know,

356
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:14,540
it's like America was founded by 
conquest of the native Americans.

357
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:14,931
It's like,
right.

358
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,720
And so as every single other country,
and so,

359
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,220
and every country had slavery in every 
country had all these things.

360
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,290
It's not no one,
150 years ago,

361
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,760
it wasn't fucked up.
That doesn't exist.

362
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,250
Right?
And so if you have some perspective,

363
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,710
the left wing thing gets pretty 
frustrating after awhile.

364
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,750
However,
then on the,

365
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,900
on the trump side,
so I've kind of been more sympathetic to

366
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:33,734
the right than the left probably over 
the last year and a half because I 

367
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:36,164
really do see like the issue of our time
becoming this like are you for free 

368
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,244
speech are against free speech that that
to me is like really because we don't 

369
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,230
really figure things out unless we get 
to debate them.

370
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,820
We can't have been topics and we can 
have topics that are supercharged to the

371
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:52,850
point where they're.
You can't have a position on them.

372
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,230
Yeah.
And you can't explore them.

373
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,330
There is a real powerful.
Yes.

374
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:56,790
Yes.
That's it.

375
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,770
That's exactly right.
I mean it's,

376
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:59,540
it's one reason I think there's many 
reasons,

377
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,010
but that's one of the most important.

378
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,250
Like why we need free speech because 
unless you fucking.

379
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,890
Unless you come from the position of I 
have everything 100 percent correct.

380
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,353
Like then maybe you need to have a 
conversation and someone has a 

381
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:10,784
conversation back with you because odds 
are you don't have everything 100 

382
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,590
percent correct.
It's their correct versus your correct.

383
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,660
Like they're correct.
Is Gender Quality?

384
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,640
They're correct.
Is transgender rights?

385
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:22,400
They're correct.
Is Socialism there?

386
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,160
Correct.
Is like,

387
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,993
and if you.
Obviously I'm talking about people far 

388
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,470
left,
not talking about you.

389
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,304
If you're listening just I'm talking 
about the hypothetical extreme far left 

390
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:36,300
person that is protesting Ben Shapiro on
Berkeley campus calling him a Nazi,

391
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,730
but this isn't.
This isn't just,

392
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,260
you know,
a right,

393
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,094
it's not you're making,
you're talking about a hypothetical 

394
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:41,804
person,
but obviously this is happening in 

395
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,394
reality.
They exist lots of them and there's 

396
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,150
enough to the point where like it's like
this real thing where,

397
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:47,984
okay,
so the great threat to free speech and 

398
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,140
our time isn't coming from the state,
which by the way,

399
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:55,080
like as a libertarian that would be more
comfortable to my narrative.

400
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,913
Like that's what I've been thinking for 
years is the great threat to free 

401
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,010
speech.
But no,

402
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,010
it's coming from this left wing culture 
that says a right.

403
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:07,011
Like Ben Shapiro can't speak Milo 
Yiannopoulos can't speak Condoleeza Rice

404
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,540
can't speak about it.
Look,

405
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,403
if,
if Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson need 

406
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,380
to be silenced,
I mean that.

407
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,710
My only problem with those two is that 
there to moderate.

408
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,350
Like these are like,
these are not bigots,

409
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,393
these are not these,
these are intellectuals making an 

410
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,390
intellectual argument and they can't 
even speak.

411
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,010
So it's,
it's very scary.

412
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:26,844
And then the other thing I would just 
say on this left wing culture and is 

413
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,860
what cabarnet kind of embodies to meet 
is just the,

414
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,830
it's this frustrating ignorance like 
this client.

415
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,733
So you'll be protesting police brutality
and mass incarceration and then like 

416
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,140
you'll put a Castro image on your 
jacket.

417
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,761
Like,
I mean,

418
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,810
come on man.

419
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,970
Come on dude.
You can't,

420
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,590
you can't stand up for something and 
swing and miss that big like that.

421
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,370
So like you got to research a little 
bit,

422
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,830
I mean do five minutes.
All the information is on your phone.

423
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,843
Like I just don't.
So there's that and I get being against 

424
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:03,714
that and I want to be like on the free 
speech side and I see a lot of these 

425
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:06,924
guys like who will bring up like Steven 
crowder and Ben Shapiro guys you've had 

426
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,430
on your show who I really admire a lot 
because they're fighting against that.

427
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,870
And Jordan Peterson fighting against 
that anti authoritarian authoritarian pc

428
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,853
antifreeze speech stuff.
So I kind of more sympathetic to the 

429
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,600
right,
but then there's this thing with the nfl

430
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,130
where,
and it really just reminds me of all the

431
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,900
cultural aspects of the right that I 
hate,

432
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,790
which is when,
first of all,

433
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,773
I'm sorry,
someone who's standing for freedom of 

434
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,100
speech.

435
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,820
I'm pretty fucking troubled by the 
president of the United States,

436
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,743
the man who's in control of the most 
powerful army in the military and the 

437
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:38,340
history of human humanity coming out and
saying,

438
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,070
I think if someone takes a need,
they should be fired.

439
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,180
Now that may not be writing a law 
against a speech,

440
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,510
but that's pretty fucking chilling to 
have like the government telling you,

441
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,141
hey,
you know,

442
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:49,974
what would please me is if you started 
firing people when they spoke out 

443
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,480
against me,
I don't like that.

444
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
And this fucking right wing,
like praise the flag.

445
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,600
And if you say anything against it,
you're,

446
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,230
you're in a.
it's like religious,

447
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,064
like it's blast for me.
It is a criticize the troops or 

448
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,270
criticized the country.
Like fuck that.

449
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,310
Yeah,
it is a power issue.

450
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,250
When I was going to say earlier is that 
when you were talking about the state,

451
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,820
when you were talking about the fear of 
the state and the censorship coming from

452
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,510
the state,
it's the same thing because the state is

453
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,380
just power and the far left is power too
and it's power with shame and with blogs

454
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,214
and with protests and it is the power 
that they're trying to exercise to get 

455
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,880
you to behave the way they want you to 
and the right does the same thing.

456
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,850
I think what we should have if we're 
gonna,

457
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,740
if we're gonna really keep doing this 
whole,

458
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,633
we're a country thing.
We should have like an armistice when 

459
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,883
then this is I think reasonable people.
Reasonable people have an issue with 

460
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,470
this idea of desecrating the flag 
because the flag is just a flag and it's

461
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:48,250
not important,

462
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,670
but what is important is that we treat 
each other like we're a team and we look

463
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:54,760
out for each other and we're all 
together and we're all united together.

464
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,250
We shouldn't be fun.
If we have an issue,

465
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,730
our issue should be with communist 
dictatorships across the world that have

466
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,270
nuclear weapons that are holding their 
people captive,

467
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,170
like if it was ever a time to look at a 
country and go,

468
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,004
wow,
this is a country that is in an unjust 

469
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:11,794
position and it's a really terrifying 
dilemma that you have this murderous 

470
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,383
dictator who's in control of nuclear 
weapons and he has an entire country of 

471
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,344
people enslaved,
which is essentially what's going on in 

472
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,501
North Korea.
Right.

473
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,730
It's basically like a giant hostage 
situation that's,

474
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,583
that's a real giant issue to us.
It's not whether or not transgender 

475
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:32,830
people can use the fucking males,
the men's room or the women's room.

476
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,350
That's not our issue.
That's,

477
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:35,184
that's,
that's a cultural conversation and that 

478
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,014
cultural conversation should become.
And we should be friendly to each other 

479
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,620
because we're supposed to be on the same
team though.

480
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,473
I agree with you,
but that stuff with the like the 

481
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,670
transgender bathrooms,
I got to say man,

482
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,910
and it's really weird for me sometimes I
just can't.

483
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,773
I can't even believe I hold some of the 
positions I do because I grew up like a 

484
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,850
kind of left wing kid and uh,
you know,

485
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,930
I was raised by a single mom in New 
York.

486
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:56,764
I kind of like,
that's kind of where I belong 

487
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,440
culturally,
but I really can't,

488
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:03,190
you know,
it's almost like the Kooky conservatives

489
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,900
who,
the religious coogee conservatives who I

490
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,630
just dismissed for years is like,
this is just insane.

491
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,823
Had more of like they had a grain of 
truth that I didn't realize they'd be 

492
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:12,961
like,
uh,

493
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:13,794
you know,
you can't legalize gay marriage or 

494
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,570
they'll start coming after the kids and 
you're like,

495
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:18,100
well,
that's just insane.

496
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,380
Anybody like gay marriage gets legalized
it.

497
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,223
Like the next year they're like,
kids should be able to take hormones to 

498
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:24,161
suppress the.
And you're like,

499
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,740
Whoa,
this is kind of weird.

500
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,813
It's very weird to me that the left 
didn't take like a minute to celebrate 

501
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,094
this victory on gay marriage that they 
had been fighting for like my entire 

502
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,900
life.
They got a huge victory.

503
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,833
The Supreme Court came in and forced it 
on the remaining 20 states or so who 

504
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,000
weren't ready.
We weren't going to vote for it.

505
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,550
They forced it on them and there wasn't 
a big backlash like that.

506
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,290
One chick went to jail for like three 
days.

507
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,470
It's not like the one in Oklahoma with 
gay folks,

508
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,150
Wendy Davis Owens,
and then she and then it's not like,

509
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,013
oh,
there was like this wave of Republicans 

510
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:59,130
who rose up like,
we're going to repeal it.

511
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,450
We're going to write a law to reverse 
that supreme court decision.

512
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:01,931
It's like,
no,

513
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,570
actually they elected the first pro gay 
marriage president.

514
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,900
It's like you won on this issue and 
immediately as soon as they won,

515
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,610
they're like,
now transgender bathrooms.

516
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,290
Now this now.
Well,

517
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,850
I think,
I don't think they're related.

518
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,040
And this is why I think,
um,

519
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,933
first of all,
the gay marriage thing is consenting 

520
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,784
adults.
They should be able to do whatever they 

521
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:20,224
want to do.
The difference between gay people and 

522
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:25,300
transgender people is pretty radical.
No great.

523
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:30,130
If almost the same difference as between
straight people and gay people there.

524
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,050
But they're in the same four letters 
according to the left,

525
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,210
but that whole Lbgtq a plus,
whatever the fuck it is now,

526
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,460
there's a bunch of new ones that they've
added on asexual.

527
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,413
No,
I agree with you.

528
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,240
I think it's actually insulting that 
they lumped them together as if it's the

529
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:44,021
same thing.
I mean,

530
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:46,100
I think it's a weird that when trump 
tweeted the thing

531
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,590
about trans people not being able to 
serve in the military,

532
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,573
I saw a bunch of people being like,
trump has come out against lgbt rights 

533
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,193
and you're like,
what the hell does this have to do with 

534
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,270
lg?
Or be like,

535
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,380
what?
Why is that crazy?

536
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,310
They're just a gang.
Lump it all together.

537
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:01,930
A big progressive gang of acronyms,
but the,

538
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,853
the.
They're always going to say about all 

539
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:08,960
this stuff being lumped in together is 
that the left has been the side that has

540
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,660
looked towards the hard science when it 
comes to global warming.

541
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,494
Right?
The hard science when it comes to 

542
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:13,754
climate data,
those are the ones that are always 

543
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,970
pushing whether they're right or wrong 
or getting the right data.

544
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:17,804
They're the ones that are really harping
on the science and if you looked in 

545
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:26,270
terms of the amount of people that are 
working in universities,

546
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,270
there are far more left than there are 
far more left.

547
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,160
Professors now are right,
so you would think,

548
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:31,994
okay,
you have this base of academia and 

549
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,184
knowledge on the left,
but yet the left is the side that's 

550
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:38,714
willing to entertain the idea that a 
young kid should take hormones to alter 

551
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,813
their sex.
When you know for a fucking fact that 

552
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,610
when you're a young person,
you're extremely confused,

553
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,980
constantly back and forth,
left and right.

554
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,130
There are hormonal changes.
The cerebral cortex,

555
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:58,160
the frontal cortex isn't even really 
fully develop.

556
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,970
They don't say you're a real fully 
developed until you're like 25 if you're

557
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:02,804
a man,
which explains a lot of the shit that I 

558
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:05,810
did.
Right.

559
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,270
It's a lot of people listening that are 
20 and retarded that like,

560
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:11,240
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
Exactly.

561
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:12,770
Dude.
You're barely an adult.

562
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,663
Oh,
you're thinking about things you do at 

563
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:14,684
like 22 and you're like,
I can't believe I'm the same human 

564
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,600
human,
but so this same party,

565
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:21,434
the same progressive mindset that is so 
incredibly open minded but yet also so 

566
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,474
deeply embedded in academia like far 
more than the right is this is the side 

567
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,933
that is willing to put aside all that 
they know about biology and psychology 

568
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:38,990
and physiology and children.

569
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,930
Put aside that a lot of people are not 
all in one lump.

570
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:42,764
Anybody together put aside that for 
Progressive Brownie points for saying 

571
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:47,744
that you are so incredibly open.
Like this child obviously knows that he 

572
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:51,704
is a.
She or she is a he and we need to start 

573
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,850
addressing them as that and this is just
a fact.

574
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,170
Well,
it's not just a fact.

575
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,490
It's a conversation that we should have 
and I think it varies in individuals and

576
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,324
I think there are some people that I 
have personally talked to the 

577
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:04,664
transgender people that for sure are 
happier being a woman or a man and they 

578
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,460
were born in what they feel is the wrong
body.

579
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:14,120
And I absolutely 100 percent salute 
their right to go out and do that,

580
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,553
but we should have a real conversation 
as to how many people is that really 

581
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:19,904
happening to me?
How many of these people have a 

582
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:25,130
psychological issue?
How many people.

583
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,440
Is there a physical trait that we're 
missing?

584
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,680
Is there a,
some,

585
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,130
some switch that gets flipped when 
they're young?

586
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,093
I mean it's a fascinating aspect of 
human beings that you are one sex and 

587
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:36,230
wish you were another.
Right.

588
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:40,640
And it seems strange to me that on the 
left the rules always seem to be.

589
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,740
There's this topic like it's like the 
left forever.

590
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,100
It's

591
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,340
always like we need to have a national 
conversation about race.

592
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,860
But if you say the wrong thing,
I want you ruined.

593
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,700
Yeah.
You know.

594
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,320
And it's the same thing with like the 
transgender thing.

595
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,690
It's like they want to like,
it's like we want to have a conversation

596
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,670
about this.
They put this forward as like this is an

597
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:58,230
issue we need to talk about.
And then also,

598
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:00,000
by the way,
you're not allowed to say anything.

599
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,923
So if you bring up the 40 percent 
suicide rate and say maybe this isn't 

600
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,954
due to societal oppression because 
there's no real link between societal 

601
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:09,760
oppression and high suicide rates,
now you need to be fired or something,

602
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,613
you know,
say 40 percent of transgender people 

603
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,950
commit suicide and the people that want 
to support the idea that there's not any

604
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,040
sort of a mental illness in any people 
on shore.

605
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,120
It's not in some.
We're not generalizing,

606
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,790
but it must be in some.
Right.

607
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,083
The people that want to deny that side 
of the reason why they are suicidal is 

608
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:31,350
because they don't get a chance to 
express their genuine,

609
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,630
authentic self,
which is a very good point.

610
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,710
So it's not.
It's not that either or.

611
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,080
No,
I'm.

612
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,913
I'm open to the argument,
the argument that the 40 percent is 

613
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,453
possibly.
It's maybe a combination of those two 

614
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,643
factors.
Maybe there's some people that are 

615
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:45,144
mentally ill that are suicidal in the 
first place and they hope that maybe 

616
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:50,310
becoming a woman would make them feel 
better and it didn't work out.

617
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,560
There's a.
there's a whole website where people,

618
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,853
I think it's called transgender regret 
or something like that and it's all 

619
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:56,934
people that switched over and we're like
really upset that they did it and then 

620
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:02,370
realized it was like some strange phrase
they were going through or whatever,

621
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,250
and then you know,
there's,

622
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,163
there's people that are sure suicidal 
because they want to be one way and 

623
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,690
people just constantly shit on them and 
bullied him and heckle them and they,

624
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,410
that's what's causing them to be so 
deeply.

625
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,590
It's not like one or the other.
No.

626
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,300
And I think in every individual case 
there's probably like a complex,

627
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,060
a complex set of different cause causing
factors.

628
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,450
So yeah,
I agree with that.

629
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,550
I just think it's like,
no matter how low,

630
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,530
obviously I'm for,
you know,

631
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,383
like everyone owns their own body and 
she's able to do whatever they want to 

632
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,490
it.
If you can find a doctor who was willing

633
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:37,350
to perform a surgery on you,
you know,

634
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,600
whatever surgery you want to have.
And,

635
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:42,240
and I think transgender people should 
have the freedom to do that.

636
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,370
Truthfully speaking though,
I don't really see anyone.

637
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:45,204
Not that anyone is in saying that,
but I don't really see anyone 

638
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,240
disagreeing with that.
You know,

639
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,074
like most people seem to agree are 
people that think it's a sickness and 

640
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,513
they absolutely shouldn't be allowed to,
but what is it seems like that's pretty 

641
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:56,460
rare.

642
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,000
Like even the people who are getting a 
lot of,

643
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,290
a lot of heat for,
for their stance on transgender issues.

644
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,760
Like I've never heard Gavin mcinnes say 
it should be illegal.

645
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,730
I've never heard like Ben Shapiro say it
should be illegal.

646
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,490
What they will say is that I'm not going
to pretend that you're a what?

647
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,910
You're a woman.
I'm going to acknowledge that you have a

648
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,520
y chromosome.
Like that to me is like okay,

649
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:16,560
that has nothing to do with your freedom
to have a surgery.

650
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:17,394
He,
this guy has a free freedom of thought 

651
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,633
to describe what's going on and it is 
kind of crazy like you said with the 

652
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,720
global warming thing.
Like it's like,

653
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,554
yeah,
the left Prague themselves on being the 

654
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,540
science party.
Like we believe in science.

655
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,583
Although the problem is that I try very 
hard to like wrap my head around all of 

656
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:36,414
these different issues and I've read a 
decent amount on climate change and I'm 

657
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,440
pretty tough,
pretty tough stuff.

658
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,040
It's not

659
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,630
easy.
It's not like some of these other issues

660
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:44,464
that are much easier to understand and I
will say that about 90 percent of the 

661
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,120
people on the left who are like have the
science,

662
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,223
they haven't looked into it.
They've just been told this is the 

663
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:52,960
science and they're like,
oh great.

664
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:53,794
Now I get to bash people by having the 
science because if you're going to say 

665
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,720
like you're the side that that believes 
in science.

666
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,050
I'm sorry to deny that there are 
biological effects on biological effects

667
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:05,524
on gender is,
but that's science as you be such a 

668
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,740
small fringe group that do make that 
distinction.

669
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:14,490
They think that there's no biological 
difference in the sexes there.

670
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:17,440
Those people are really just crazy.
The idea of pushed it so far,

671
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,830
they're so far left that there in some 
crazy alternative reality.

672
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,610
There are a lot of those.

673
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,780
I look at it like the same way a year.
Like,

674
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,683
um,
scientologists have like their levels I 

675
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:30,070
look at like,
like left wing ideology,

676
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:30,904
jc or something like the social justice 
warrior who's like out in the front 

677
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:39,631
lines protesting Christina Hoff summers.
She's like top level left wing mindset,

678
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,610
but there's a lot.
But no,

679
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:43,444
the idea that gender is a social 
construct is pretty well accepted I 

680
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,290
think on the left.
And to me that is insane.

681
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,183
That's true.
I think it's only accepted in a very 

682
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:55,300
fringe group,
especially academics.

683
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,163
Maybe you're right,
and people in school that protest about 

684
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:01,390
it and people that are super active 
social justice warriors.

685
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:02,224
I think if you polled people,
whether or not they think there's a 

686
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,490
biological difference and you gave them 
three choices.

687
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,361
Yes,
no.

688
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,320
And Dha that most people would say,
Da Da,

689
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,110
here's what,
here's the only thing I'll just,

690
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,650
I,
I,

691
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,020
I think you're 100 percent right.

692
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,960
If they were taking that test 
anonymously,

693
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,210
anonymously to put their names behind 
it,

694
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,620
I think you'd get a much different 
answer.

695
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,890
I talk to college professors,
like my sister's a college professor.

696
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,210
I talked to our friends.
I talked to other people.

697
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,940
A lot of them will come up to me and 
it's almost like this thing,

698
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:30,550
like at a dinner table,
it's like get close and be like,

699
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,780
hey,
just so you know,

700
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:34,390
I really agree with you on like a lot of
stuff and I'm not,

701
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,250
you know,
like it'll be like the people who for,

702
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,233
for the one Jordan Peterson,
who by the way a guy like Jordan 

703
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,983
Peterson really does beg the question,
why aren't there more Jordan Peterson's 

704
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,273
like,
why is it just you and five other 

705
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,720
people?
Why are there not more professors?

706
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,060
And the reason is because they're all 
intimidated.

707
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:50,440
Look at all the shit he's had to deal 
with.

708
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,870
They're all intimidated by that.
Bret Weinstein,

709
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:53,704
who's a super progressive guy,
I mean he's way left and he got shamed 

710
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,700
and he got like literally threatened.
I mean,

711
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:06,250
and now he just won a lawsuit though.
He just got paid $500,000.

712
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,233
We had him on like right after Evergreen
College had to shut down and kids were 

713
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,180
patrolling the fucking parking lot with 
baseball bats.

714
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,790
Looking for him.
Like it was really crazy,

715
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,003
man.
It's insane.

716
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,420
Really crazy stuff that the left,
I mean,

717
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:20,800
imagine if that was coming from the 
right,

718
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,663
you would start calling them Nazis.
He started calling them white 

719
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:25,900
supremacists.
You start calling them thugs,

720
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,750
but on the left they conveniently ignore
the same types of pattern.

721
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,370
It's so unbelievable.
Like the double standard of life.

722
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:35,420
A dude will look.
So you have like the,

723
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,303
the,
the thing that happened in 

724
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,320
Charlottesville,
right where you have like,

725
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,540
I mean I'm a few hundred

726
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,540
people marched and,
and I guess there were dozens of them at

727
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,810
least at least who were like wearing 
Nazi gear,

728
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,591
which is,
you know,

729
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:52,760
don't get me wrong.
I mean it's pretty eyeopening and like,

730
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:53,630
Holy Shit,
I mean,

731
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,400
what?
It's,

732
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,820
it's like disturbing and kind of very.
It very interesting to me that anyone in

733
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:02,480
2017 in America is putting a swastika 
on.

734
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,343
Not only that,
these dumb fucks got together in public 

735
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,553
with lit their face with torches so 
everybody can take video and photos of 

736
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:10,484
them and March student street together,
yelling like blood and soil and all 

737
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,803
sorts of weird fucking shit.
Like what would the quotes that they do 

738
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,420
you remember?
What the Jews will not replace us was.

739
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,273
Wow.
What can I tell you is that as a Jewish 

740
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:23,264
person,
I've never felt more empowered in my 

741
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:27,770
life than the Jews will not replace what
an unbelievable.

742
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,330
Like I've never even entertained the 
idea of replacing anybody.

743
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,840
And then when they're like,
the Jews will not replace us.

744
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,010
I think we can replace these 
motherfuckers got worried about it.

745
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,400
Let's make a move.
Jews,

746
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,060
let's go replace these Charlottesville.
How many people were there?

747
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,060
The protest?
100.

748
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,670
I think between three and $400.
That's it.

749
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,740
That's it.
That's a good size crowd.

750
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,210
That would be psyched if they came to 
see me,

751
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,703
right?
If I,

752
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,180
if I walked into that on the road,
I'd be like,

753
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,040
oh,
that was the line again.

754
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,870
Theater.
You're like,

755
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,040
oh,
we're doing good tonight.

756
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,670
And they'd be like,
it's pretty white supremacy in Italy and

757
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:02,481
here.
There really,

758
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:03,291
uh,
I mean,

759
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,670
at first I thought it was well lit.
Can they bring their Tiki torches inside

760
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,523
or a sticker on a dirt outside?
Who's going to funny to watch those 

761
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:14,570
fires and how to get to know which 
torches yours has got the.

762
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,830
We got a guy,
we have numbers.

763
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:16,664
We got it all figured out yet she passed
Walmart Torch when you had a nice home 

764
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:20,084
depot torch.
Good solidly constructed American Home 

765
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,870
Depot Choice and some dude stole your 
shit and left you with some main Chinese

766
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,190
bullshit.
That would be.

767
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,340
I'll vto bullshit and it's probably just
good enough that you get halfway through

768
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:33,110
the march before you're like,
wait a minute.

769
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,770
Look up and you see made in China.
Fuck.

770
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:39,420
I knew this felt light used to have a 
little American flag under each.

771
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:41,630
A little metal bonnet.
Let's get real.

772
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:42,950
They were all made in China.
Yeah.

773
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,853
Probably.
This is not a big market for Tiki 

774
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,610
torches,
but anyway,

775
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:47,840
I was saying,
but these guys like,

776
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,290
I mean nobody even like people who are 
real far ahead on the right wing who are

777
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,130
like pretty,
you know,

778
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,120
considered,
you know,

779
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,760
like whoever,
like Ben Shapiro who was being protested

780
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,594
by these guys,
he doesn't associate with any of those 

781
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:58,320
guys.

782
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,153
I disgusted by them.
Gavin McInnes won't associate with any 

783
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,630
of these guys.
He's disgusted by them.

784
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,180
These guys can't even speak at their own
rallies.

785
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,160
They don't come to the right wing.
Does a,

786
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,070
I think a fairly decent job at just 
being like,

787
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,760
no we're not.
We're not even associated with trump.

788
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,850
Did Not denounce them correctly.
Well,

789
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,050
no,
I don't think so.

790
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,621
I mean,
look,

791
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:19,454
from what I saw,
I actually thought it was a weird 

792
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:22,110
reaction to what trump said.
It's like,

793
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:22,944
it's like,
so what I'm saying is I see this going 

794
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:24,614
on here with,
with the one thing that happened in 

795
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,404
Charlottesville,
right?

796
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,740
And I haven't seen too much Nazi stuff 
outside of that,

797
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,160
right on the Internet.
But I mean like in terms of response.

798
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,860
But this will just make this point 
because I to address what you're saying.

799
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,180
But.
So then this happened,

800
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,230
this one limited.

801
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,840
There's one thing with a few hundred 
people in Charlottesville happened.

802
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,640
The media goes fucking nuts.
Like,

803
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,040
this is the biggest thing that's ever 
happened on the other side,

804
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,083
on the left wing side,
everywhere that someone tries to have a 

805
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,520
free speech rally everywhere.
Anyone who's,

806
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,413
who's one step to the right of Bernie 
Sanders wants to speak like Condoleezza 

807
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,290
Rice can't speak like anyone who's one 
step to the right of Bernie Sanders gets

808
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,270
shut down.
And there is this mob,

809
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,650
okay,
called Antifa,

810
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,573
who,
who actively go after assaulting people 

811
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,360
who,
and this isn't just Nazis,

812
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:11,310
they go after trump supporters or 
anyone,

813
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,120
anyone who disagrees with them,
they were hammer and sickle flags,

814
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,950
which is,
you know,

815
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,340
represent representing an ideology that 
killed more people than the Nazis.

816
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,174
So,
you know,

817
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,910
let's put them both on the level of like
genocidal horrible,

818
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,020
uh,
groups.

819
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,033
However,
this one group on the left is going 

820
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,733
everywhere across the country and are 
given comfort and aid by college 

821
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,544
professors.

822
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,000
So when,
then my ears.

823
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,880
Yes,
yes,

824
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,713
there actually.
And when it's brought up and it's 

825
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:38,184
actually backed up by things like 40 
percent of millennials in a Chicago 

826
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,110
University,
a study,

827
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,303
a state,
they don't believe in free speech for 

828
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:47,544
hate speech,
which basically means you don't believe 

829
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,314
in free speech.
You've got about 40 percent of 

830
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,930
millennials who don't believe in free 
speech.

831
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,960
You have to define hate speech.
And that's where things get slippery and

832
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:57,360
what you might call hate speech is so 
different from me,

833
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,290
right?
What I might,

834
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,123
what you might call hate speech is me 
saying that I don't want to call a 

835
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,510
transgender woman,
uh,

836
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,860
her right?
That well,

837
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:05,720
let's.
And that has been,

838
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,790
that has been labeled hate speech.
That's a microaggression.

839
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,880
These are all.
So it's like,

840
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:10,050
once you define that,
it's like,

841
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,040
oh,
you can punch a Nazi.

842
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:11,874
But by the way,
everyone who disagrees with me as a 

843
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:14,730
Nazi,
I am against hate speech.

844
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,500
And by the way,
anything I don't like I'm offended by is

845
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,380
hate speech.
And,

846
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,930
and that's the whole idea of freedom of 
speech is to protect unpopular speech.

847
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,213
It's not there.
So we can talk about things that don't 

848
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,200
offend you.
Obviously.

849
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,840
No one has a problem with that,
but so you have this on the left,

850
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:31,680
which this math problem,
and then the media demands that everyone

851
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:34,890
on the right denounce this non existent 
thing,

852
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,070
so when trump can on a nonexistent thing
was disturbing,

853
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:41,400
was seeing hundreds of people walking 
down the street with torches,

854
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:44,190
yelling out racist things together as a 
group,

855
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,990
and the only thing that was 
differentiating,

856
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,913
differentiating their idea was so much 
more stupid than the free speech idea 

857
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,143
because their idea was just to 
differentiate people based on how much 

858
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:57,570
melanin in their skin and what part of 
the planet their ancestors came from.

859
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,810
That's one of the dumbest fucking ideas 
in human history.

860
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,793
So what you have is this river of dumb 
dumbs walking down the street and the 

861
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:06,924
president doesn't say that.
The president doesn't say he's the guy 

862
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:10,044
who's running the country,
right?

863
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,943
He doesn't say,
Hey,

864
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,070
this is the lowest form of stupidity 
that we know of with humans.

865
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:21,030
The lowest form of stupidity is to 
accept everyone that looks like you.

866
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,073
This is so fucking stupid.
You're pretending that someone has any 

867
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:26,850
power whatsoever over where they were 
born,

868
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,550
their national origin,
who their parents were.

869
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:30,384
You don't,
you don't have any fucking power over 

870
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:32,274
that.
So you're putting all the power and 

871
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:36,730
things that you have zero control with.
That means you're a fucking loser.

872
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,653
Alright,
and that means the only thing that you 

873
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:42,190
got to bank on is this white skin,
the unity of in workforce.

874
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,693
This is the group that you're lumping 
everybody together with and you don't 

875
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:45,880
know.

876
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,660
Do you not know any great black people 
do not know any great Hispanic or Latino

877
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,494
people you don't know any.
Well then you need to get the fuck out 

878
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,060
of your neighborhood,
the ignorance,

879
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,970
but I think that applies to that thing 
you're saying about kind of being like a

880
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:58,804
loser and then grasping to some 
collective because you don't have 

881
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:04,540
anything in your own story to really 
cling to life.

882
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,860
I agree with you,
but that's.

883
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,723
I mean I think that applies to people 
who get into this identity bullshit on 

884
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,260
all sides.
I don't disagree.

885
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,094
It's like,
yeah,

886
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,410
I mean for a second about the president,
Short,

887
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,870
short,
but I just think to me what he said,

888
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
from what I see,
what like he did call out those guys,

889
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:22,870
he did say it was like disgusting,
but what people were upset about it that

890
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:25,570
he said there were bad people on both 
sides.

891
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,423
What did you ever see a storm fronts 
reaction to trump speech that he never 

892
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,220
criticized white supremacy and they were
saying it was very good,

893
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:34,054
very positive overall,
and he said that there was problems on 

894
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,074
both sides and bad people on both sides.
I see videos slide that Antifa was bad 

895
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,120
also and they were say,
God bless Donald Trump.

896
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,013
Okay,
so this is what I saw from the videos 

897
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,290
that I saw because I have learned and we
could go through this forever,

898
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,540
that I don't trust the mainstream media 
at all.

899
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:56,740
They're completely full of shit.
So whoever rotated by corrupt people,

900
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,960
a reporter.
Sure.

901
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,863
No,
I'm not saying that it's necessarily 

902
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:00,484
corrupt,
but been an embedded reporter that just 

903
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,340
wanted to write a story.
Maybe maybe,

904
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,180
but I'm from the videos that I saw like 
videos of what was going on there.

905
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:07,721
It's like,
yeah,

906
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:08,950
I saw all the stuff you're talking 
about,

907
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,030
like the Tiki torches.

908
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,040
The Jews will not replace us,
swastikas,

909
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,210
all that really,
you know,

910
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,790
garbage.
And then I also saw,

911
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,863
um,
like David Duke and Richard Spencer and 

912
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,950
all these guys who are kind of like 
Richard Spencer,

913
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,280
I think as a white nationalist.
David Duke has been around forever.

914
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:24,680
You know,
is,

915
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,513
is a bigoted guy who had a almost 
successful run for governor I think at 

916
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,390
one point in Louisiana.
But you know,

917
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:32,224
it's been around forever now.
I find a lot of both of their ideas a 

918
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,460
fucked up at offensive,
but they got a permit and we're there to

919
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:40,294
speak and this was the next day.
This has nothing to do the night before 

920
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:46,030
they were out doing all that crazy shit 
that we were talking about.

921
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,043
And then I did see this video of groups 
of people who were forced out when they 

922
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:51,454
canceled the speech,
a forced out through an Antifa mob at a 

923
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,160
bunch of them getting tear gassed and 
rocks thrown at them and shit like that.

924
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,470
So I don't know,
I mean as,

925
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,363
as,
as disgusting as like white supremacy 

926
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,550
may be,
or national socialism,

927
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:04,384
particularly to me,
someone whose family was fucking 

928
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:09,750
slaughtered by them.
And I believe in freedom of speech and I

929
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:12,790
think like the.
So I do think to some degree I get,

930
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,450
I just get where and,
and like I get where trump is being.

931
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,423
I guess what I'm sympathetic to is that 
he's being like a raked over the coals 

932
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:24,220
for not for calling out both sides 
instead of just calling out one side.

933
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,820
Whereas everyone on the left is silent 
about this antifa group.

934
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,683
It just started getting press actually 
covered in a fair way in the mainstream 

935
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:33,980
media.
But it's everywhere but blow.

936
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,813
I think the idea of anti for though is 
to react to people they disagree with 

937
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,400
who are speaking right?
This is,

938
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,234
this is their idea versus the idea of 
rights of premesis to walk down the 

939
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,134
street and denounce other weaker races 
and get together as a big group with 

940
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:51,590
torches and then people protest them and
then there's violence.

941
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,903
I think you got to address the root of 
the idea of it as a representative of 

942
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:56,894
all the people in the United States.
The root of the idea of it is that it's 

943
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:02,950
okay to be a white racist and you know,
there's a lot of people that said,

944
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:03,784
what about Brown pride?
How cain Velasquez is brown product 

945
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:10,070
tattooed on his fucking chest.
If you don't know the difference between

946
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,160
a guy who is born of immigrants that 
literally his dad walked from Mexico,

947
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,600
you know,
I mean this is,

948
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,040
he's a first generation.

949
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,050
I mean,
you're second generation.

950
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:22,880
I guess his dad was first generation.
How does it work?

951
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,773
No,
he's first generation American because 

952
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:27,920
his dad was from Mexico.
I mean this is a,

953
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,791
it's a different.
I mean,

954
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:29,624
they came here to try to get a better 
life because they got a shit roll the 

955
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:32,504
dice.
They were born in Mexico and he wanted 

956
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,293
out and he wanted better for his family,
so they took a chance to come here when 

957
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:40,590
he has brown pride tattooed on his.
He's not saying that like,

958
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,120
you know they're going to dominate and 
the Jews will not replace us.

959
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,740
He's saying,
I'm proud to be a Mexican.

960
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,560
It sure when you say you're proud to be 
a Mexican for whatever reason,

961
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:52,640
and I don't know why,
it doesn't mean you hate white people.

962
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,000
It doesn't mean you hate black people.
It means you have pride in your heritage

963
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,910
when you have white pride in for 
whatever reason.

964
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,983
I don't know why,
but our thought is that you hate other 

965
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:03,370
races.
Like if you are,

966
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,890
if you're a white nationalists like you 
love white people,

967
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,330
people look at you like you're a piece 
of shit and you are racist and you.

968
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,193
You think black people are inferior and 
you think Mexican people and Asian 

969
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:17,270
people and American Indians,
you think they're all inferior.

970
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,960
That's how we look at it.
But if you have black pride,

971
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,243
we look at you as a strong person who's 
resisting this really fucked up society 

972
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,580
that has brought your ancient ancestors 
over from Africa and enslaved people and

973
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,343
literally marginalized everyone who 
looks like you and you were there to 

974
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:43,190
fight against that.
But it's kind of strange in a way,

975
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:44,024
like even as you say it,
it's kind of strange that we think of 

976
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:47,990
one this way and the other that way.
I do think like,

977
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:48,601
I get that,
I,

978
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:52,070
I get the certainly get the point that 
like came to Alaska,

979
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:52,904
is tattooing brown pride on his skin,
give him his story is a very different 

980
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:56,420
thing.

981
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,253
Then tattooing white pride on your skin 
because you're like a neo Nazi or 

982
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:01,094
something like that.
And it was the UFC heavyweight champion 

983
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,770
and it never came up.
Yeah.

984
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,530
He's arguably the greatest UFC 
heavyweight in history.

985
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,950
It only,
it only came up in the,

986
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,470
in the fact that like they were like,
oh,

987
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:12,290
we're gonna sell numbers in Mexico City.
Brown pride.

988
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,490
And they didn't.
He lost the belt.

989
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,660
Well,
he shouldn't have used Brown.

990
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:18,680
It's a fucking English word.
People to say,

991
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,910
no,
you can't even.

992
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,590
What is the,
what's the word?

993
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,960
Brown and Spanish.
What's the word?

994
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:24,794
Pride in Spanish.
I get a guarantee you it ain't brown 

995
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:28,400
pride.
If you go over there and you go,

996
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:29,480
I got brown pride.
They'd go,

997
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:32,010
what?
What'd you say?

998
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
So weirdly symbolizes how American he 
is.

999
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,630
Ah,
or our own.

1000
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,910
That's how you said that's what it 
should say.

1001
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,810
That's what she'd say came.
Who?

1002
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,340
Fuck cane.
I can't wait to see that guy fighting.

1003
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,490
I hope he can heal up.
Yeah.

1004
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,750
He's had a lot of injuries or injuries?
Yeah,

1005
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:49,683
just his whole career.
Is that a lot of injuries but he's been 

1006
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:51,481
yet,
like you said,

1007
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,630
maybe the best heavy weight ever,
but I just wanted to,

1008
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,800
to what you were saying like I do,
I get that.

1009
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,850
I get the difference and I think that's 
a very,

1010
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:58,684
very valid point.
But like there is this thing like the 

1011
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:06,480
idea of white people embracing identity 
politics.

1012
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,060
The way the left has kind of embraced 
identity politics.

1013
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,310
Oh,
it does in some sick way.

1014
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,980
Seemed like the natural logical 
progression.

1015
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,920
If you want to accept what the left wing
believes and then you're like,

1016
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:18,840
okay,
well you look at the demographics,

1017
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:19,763
white people are becoming a minority in 
this country in the future and this is 

1018
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,600
how you kind of have like I get the 
point you're making,

1019
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:27,960
but at the same time it's a bit of a 
weird setup that the left has.

1020
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,883
We're like,
everyone else is allowed to say these 

1021
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:30,624
things except white people ever.
Like political correctness kind of only 

1022
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:33,894
applies to this one group and we're 
going to put everything you say under a 

1023
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:37,284
fine tooth comb,
but somebody else could say whatever 

1024
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,374
they want.
It gets to a cartoonish point where you 

1025
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:42,864
have ice cube lecturing Bill Maher about
making a joke and actually ironically 

1026
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:51,180
while he's promoting his gangster rap 
album,

1027
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,103
sitting there going,
now what made you think it was cool to 

1028
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:56,940
say that Bill Maher and it's like 
motherfucker,

1029
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:58,800
you made cop killer.
Yeah,

1030
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,110
she iced tea.
Oh No,

1031
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,900
what?
What was his song now?

1032
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,890
I'm sorry.
They both didn't like cops is my point,

1033
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,380
but I'm just saying like he makes,
you know.

1034
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:12,120
It's really funny.
It's key calls,

1035
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,670
easy e a house Nigga on that album,
right?

1036
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,290
He uses the same insults actually toward
another black guy.

1037
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,243
Not as a joke,
not as a self deprecating joke the way 

1038
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:22,824
Bill Maher used that,
but in the worst way you could insult 

1039
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,460
another black guy.
He uses it,

1040
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:27,443
so I just think there is this weird 
dynamic on the left where it's like the 

1041
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:31,364
rhetoric is so anti white and so anti 
male that I almost sit there and I go 

1042
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:36,324
like,
man,

1043
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,460
if you guys think Charlottesville is 
ugly,

1044
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,350
you're gonna.
You're gonna.

1045
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,193
Create a lot more of this.
I was sitting at my sister's place a 

1046
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,273
couple of weeks ago and talking with a 
few of her left wing professors and my 

1047
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:47,980
sister's got a.
she's a college professor.

1048
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:49,970
He's got this big bookshelf up behind 
the,

1049
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,270
you know,
like behind the table,

1050
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,243
lots of books and I just looked over and
there was a Michael Moore book from the 

1051
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:58,500
nineties called stupid white men and you
just look at it and you're like,

1052
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,410
oh yeah,
maybe that's why they're all angry.

1053
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,383
People don't like being the bad guy.
Black Guy wrote a book called stupid 

1054
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:09,390
black men.
They would come out of him so hard.

1055
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,703
Yeah.
It's sounds like something Larry elder 

1056
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,670
my right,
but with a more eloquent title for it.

1057
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:16,643
Nobody fuck with some stupid black man.
If a black guy wrote a book that was 

1058
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:20,471
like,
Ah,

1059
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,140
you know,
all white people aren't stupid.

1060
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,510
They'd be like uncle Tom,
you know,

1061
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:24,510
like right away it's like,
oh,

1062
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:27,780
you sell out.
Well it's racist.

1063
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,853
Yeah.
We just don't like to think it's racist 

1064
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:30,070
because it's about

1065
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,770
white people and generally white people 
don't have to deal with racism nearly as

1066
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:35,680
much as other races.
So we allow it to be okay.

1067
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,770
It's also sexist.
There a big thing that's going on now,

1068
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,950
especially lately where women think it's
okay to say all white CIS men are trash.

1069
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,960
I mean,
it's so fucking common.

1070
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,823
It is such a crazy generalization to say
that all men or all white men are 

1071
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:56,590
terrible and they're horrible trash 
until prove until they prove otherwise.

1072
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,453
And it's so fucking killer to say that 
it's so contradicts everything they've 

1073
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,520
supposedly believed in it.
So like,

1074
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:03,850
you know,
if,

1075
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,500
if there's,
uh,

1076
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,393
if there's like a Muslim terrorist event
and then somebody lumps that into like 

1077
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:15,280
radical lumps that into all Muslims,
people on the left will lose their mind.

1078
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:16,114
Like how can you lump every,
the whole group in with what this one 

1079
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,910
bad guy did and then they turn the land 
and lecture white people about the evils

1080
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:22,610
of history.

1081
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,760
But forget if we just stopped saying 
left and right,

1082
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,570
don't you think that what this is is 
just human beings doing that team thing,

1083
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:29,823
you know?
And once you start adopting the rules 

1084
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:35,950
and the patterns of the team,
whether you're a Wisconsin cheese hat or

1085
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:39,310
you're a Boston red sox fan or whatever 
the fuck it is that you're into,

1086
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,880
you get into this like you've ever heard
those vikings chant,

1087
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,743
whether they get the whole stadium like 
a thousand people and they clapped her 

1088
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:52,870
hands together.
It's insane.

1089
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,970
It's amazing.
It's amazing,

1090
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:58,330
right?
But obviously that is a group think sort

1091
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:59,800
of a situation.
And they all,

1092
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,723
they all gear together and they all 
support this behavior that makes them 

1093
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:05,140
feel good that they're a part of this 
group.

1094
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,243
And I think people do that when whenever
they support rightwing causes and I 

1095
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:10,714
think people do that whenever they 
support left wing causes and what the 

1096
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:13,504
right and the left arm is essentially 
just frameworks that we can fit in our 

1097
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:17,674
ideologies and our mind and our needs 
and all of our social and emotional 

1098
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,963
requirements and we can fit them into 
these patterns that we follow and when 

1099
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,840
anybody opposes the structure that we've
adopted as reality,

1100
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:36,990
then we fight with bike locks and 
fucking pepper spraying girls with trump

1101
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:38,170
hats on.

1102
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,003
And you know,
you find all sorts of insane 

1103
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:45,100
justifications for racism,
sexism,

1104
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,173
all sorts of crazy shit that you would 
if it were happening to anyone else 

1105
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,610
other than the person that you're 
opposing.

1106
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,700
You would say,
think of it as being a horrible front to

1107
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:55,534
everything that you stand for.
But as long as it's a white man who 

1108
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:58,720
cares?
Hit him in the head with a bike lock.

1109
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,913
Imagine if it was a black woman that it 
was this professor was disagreeing with 

1110
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:05,530
and he stepped up and he hit her in the 
head with a bike lock.

1111
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,110
It's insane.
Like that's when,

1112
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,390
when you see someone who does that from 
Antifa,

1113
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,373
it is exactly the same as that.
That redneck who pulls out his gun and 

1114
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,230
shoots at that black guy was holding a 
torch.

1115
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1116
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,140
This is all the same thing.
Well,

1117
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:21,130
I also know,
I mean,

1118
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:21,901
you're right,
and it's,

1119
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:23,140
it's like,
uh,

1120
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:27,650
they're shocking similarities between,
between the extreme and the extreme,

1121
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:27,920
right?

1122
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,330
Or,
you know,

1123
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,001
whatever.
You know,

1124
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,770
these teams,
and I agree with you completely.

1125
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:31,604
I think it's all just this tribal team 
group think bullshit kind of that we 

1126
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,314
have to a large degree outgrown,
but that's still kind of haunts us and 

1127
00:50:40,021 --> 00:50:40,854
it's still don't think they've outgrown 
and universities and that's part of the 

1128
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:43,694
issue.
That's why this is all happening at UC 

1129
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,793
Berkeley.
That's why you're seeing it all 

1130
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:49,240
throughout the country in these 
universities because in universities,

1131
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,290
first of all,
you have a bunch of people.

1132
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,153
Let's,
let's try to be as honest and objective 

1133
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:54,560
as possible.
First of all,

1134
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:56,180
you have a bunch of people that are 
seeking knowledge.

1135
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,340
You have young people that are 
idealistic,

1136
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:00,680
that want to change the world,
that want to stand out as being better.

1137
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:01,514
They want to virtue signal.
They want to do all the crazy things 

1138
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:06,410
that they can to be something great and 
there's other ones that want to get laid

1139
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,170
and there's other ones that want to 
manipulate and they still don't know who

1140
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:09,680
they are.

1141
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,950
They still don't know how to behave.
Then you have these professors and a lot

1142
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:15,710
of these professors went through this 
process and then after they went through

1143
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:17,720
this process,
they got their phd,

1144
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,853
they wrote and then they started 
teaching and so they have never been 

1145
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:26,650
outside the hallowed halls of academia 
since the time they were like 19 years.

1146
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:27,484
They've been going through the whole 
system and some of them do it and they 

1147
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:31,484
do it with balance and they figure out 
who they are and they take great pride 

1148
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,790
in the fact that they can mold these 
young minds and give them information.

1149
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,983
And some of them are incredibly broken 
people who are never sexually viable 

1150
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:43,484
when they were young and now they're in 
a position of power and they virtue 

1151
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:46,874
signal to a sickening degree and you see
them and you see them standing up for 

1152
00:51:51,621 --> 00:51:52,454
women above all else,
which is what happened with this whole 

1153
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,780
betsy devos thing when she's there.

1154
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,210
They're trying to push this and say her 
name devoss.

1155
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,293
I think they're trying to push due 
process in the case of these sexual 

1156
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,640
assault cases on campus and people are 
resisting due process.

1157
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,660
People are resisting guilty until proven
innocent.

1158
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,370
Oh my God,
that's what they want.

1159
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,263
And I'm sorry,
like,

1160
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,900
and I don't mean to also like uh,
you know,

1161
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:19,010
like keep harping on this kind of left 
versus right thing.

1162
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:19,844
But it's hard for me.
I almost want like some term to like 

1163
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,093
define,
but this left side of a lake on college 

1164
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:25,940
campuses.
This grill,

1165
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,880
they're position is simultaneously.
I mean,

1166
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:31,040
it's really quite amazing.
Their position is that,

1167
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,170
and this is what basically what was just
repealed now,

1168
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:36,710
but this is what the guidelines under 
Obama basically did on college campuses.

1169
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,030
They said,
okay,

1170
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,790
there's no due process for men who are 
accused of rape.

1171
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,290
Oh,
and by the way,

1172
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,660
and this isn't in the legislation,
this is just the cultural punch,

1173
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,300
but so there's no due process for men 
accused of rape and by the way,

1174
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,070
everything is rape.
Everything's right.

1175
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,060
Everything's right.
Everything.

1176
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:52,460
Every guy you've ever met.
Yeah,

1177
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,340
I mean if you had anything to drink,
by the way,

1178
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:56,174
the man is not,
is not responsible or the man is 

1179
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:01,310
responsible.
The woman is not so great beers.

1180
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,203
I mean you've probably taken 90 percent 
at least of the pool of what men and 

1181
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,740
women in America previously considered.
Good guys.

1182
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,713
Forget even like rapists,
good men like just the guys who you 

1183
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,230
think are good people not like consider 
it.

1184
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,360
Ninety percent of them are serial 
rapists.

1185
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,030
Have you heard the story from University
of Amherst?

1186
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:20,864
It's one of the most ridiculous ones or 
this guy suing now and he has gone 

1187
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:25,890
through hell for the last couple of 
years,

1188
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,963
but it was a kid who was a student from 
Nigeria and some girl who was in his 

1189
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,034
class and they hooked up and they got 
together and they apparently they were 

1190
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,190
slightly intoxicated,
I think on marijuana.

1191
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,323
The girl gave the guy a blow job and 
then she wanted to stop and he was 

1192
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,060
trying to get her to do it again and she
said no.

1193
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,620
And so they ended it.
That was it.

1194
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,740
Um,
she talked to her friends.

1195
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,723
They decided that she had been sexually 
assaulted because he was trying to get 

1196
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:54,631
her to.
Come on,

1197
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,464
please,
you know,

1198
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,460
I don't know what he said.
I don't know,

1199
00:53:56,461 --> 00:54:00,060
maybe it would be a no,
that wouldn't be enough.

1200
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,460
I don't know what the fuck he said.
I don't know what the scenario was,

1201
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,563
but I do know that it was essentially an
awkward sexual exchange between young 

1202
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:08,064
people,
which is just a part of being a young 

1203
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:11,540
person who's having sex.
When you're,

1204
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,403
you're a person and you're 18 years old 
or whatever they were and you're in 

1205
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:18,660
college and you're having sex and you're
in some sort of a sexual scenario with a

1206
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:19,500
new person.

1207
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,900
What are they?
How long have you been doing that?

1208
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,973
Three years.
How good are you at it or you fight you 

1209
00:54:24,521 --> 00:54:26,940
probably fucking terrible at it.
You'd probably awkward as Shit.

1210
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,063
You probably weird around women.
You can't believe they like you don't 

1211
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:32,670
know why they like you.
Maybe you're confused.

1212
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:34,320
Maybe you think you have to act a 
certain way.

1213
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,210
You know the,
the finding yourself,

1214
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,173
you adolescent use it before you 
actually do not have a fully developed 

1215
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:43,410
brain and it's a different and forget 
even insects and stuff like that.

1216
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:45,810
There's just things.
How many things did you do at 20?

1217
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,040
We'd look back and go,
oh,

1218
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:50,250
what a douchey thing to do.
Like that's not how you treat someone.

1219
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:50,660
You know,
like,

1220
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,070
so this young guy,
I think he was 19 at the time,

1221
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:54,870
somewhere in the college age,
whatever it was,

1222
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,390
he's fucked.
They kicked him out of school,

1223
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,343
they labeled him some sort of a sexual 
Predator and he's in this terrible 

1224
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:02,830
position where,
you know,

1225
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:03,683
he's suing the school,
but it's gonna take a long time before 

1226
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:06,054
anything gets resolved and you know,
we don't know the whole story of the 

1227
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:09,984
case,
but if the case is as he's representing 

1228
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:15,390
it and as no one's said,
he held her down,

1229
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,240
no one said he tried to rape her and no 
one said he threatened violence.

1230
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,073
No one said anything like that.
Her version of the story is that they 

1231
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,840
had some sort of a willing sexual 
encounter and she just didn't want to go

1232
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:26,670
any further and he asked her to and she 
said no,

1233
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,960
and then it ended.
That's it.

1234
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,890
That is a normal.
That's just part of being a young person

1235
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,530
that's just part of being a young person
having sex,

1236
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,364
especially if you're intoxicated.
Is it a good idea to have sex 

1237
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,030
intoxicated kid?
I don't know.

1238
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:39,983
I mean,
I've done it a bunch and sure you have 

1239
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:43,400
to have.
Yes.

1240
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,230
Stop pretending you haven't done it.
Stop pretending that a lot.

1241
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,093
Look,
there's all sorts of mistakes you make 

1242
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:49,860
when you're drunk.
W why?

1243
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,843
Why are they so much bigger?
If it's sex and there's something about 

1244
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:55,890
just using the word rape,
rape.

1245
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,783
I mean it's like look,
rape is a particularly horrific cutting 

1246
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:01,464
word because of what a horrific crime it
is and then to try to make everything 

1247
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:06,930
else like it's literally,
I mean the extent they go,

1248
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:08,100
it's almost like,
you know,

1249
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,350
it's like if you,
if you punch someone in the arm and they

1250
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:11,184
go,
you committed or murder or something 

1251
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:12,541
like that,
it's like,

1252
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:13,374
no,
you can't.

1253
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,600
You can't just throw that word at 
everything.

1254
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,710
I mean everybody wants to.
It's worse than that because of race.

1255
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,040
That's an assault is an actual egregious
offense.

1256
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,100
If you're talking about people

1257
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,820
having sex.
No Cross,

1258
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,640
right?
You're absolutely calling.

1259
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,430
You know,
it'd be like calling a glance murder.

1260
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,570
Yeah.
I mean it's really,

1261
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:32,404
it's fucking crazy.
Was the idea of microaggressions and 

1262
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:35,434
this is the whole.
This is the whole thing that underpins 

1263
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:37,834
the philosophy,
which I find really terrifying is that 

1264
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,840
the idea of micro aggression or social 
justice,

1265
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:44,763
it's like you take these terms like 
aggression or justice that meant 

1266
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:50,710
something and now you've made the mean 
the opposite of what they mean.

1267
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:53,440
But microaggression is not an aggression
inherently.

1268
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,620
It's not an aggression.
No,

1269
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:55,463
I know.
It's a normal part of human 

1270
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:56,824
communication.
You say something mean and I go like 

1271
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,163
this and I walk away.
That's what people do is that's a 

1272
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,213
microaggression and there's this thing,
and this is why I find it to be such 

1273
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,220
that the issue of our time,
I almost forget like,

1274
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,430
you know,
like it's not the issue.

1275
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,560
I necessarily wanted to be the issue of 
our time.

1276
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,800
I was hoping it would be like embracing 
libertarianism full on or something,

1277
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:15,634
but it just seems to be like,
are you for free speech or against free 

1278
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:22,030
speech and free speech has such a Prereq
for everything.

1279
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,690
It's a prerequisite for everything about
the,

1280
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,583
uh,
the society we live in and everything 

1281
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,140
particularly like what you do,
what I do,

1282
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,120
everything we do.
Like you can't,

1283
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,043
you can't.
What I love in life is like comedy and 

1284
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:34,864
truth and you can't have either of those
without that free speech because 

1285
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,520
possible can have this conversation 
about free speech.

1286
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,290
I mean,
we couldn't have this conversation if we

1287
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,320
were on a state sponsored program.
We couldn't have this.

1288
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,450
If we were on a corporate sponsored 
program,

1289
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,313
we'd likely couldn't have this 
conversation without being interrupted 

1290
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:49,534
or,
or being lectured to or having some 

1291
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,930
conversation with someone who says,
Hey,

1292
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,180
you can't say the word nigger.

1293
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,770
Right?
You're not allowed to say it.

1294
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,240
Forget about living in the context.
Yeah,

1295
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,730
yeah.
You can say that noise with your mouth.

1296
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:01,603
Right?
Not Calling someone at not saying you 

1297
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:04,360
are one,
you know,

1298
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,560
and like,
no one can go,

1299
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:06,394
but that's fucking retarded.
It's what's the dumbest thing I've ever 

1300
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:09,094
heard,
but that this was the rule and this is 

1301
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:12,350
how everybody operates and there's a 
thing where it's not.

1302
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,233
I mean,
if,

1303
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,120
if we're living in a world of I can't 
commit a microaggression,

1304
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:18,760
I can't go down a path that might offend
anybody.

1305
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,103
You,
you need that freedom in order to find 

1306
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:24,844
anything interesting.
There's nothing worth saying if you're 

1307
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:27,760
living in this world where you're like,
oh,

1308
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:31,300
I can't get outside of this box.
So I find that to be very,

1309
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:36,070
just very dangerous and I feel like 
people in America,

1310
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:38,050
it's almost like we've had it too good 
for too long,

1311
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,260
that people are removed from the fact 
that we can lose all this shit.

1312
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,680
It's like there's no,
there's no respect for like,

1313
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,540
like what we have,
how much different,

1314
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,960
how much higher standard of living we 
live than the vast,

1315
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,960
you know,
uh,

1316
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,630
for,
for,

1317
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:55,270
than most humans that are alive today.
And the vast majority of humans who have

1318
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:56,450
ever existed.
I mean,

1319
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,293
it's like what?
I got this from a Jordan Peterson 

1320
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,320
lecture,
uh,

1321
00:58:59,320 --> 00:58:59,930
but he said,
uh,

1322
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,780
it was an 18,
95.

1323
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,920
The average American lived on a dollar a
day adjusted for modern inflation.

1324
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,480
So in 18,
95,

1325
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,433
you know,
it's like,

1326
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:13,530
like central Asia level poverty in 
America and that's just everyone.

1327
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:17,280
Before that living in backbreaking 
poverty was like,

1328
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,300
just life.
That was just all of life.

1329
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:23,810
And it's like we figured something out 
in these last less than 200 years,

1330
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:24,644
you know,
like we figured something or a little 

1331
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:27,170
more than 200 years.
We've figured something out.

1332
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,980
Wait,
what am I saying?

1333
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,170
No,
no,

1334
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,480
no,
it's less than 200 years.

1335
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,170
We figured something out in this 
industrial revolution that like now lets

1336
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,320
us live up here on this.
And it's like we can lose that and a lot

1337
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,170
of it has to do with freedom.
But the whole thing to me is freedom.

1338
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,880
The whole thing is that we embrace.
Look,

1339
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,550
if you look in the year,
um,

1340
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,260
and uh,
that you had on your show,

1341
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,640
Thaddeus Russell,
who's great,

1342
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:49,280
I just did his podcast recently and he 
put it this way,

1343
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:49,881
uh,
where he goes,

1344
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:50,714
you know,
in the year 1800 [inaudible] I was 

1345
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:52,244
talking about what an incredible thing 
the 19th century was and how it 

1346
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:55,484
transformed humanity.
And he goes to the year 1800 Americans 

1347
00:59:58,221 --> 01:00:00,110
are all making their own clothes in the 
year.

1348
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:03,080
1,900
Americans are shopping at macy's.

1349
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,970
Like we,
we,

1350
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,730
if you had said in the,
you know,

1351
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,480
in the year 18,
45 and been like,

1352
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,910
dude,
in the next 65 years,

1353
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:11,923
slavery is going to be abolished in the 
West and we're going to have an 

1354
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:16,370
industrial revolution,
you know,

1355
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:19,490
it's like magic happen and that's why we
live the way we live today.

1356
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,950
And no one is even interested in that 
story.

1357
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:25,690
Like why do we have this much wealth?
And I like what you said.

1358
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:27,080
I think it's,
it's all about freedom.

1359
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,320
And when you have a guy like Bernie 
Sanders who harps on and on about income

1360
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:31,320
inequality,
I,

1361
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,820
I have a real issue with that because 
it's one of those blanket statements.

1362
01:00:34,821 --> 01:00:36,950
It sounds really good at a campaign 
speech,

1363
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:40,970
but freedom itself breeds income 
inequality.

1364
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:41,823
Yes.
Because freedom means you can do 

1365
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:43,574
whatever you want.
You could do very little or you could 

1366
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,490
work like a maniac.
Well,

1367
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:47,630
if you're going to work,
like if you're,

1368
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,370
if here's the game,
okay,

1369
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,220
you do something for that.
Something.

1370
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:53,054
You get currency,
you use that currency to buy things or 

1371
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:56,474
to make sure you don't have to work 
again by food and goods and take trips 

1372
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,720
and travel.
The more you work,

1373
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:05,810
the more you decide you want to pursue 
something,

1374
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:08,300
the more chances you have to acquire 
their currency.

1375
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,133
If you do it correctly.
That is income inequality due to 

1376
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:13,184
freedom.
I mean take away all the other factors 

1377
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,304
that might be in play,
whether it's racial discrimination or 

1378
01:01:19,381 --> 01:01:22,070
sexual discrimination.
I'm not denying that those things exist,

1379
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,113
but what I am saying is that the idea 
that you are going to have income 

1380
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:29,720
equality in a capitalist society where 
anybody can do whatever they want.

1381
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,730
You know people that is so counter to 
what we know about human behavior.

1382
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,500
I agree.
This is.

1383
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,060
You're talking about a fantasy person 
who doesn't exist,

1384
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,530
who has motivations outside of wealth.
Outside of that,

1385
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,583
most people want some sort of reward for
what they do and if everybody gets the 

1386
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,134
same amount,
there's no fucking reward for working 

1387
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:53,330
extra hard and that's not going to.
We're not going to get Microsoft.

1388
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:55,210
You're not going to get IBM.
It's just,

1389
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,020
I mean it's not,
it's not just,

1390
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,290
I mean they talk about fairness a lot,
which is a strange concept,

1391
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:03,290
but it's not just that somebody works 
twice as hard and doesn't get more.

1392
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,570
I mean that's not the right thing to do 
anyway.

1393
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,800
But like what you were saying,
I just think it's like they,

1394
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:10,430
they use the term so much,
but what's misleading about it?

1395
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,950
You're absolutely right that freedom 
breeds inequality,

1396
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:13,933
but what's misleading about it is by 
that people think like the poor get 

1397
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:20,310
poorer and that is objective.
That is a like objectively false,

1398
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,150
demonstrably false.
It's not that,

1399
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,003
you know,
they make it out like the rich get 

1400
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:26,280
richer and the poor get poorer like that
old saying,

1401
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:27,490
but it's like that,
you know,

1402
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,740
if you think it through like that can't 
really continue like that.

1403
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,733
Nobody was going to have rich.
But if the poor work hard and figured 

1404
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,790
they haven't possibility to escape 
whatever economic situation they're in,

1405
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:39,624
it is possible.
But with freedom and homeless people 

1406
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,503
here live better than,
than rich people in Third World 

1407
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:46,314
countries,
or certainly at least better than 

1408
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,840
average people in third world countries.

1409
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,710
Uh,
so it's like,

1410
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,620
it's not just that the inequality grows,
it's like everything moves up.

1411
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,410
The inequality grows up here.
And this is like what I just,

1412
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,890
what I can't understand.
And,

1413
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,160
and again,
it's like what I was saying before,

1414
01:02:59,161 --> 01:02:59,994
like if you have any concept of the fact
that we're by far the richest freest 

1415
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:05,970
human beings who have ever existed in 
recorded human history,

1416
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,833
at least recorded human history.
Who knows what is going on in ancient 

1417
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:11,610
Egypt,
but like a pro before engineered it.

1418
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:12,444
But,
uh,

1419
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,780
but if you realize that we have this 
incredible amount,

1420
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:15,810
then it's like,
yeah,

1421
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:17,400
it's like just being like,
oh,

1422
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:21,090
we need all of these policies to like 
give handouts to poor people.

1423
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:22,800
It's like,
well actually,

1424
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,850
let's continue this train of getting 
richer and richer and richer,

1425
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,043
which is not at all.
You know what people like Bernie 

1426
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:30,780
Sanders,
man.

1427
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,471
It's like,
well,

1428
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:33,780
it's a hustle.
Bernie's got a hustle going on.

1429
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,563
So you find out it's a hustle when you 
find out it's got a bunch of houses and 

1430
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:39,354
his wife tried to buy up all this 
fucking land to expand the university 

1431
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,580
that she was running and she killed the 
whole fucking school.

1432
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:45,683
Like you.
How about the fact that the 

1433
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:48,450
motherfucker,
and we haven't seen.

1434
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,583
First off he,
he made a million dollars off a book on 

1435
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:55,500
how it's wrong to be a millionaire.
I mean it's like how are you not how can

1436
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:58,560
anyone look at you like as a serious 
leader when you did that?

1437
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,260
So you saying what people want to hear 
and there is something,

1438
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,030
some truth to some of the things that 
he's saying.

1439
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:03,893
I think that the world would be a better
place if we had more social programs in 

1440
01:04:07,471 --> 01:04:08,304
place.
I think the world be a better place if 

1441
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,350
college were free.

1442
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,483
If we think.
I mean I don't disagree with like the 

1443
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:16,150
thought behind that.
I think they're,

1444
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,333
all of these things would be better 
suited in voluntary arrangements than 

1445
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,870
some forced government monopoly.
But I do agree with you that like,

1446
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,823
sure,
I'd like great schools to be very 

1447
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,640
affordable or free if possible.
I'd like everyone to be.

1448
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,533
And,
and Bernie Sanders certainly addressed 

1449
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,950
some very real problems.
Like he would point things out that were

1450
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,120
very real,
like he would be like,

1451
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,740
you know,
they claim it's a great recovery,

1452
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,990
but you know,
90 percent of the new wealth has gone to

1453
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:38,050
the top three percent,
you know,

1454
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:43,060
like he either have some Jackie Mason,
I only do one thing,

1455
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,330
two and that has to apply to every New 
York Jew who's out there.

1456
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,620
But like so like there is some,
and I don't care if Bernie Sanders makes

1457
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:54,540
a million dollars,
but there's something like,

1458
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,403
number one,
making a million dollars while claiming 

1459
01:04:56,881 --> 01:04:59,880
it's kind of a moral issue that some 
people have so much what others have.

1460
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:02,490
So little endorsing Hillary Clinton.
I mean,

1461
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:04,800
I just don't know how you can have.
You can look at the guy who goes,

1462
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:09,950
the problem is incoming inequality and 
these and the banking cartel,

1463
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,420
but I'm going to vote for the candidate 
of the big banks.

1464
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:13,050
Like to me,
that's,

1465
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,883
that's insane.
It would,

1466
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,740
to me it would be if Ron Paul endorsed 
mccain.

1467
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,220
Well,
don't you think the big banks sort

1468
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,530
of were on both teams?
Yeah.

1469
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,423
Well not.
I don't know if they were on trump's 

1470
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:22,804
team,
but there's certainly been on every 

1471
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:24,610
other team now.
Yeah,

1472
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,360
yeah,
yeah.

1473
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,193
No,
certainly.

1474
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,143
It's not even like the teams they run 
the Treasury Department in the Federal 

1475
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,960
Reserve.
They run the whole system.

1476
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,823
But the fact that Bernie Sanders never 
had like a fiery speech about what 

1477
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,184
happened at the DNC about how they 
literally conspired to ruin him and to 

1478
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:41,860
take him out of the race with Hillary 
because they,

1479
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:44,140
the DNC wanted hillary to be the 
candidate.

1480
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,090
They literally sabotaged him.
Oh,

1481
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:47,050
they were very open.
I mean,

1482
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,340
I shouldn't say they were very open 
about that.

1483
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:49,630
Openly.
They lied and said,

1484
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:52,330
we don't have a pick,
but the leaks that were weaponized.

1485
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,390
Yeah.
I mean really some of Russia did it.

1486
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:56,950
Russia ruined everything.
I,

1487
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,583
I actually remember it was one of the 
most surreal and I'm a guy who was 

1488
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:02,260
always preaching about how full of shit 
the media is,

1489
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,243
but even I like this last year that'll 
give the trump moment credit even I've 

1490
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:07,660
been like,
Holy Shit,

1491
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:12,100
I can't believe it,
but I was watching CNN and they had.

1492
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,033
They were playing clips from a Hillary 
Clinton interview and talking about it 

1493
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,053
and Hillary Clinton was claiming that 
Vladimir Putin a weaponized information 

1494
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:26,220
against Hillary Clinton and they're 
discussing this and they never mentioned

1495
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,633
that the information is on CNN.
They're breaking down this piece and 

1496
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:31,504
they never mentioned that.
The information that was weaponized was 

1497
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:39,751
that CNN leaked debate questions to 
Hillary Clinton before the debate.

1498
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:45,010
Like you sit here talking about 
undermining democracy for a month.

1499
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:48,220
What could be more to under what could 
do more to undermine democracy?

1500
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:49,323
The debate,
the things that people actually watch 

1501
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:51,814
and vote on in America.
They gave Hillary Clinton the questions 

1502
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:56,170
that were asked at the debate.
We know for a fact too,

1503
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:57,004
I'm sure there were more,
but we know two questions were given to 

1504
01:06:58,301 --> 01:07:02,950
her and that they were both asked and 
Hillary Clinton take some doesn't have a

1505
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:04,700
problem,
doesn't have a moral issue with that,

1506
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,510
just takes them and pretends she's 
hearing the questions for the first time

1507
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,180
and the show that I'm watching describe.

1508
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:13,660
Talk about this on CNN that's talking 
about the weaponized information and not

1509
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:18,661
mentioning what the information was.
The show is called reliable sources.

1510
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,300
It's a show where they break down the 
media.

1511
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,910
It's like it's surreal to be watching 
and then those same guys in CNN go,

1512
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:31,000
we've got an epidemic of fake news on 
the Internet and you're like,

1513
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:31,834
man,
I don't know if I'm living through a 

1514
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:35,080
fucking simulation or what,
but this is some nutty shit.

1515
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:35,973
Well,
it's so obvious when you watch the 

1516
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:38,404
strategies play out.
Like for people who don't remember 

1517
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,250
Hillary Clinton before she ran against 
trump was running against Barack Obama.

1518
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:46,084
Yes.
And when she was running against Barack 

1519
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,303
Obama,
one of the things she did was she 

1520
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:51,070
positioned herself as to be right of 
center.

1521
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:52,143
So more right than Obama was.
So one of the things that she did was 

1522
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,190
she was publicly stating that gay 
marriage was wrong.

1523
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,293
She was publicly stated that she 
believes that marriage is a sacred 

1524
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:03,904
institution between a man and a woman.
And that was her way of positioning 

1525
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:09,454
herself to the right of Obama.
Like she would appeal to all the 

1526
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:13,200
religious nuts.
Obama,

1527
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:15,120
by the way,
I'm okay with going left.

1528
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,700
I don't want no more war

1529
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,120
in Iraq,
but these fags marrying each other and.

1530
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:20,954
But fucking.
It's just me and Gary Been Married for 

1531
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:26,990
25 years.
You think it's right that they get to be

1532
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:29,150
the same thing?
We are under Christ.

1533
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,240
She will.
She will.

1534
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,020
Just to be fair,
that Obama was also against gay marriage

1535
01:08:34,021 --> 01:08:35,330
and that election,
but she absolutely,

1536
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:37,760
you're right.
Did he say how he.

1537
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:40,070
He did the same thing.
It was these motherfuckers.

1538
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,270
It's like 51 percent approval rating,
right?

1539
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,440
Then all of a sudden they come to Jesus 
53.

1540
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,101
Yeah.
Yeah.

1541
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:46,531
It's like,
well,

1542
01:08:46,531 --> 01:08:49,760
it's like right when it went right when 
it starts being a wedge issue we can use

1543
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,170
right when Obama was going,
oh,

1544
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:54,920
we need reelection and I didn't end in 
any of these wars and still open.

1545
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:55,754
It's like if you're a comic,
but the only way you could work is if 

1546
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,600
somebody gave you an earpiece and they 
fed you great lines.

1547
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,583
Like you couldn't just ad Lib Yourself.
Like if you were doing this podcast and 

1548
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:06,230
why you're doing this podcast,
big Jay's over in the corner feeding you

1549
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:08,250
lines through one of your earpieces 
right.

1550
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,830
Know there's a team of guys,
you know,

1551
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,200
because the other guys in the back,
they're doing like a.

1552
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,470
they're like running like research on 
it.

1553
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,943
The like Jamie's over there constantly 
googling and you have like a screen in 

1554
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:20,714
front of you.
Like you know Howard stern used to have 

1555
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,720
that with Jackie.
The joke,

1556
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:26,030
man,
this is way back in the day.

1557
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,710
Really?
The jokes?

1558
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:29,930
Yeah.
What he did was he had a thing where you

1559
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:33,500
would write on like an overhead 
projector.

1560
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,503
This was like a thing.
It was like a camera and he would see 

1561
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:39,710
the video of it on his side.
He would see the picture.

1562
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:40,783
So you had a funny line,
you would write down the funny line and 

1563
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:43,874
you would put it on the projector and 
Howard would get it on his screen and 

1564
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:48,170
that's one of the things that Jackie,
the joke man did because he was always.

1565
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,930
He was great at like one liners and 
things along those lines.

1566
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:51,764
He knew a lot of jokes and so he would 
give Howard like really funny things to 

1567
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:54,644
say any with juice it up and I did the 
Jackie Chair for a couple times when 

1568
01:09:58,401 --> 01:09:59,810
Jackie,
the joke man quit.

1569
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,913
Jackie wanted like a million dollars a 
year and they wouldn't give him a 

1570
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,060
million dollars a year.
They would give them a 900,000.

1571
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:04,894
He was like fuck you.
So he left and so when he left they had 

1572
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:07,634
a bunch of guys sit in that chair and 
one of them was already and already 

1573
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:11,024
wound up taking that job and part of our
job was to feed Howard lines and like 

1574
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:16,970
that kid Benji.
He's really funny man.

1575
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:17,823
That guy,
he would write down stuff and feed 

1576
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:20,114
Howard funny lines,
so he has a few guys on the side that 

1577
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:23,164
would toss some stuff,
which is essentially what a politician 

1578
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:26,474
does,
write us a politician like you're not 

1579
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:33,470
going to get their full unadulterated 
ideas except for trump and that's one of

1580
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:37,700
the things that was so refreshing about,
even though it was a shitty message,

1581
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,833
even though there's a poverty of words 
and the way he spoke and there was this 

1582
01:10:41,931 --> 01:10:43,340
clunkiness to it all.

1583
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,280
There's certainly as a clunkiness,
there's no question about that.

1584
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:49,050
It's a very,
very simplistic way of,

1585
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,260
of speaking compared to what we're used 
to.

1586
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:52,970
Politicians.
Yeah,

1587
01:10:52,971 --> 01:10:55,190
like all the slogans,
slogans,

1588
01:10:55,191 --> 01:10:57,890
work.
I think there is something about it.

1589
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,590
The fact that he was as,
as you were saying,

1590
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:04,080
like completely unrestrained,
completely on,

1591
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,053
you know,
there's something really interesting 

1592
01:11:05,781 --> 01:11:06,614
about trump.
I mean the whole thing is really 

1593
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:08,920
fascinating,
but it,

1594
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,440
it's like the most profoundly hilarious 
and interesting moment ever.

1595
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,250
And like no one wants to appreciate

1596
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,200
it because they're so dug into like one 
or the other.

1597
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,220
Nuclear War with Korea.
Well,

1598
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,470
I get that.
That's kind of scary.

1599
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,393
I mean it's more,
more scary for the people in Seoul than 

1600
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:24,690
us,
but still like that is scary.

1601
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,380
But the thing with trump is that he 
speaks and,

1602
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,030
you know,
it's like,

1603
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:30,864
okay,
the people who hate trump hate him more 

1604
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:33,610
than any.
Anyone.

1605
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,420
I mean,
I've never seen a political leader hated

1606
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,800
as much as the people who hate trump 
hate him right now.

1607
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,560
No one in America for sure.
No,

1608
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,030
no,
no one in my lifetime has in America has

1609
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,620
even come close.
I'm sure there are other countries where

1610
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:44,520
it's like,
you know,

1611
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,290
dictator.
Yeah.

1612
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,280
Yeah.
Like that I'm sure.

1613
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,630
But like there,
um,

1614
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,023
but trump has hated and I got to be 
honest with if you ask people on the 

1615
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:54,294
left why they hate him,
I think they struggled to give you a 

1616
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:58,770
really good,
honest answer for it.

1617
01:11:58,771 --> 01:11:59,604
I mean they'll say things like,
I think they say things like racism or 

1618
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,383
bigotry or you know,
I'd say pa people were paying attention 

1619
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:06,324
to what he's doing.

1620
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,690
Right.
They were worried about that.

1621
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:10,524
Although I gotta say the EPA thing,
I don't think any of this is actually 

1622
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:14,394
the source of the trump patriot.
I think this is like we hate trump and 

1623
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:17,634
now what's he doing?
That's how we're going to get evidence 

1624
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:21,220
against him.
Um,

1625
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,133
the truth is what they'll say nine out 
of 10 times if I present this to a left 

1626
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:25,670
wing person or I'll go like,
oh,

1627
01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:26,504
you know,
he's pretty much continuing all the 

1628
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:29,670
Obama policies or it's virtually the 
same.

1629
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:34,020
Which I think is one of the really big 
stories of the trump era so far that how

1630
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:37,290
much is the same since Obama.
No one wants to talk about big changes.

1631
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:41,010
There's been a big change.
I'm not saying there are no changes.

1632
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:43,020
Immigration Policy,
immigration policy.

1633
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:45,660
He wrote one executive order by the 
courts,

1634
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:46,523
but it hasn't really gone into effect,
but it's the idea that he's promoting 

1635
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,050
his rhetoric is very,
very different.

1636
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,730
No question about that.
He's promotes different ideas.

1637
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:55,080
His rhetoric is very,
very different.

1638
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,690
Um,
but in terms of like monetary policy,

1639
01:12:57,691 --> 01:12:59,340
fiscal policy,
foreign policy,

1640
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:02,820
the war on drugs,
see if you're talking about immigration,

1641
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,730
I mean,
that's kind of like,

1642
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:04,564
okay,
I would get,

1643
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,750
I'm putting that in domestic policy in 
my mind,

1644
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:07,584
but yet far enough,
well in foreign policy it speaking 

1645
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:10,404
about,
because I was saying nine out of 10 

1646
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:12,300
times the answer to me as they go,
well,

1647
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:14,590
that's kind of your white privilege.
And if you were in,

1648
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,260
if you were in one of these,
uh,

1649
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,610
um,
uh,

1650
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:18,503
uh,
groups that's worried about being 

1651
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:20,850
deported,
you would feel differently.

1652
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,890
But the fact is that deportations are 
down,

1653
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:23,803
right?
Under trump,

1654
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,160
there were more under Obama.
I mean,

1655
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,053
they're down now.
There's a few different arguments for 

1656
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:29,830
why that reason is,
uh,

1657
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:33,030
there have been a lot of arrests but,
but not deportations,

1658
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,013
but it's just like,
even that the narrative isn't fitting 

1659
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,223
the way.

1660
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,660
Like what really,
to me,

1661
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:43,920
what really drove what made people hate 
trump was his rhetoric.

1662
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,210
It was all rhetoric.
It wasn't.

1663
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,900
Obama was deporting lots of people.
Obama was bombing the crap out of him.

1664
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:49,734
Obama was targeting families of,
of and he was torturing like all these 

1665
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:54,360
things were happening,
but he didn't talk about it.

1666
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,373
He spoke about it in a nice way and 
trump was like this unapologetic like 

1667
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:05,510
white rich man who didn't play the PC 
game and spoke of minorities.

1668
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,090
Not In like a glowing.
I'm so sorry,

1669
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,380
like minorities are better than me.
I'm the evil white guy.

1670
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:11,891
Was like,
no,

1671
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:12,100
we're

1672
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,850
great.
I never say we're great.

1673
01:14:13,851 --> 01:14:15,030
He would say,
you know,

1674
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,480
some nice things about minorities when 
asked,

1675
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,463
but his central message was like our 
teams great and this to me is I think 

1676
01:14:21,401 --> 01:14:26,401
the reason why leftwing people's blood 
boil was just so many pieces of evidence

1677
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:30,640
that point to corruption with Russia.
So many pieces of evidence that point to

1678
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,803
the idea that this guy is operating in 
the interest of himself and of big 

1679
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:40,570
business and then he's profiting in a 
huge way off being the president and one

1680
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:41,404
of the ways they're doing that.
The reason they're not rolling back the 

1681
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:44,134
environmental protection agency 
standards because they don't believe in 

1682
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:47,644
them.
They're rolling a backpack because it's 

1683
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,920
impeding business.
That's infuriating.

1684
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:51,754
A lot of people on the west scares the 
shit out of people when you have some 

1685
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:57,520
crazy old man who's just doing 
everything for profit.

1686
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,353
Some guy who wants to literally start 
disc fights with basketball players and 

1687
01:15:04,931 --> 01:15:06,700
the hosts from.
That was the thing.

1688
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:07,603
We talked about this before,
but the host from espn who had tweeted 

1689
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:11,823
some stuff about him being a white 
supremacist and then he asked for espn 

1690
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,060
to apologize.
I'm like,

1691
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:17,530
hey,
how come you didn't talk about her man?

1692
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,990
He can't talk about her.
He can't.

1693
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,930
They literally can't say her name 
because if he goes after a black woman,

1694
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,120
then it reinforces all these people's 
ideas.

1695
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,770
Prejudice might know.
Look,

1696
01:15:26,771 --> 01:15:28,840
I,
I get what you're saying and just to the

1697
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:30,530
point about corruption.
I mean like,

1698
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,920
of course.
I mean that's the nature of government.

1699
01:15:32,921 --> 01:15:36,760
Like whatever decision they're making is
based on what lobbyists is lobbying them

1700
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,460
the harder and when it's all corrupt,
but my point is just that,

1701
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:41,680
that is not at all different with trump.

1702
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,830
I mean like if you like the corruption 
under Obama was.

1703
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,280
I mean,
Obama just went and collected $400,000

1704
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:55,441
for a speech to a Wall Street,
so he's in there just a couple of months

1705
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:56,320
ago,
right?

1706
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,640
Don't they all do that and once they get
out,

1707
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:58,863
bomb is like you're in there,
you preside over the bailouts of the 

1708
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:02,650
banks.
Started under Bush,

1709
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:04,420
but continued under Obama and the big 
ones,

1710
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:06,340
the Fed policy,
which really bailed them out.

1711
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,293
Like you're in there.
You take all this money for your 

1712
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:10,180
campaigns,
you present,

1713
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:11,740
you vote every way that they want you 
to.

1714
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,010
You preside over the biggest profits for
the big bankers.

1715
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:15,903
You put them all around your 
administration and he'd get out and you 

1716
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:19,730
collect your check.
It's like time to get rich now.

1717
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,540
Now some of them one check,
he's going to get a ton of them.

1718
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,010
As you think it's speaking everywhere.

1719
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,821
I mean,
maybe I'm wrong,

1720
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:25,840
right?
I'm being too cynical.

1721
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:28,930
Probably all of those bankers just 
really loved the way Obama speaks.

1722
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:29,590
He's,
I mean,

1723
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,930
he has a great speaker,
but here's my problem.

1724
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,963
That's not why they're paying them.
Hillary Clinton is not a great speaker 

1725
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,393
and they paid her shit tons of money and
that was one of the things that Bernie 

1726
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:40,180
said,
we're the transcripts and you know,

1727
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:42,010
what a transcript.
And of course,

1728
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,180
uh,
she didn't,

1729
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:47,140
but wikileaks did get their hands on one
of them in which she said something that

1730
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,003
kind of indicated why she didn't release
the transcripts because she actually 

1731
01:16:50,321 --> 01:16:53,320
said I'm lying to the public.
I mean,

1732
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,154
not literally,
but she basically said to all these 

1733
01:16:55,271 --> 01:16:57,190
bankers to not be concerned about 
because,

1734
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:58,810
you know,
she hurt public rhetoric at the time was

1735
01:16:58,811 --> 01:16:59,644
like,
you know,

1736
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:02,320
no one's too big to fail,
no banker too big to jail.

1737
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,393
And then she basically said to them in 
this speech that wikileaks leak to the 

1738
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:07,510
transcript of where she was like,
you know,

1739
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,130
you have to take one public and then 
hold

1740
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,963
a different position in private.
So she was basically assuring know that 

1741
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:14,683
that's an unaltered now.
I mean it's kind of like the same way 

1742
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,224
that we,
we know that all of the emails are 

1743
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,920
legit,
like they've been presented.

1744
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:24,980
Even the Clintons aren't arguing that 
there are legitimate.

1745
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:25,823
Like nobody's really coming out and 
arguing that they're not legitimate and 

1746
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:28,874
it,
and it seems too big from a legitimate 

1747
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:31,184
site.
Julian assange is sort of shifting over 

1748
01:17:33,591 --> 01:17:35,870
time,
paying more and more aggressive,

1749
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,940
like his,
his position on things.

1750
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,910
He's more,
he's more aggressive,

1751
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:40,783
more leaning one way.
I think he's bummed out that he's still 

1752
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:45,350
stuck over there.
I mean,

1753
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:47,510
it's rotting him away.
Sure.

1754
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:49,340
But I think he's been kind of 
consistent.

1755
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:50,174
It's almost like everybody else,
like changing their of like I feel like 

1756
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:56,570
the Democrats to me and the people who 
follow them and the trump haters,

1757
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,120
it's like insane how much they've 
changed their possessions.

1758
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,063
Like to me,
Julian assange was exposing all this 

1759
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:02,054
bullshit under Bush.
He exposes all the shit about Clinton 

1760
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:05,270
and Obama.
And it was like,

1761
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,350
yeah,
from my perspective,

1762
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:07,184
they're all part of the same network.
So he's kind of exposing the same 

1763
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,184
network.
Whereas the Democrats became cold 

1764
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:13,130
warriors,
like,

1765
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,930
like the Democrats.
As soon as trump got in,

1766
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,071
it's like,
well,

1767
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:19,070
everything was CIA is taken without any 
evidence being project,

1768
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:19,701
uh,
presented.

1769
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:21,440
And Russia is the evil threat of our 
time.

1770
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:22,274
And like when did you go,
you guys became Republicans from the 

1771
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:27,040
seventies,
like just that quickly and then every.

1772
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:30,170
I even saw somebody today,
like it's like the trump haters,

1773
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:31,603
like again,
feel however you feel about trump hatim 

1774
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,760
sure.
Go ahead and be against.

1775
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:35,361
I,
like I said,

1776
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:36,194
I think it's terrible that he's telling 
st people should be fired for speaking 

1777
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:40,160
up.
Like that's ridiculous.

1778
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,230
But I say these guys who are like,
they're like,

1779
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:43,030
oh,
you want,

1780
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,080
you know,
you want to talk about patriotism and,

1781
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:47,540
and like bashing trump for being a draft
dodger.

1782
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,840
He wants.
He dodged it a ton of.

1783
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:56,210
If you did whatever you did to stay out 
of the Vietnam War,

1784
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,480
God bless you.
God bless you for staying away from that

1785
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:02,390
fucking nightmare.
That was started on a lie.

1786
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:06,260
That was like the most disgusting mass 
slaughter for profit.

1787
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,283
I mean like if someone avoided that,
like you're mad at him for avoiding 

1788
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:14,140
going and killing some fucking poor 
people in Southeast Asia.

1789
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:14,974
But it's just the point that they could 
grab him on the hypocrisy of being a 

1790
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:19,880
chicken hawk.
Like same as Dick Cheney.

1791
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:22,520
They did it with him as well,
but it's not because he is at,

1792
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:23,354
look,
I'm all for hitting someone for 

1793
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:26,090
hypocrisy,
like if you're advocating a war,

1794
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:27,800
hitting them on not wanting to fight a 
war,

1795
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:28,783
but you're just mad at him for not being
on the same side of yours about police 

1796
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:32,150
brutality.

1797
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,600
It's like finding out his character,
pointing out who he is.

1798
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,463
Fine,
but don't abandon all of your principle 

1799
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,773
guy.
He's not like JFK went over and fought 

1800
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:42,350
in the war.
I get what you're saying,

1801
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:43,184
but I don't think there's.
I'm just saying if the left is going to 

1802
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:45,434
say to me,
it's kind of abandoning your own 

1803
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:48,230
principles.
If you're going to bash someone for like

1804
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:52,310
a not fighting in the Vietnam war,
you kind of know what they're doing.

1805
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:53,144
They all do that.
They try to find something that you did 

1806
01:19:54,391 --> 01:19:56,780
that's kind of questionable that they 
can politicize.

1807
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,750
Yes.
No,

1808
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,570
I get it.
I'm just making the same thing with like

1809
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:01,520
the Democrats becoming the Cold War.
It's just like,

1810
01:20:01,521 --> 01:20:02,420
yeah,
so whatever windows,

1811
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:03,254
whatever gets you points.
What really gets me with the Democrats 

1812
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,190
with the left is how all of a sudden 
Julian size is a puppet

1813
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,700
of Russia now,
like for the longest time Wiki leaks was

1814
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:16,730
supposed to be the voice of honesty.
This not,

1815
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:17,803
you know,
non bipartisan sorta or bipartisan 

1816
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,153
openminded group that's just trying to 
disseminate information they think is 

1817
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:28,470
critical to the American people that 
they're being denied.

1818
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,240
Like the casual,
would it called casualties?

1819
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:37,650
What was that one video that they had?
There was a v,

1820
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:40,140
one of the first videos was,
I forget what they called it,

1821
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:45,440
but they had a footage from one of those
gunships when those helicopters and they

1822
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,054
showed these guys sort of casually 
talking about gunning down these 

1823
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:51,144
reporters.
They thought these reporters are 

1824
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:54,990
carrying guns and so they just opened 
fire on them and gunned him down,

1825
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:55,824
including lunch.

1826
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,230
I forget what it was called,
I forget,

1827
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:05,760
but that sort of like they.
They felt like they had some information

1828
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,683
that people weren't aware of.
They weren't allowed to see photos of 

1829
01:21:08,461 --> 01:21:10,560
caskets.
They weren't allowed to get the full.

1830
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,883
They weren't allowed to have a really 
informed opinion and what exactly is 

1831
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:18,600
happening there and when they see the 
horrors of war in that regard,

1832
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:19,434
like we see people like sort of casually
talking about gunning down some people 

1833
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,503
and I think there are kids in their car 
and well they shouldn't have brought 

1834
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,590
kids.
You know,

1835
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,970
that was one of the things they had 
said.

1836
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:28,410
Like that whole thing was like,
Whoa,

1837
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,060
we are better off knowing that this is 
what can happen if you just allow people

1838
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:36,150
to just go to war.
And especially some really ambiguous war

1839
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:38,130
on terror.
That's what wikileaks did for,

1840
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,580
right?
Qliq stood for Chelsea Manning,

1841
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,200
AK Bradley Manning,
you know,

1842
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,183
releasing this information.
Someone who is under a lot of people's 

1843
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:47,641
eyes,
a patriot,

1844
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:48,920
right?
A whistleblower.

1845
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:51,300
See something gets a hold of some stuff 
and it's like,

1846
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:52,134
look,
you guys got to see this and gives it 

1847
01:21:53,911 --> 01:21:57,150
out to wikileaks,
but try to give it out to other people.

1848
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:57,870
Right?
Didn't,

1849
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:01,080
didn't he try or she tried to believe 
New York time?

1850
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:04,180
I believe so I got rejected it and then 
out into the same thing.

1851
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,210
And then uh,
you know,

1852
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,610
Chelsea Manning,
Bradley manning at the time,

1853
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,013
paid quite a price for it,
I think 200 days in solitary 

1854
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:16,930
confinement.
This is a really brutal price.

1855
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,460
Um,
and yeah,

1856
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,680
and exposed a ton of really interesting 
stuff.

1857
01:22:20,681 --> 01:22:21,070
I mean,
we,

1858
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:23,800
what we learned from the Bradley Manning
Dump,

1859
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:24,851
what's,
you know,

1860
01:22:24,851 --> 01:22:25,684
like all this crazy shit about war 
crimes and then like we learned about 

1861
01:22:28,931 --> 01:22:29,764
how there were like a,
like US officials trying to influence 

1862
01:22:34,721 --> 01:22:38,580
the British parliament,
trying to influence a reporters and just

1863
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,810
all that shady shit that came out.
Um,

1864
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,913
and then again it becomes this kind of 
like integrity test for the mainstream 

1865
01:22:44,651 --> 01:22:46,450
media or they just have no interest in 
it.

1866
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,560
I mean,
if they talk about it,

1867
01:22:47,561 --> 01:22:50,170
they'll talk about Chelsea manning.
But that's the story.

1868
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,420
The same snowden's the story.
None of it's ever like,

1869
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:53,343
Oh shit,
we learned some crazy shit that's going 

1870
01:22:54,821 --> 01:22:56,560
on.
Well that's what we are.

1871
01:22:56,561 --> 01:22:57,520
We're a nation of gossip,
awesome.

1872
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,620
Copper next historic,
not Puerto Rico.

1873
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:00,993
You know,
a guy not standing up with his hand in 

1874
01:23:03,461 --> 01:23:06,070
the correct position that lets know that
we are

1875
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,173
all on one mindset,
that guy is more important and even 

1876
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,194
within that context and a lot of people 
like and this is where there's this 

1877
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:13,684
weird disconnect between like there's 
like the mainstream media and then all 

1878
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:17,374
of the alternative Internet media and 
there's certainly a ton of bullshit in 

1879
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:20,944
the alternative Internet media world and
a lot of just straight up false stories 

1880
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,073
short,
but then there are people also talking 

1881
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:27,004
about the truth there.
Whereas none of that seems to enter the 

1882
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:30,100
mainstream media.
So what doesn't.

1883
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,530
What gets brought up online and in the 
alternative media,

1884
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:34,540
which should be at the center of this 
story,

1885
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,500
is that like,
like the the players didn't use to be on

1886
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,940
the field for the national anthem.
For the vast majority.

1887
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,793
It was 2009 or 2010.
The Defense Department cuts these huge 

1888
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:45,724
checks to the nfl and then all of a 
sudden they get the players out on the 

1889
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:49,990
field so we can do this whole tribute 
thing.

1890
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:50,913
And the military industrial complex has 
been like working on taking this past 

1891
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:55,750
time,
the number one sport in America,

1892
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,673
which is already pretty like warring and
making sure we can use this as 

1893
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:02,610
propaganda to get Americans,
you know,

1894
01:24:02,611 --> 01:24:05,350
into this nationalistic pro military 
mindset.

1895
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,450
I like no.
Are you a journalist?

1896
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:09,760
Like how are you not interested in that?
How is it,

1897
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:10,623
how can Obama sign into the national 
defense authorization act that he has 

1898
01:24:13,691 --> 01:24:17,740
the right to detain American citizens 
with no charges?

1899
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,640
And it's like,
okay,

1900
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,100
like Alex Jones is over here.
And like,

1901
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:23,200
yeah,
I know he says some wild stuff,

1902
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,720
but he is making a big deal about this.
Like this is crazy.

1903
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,820
And then the mainstream media just 
doesn't think it's a big story.

1904
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:28,953
How is it possible that you're a 
journalist in honest journalist with 

1905
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:34,210
integrity and you don't think it's a big
store?

1906
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,850
You don't look at that and go,
well that's the story of my lifetime.

1907
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:37,983
Obama just repealed habeas corpus.
Don't you think it's the exact same 

1908
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:44,030
thing as what we were talking about with
people in academia and on the left,

1909
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:47,710
don't look at things that are in 
opposition to the group.

1910
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:49,190
Think of their ideology.
I think it's,

1911
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,420
it's a lot of that and it's like this 
thing where it's like there's this,

1912
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,493
it's almost like unspoken,
unwritten pressure where you just kinda 

1913
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:56,831
know.
It's like,

1914
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:57,664
right,
you have this herd mentality and you 

1915
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:01,570
know,
if I step out here I get bashed and most

1916
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,850
people don't want to get bashed.
Like,

1917
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:04,684
you know,
you were talking about the people who 

1918
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:08,140
are professors and and they're certainly
very,

1919
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:09,290
very smart people.
Lots of very,

1920
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,890
very smart people.
But it is a certain personality type,

1921
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:12,900
you know?
It's like that,

1922
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,733
that,
that person who like that you go to 

1923
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:15,550
school your whole life.

1924
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:18,280
Then you go to college,
then you go to Grad school,

1925
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,770
then you teach and you basically just 
been in college your whole life.

1926
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,633
Did you see that video?
That woman at the Berkeley protests 

1927
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:26,890
where she's screaming at the cops 
fucking yes.

1928
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,733
Yes.
Screaming in the.

1929
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,410
Yes.
See if you can find her,

1930
01:25:29,411 --> 01:25:30,244
because that is a social retard.
That's what she's asking them to go 

1931
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,790
arrest people inside.
They're Nazis and these are the types of

1932
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:40,050
people who never got into into like,
look,

1933
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,040
there's socially retarded.
I mean,

1934
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:45,220
that's really literally what it is.
They never competed in the real world.

1935
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:49,060
They didn't formulate a normal 
psychological outlook.

1936
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:49,780
Yeah,
but there's.

1937
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:50,650
Okay,
so there's that,

1938
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,980
that woman who you're talking about and,
and,

1939
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:54,410
and Oh yeah,
she is whatever,

1940
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:55,630
whatever,
the scientology,

1941
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,493
whatever the top level is.
I'm saying that it's left wing level 

1942
01:25:58,541 --> 01:25:59,374
five.
You've achieved the height of those 

1943
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:04,050
people are literally mentally disturbed.
People like these

1944
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:04,560
are.
Yeah,

1945
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,140
laser.
This is a woman with video's gone.

1946
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,650
It impossible.
Well,

1947
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,750
this one has to go to four Chan.
So fine.

1948
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,510
If I don't believe those geniuses at 
four.

1949
01:26:12,511 --> 01:26:14,740
Chan haven't kept this job,
but this is,

1950
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:15,613
she's at level five with like trigger 
puff and those who like yelled out for 

1951
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:21,164
more muscle Missouri state.
These are like the maximum level and 

1952
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:28,040
most of those people are made up of like
genuinely disturbed people.

1953
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,200
Here she goes,
here,

1954
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:30,890
can we get some volume on this crazy 
bitch?

1955
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,050
Do you work for Devin?

1956
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,550
Wasn't that at Milo's rally?
Which is hilarious.

1957
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:51,900
I think this was Gavin.
Could you say proud boys is getting your

1958
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:55,190
proud boys a boy.
She might work for his marketing.

1959
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,190
That's like the best branding.
She's still going.

1960
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:59,780
We shut it off,
but she's still going.

1961
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:03,950
I'm a fucking professor.
How dare you so much make a t shirt.

1962
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,990
From my perspective,
I'm a fucking professor.

1963
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:06,824
How dare you.
I've a professor is not what you 

1964
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:11,270
expected.
The next line's fucking professor.

1965
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:15,020
How dare you so well,
but also from my perspective,

1966
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:16,910
like as a libertarian,
you just look at that and you're like,

1967
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:17,744
wow,
what a naked like example of you just 

1968
01:28:19,191 --> 01:28:20,024
calling the state,
calling the authority of the state 

1969
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:25,340
because you believe this ridiculous 
microaggressive aggression.

1970
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:25,870
Like,
well,

1971
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:30,870
just look at her the way she's behaving 
and that's not a balance,

1972
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,083
but ilt person.
What I was describing with the college 

1973
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:36,670
professor,
I wasn't talking about those people like

1974
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:37,543
that's level five disturbed is that top 
people will change you like belt in 

1975
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:42,040
Jujitsu.
That's.

1976
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,880
That's like,
it's not even like that.

1977
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,100
Not even black belt.
That's like next next level.

1978
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:47,060
Like you're tapped out.
Yeah.

1979
01:28:47,061 --> 01:28:47,894
You tap out black belts,
coral and then red belt is like Noam 

1980
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:51,440
Chomsky,
red belt,

1981
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,750
right.
Written Chomsky's,

1982
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,593
a red belt.
Noam Chomsky is actually like an 

1983
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:55,964
intellectual.
I don't want to lump them in with these 

1984
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:58,330
top of right.
He,

1985
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,110
but he is talking to the top of the food
chain,

1986
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:02,040
left wing ideologies,
but this is like

1987
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,590
some Hixon Gracie Shit,
but these,

1988
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,010
these people,
she's more retarded.

1989
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,030
She's more of a Kung Fu person.
She's got ineffective martial arts.

1990
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:09,893
She's got some shit,
some shit that doesn't even really work 

1991
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:12,643
for work.
She's trying to get people with that 

1992
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:16,440
cheat.
Touched was like a guy with like just an

1993
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:17,274
overhand right.
Could probably take you if like you'd 

1994
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,330
like to see her.
Like in an MMA fight with Cyborg.

1995
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:23,970
She actually would believe that she had 
this.

1996
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,340
Cheese is still the most amazing.
There's still to me,

1997
01:29:27,341 --> 01:29:28,174
nothing better.
I know you've got over a bunch of near 

1998
01:29:29,361 --> 01:29:30,194
Shell before,
but there's nothing better to me than 

1999
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:34,290
someone really believing in a martial 
art that doesn't work and finding out in

2000
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,124
a fight modular doesn't know.
It was amazing through the early UFC is 

2001
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:39,030
when it used to happen.
It'll still,

2002
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:40,540
you'll find internet videos that have 
it,

2003
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:44,640
but it's still going on in 2016 and 17 
has been some of the best videos ever,

2004
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:46,980
especially at China where they had that.

2005
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:47,993
One guy had to go into hiding.
He brained some fucking poor slob that 

2006
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:53,880
thought he knew Kung Fu.
You know some dude really thought he was

2007
01:29:53,881 --> 01:29:55,020
going to cheat,
touch this guy,

2008
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:58,020
and he got he this Chinese kid who knows
mma,

2009
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:02,310
fuck this guy up and had to go into 
hiding because so many people are mad at

2010
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:03,144
him for using martial arts techniques 
that did not originate in China to sort 

2011
01:30:07,441 --> 01:30:09,770
of denigrate Chinese martial arts,
man.

2012
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,730
Yeah.
Myth versus reality.

2013
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,833
What's interesting,
they are fighting against the exposing 

2014
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:20,310
of their bullshit nonsensical fucking 
tiger claws.

2015
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:21,144
Shit like.
And you've got an entire identity 

2016
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,223
associated with this being real me.
And want the guy who did is also 

2017
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:26,034
Chinese,
so China is apparently like Asia in 

2018
01:30:28,491 --> 01:30:29,324
particular is where a lot of the martial
arts techniques that people use today 

2019
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:32,843
originated and they were sort of adapted
and they were changed and they evolved 

2020
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,580
particularly in Thailand.

2021
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:42,990
They really started understanding how to
kick the legs and they became masters at

2022
01:30:42,991 --> 01:30:43,824
using the elbows and the knees more so 
than and they did it through 

2023
01:30:46,351 --> 01:30:48,120
competition,
which is really quite fascinating.

2024
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,013
They did it through gambling and by 
having these competitions on a regular 

2025
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:55,560
basis where people will like nine,
10 years old,

2026
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:58,620
they start fighting and they fight.
They might have hundreds and hundreds of

2027
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:00,360
fights in their career by the time they 
retire.

2028
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,260
They developed a real acute 
understanding of what actually works and

2029
01:31:04,261 --> 01:31:07,590
what doesn't work.
Whereas these other worlds,

2030
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,040
they didn't do that.
They didn't have.

2031
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:13,110
They weren't like this small island is 
filled with hedonists that are gambling,

2032
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,350
kicking each other in the legs and 
betting on the guy kicking the guy.

2033
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:19,860
That's really what develop that art.
But then there's other ones that sort of

2034
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:24,861
stayed in this non evolved state.
And then as the material sort of got out

2035
01:31:25,111 --> 01:31:28,230
to all of the world and people started 
to evolve into techniques,

2036
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:31,500
it all coalesced together in the 
ultimate fighting championship.

2037
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,520
And then we realized,
okay,

2038
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:35,760
it's a combination of these things 
doesn't necessarily always work on every

2039
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:36,594
individual and styles sort of straddles 
sort of determined interactions and 

2040
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:44,970
athletes determined whether or not 
something is effective or ineffective as

2041
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:45,804
much as the technique itself,
the athleticism and speed and power of 

2042
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:48,834
the practitioner is very important,
but all told these are the things that 

2043
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:55,470
we think are pretty effective.
These are the standard techniques.

2044
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,120
Yeah,
the new information.

2045
01:31:57,121 --> 01:31:59,220
But you figure out pretty quickly like,
okay,

2046
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,620
like wrestling and you know,
crane kicks are not the same thing.

2047
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,753
One guy used Western boxing techniques 
and Moy Tai and wrestling and Jujitsu 

2048
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:11,260
and just beat the holy fuck or this 
poor.

2049
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:14,830
I mean did it like 10 seconds,
beat the holy fuck out of this poor Kung

2050
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:15,940
Fu guy.
And then he had to go into hiding.

2051
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:17,853
People didn't want to know.
They didn't want to know this is white 

2052
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:21,130
power,
white power.

2053
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,400
The white power guy goes in there and 
gets fucking merch by Anthony.

2054
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:27,340
Joshua Electric Shit.
How is this possible?

2055
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:29,170
Well,
of course it happened.

2056
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:32,230
Did you not know who you were?
Do you not know who he is?

2057
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,240
You know you're,
you're in denial of this.

2058
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:36,520
And so if they all came after Anthony 
Joshua,

2059
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,920
because he beat the shit out of the 
white power boxer.

2060
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:42,100
That's exactly what's going on in China.
It's take watch it here.

2061
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,430
So get this guy who his poor fucking 
dog,

2062
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:45,383
you can just already tell he's got some 
crane technique going on and the kid 

2063
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:51,520
just fuck and starts beating the shit 
out of them.

2064
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,840
Boom,
boom,

2065
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,250
boom,
boom.

2066
01:32:54,251 --> 01:32:57,850
Just fucking pummel him.
Unconscious knuckles to the temple.

2067
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,930
Literally it happens all the like 10,
15 seconds.

2068
01:33:00,931 --> 01:33:04,210
His kid just kicks the shit out of him 
and then after this happens and this guy

2069
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:06,790
who doesn't get hit like he's,
he's never been hit before.

2070
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:07,421
You know what I mean?
Like,

2071
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,560
yeah,
he didn't get hit at all.

2072
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:11,230
He doesn't listen.
He's not used to even like being in this

2073
01:33:11,231 --> 01:33:12,064
situation,
but he must've believed that it was 

2074
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:14,044
going to work.
He must've believed that he was capable 

2075
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:19,920
of fending off attacks.
I agent and he's doing that crazy shit.

2076
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,660
I'm trying to remember in mma,
what was the guy,

2077
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:23,950
I can't remember his name was like some 
really,

2078
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:26,260
really Asian name,
but the dude to fought Nick Diaz.

2079
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,393
You called the fight.
It was like an old nickname aspect 

2080
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:32,050
before he left the website and the guy 
tried this crazy technique.

2081
01:33:32,051 --> 01:33:32,884
He tried like hands out here.
I'm going to block your punches with 

2082
01:33:35,471 --> 01:33:37,930
punches.
It was like a short Asian dude.

2083
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,970
Me and thinking of Tony Ferguson,
I think.

2084
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:42,291
No,
no,

2085
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:42,470
no,
no,

2086
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:43,180
no,
no.

2087
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:46,530
It's 100 percent a nickname called as 
cocoon.

2088
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:48,960
You called it and I remember you being 
there.

2089
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,793
I remember you saying during the thing 
you were like you say before the fight 

2090
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:52,840
you go,
this is really weird.

2091
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:53,703
He was doing this stuff before,
like in the octagon warmup and it comes 

2092
01:33:56,351 --> 01:33:57,460
out like doing it and you're like,
okay,

2093
01:33:57,461 --> 01:33:59,560
he's going to try to fight Nick Diaz 
with this weird stuff.

2094
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,453
Like where he's trying to,
whatever it's doing like this kind of 

2095
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,903
like,
like style of trying to block by like 

2096
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,450
hitting their hands with your hands.
Way Out.

2097
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,490
Pull up.
Nick Diaz is a record.

2098
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,350
I'm,
I'm remembering.

2099
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:15,790
I'm Tony Ferguson fighting this guy 
who's a bad motherfucker and pride.

2100
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,200
And His name is cocooned.
No.

2101
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:20,910
And he used to fight like that.
Pull up Tony Ferguson's record me.

2102
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,830
See if he could find that video.
Tony Ferguson versus cocoon.

2103
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:26,430
Yeah.
It's not.

2104
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,390
I don't think it's he though of that 
fight.

2105
01:34:28,391 --> 01:34:29,500
I don't remember.
I don't remember.

2106
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:30,070
Tony Ferguson.

2107
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,420
He's been around for awhile.
Yeah,

2108
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:36,550
totally lit him up.
So what it was was that cocoon was a guy

2109
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:37,384
that had this crazy kick that he would 
throw to the body and fuck a lot of 

2110
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:41,254
people up with it.
And it was kind of a hybrid between a 

2111
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:46,450
front kick and a roundhouse kick.
Like some people would call it a 45.

2112
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:47,640
Yeah.
Cotsen,

2113
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,870
Nora cocoon.
No.

2114
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,100
And He came out him.
Yeah.

2115
01:34:51,101 --> 01:34:53,410
I think that's the fight you're thinking
of man.

2116
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,650
No,
I'm telling you this guy pull up.

2117
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:58,740
Nick Diaz is one of the ideas.
It's a different guy.

2118
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:02,660
I used to fight like this.
He used to walk forward like this.

2119
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,210
The Guy I was like that it was a similar
type of style,

2120
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,073
but the guy was saying,
but it was like real short too and I 

2121
01:35:07,251 --> 01:35:08,084
mean Nick Diaz just,
it was like the worst guy to fight with 

2122
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:13,670
that style because he's got like real 
Chris boxing so he just came in.

2123
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:18,670
I mean just lit them up like next to his
last fight in his first run in the UFC.

2124
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:21,590
So it's up way before this.
No,

2125
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,503
no,
no,

2126
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,361
no,
I'm sorry.

2127
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:24,081
Down,
down from.

2128
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:28,160
This is down before it's his first run 
in the UFC.

2129
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:34,010
So it's a real maybe before the losses.
Gleason Josh right there.

2130
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:35,720
Right there.
Before Diego Sanchez.

2131
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:36,800
That's it.
Oh,

2132
01:35:36,801 --> 01:35:39,230
that Guy Koji.
Click on it.

2133
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,570
Cogent.
No,

2134
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:43,520
there's no ass there.
Oh yeah.

2135
01:35:43,521 --> 01:35:45,180
Oh he,
she is that he said,

2136
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,780
I think you're right.
Koji.

2137
01:35:46,781 --> 01:35:47,960
Oishi.
Yeah,

2138
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:49,220
maybe.
Oh,

2139
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,740
okay.
Nick Diaz and I remember this kid,

2140
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:54,440
I remember saying this kid looks like 
he's on heroin.

2141
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,830
Like he walked in like,
like almost like in a Zombie state as he

2142
01:35:57,831 --> 01:36:00,920
walked into the octagon.
It was really strange.

2143
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,520
Just click on that right there.
That's me.

2144
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,050
This is a different.
Is it neat?

2145
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,700
Yeah.
And then this was in the UFC,

2146
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:11,570
but it's the vine of it.

2147
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:12,403
Is there?
I don't know.

2148
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:14,380
I guess they both thought,
yeah,

2149
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,283
this is the fight I'm talking about.
He's trying to do this openhanded weird 

2150
01:36:17,741 --> 01:36:19,650
thing and it's just.
Oh Nick,

2151
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:24,660
just by eating them online.
I mean,

2152
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:27,470
uh,
I'm sure it's on the UFC.

2153
01:36:27,471 --> 01:36:29,630
See if he could find Tony Ferguson 
versus cocoon.

2154
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:31,460
No,
that's a weird one because cocoon.

2155
01:36:31,461 --> 01:36:32,750
Oh,
he had this weird style,

2156
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:33,584
like almost like a car,
like you would think of as a guy who 

2157
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,180
knows karate,
like move forward,

2158
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,050
like standing like totally square,
not sideways,

2159
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:43,093
like moving forward in this weird way.
And he would throw this kick and it 

2160
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:48,890
wasn't a front kick up the middle.
It was like an angled front kick.

2161
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:51,860
So he hit you with the ball was foot,
but you throw it like a roundhouse kick,

2162
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:56,000
which was one of the ways that they used
to do that in the old taekwondo way too.

2163
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:59,150
They would make impact with the ball of 
the foot with a roundhouse kick,

2164
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:02,360
like they would throw a kick.
Like I got a book when I was a kid about

2165
01:37:02,361 --> 01:37:03,194
taekwondo techniques and this one old 
dude would practice in the park by 

2166
01:37:06,831 --> 01:37:10,790
kicking trees and the way he would kick 
trees with the ball of his foot.

2167
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:14,720
He throw a roundhouse kick and kick the 
ball of his foot into the tree.

2168
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,220
And it was.
It was really funny,

2169
01:37:16,221 --> 01:37:17,054
but because in one,
one of the things where you described 

2170
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:20,064
all various self defense techniques,
he described what to do if you ever 

2171
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:25,370
threatened by someone and one thing you 
should do is kick a tree.

2172
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:29,330
So show them like if you kick a tree,
what you could do to them.

2173
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:30,863
It's probably an actually bad advice.
It's just to break your leg and then 

2174
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,120
I'll just kick a tree.

2175
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:34,900
You know what I'm saying?
Like if,

2176
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:38,000
if you're not used to getting countries,
see if you can back that up,

2177
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,130
CV,
back it up.

2178
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:41,700
But that's,
it's only a ten second view.

2179
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,593
Oh,
okay.

2180
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:44,850
Cocoon was a,
hey,

2181
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:49,790
this is also another one of those guys 
were go let that play.

2182
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,500
Play out.
A little video you were just showing.

2183
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:55,860
He was one of those guys that was in a 
shit ton of fights.

2184
01:37:55,861 --> 01:37:56,694
So see that was,
that was back when he was competing and 

2185
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:00,270
karate.
I think that's Keoki.

2186
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,260
Yeah.
Keoki Shin.

2187
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:05,490
And so they fought with yogesh and 
outfits on,

2188
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,960
but they had an MMA fight and the guy 
who was a,

2189
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:14,100
the referee was dressed up in a fucking 
weird sort of geisha outfit.

2190
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:16,970
Like what the fuck's that guy wearing?
But cocoon.

2191
01:38:16,971 --> 01:38:17,804
Oh,
was a like sort of a classic Japanese 

2192
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:20,760
martial arts.
Stryker.

2193
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:21,870
That's,
that's him right there.

2194
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:22,733
Okay.
And you got to think by the time these 

2195
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:25,884
guys got to the UFC,
they had been trained so many fucking 

2196
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:31,230
times,
especially fighting in pride and k one.

2197
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,690
Oh Shit.
Boom.

2198
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:36,030
Front kick to the body.
Right hand.

2199
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,590
That's a wrap.
That was due.

2200
01:38:37,591 --> 01:38:40,000
Dude is fucked.
Check this out again,

2201
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:40,950
man.
Watch how I do this.

2202
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:43,890
Just steps.
It was a different fight.

2203
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,383
Aau Tournament probably,
which is really crazy that these guys 

2204
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:51,384
would do this more than one time a day,
but that was what they did in pride a 

2205
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:54,930
lot.
Oh,

2206
01:38:54,931 --> 01:38:57,210
he just threw them off the top of the 
Mat and pride.

2207
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:58,044
They would fight several times a day 
early UFC is as well and then it like 

2208
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:04,110
eventually I think they started 
realizing like a lot of guys get injured

2209
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:04,944
doing this.
The craziest ideas like that stupid 

2210
01:39:06,391 --> 01:39:09,780
movie warrior when they fought more than
one time in a week,

2211
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,990
like they fought once and they fought 
again the next day.

2212
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:12,863
That's got to be worse than the same day
probably because you're like all the 

2213
01:39:14,671 --> 01:39:16,710
soreness that like comes in two days 
later.

2214
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:17,603
Your fucking face is all swollen.
You can't say you have to have 

2215
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:22,140
sunglasses everywhere.
You definitely can't take a punch.

2216
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:24,630
Like the whole idea is so stupid and 
they don't do that.

2217
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:27,360
I mean maybe they've done that a couple 
of times throughout history,

2218
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,470
but that's not a standard thing in this 
movie warrior.

2219
01:39:30,471 --> 01:39:31,304
They,
they just added their own Hollywood 

2220
01:39:32,191 --> 01:39:33,380
judges to the suit,
be like,

2221
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:36,050
let me just change it.
You're going to fight for the flavor,

2222
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:40,440
and then the next day I'll grabbed my 
balls.

2223
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:42,003
That's what they did.
They added their own stupidity to it 

2224
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,133
just didn't even make any sense.
And it was totally unnecessary like 

2225
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:49,110
that.
That's you can't,

2226
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,123
you're changing what martial arts are 
just to fit your narrative because 

2227
01:39:53,341 --> 01:39:54,300
you're not a good writer.

2228
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,880
Like if you,
if you were a good writer,

2229
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,510
you would write about how it actually 
happens and you'd make a story about how

2230
01:40:00,511 --> 01:40:03,870
it actually happens.
You wouldn't create some fake thing that

2231
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:08,100
you can do.
So be several times in a day,

2232
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:10,800
twice,
two days in a row you'd be fucking meat.

2233
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,350
Well,
it's just give them super powers at this

2234
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:15,030
point.
Just give him like guns and stuff.

2235
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:16,640
If you're listening to John Claude van 
Damme,

2236
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:18,400
you got to decide what you are.
Are you,

2237
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,273
uh,
an excellent dramatic movie with Nick 

2238
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,430
Nolte and Tom,
what the fuck's his name?

2239
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:25,560
Who was another guy?
The fuck's his name?

2240
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,091
No,
no,

2241
01:40:26,091 --> 01:40:26,491
no,
no.

2242
01:40:26,491 --> 01:40:29,340
How dare you?
The young guy who's a Bain,

2243
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,660
Tom Hardy,
Tom Hardy,

2244
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:32,390
that motherfucker is amazing,
right?

2245
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,530
It's him and Nick Nolte mean they're 
amazing,

2246
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:35,573
but yet they put it in this stupid plot 
idea where they have to fight in two 

2247
01:40:37,891 --> 01:40:38,491
days.
Like,

2248
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,560
come on,
just come on.

2249
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,543
It's like it's,
it's annoying because it's like you're 

2250
01:40:42,421 --> 01:40:43,254
making this world real and then you're 
doing something that's just my little 

2251
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:46,703
ridiculous.
Yeah.

2252
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:49,800
World where I work,
so it makes me buy like super offended.

2253
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:50,873
I'm super excited.
It makes it impossible for someone like 

2254
01:40:52,201 --> 01:40:54,220
you to.
Because it's like if anyone

2255
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,770
who knows fighting Canada,
which by the way I will say,

2256
01:40:56,771 --> 01:40:58,300
and I do,
even when we talk about old school,

2257
01:40:58,301 --> 01:40:59,320
UFC,
there's something like that.

2258
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,840
Like I'm nostalgic for it.
I know you can't have it now.

2259
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:04,570
It has to be the sport it is now and 
it's evolved way past there,

2260
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:05,493
but there was just something so cool 
about the old ufc and there was 

2261
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:08,674
something about the conor versus floyd 
fight that almost gave you that feeling 

2262
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:16,870
again of like these two guys from 
different worlds going in there and like

2263
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:17,704
how does this look like?
How does a guy who doing mma striking 

2264
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:22,810
and fucking doing like capital Ada stuff
on the side,

2265
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,833
how does he go in there and buck and 
that it turned out connor actually it 

2266
01:41:25,811 --> 01:41:26,411
was just like,
oh no,

2267
01:41:26,411 --> 01:41:28,210
you got a box,
can't do any of that stuff.

2268
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:28,930
Get destroyed.

2269
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:31,390
So I just went out there and boxed and.
But it was an interesting.

2270
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,253
Like I came out of it.
I was arguing with a lot of friends of 

2271
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:36,610
mine were like big boxing fans,
nothing against you guys.

2272
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,473
God bless boxing.
I'm not like as big a fan as I used to 

2273
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:41,140
bake.
I'm a huge MMA fan,

2274
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,870
but I just can't.
Like when you look at mma,

2275
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:46,490
the way you look at mma is like the 
sport of fighting and,

2276
01:41:46,491 --> 01:41:47,324
and the original thing was always 
figuring out who's better at fighting 

2277
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:50,104
and have these does.
It was just hard for me to not look at 

2278
01:41:51,971 --> 01:41:56,971
the fight with conor and floyd and go 
like,

2279
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:58,323
you know,
it's like when there was the first 

2280
01:41:58,571 --> 01:41:59,404
Clinton I,
Louis j Gomez said this to me is the 

2281
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:02,770
first clinch of the fight.
He goes,

2282
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:04,420
well,
that's where connor would destroy him.

2283
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:05,693
Yeah,
and then you just sit there watching 10 

2284
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:10,510
rounds of of a referee,
saving floyd mayweather's life.

2285
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,360
Like every few seconds the referee comes
in and goes,

2286
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:14,230
Oh,
let me save your life.

2287
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:16,750
Don't let me save your life.
I know you're the greatest effort this,

2288
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:19,750
but you need even under your rules with 
your gloves and your this,

2289
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:20,763
you need a ref to keep coming in and 
saving your life every few seconds and 

2290
01:42:23,531 --> 01:42:25,940
you'd see it like every time they they 
clenched.

2291
01:42:25,941 --> 01:42:26,774
Like connor would immediately almost 
just instinctually just kind of take us 

2292
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:30,154
back and like step over here because 
right here is where I can hit you and 

2293
01:42:32,681 --> 01:42:35,080
you can't hit.
It would just cover up and bend over.

2294
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:38,020
Like literally bend over,
guy come saved my life buddy.

2295
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:40,540
And it's just hard to not watch that and
go,

2296
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:41,770
Oh,
if he wanted to,

2297
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:43,600
he would jump on his back and choke them
to death.

2298
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,820
And even in Europe,
even in your sport,

2299
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:49,220
like he went 10 rounds and okay,
I know mayweather.

2300
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:51,460
I know what may,
whether did was brilliant and he dragged

2301
01:42:51,461 --> 01:42:53,320
him in,
he played it safe and perfectly,

2302
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,333
but it wasn't a part of the plan to eat 
that upper cut on the chin that 

2303
01:42:56,081 --> 01:42:57,970
definitely wasn't a part of the planet.
And,

2304
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:01,940
and also I think there's boxers punch a 
lot harder than MMA guys do and there's,

2305
01:43:01,941 --> 01:43:02,774
there's truth to that too.
So Connor's power didn't translate in 

2306
01:43:05,021 --> 01:43:08,770
the way that MMA fans thought it would,
but he's just not quite as fluid.

2307
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:10,990
And also I think he was probably very 
nervous.

2308
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:12,243
I mean he's fighting literally the 
greatest fighter of all time and his 

2309
01:43:14,171 --> 01:43:17,950
first professional boxing match.
It's so crazy.

2310
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:20,440
And yet he's still got it to the 10th 
round it flow.

2311
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:20,850
I mean,
I,

2312
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:21,683
this is why I said I said I gave her a 
very small chance of winning a boxing 

2313
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,011
match,
very small.

2314
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:27,844
So I thought it was like 94 percent that
floyd would beat the shit out of Canada 

2315
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,373
the way he did.
And the economy would eventually get 

2316
01:43:34,061 --> 01:43:36,010
tired.
Like the guy who did the best assessment

2317
01:43:36,011 --> 01:43:36,844
of it,
uh,

2318
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:38,890
in my opinion was John,
John Donahoe.

2319
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:41,740
John Danaher,
who's a brilliant Jujitsu coach,

2320
01:43:41,741 --> 01:43:44,590
is also brilliant mma coach because get 
a deep understanding of it.

2321
01:43:44,591 --> 01:43:47,740
He basically spelled out exactly what's 
going to happen because of all the times

2322
01:43:47,741 --> 01:43:52,220
he's seen a boxer's sparring with elite 
martial artists that the mixed martial

2323
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,053
arts does well for a few rounds because 
it takes awhile for the box and to 

2324
01:43:55,881 --> 01:43:59,760
figure out the timing and then the 
efficiency and fluidity of the box.

2325
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:00,603
It starts to take over the ring 
generalship the understanding of this 

2326
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,373
one isolated particular discipline and 
then they dominate and that's exactly 

2327
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:07,544
what happened to a it.
What I said is I think there's a 94 

2328
01:44:10,731 --> 01:44:11,564
percent chance that floyd mayweather.
It just boxes the shit out of conor 

2329
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:14,834
Mcgregor.
There is a four percent chance that 

2330
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:17,834
connor catches him with like an apricot 
like it did in the first round and 

2331
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:23,030
actually stuns them and hurts them and 
then swarms on him and takes him out.

2332
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:23,933
Connor has got ferocious power.
It's whether or not he executed that 

2333
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:28,790
power,
like he has an mma,

2334
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:30,980
whether he felt he could drain his gas 
tank like that,

2335
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:32,840
especially with two months worth of 
training,

2336
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,853
not enough,
not enough to get in shape for a 12 

2337
01:44:35,211 --> 01:44:37,250
round boxing match against the greatest 
of all time,

2338
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:42,700
but there was a 100 percent chance that 
connor nukes him in a fucking mma fight.

2339
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:44,793
Nukes him like I would be willing to 
literally 100 [inaudible] Floyd's not 

2340
01:44:48,201 --> 01:44:49,034
going to knock them out with one punch 
and Conecuh kick his fucking legs out 

2341
01:44:51,741 --> 01:44:53,660
from under him before we got even close 
enough to punch them.

2342
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:56,270
And if they did get to a clinch,
which they absolutely would,

2343
01:44:56,271 --> 01:45:00,260
connor would ragdoll him to the ground 
and beat his fucking brains in before he

2344
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:01,490
strangled him.
One hundred percent,

2345
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,380
100 percent.
Even if you just look,

2346
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:04,214
if you just take out even grappling.
I agree with you that I just thought as 

2347
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:10,370
a master of range and he's got excellent
kicks and if he can kick the shit out of

2348
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:11,204
him and stay out of the area where he's 
just stay out of his punching range and 

2349
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,250
kick him in the legs and the body 
believed if he can clench,

2350
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:17,690
if you don't break them up.
When he coaches,

2351
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,910
he show nice the body,
they're done fucked.

2352
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,073
You're fucked in elbows to the head.
He's going to tie you up in the back of 

2353
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:25,340
the head and smash you.
Has that ever happened?

2354
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,030
No.
He's never.

2355
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:27,920
You don't know what the fuck to do when 
a guy's doing that.

2356
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:29,500
You don't know how to deal with those 
needs.

2357
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:30,343
The face like when Anderson Silva fucked
up rich Franklin to win the title when 

2358
01:45:33,101 --> 01:45:33,934
you just plumb the back of his head and 
just start smashing these in his face 

2359
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:38,150
and he was clear that rich really didn't
know.

2360
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:39,043
He didn't have an answer to that,
which was an amazing thing because that 

2361
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:41,894
was one of those moments like everyone 
in the mma world thought rich was the 

2362
01:45:44,211 --> 01:45:45,044
best or not mma world.
Everyone in the UFC world kind of like 

2363
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:49,570
what was the,
because you're.

2364
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:52,400
That's why I correct myself because 
people who knew the MMA scene better and

2365
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:54,440
pride and that stuff knew what Anderson 
Silva was,

2366
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:58,070
but like the average fan of the UFC had 
just been.

2367
01:45:58,190 --> 01:45:59,023
We hadn't really seen Anderson Silva.
I hadn't seen one or two tapes of pride 

2368
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:03,760
and I would say I saw him like maybe 
not.

2369
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:07,010
It's on the one where you got ankle,
ankle locked real quick because I didn't

2370
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:07,844
really know how good Anderson Silva was.
I saw I'd seen him beat Carlos Newton 

2371
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:12,170
and that was like all I had on them,
so I was like,

2372
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:16,280
I have rich Franklin will probably.
Well the third type is the pride fights.

2373
01:46:16,281 --> 01:46:20,570
The thing was when he got out of pride 
and then fighting in a cage wars or cage

2374
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:21,860
warrior,
what the fuck was that?

2375
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:23,990
English.
I remember the one you're talking to the

2376
01:46:23,991 --> 01:46:24,824
organization.
I know that it's an English 

2377
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:28,250
organization.
God dammit.

2378
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:29,593
I want to say cage wars,
but it's not that cage warrior the fuck 

2379
01:46:32,631 --> 01:46:33,464
do they call it?
Anyway,

2380
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:36,590
he went over there and just started 
fucking people you can people.

2381
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,800
So like I hadn't seen any of that,
any of that,

2382
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,643
and I think,
I guess most of UFC fans hadn't seen 

2383
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:43,310
that either and they thought rich 
Franklin is the champ.

2384
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:44,623
Beat up a bunch of guys.
The odds were actually I'm in innocence 

2385
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:47,931
favor though.
Oh,

2386
01:46:47,931 --> 01:46:48,764
what are they?
One of the weird ones where the odds 

2387
01:46:50,641 --> 01:46:52,380
makers,
when he fought Chris Leben,

2388
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:55,590
he was a slight favorite looney his 
first UFC fight and I was like,

2389
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,023
get ready for some crazy shit because 
this motherfucker's on a totally 

2390
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:00,720
different level.
I'm like,

2391
01:47:00,721 --> 01:47:01,554
I knew him.
I'd seen him fight Jorge Rivera and Lee 

2392
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:05,063
Marie.
I saw him hit Tony Ferguson with a step 

2393
01:47:06,511 --> 01:47:10,350
in upper cut elbow that he had practice 
on a pillow at home.

2394
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:11,333
He made his wife hold a pillow and 
practice this technique because he 

2395
01:47:14,051 --> 01:47:14,884
wanted to use it in his fights in as 
coaches wouldn't hold the pads for them 

2396
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:18,000
because they thought it was ridiculous 
and they said,

2397
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:18,570
is this true?

2398
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:19,403
I think I remember hearing this,
but I think it was like in between 

2399
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:22,190
rounds.
He said to one of his coaches,

2400
01:47:22,191 --> 01:47:23,160
he goes,
I think it's open.

2401
01:47:23,161 --> 01:47:23,881
I think it's there.
They were like,

2402
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:25,580
forget about this stupid technique.
Dammit.

2403
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:26,700
Like,
it's not going to be there.

2404
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,080
Uh,
I don't know if that's the case.

2405
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:30,810
You were worried about that.
Fucked up Tony Ferguson before that.

2406
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:32,250
The reason why I was able to get that 
off,

2407
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:34,320
it's because he wasn't turning 21st.
Excuse me.

2408
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:37,510
I'm 20 Franklin.
Tony fryklund sorry,

2409
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:38,970
my apologies.
Twenty percent.

2410
01:47:39,130 --> 01:47:39,963
Um,
he fought Tony Franklin and he hit him 

2411
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:45,570
with the standing,
stepping in upper cut with the elbow and

2412
01:47:45,571 --> 01:47:48,690
he was just like another level,
maybe three,

2413
01:47:48,691 --> 01:47:51,480
four,
five levels above Franklin at the time.

2414
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:53,520
It was just so infrequent,
was a real veteran.

2415
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,240
Franklin was in one of the first.
You have c's that I ever worked in.

2416
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,940
Nineteen 97.
He was there.

2417
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:03,300
And so that was like his debut in the 
UFC.

2418
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:04,134
I was there when he had his debut.
So Anderson was just lightened him on 

2419
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:09,330
fire before he decided to step in an 
upper cut them.

2420
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,000
But I just knew he was on it just such a
different level.

2421
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:16,830
But that was a really important learning
moment for mma because people knew like,

2422
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:17,664
okay,
if you get in a fight and a guy is a 

2423
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:22,320
more Thai practitioner on the level of 
Anderson Silva,

2424
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,650
you better learn how to deal with this 
goddamn clinch.

2425
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:30,860
So here's Anderson versus a Tony 
Franklin and this is Anderson in,

2426
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:31,703
in my opinion,
maybe his prime ever because he hadn't 

2427
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:38,190
taken on all the damage and all the 
crazy fights that he had in the UFC.

2428
01:48:38,191 --> 01:48:42,600
And by the time he got to Chris Weidman,
I mean he was in his thirties.

2429
01:48:42,610 --> 01:48:43,443
He's getting older or his body was 
starting to not perform the way it used 

2430
01:48:46,891 --> 01:48:51,020
to and then obviously he fucked up and 
stood in front of Weidmann,

2431
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:53,070
got left hooked in the head while I was 
clowning them.

2432
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:54,143
Then it's a lot tougher to come back 
when you're 40 now they've taken these 

2433
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:57,354
losses,
but it's time back then was so fucking 

2434
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:02,370
tight and it was just so levels above 
what everyone else was doing.

2435
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:03,670
Oh yeah.
They just did.

2436
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:06,600
Didn't belong in there with them.
Like look how he's moving around.

2437
01:49:06,601 --> 01:49:07,434
Just sort of like feeling out.
Tony trying to find out what Tony's 

2438
01:49:10,141 --> 01:49:12,720
capable of trying to decide when to 
move.

2439
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:17,640
I mean he really is like a spider 
because he's setting up the web and he's

2440
01:49:17,641 --> 01:49:18,474
moving around.
Eventually it's going to sting you and 

2441
01:49:19,651 --> 01:49:23,520
you know it's come in and you know by 
the time you're moving at him,

2442
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:24,451
look at that.
Boom.

2443
01:49:24,451 --> 01:49:25,284
One,
two starts kicking you and now he's 

2444
01:49:26,251 --> 01:49:27,720
coming after you.
Oh Shit Bitch.

2445
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:30,930
Now you know there's a big difference 
between the two of you and it just feels

2446
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:32,790
like even if you don't know anything 
about fighting,

2447
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:35,460
you just know there's levels here.
Like you can just see it.

2448
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,720
Everything he does in this fight,
it's like fucking picture perfect.

2449
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:43,560
He steps in and look at this beautiful 
Thai clinch clenched his,

2450
01:49:43,570 --> 01:49:46,650
his control of the neck and head was 
spectacular.

2451
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:47,580
Look at that.
Boom,

2452
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:48,190
and it's bigger

2453
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,023
than all these.
Stronger than them like knees to the 

2454
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:51,610
body,
man.

2455
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,250
And Franklin is fucking throwing down,
man.

2456
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:55,180
He's,
he's doing his best.

2457
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:57,070
He was a warrior,
but you'd see it when he would be.

2458
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,780
When he went up and fought at two.
Oh five.

2459
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:01,290
And he'd be in the clench with honor and
forrest griffin,

2460
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:02,980
like these guys couldn't do anything to 
them.

2461
01:50:02,981 --> 01:50:04,220
So these guys are like,
just,

2462
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:05,883
he's already fucked here because he's 
eating a bunch of really hard shots to 

2463
01:50:08,161 --> 01:50:11,380
the body and even though he's moving 
okay and he's like really compromised.

2464
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:14,200
He'll look at that beautiful right hook 
and then left kick,

2465
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:15,123
left low kick.
And Anderson fought a lot from the 

2466
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:18,124
southpaw stance.
He could fight from any position he 

2467
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:20,194
wanted to,
but he fought a lot from the southpaw 

2468
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:21,874
stance,
which is also an advantage to a lot of 

2469
01:50:23,021 --> 01:50:23,854
people.
It's amazing how much mma guys make it 

2470
01:50:25,301 --> 01:50:30,301
look like me and Jesus.
His arm's gone limp.

2471
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:35,330
I mean it's this boom,
boom.

2472
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,310
Wow Dude.
That is nuts.

2473
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,540
It's nuts.
Just the way he moves.

2474
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,010
Watch them step in here though,
man.

2475
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:44,720
It's so crazy.
Watch this

2476
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:51,770
step in elbow.
First time ever in MMA.

2477
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:55,130
That was Anderson in his prime and the 
cool.

2478
01:50:55,131 --> 01:50:58,500
And it was one of those moments where a 
particularly you have like,

2479
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,353
I've had a lot in watching mma where 
when someone comes in and beat someone 

2480
01:51:01,911 --> 01:51:02,744
else at their strength and then you have
to reorganize your mind where you're 

2481
01:51:05,841 --> 01:51:06,201
like,
oh,

2482
01:51:06,201 --> 01:51:09,160
I thought that guy was like.
Because Franco was like,

2483
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:12,470
this guy's got really great hands,
he's a really good striker.

2484
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,240
And then a guy like that lets you know 
like,

2485
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,320
oh,
there's like another world when,

2486
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:17,420
you know,
it's like levels.

2487
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:18,313
You got these guys like the Chinese Kung
Fu guy and then you have all these 

2488
01:51:21,861 --> 01:51:22,694
different levels,
these steps along the way in the 

2489
01:51:25,311 --> 01:51:26,144
spectrum.
And then you've got like Moitai of 

2490
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:29,203
Anderson.
But then you got like Moitai of Sand 

2491
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:32,510
Chai in Thailand.
It's like several levels,

2492
01:51:32,511 --> 01:51:36,890
past Anderson Pool cow and rob deck,
Ramon Ramon dekkers.

2493
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:39,800
And Rob came in and all the greats,
you know,

2494
01:51:39,801 --> 01:51:40,371
uh,
Ernesto,

2495
01:51:40,371 --> 01:51:42,320
who's these guys are like even further 
past that,

2496
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,790
you know,
there's all these crazy,

2497
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:45,290
crazy,
crazy levels to this thing.

2498
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:48,500
And you know,
when you see a guy like Anderson you see

2499
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:53,370
just for the first time it was in the 
UFC where you have like legitimate world

2500
01:51:53,371 --> 01:51:55,560
class,
maybe not the best ever and more Thai,

2501
01:51:55,561 --> 01:51:58,970
but legitimate worldclass Moitai skills,
watching them fight.

2502
01:51:58,971 --> 01:52:00,710
That's like a professional Moy Thai 
fighter.

2503
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,870
And it seems to me like,
um,

2504
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:06,350
for whatever reason I think because in 
it's on its own,

2505
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:07,184
it works better in a real fight.
So the grappling stuff in mma like 

2506
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:11,623
pretty quickly,
we got very high level grapplers pretty 

2507
01:52:13,881 --> 01:52:14,381
quickly.
Like,

2508
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:15,214
I mean from the first UFC,
you've got the best Jujitsu guys at the 

2509
01:52:17,121 --> 01:52:20,510
time or were at least one of a 
representative of the gracies.

2510
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:22,610
And then uh,
you know,

2511
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:25,400
you got Olympic level wrestlers in there
pretty quickly.

2512
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:26,271
Like,
I mean it was,

2513
01:52:26,271 --> 01:52:27,104
it wasn't too long before,
like Dan Severn and Mark Coleman and 

2514
01:52:29,031 --> 01:52:32,090
guys like that who had like legit 
wrestling credits came in.

2515
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:36,200
But it took a long time before you got 
like really,

2516
01:52:36,201 --> 01:52:40,940
really high level striker.
So he got Maury Smith was the guy,

2517
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:42,650
he was,
he was really the first was the first.

2518
01:52:42,651 --> 01:52:43,790
Yeah,
go back to that,

2519
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:46,160
go back to that fight again.
Here's something that's

2520
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:46,993
interesting to point out as Bas rutten 
was one of the early guys to strewn was 

2521
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,860
after Maurice where there weren't too 
many besides that,

2522
01:52:51,861 --> 01:52:52,694
like it.
Those guys were like a few who actually 

2523
01:52:54,591 --> 01:52:56,840
because it took so much to learn all the
other shit.

2524
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:57,823
Right.
But the difference between boss and 

2525
01:52:58,551 --> 01:52:59,384
Maurice was that Maurice was more of a 
tactician and boss was a destroyer and 

2526
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:06,740
he's like an intelligent animal.
He would just like attack like vicious,

2527
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:09,290
ferocious striking,
you know,

2528
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,930
but real aggressive but also very 
technical as well.

2529
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:16,010
Whereas Maurice is much more clever like
leg kick dependent,

2530
01:53:16,011 --> 01:53:16,844
like Maurice is actually on a higher 
level in terms of like professional 

2531
01:53:18,981 --> 01:53:21,470
kickboxing.
Then boss boss didn't have like a lot of

2532
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:23,900
kickboxing fights.
Maurice was a world champion,

2533
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:24,973
but boss had that Holland style and as 
an MMA fighter he was one of the first 

2534
01:53:28,581 --> 01:53:30,950
guys that we ever saw that kick so 
fucking hard.

2535
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:32,083
But if you watch this fight,
what you learn is like what conor 

2536
01:53:34,911 --> 01:53:35,744
mcgregor figured out.
What conor mcgregor figured out is that 

2537
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,593
what holds a lot of these guys back his 
movement and see if you look at Tony 

2538
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,010
Franklin as he's moving towards 
Anderson,

2539
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,040
his movement,
he's very limited like he can't.

2540
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:48,830
He can't cover distance quick enough.
He has to make these little hop steps,

2541
01:53:48,831 --> 01:53:52,310
hop steps,
just slide in and blast things.

2542
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:53,263
Connor is fluid with his movement in and
out to the point where he can step 

2543
01:53:57,411 --> 01:54:00,710
forward and obviously wouldn't be able 
to do that with Anderson Silva,

2544
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:05,500
but he can step forward and step in and 
step out like when he fought a Joseph,

2545
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,353
although one of the most important parts
of that fight was that Aldo was trying 

2546
01:54:10,161 --> 01:54:12,830
to figure out the movement of Connor,
like go to go to that fight.

2547
01:54:12,831 --> 01:54:13,664
Joseph Aldo versus conor mcgregor and 
what connor was doing so good was 

2548
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:20,030
sliding forward and sliding back.

2549
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:22,070
There's like that one moment because 
it's a very short fight,

2550
01:54:22,071 --> 01:54:22,904
but there's the one moment where he 
faints a thing and jumps back right 

2551
01:54:24,951 --> 01:54:25,784
here.
See that?

2552
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:29,460
See how sleep pod,
but look how like he.

2553
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:32,860
He's in and out.
He's moving a lot and it's.

2554
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:34,430
It's a different thing,
boom,

2555
01:54:34,431 --> 01:54:35,264
slides back and drops the fucking left 
hammer on his chin and it's that 

2556
01:54:38,631 --> 01:54:41,690
movement that's so critical in a really 
high level.

2557
01:54:41,691 --> 01:54:42,524
If I look,
look how fluid he slides back and 

2558
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:44,923
launches that punch at the same time.
It's very interesting to me too because 

2559
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:50,000
it was a different intensity in his 
movement than like when he fought.

2560
01:54:50,001 --> 01:54:50,834
Other guys like Chad Mendez matter 
because he respected what Al Alto 

2561
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,923
throws,
alto throws heat and especially in that 

2562
01:54:55,901 --> 01:54:59,230
first round when Aldo is furious at you 
for disrespecting them.

2563
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,430
Like he knows he's coming with like a 
bomb,

2564
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:04,280
but yeah,
just but superior movement.

2565
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:08,450
It's also new,
unorthodox movement bloom.

2566
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,793
I mean a lot of ways.
They've been doing that shit and karate 

2567
01:55:11,541 --> 01:55:13,000
tournaments forever.
Right.

2568
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:15,740
But people hadn't figured it out in MMA 
yet.

2569
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:16,574
I mean if you look at a lot of what 
connor had done with his stance and his 

2570
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:20,233
movement,
a lot of it resembles what you see in 

2571
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:25,190
the karate point tournaments where they 
would leap in and drop a shot on you and

2572
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:27,710
leap out,
but they weren't fighting stationary.

2573
01:55:27,711 --> 01:55:29,660
People like.
Although that just charged forward,

2574
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:33,890
but although got used to fighting in 
that man fitting more Thai guys and that

2575
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:36,770
kind of mma look,
it's just the wrestling look.

2576
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,481
It's been,
you know,

2577
01:55:37,481 --> 01:55:40,720
it's really fascinating to me.
Just on this kind of evolution was a um.

2578
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:41,700
Oh God,
what's his name?

2579
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:44,100
A hutto the

2580
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,990
guy who fought Demetrius Johnson who 
don't,

2581
01:55:45,991 --> 01:55:47,880
who just,
I don't know who fights like him now.

2582
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,160
He all the sudden he adopted this style 
and you're like,

2583
01:55:50,161 --> 01:55:53,370
Holy Shit,
this style gives people real problems.

2584
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:57,060
And it's like I get,
I mean maybe I'm wrong about this,

2585
01:55:57,061 --> 01:55:59,700
but it reminds me a little bit of almost
like Mochida type thing,

2586
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:00,883
but it's like this,
it's this weird karate kind of thing 

2587
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:07,740
that it's like this weird evolution wake
once you have all the other shit.

2588
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,753
And what connor does this,
he's also got really good traditional 

2589
01:56:10,231 --> 01:56:11,320
boxing.
So like,

2590
01:56:11,321 --> 01:56:14,740
like not a lot of MMA guys couldn't do 
10 rounds with me whether they,

2591
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,133
he's also got boxing so he can kind of 
mix it up with like traditional boxing 

2592
01:56:19,891 --> 01:56:20,724
attacks and this crazy other shit.
So what's crazy about him is he'll be 

2593
01:56:23,251 --> 01:56:27,090
like throwing like,
like these crazy spinning like cartwheel

2594
01:56:27,091 --> 01:56:28,940
kicks and then he'll just have like a 
one,

2595
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:29,783
two that was like perfect,
which that's new to mma or we haven't 

2596
01:56:32,461 --> 01:56:33,630
seen a lot of that in the past.

2597
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:35,420
And you know,
it's titles,

2598
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:36,443
those kicks are longer too.
You're dealing with something that 

2599
01:56:38,461 --> 01:56:41,760
reaches much further than the 
traditional Moitai techniques or,

2600
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:44,570
or straight boxing techniques.
He's throwing sidekicks.

2601
01:56:44,610 --> 01:56:45,443
He's.
His head is so far away from you when 

2602
01:56:46,891 --> 01:56:48,360
he's throwing a side kick,
if he lands,

2603
01:56:48,361 --> 01:56:50,670
if he's touching you in the chest or the
sidekick,

2604
01:56:50,890 --> 01:56:53,430
there's no opportunity for you to 
counterpunch he's way over there.

2605
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:55,680
He's bent sideways.
His head is way out of reach.

2606
01:56:55,950 --> 01:56:56,783
He might be able to catch them with a 
kick if he comes forward after he drops 

2607
01:56:59,251 --> 01:57:01,320
the sidekick,
if you're in range,

2608
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:04,050
but you might get pushed back.
There's a lot of factors involved.

2609
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:05,400
The fight and the guy who fights like 
that.

2610
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:06,443
And so who does figure that out?
And then he just dropped some bombs on 

2611
01:57:09,241 --> 01:57:10,980
Wilson has that is,
which is,

2612
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,581
uh,
you know,

2613
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:13,170
I mean obviously like,
you know,

2614
01:57:13,190 --> 01:57:15,270
Demetrius Johnson is like head and 
shoulders above,

2615
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,350
above everybody,
everybody else.

2616
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:19,020
And he made quick work of him.
But that was like,

2617
01:57:19,021 --> 01:57:21,450
at least to me,
like a little like glimpse of like,

2618
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:22,343
oh,
well maybe if this guy is this good a 

2619
01:57:23,241 --> 01:57:24,150
grappler in,
is figuring,

2620
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:26,520
striking out like this.
Maybe he's the guy who could,

2621
01:57:26,521 --> 01:57:27,420
you know,
like be a good,

2622
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:30,060
a good contender.
It may may happen very well.

2623
01:57:30,061 --> 01:57:34,580
I mean he might challenge them one day,
but what Henry Cejudo represents is like

2624
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:35,423
extreme talent,
a real sponge for knowledge and 

2625
01:57:37,531 --> 01:57:38,364
information.
And he's got a guy that's in his 

2626
01:57:40,111 --> 01:57:41,040
division,
that's the king.

2627
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,120
That's,
in my opinion,

2628
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:42,954
the greatest martial arts of all time.
I don't think there's anybody that's 

2629
01:57:45,001 --> 01:57:45,834
been a better representation of what's 
possible in modern martial arts better 

2630
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:51,240
than mighty mouse because he just 
doesn't get hit.

2631
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:53,280
And He fucks everybody up and you can't 
hit him,

2632
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:54,150
man.
He's coming at you.

2633
01:57:54,151 --> 01:57:55,200
And then all of sudden he's over here.

2634
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:58,140
And then you've got a knee in your body 
and then you got punched in the face and

2635
01:57:58,141 --> 01:57:59,580
you're trying to figure out what the 
fuck's happening.

2636
01:57:59,581 --> 01:58:00,414
All the sudden you're on your back and 
he's dropping hammer fists on you and 

2637
01:58:02,461 --> 01:58:04,080
you,
by the time you're reacting to that,

2638
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:05,310
he's gotten in an arm bar.
You're like,

2639
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:07,020
what the fuck just happened to me.
Yeah.

2640
01:58:07,021 --> 01:58:08,820
It's hard to argue with the emerald.
He's,

2641
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:11,280
he fights like he's a specialist at 
every discipline.

2642
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:12,570
Yeah.
Like he's like,

2643
01:58:12,571 --> 01:58:15,690
he's like,
like you feel like he could beat all the

2644
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:19,110
specialists at their discipline.
And it's like what George St Pierre used

2645
01:58:19,111 --> 01:58:20,090
to kind of do.
But uh,

2646
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,510
yeah,
I do modern,

2647
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:22,693
modern MMA and more dominant.
Not going to decisions destroying 

2648
01:58:25,381 --> 01:58:26,214
everybody.
He's about to break the record if you 

2649
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,660
already have about to,
you know,

2650
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:30,503
who knows,
right?

2651
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:31,680
You're right.
You're right.

2652
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,500
I shouldn't grant him.
Weidman knocked out Anderson Silva.

2653
01:58:34,501 --> 01:58:36,330
Nobody saw that coming.
This is a crazy sport.

2654
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:37,020
It's not,
it's,

2655
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,550
it is a crazy sport.
And it's like,

2656
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,820
it seems like nobody can escape it.
Right?

2657
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:42,883
Like it's like it takes the toughest,
most invincible person you can think of 

2658
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:46,983
as like Anderson Silva was a Ninja in 
untouchable Ninja and then you see him 

2659
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,540
crying in the center of the ring with 
like a shattered,

2660
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:53,621
shattered,
but whatever,

2661
01:58:53,621 --> 01:58:54,820
you know,
split up Shinbo.

2662
01:58:54,850 --> 01:58:58,160
I mean it's like it's chocolate dal.
Like all these landscapes.

2663
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,920
They came,
saw junior dos Santos,

2664
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:02,410
drop a bomb on,
came the Alaska isn't came collapsed.

2665
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:03,244
You're like,
wow.

2666
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:06,760
And then Kane can get Kale and then 
junior dos Santos at that point.

2667
01:59:06,761 --> 01:59:07,541
Then I was like,
well,

2668
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:08,374
after that you're like,
I guess we're living in junior dos 

2669
01:59:09,431 --> 01:59:11,440
Santos has world.
I mean those guys destroyed everyone.

2670
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:12,273
And then to watch him get nuked by Cain 
and the rematch can you just came back 

2671
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:16,864
and beat the fuck out of him,
but can the first fight really probably 

2672
01:59:19,151 --> 01:59:19,984
should have been fighting.
But it was the first big fight on Fox 

2673
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:24,370
and he had a fucked up Neiman and you 
couldn't move.

2674
01:59:24,371 --> 01:59:26,420
Right.
And the only one out of the way,

2675
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,810
his only two losses were when he was 
coming off an injury.

2676
01:59:28,811 --> 01:59:31,570
I believe he was coming off an injury 
against Fabrizio overdo as well.

2677
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:32,803
Uh,
well he was always coming off injuries 

2678
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:35,230
by that.
Is that as a problem?

2679
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:36,450
But the real problem with,
for Breo,

2680
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:38,800
for doing fight was that he didn't 
prepare in Mexico City.

2681
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:42,610
Mexico City is at 7,000,
500 feet above sea level,

2682
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:43,683
which is where I was in Utah last week.
I couldn't imagine if you didn't train 

2683
01:59:47,111 --> 01:59:49,210
there that you could be adapted to it.

2684
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:51,370
The way for Breesa was because for he 
smart,

2685
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:52,353
he was there for like,
I think a couple months at sea level 

2686
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:59,410
training doing his entire camp in Mexico
like way,

2687
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,453
even above 7,500.
I think he got up to the eight 

2688
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:03,760
thousands.
Yeah,

2689
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:07,450
that's the house seemed in the fight.
Like that made a big difference.

2690
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:10,560
Pretty hard to argue because cane is 
known as being the cardio care.

2691
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:14,260
Fabrizio knock on his cardio,
but that's not what he's known for.

2692
02:00:14,261 --> 02:00:15,860
He's not known for being like the Cardio
and,

2693
02:00:15,861 --> 02:00:17,920
and to see him at last time it was like,
oh yeah,

2694
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,300
that's a,
that's almost.

2695
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,570
It's almost like cain had so much 
confidence in his cardio because this is

2696
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:24,630
what he's been known for since like 
before he got into the UFC,

2697
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:25,723
it's like he's,
he's got this unbelievable tank that he 

2698
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:27,471
was like,
no,

2699
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:28,810
I'll be fine with that and it.

2700
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,950
And it didn't work out.
Okay.

2701
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:32,440
But I'll say,
and I know he's an injury case,

2702
02:00:32,441 --> 02:00:33,274
but like the Cain Velasquez that showed 
up to ufc 200 that fought a travis 

2703
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:40,270
brown.
I don't see any heavyweight beating that

2704
02:00:40,271 --> 02:00:40,781
guy.
Well,

2705
02:00:40,781 --> 02:00:42,460
I dunno for breach shall beat him.
I mean,

2706
02:00:42,461 --> 02:00:44,230
I don't know if he would be able to beat
them again.

2707
02:00:44,231 --> 02:00:45,690
But see,
the thing is for eco,

2708
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:49,060
his striking improved radically hand.
He's got long reach.

2709
02:00:49,061 --> 02:00:51,640
He's a big tall guy and he's strong as 
fuck.

2710
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:54,350
And if you could take him down,
good God damn luck.

2711
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:55,593
Everybody found.
If there's another argument for anybody 

2712
02:00:57,371 --> 02:00:59,920
being the greatest heavyweight of all 
time besides cane,

2713
02:00:59,921 --> 02:01:00,754
it's fabrizio.
Fabrizio might have a better argument 

2714
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:05,470
because fabricio submitted all the 
greats.

2715
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:08,530
He submitted fate or million inco 
submitted minotauro.

2716
02:01:08,531 --> 02:01:10,900
Nogueira submitted Cain Velasquez.
I mean,

2717
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:14,170
fabrizio submitted fucking everybody.
He's got some amazing ones.

2718
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:15,100
Amazing runs.
Yeah.

2719
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:18,880
If he didn't get killed by Steve Bay and
fighting out of composure,

2720
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,910
he was fighting very emotionally.
He's chasing steep a.

2721
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,260
I mean,
just got wild.

2722
02:01:23,261 --> 02:01:25,420
He was in Brazil.
He wanted to fucking get after it,

2723
02:01:25,421 --> 02:01:27,220
you know,
it was pumped up there in Brazil.

2724
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:29,500
He's the heavyweight champ.
He's fired up,

2725
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,693
but I think he might've underestimated 
what a bad motherfucker steep meo trick 

2726
02:01:33,581 --> 02:01:35,530
is and how the steep.
They could do the same thing.

2727
02:01:35,531 --> 02:01:38,620
Connor did slide away and drop that 
right hand,

2728
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,430
like pays a fucking elite

2729
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:41,720
athlete.
He's a monster.

2730
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:42,613
He's a monster.
I think I slept on him a little bit too 

2731
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:46,250
much for a long time.
But no,

2732
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:47,140
you see it in,
you know,

2733
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,350
he's,
he's proved it like it was last minute,

2734
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:54,040
but I was blown away by how reckless a 
lot about that.

2735
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:56,060
I mean he just charged them like 
straight on.

2736
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:58,820
Charge them as a dangerous way to fight 
any MMA fighter.

2737
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:00,540
Yeah.
It was like modern day.

2738
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:01,513
He made a mistake and I think he made 
that mistake because you got caught 

2739
02:02:03,381 --> 02:02:04,214
before that.
I think he got clip before that and he 

2740
02:02:05,811 --> 02:02:06,644
got emotional because he got clipped and
he tried to really ramp it up and 

2741
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:10,343
overcompensate.
Like if you watch that fight before 

2742
02:02:12,111 --> 02:02:14,960
Steve Bay knocks him out.
He catches him a couple times.

2743
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,970
Yeah.
Pays a sharp boxer.

2744
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:17,833
Very,
very sharp hands and he catches you on 

2745
02:02:19,201 --> 02:02:20,310
the chin.
Oh,

2746
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:21,153
we could put people away.
Obviously he's putting everybody away 

2747
02:02:22,671 --> 02:02:24,680
now.
Put Away Alistair overeem.

2748
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:26,900
Arguably the greatest strike or whoever 
fought in mma,

2749
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:29,060
you know,
k one Grand Prix champion.

2750
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:32,170
Strikeforce dropped,
dropped and got right back up.

2751
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:33,533
You know,
that's,

2752
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:36,230
that's pretty impressive.
Fucking animal.

2753
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:37,123
Yeah.
And when I was talking to him after the 

2754
02:02:38,121 --> 02:02:39,200
fight,
he thought he got kicked.

2755
02:02:39,290 --> 02:02:40,670
I,
he didn't even remember he got punched.

2756
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:42,440
It was all.
He was like,

2757
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:44,570
I don't know what the fuck happened.
Usually it wasn't sure if he's like,

2758
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:45,433
oh,
I know that one.

2759
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:50,000
Well,
both of them felt they want.

2760
02:02:50,001 --> 02:02:52,390
He's the highest level so far.
You know,

2761
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,100
Steve Bay in his athleticism,
his ability to move,

2762
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:55,963
his ability to overcome obstacles like 
junior had kicked the shit out of his 

2763
02:02:58,401 --> 02:02:59,234
leg to the point we had this giant 
Hematoma on his shin and he's still 

2764
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:03,170
knocked him out.
Yeah,

2765
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:05,210
that was,
that was a very interesting fight.

2766
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:06,103
I mean it was super quick,
but it was like a lot of actions super 

2767
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:09,130
quick.
Now I do the more.

2768
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:11,390
I'd love to see a healthy cane come back
and fight.

2769
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:13,103
Yeah.
I don't know what the extent of his 

2770
02:03:14,271 --> 02:03:15,104
injuries are and why he's been sidelined
so long and you'd have to talk to him 

2771
02:03:17,601 --> 02:03:20,180
personally,
but what I'm hoping is that I know a lot

2772
02:03:20,181 --> 02:03:22,070
of it was back issues and shoulder 
issues.

2773
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:23,720
He had shoulder surgery,
knee surgery,

2774
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:26,210
back surgery,
and he had several surgeries,

2775
02:03:26,211 --> 02:03:30,830
so it's just that style is so aggressive
and so physically dependent.

2776
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:35,860
I mean he just so fucking overwhelming 
that a lot of it is mental toughness,

2777
02:03:35,901 --> 02:03:38,060
the mental toughness to push past 
everybody.

2778
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:40,640
Sometimes your body just can't keep up.
Right.

2779
02:03:40,641 --> 02:03:42,620
And so like,
right in general,

2780
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,730
probably every high level MMA,
UFC fighter at this point.

2781
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,593
I mean,
what they're doing to their body when 

2782
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:50,480
they're putting their body through,
is it a lot for,

2783
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,343
you know,
I mean it's like,

2784
02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:54,380
it's like really pushing yourself to the
absolute limit constantly.

2785
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:57,110
Then as you mentioned,
his style is particularly,

2786
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:58,220
you know,
like kind of physical,

2787
02:03:58,221 --> 02:04:02,630
physical and he comes from a chaos 
that's notoriously a very,

2788
02:04:02,631 --> 02:04:03,464
very tough case.
Those guys are like known for like 

2789
02:04:05,811 --> 02:04:08,600
getting in wars and like really,
really training hard.

2790
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,713
So I'm sure all of that shit doesn't.
It's bad because if Cain cain had such 

2791
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:14,084
amazing cardio and great footwork and 
beautiful striking technique as well as 

2792
02:04:17,331 --> 02:04:19,160
like real elite wrestling technique.

2793
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:22,670
If cain fought more in a mighty mouse 
sense.

2794
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:23,743
It's just one of the reasons what made 
mighty mouse so good is that like if 

2795
02:04:26,181 --> 02:04:29,120
cain used his cardio,
not in like a blunt way,

2796
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:30,680
but more in a surgical way.
Right.

2797
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:32,230
You know,
if cane,

2798
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:34,910
like in the junior dos Santos fight in 
particular,

2799
02:04:34,911 --> 02:04:35,744
he caught them like real early in the 
fight and clipped him with a right hand 

2800
02:04:38,851 --> 02:04:41,230
and heard them rock them and just 
decided to mall them.

2801
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,040
She has got all over him,
amalgam,

2802
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,940
but he took a lot of damage in the 
process.

2803
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:45,983
They both did.
They both hit each other and he came 

2804
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:50,430
overwhelmingly dominated the fight,
but it wasn't.

2805
02:04:50,610 --> 02:04:53,820
It wasn't the way mighty mouse does.
Mighty mouse doesn't get hit.

2806
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,580
He's there and then he's here and then 
you're getting hit,

2807
02:04:56,850 --> 02:04:57,683
you know,
and then he's on your clench and then 

2808
02:04:58,681 --> 02:04:59,514
boom,
you get a need in the chin and then 

2809
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:01,470
boom,
you're getting elbowed and then boom,

2810
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:04,930
you're getting tripped and then if he's 
just doing things,

2811
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:09,840
he's got this repertoire of 
possibilities that no one else has.

2812
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,560
Whereas cain just had this ferocious 
attitude,

2813
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:18,630
powerful striking and ungodly cardio,
which is common at your bitch.

2814
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:19,220
Here we go.

2815
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:20,070
Yeah.
It's interesting.

2816
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:22,130
One of the things may whether it was 
talking about.

2817
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:23,033
I see him like in a few different 
interviews leading up to the conor 

2818
02:05:25,011 --> 02:05:26,420
fight,
but just talking about the fee,

2819
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,493
it's a crazy thing that like,
it almost seem like fans like the guy 

2820
02:05:30,711 --> 02:05:34,730
who takes a lot of head damage more like
they don't like the guy who avoids those

2821
02:05:34,731 --> 02:05:35,564
wars and avoid that,
but it's like you sit there and look at 

2822
02:05:37,851 --> 02:05:41,300
the way Mohammed Ali left and the way 
floyd mayweather's leaving.

2823
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:42,500
Oh yeah.
And it's like,

2824
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:43,131
okay,
I get it.

2825
02:05:43,131 --> 02:05:45,770
The fans love rope a dope more,
but like,

2826
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,590
I dunno,
it's kind of hard to argue with that.

2827
02:05:48,590 --> 02:05:49,450
Yeah,
floyd going out,

2828
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,293
beating conor is really the perfect way 
to do it too because he really didn't 

2829
02:05:53,151 --> 02:05:53,984
take much damage and that fight took one
good solid upper cut in the first round 

2830
02:05:56,571 --> 02:05:57,404
and then Kinda like took over.
So He gets his big 50th win and then 

2831
02:06:00,441 --> 02:06:02,810
really gets to show that it's really 
about boxing.

2832
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:04,520
It's not about slugging and standing 
there,

2833
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:07,400
but when people talk about him,
they don't talk about them with the same

2834
02:06:07,401 --> 02:06:10,940
reverence that they talk about like 
Arturo Gotti and micky ward made because

2835
02:06:10,941 --> 02:06:11,774
they were more entertaining.
Like the people that get entertained by 

2836
02:06:15,470 --> 02:06:16,690
the style,
the fighter,

2837
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:18,290
the wild,
crazy slugger.

2838
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:19,290
They love those guys.

2839
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:21,080
I mean,
we all love those guys.

2840
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:21,681
Like,
I mean,

2841
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:24,800
who doesn't love Travis Browne versus 
Andrei Arlovski like a fight like that.

2842
02:06:24,801 --> 02:06:26,890
I mean it's like the grant and to see 
things like,

2843
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:29,900
to see somebody come back after getting 
like,

2844
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,120
like there's something incredible about 
that.

2845
02:06:32,121 --> 02:06:32,710
It's like,
it's,

2846
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:33,543
it's an amazing thing that mma,
like when you were talking about a 

2847
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:36,013
steeping,
not knowing whether it was a kick or a 

2848
02:06:36,591 --> 02:06:37,424
punch is this amazing thing that mma 
does where you find out someone's true 

2849
02:06:40,491 --> 02:06:43,550
character when they're in a storm,
you know,

2850
02:06:43,551 --> 02:06:45,140
and like how they come and that's 
amazing.

2851
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:48,680
But if you are that person,
you know,

2852
02:06:48,681 --> 02:06:49,514
it's just a little bit different.
Like there's human elements involved 

2853
02:06:51,171 --> 02:06:52,550
too.
And like you got a family,

2854
02:06:52,551 --> 02:06:53,384
you've got kids.
You want to think for the rest of your 

2855
02:06:54,351 --> 02:06:56,810
life you want to like,
and how can you argue with floyd?

2856
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:57,673
I mean the guy made the most money and 
took the least damage and as the best 

2857
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:04,370
record on you argue with that

2858
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:05,383
and figured out a way to neutralize 
really dangerous people like Canelo 

2859
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:10,340
Alvarez.
I mean,

2860
02:07:10,341 --> 02:07:12,820
forget about the conor fight who was 
congress,

2861
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:13,663
obviously outmatched,
but if you look at his fights with 

2862
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:19,010
really elite knockout artists like manny
Pacquiao neutralized him,

2863
02:07:19,190 --> 02:07:21,030
Canelo Alvarez neutralized him.
I mean,

2864
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:21,913
pretty much everybody fought.
He fought a freestyle that was more 

2865
02:07:26,121 --> 02:07:28,810
entertaining because you wanted him to 
lose his,

2866
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:29,693
like his,
his brilliance was that he got you to 

2867
02:07:31,251 --> 02:07:32,084
hate him so that you would buy a fight 
hoping that the guy was going to kick 

2868
02:07:34,731 --> 02:07:35,760
his ass.
So

2869
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:38,600
I remember doing this thing.
Uh,

2870
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:40,210
I was on,
I was on a radio show,

2871
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,131
um,
that,

2872
02:07:41,131 --> 02:07:41,964
uh,
Brian Stan called into was like MMA 

2873
02:07:44,321 --> 02:07:46,690
radio show on Sirius radio that they 
used to use me on sometimes.

2874
02:07:46,691 --> 02:07:49,330
And Brian Stan called and I remember he 
was just talking about like,

2875
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,093
I forget what the topic was at first it 
was like Joe Silva had just left and he 

2876
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:55,560
wasn't matchmaking anymore.
And he started talking about how like,

2877
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,160
how,
how tough the job is,

2878
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:58,023
a matchmaking and how much it fucks with
you when someone gets knocked out real 

2879
02:08:00,311 --> 02:08:01,031
bad.
And then you're like,

2880
02:08:01,031 --> 02:08:02,560
and maybe I shouldn't have made that 
match.

2881
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:03,820
You know what I mean?
Like you kind of feel like,

2882
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:05,380
oh,
maybe I threw someone in the wrong time.

2883
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:06,700
And I was kind of like,
Oh man,

2884
02:08:06,701 --> 02:08:09,610
that's a human element I really never 
think about in that job.

2885
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,890
And then he was like,
we were talking about GSP coming back.

2886
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,030
And he was like,
yeah,

2887
02:08:13,031 --> 02:08:13,864
you know,
I just don't think GSP each come back 

2888
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:15,604
like,
what's he got to prove and what's it 

2889
02:08:16,350 --> 02:08:17,290
going to do,
you know,

2890
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:19,420
why risk the brain damage,
you know?

2891
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:20,643
And then it's like this weird thing.
Like you never think about that as a 

2892
02:08:22,001 --> 02:08:22,834
fan,
but when you start meeting the guys and 

2893
02:08:23,951 --> 02:08:24,784
they actually become people like I met 
Michael bisbing and Lewis does it show 

2894
02:08:27,551 --> 02:08:28,750
with him?
They do a podcast,

2895
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:29,613
a believer.
You believe you may really great 

2896
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:32,600
podcasts.
How do it.

2897
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:34,240
They do it through skype?
Yeah,

2898
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:35,110
skype,
I believe.

2899
02:08:35,110 --> 02:08:35,943
Yeah.
So He's in La and Louis is in New York 

2900
02:08:37,041 --> 02:08:39,290
and they skype it and then like when 
they're on the coast,

2901
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,870
we'll do it together.
But uh,

2902
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:41,913
but so you know,
like you get to know them like hang a 

2903
02:08:43,361 --> 02:08:46,750
few times and like your friends and like
I think it kind of like,

2904
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:47,621
oh yeah,
no,

2905
02:08:47,621 --> 02:08:49,480
I don't want to see you go fight one of 
these killers,

2906
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:51,520
which is fight gsp and then retire after
that.

2907
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:51,991
Dude,
like what,

2908
02:08:51,991 --> 02:08:53,130
what are you doing?
Like you've,

2909
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:55,180
you've had a great career,
you're the champ,

2910
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:57,800
you get a huge money fight now you're 
great at,

2911
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:58,773
at the commentating thing.
It's like when you know someone 

2912
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:01,410
personally,
it's a little bit more like,

2913
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,260
ah Nah Dude,
just.

2914
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:03,670
But when you're just a fan,
it's like,

2915
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:04,553
all right,
I want to see you fight Yoel Romero and 

2916
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:06,930
then with the car and then this guy and 
then.

2917
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,620
But like when you know someone,
you're like,

2918
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,000
oh,
that guy's a monster.

2919
02:09:10,001 --> 02:09:12,240
I don't know.
That's my.

2920
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:13,263
It makes my job way harder for like the 
guy I imagine and I know it's going to 

2921
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:17,314
be a mismatch.
Like you find out somebody you really 

2922
02:09:19,601 --> 02:09:21,130
care for.
It was gonna fight.

2923
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:23,410
Somebody that is just going to light 
them up and you're like,

2924
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:25,630
oh,
are you going to win this?

2925
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:26,973
You know,
that very public moment with a Brendan 

2926
02:09:28,301 --> 02:09:28,660
shot.

2927
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:29,493
But it was a very interesting,
compelling moment because it's like a 

2928
02:09:31,901 --> 02:09:32,860
thing where it's like,
yeah,

2929
02:09:32,861 --> 02:09:34,610
you're like,
you're talking to your friend Tommy,

2930
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:35,463
you're also an analyst.
I'm talking to a good friend who I knew 

2931
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:39,603
as a good friend was already one foot 
out the door and had a bunch of other 

2932
02:09:42,881 --> 02:09:47,290
things that were going on and was one of
the rare guys that has massive potential

2933
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:48,790
to do things outside the sport.
Yeah,

2934
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:49,780
he's killing it.
He's killing.

2935
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:52,390
It was right.
Look at me and he's smashing it with his

2936
02:09:52,391 --> 02:09:54,580
podcast,
smashing it with the fighter and the kid

2937
02:09:54,581 --> 02:09:57,610
podcast he does with count to machinate 
with his live touring.

2938
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:59,090
It was amazing to see him.
Uh,

2939
02:09:59,230 --> 02:10:02,690
he did a fucking great job on all the 
stuff leading up to conor conference.

2940
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:03,603
Like he was excellent.
He was like the only mma analysts who 

2941
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:06,590
was in there kind of breaking shit down.

2942
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:08,920
It was great.
It's like why?

2943
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:09,843
So all,
all that to just have one or two more 

2944
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:16,120
fights and maybe take some real band.
Really see one thing if he really wanted

2945
02:10:16,121 --> 02:10:16,954
to do that.
Like if he was obsessed and that's what 

2946
02:10:18,611 --> 02:10:19,444
he wanted to do,
he wanted to win the heavyweight title 

2947
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:23,140
and that was 100 percent of his focus 
was.

2948
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:24,603
But he wasn't there.
I mean maybe it was when he first 

2949
02:10:27,191 --> 02:10:30,040
started his career and often times your 
motivation shifts.

2950
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:33,070
You get knocked out a few times and he 
had been knocked out several.

2951
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,130
By then he got knocked

2952
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,010
out by Minotauro.
He got knocked out by big Ben Rothwell.

2953
02:10:37,011 --> 02:10:40,730
He got smashed by Travis Brown.
He got knocked out by Roy Nelson.

2954
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:41,593
And these are out cold knockouts,
so like there was so many of them and I 

2955
02:10:44,871 --> 02:10:45,704
was seeing it so often.
And then towards the end I was noticing 

2956
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:52,740
just a lack of enthusiasm.
It wasn't the same as those.

2957
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:56,210
It wasn't the same fire that allowed 
them to knock out Mirko Cro,

2958
02:10:56,211 --> 02:10:59,000
cop.
It wasn't the same sort of intensity.

2959
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,863
You,
you told me last time I was on the show 

2960
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:05,300
that you've experienced that a smart 
guys have a tougher time.

2961
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:06,223
Yeah.
Coming back from getting knocked out 

2962
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,680
because I found that really interesting.
Maybe that's part of the case with him.

2963
02:11:09,910 --> 02:11:10,743
It was like,
it's hard to avoid knowing the 

2964
02:11:11,421 --> 02:11:12,650
information.
Yeah,

2965
02:11:12,651 --> 02:11:13,484
most certainly.
I mean if you're a person who being you 

2966
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:16,784
can be a smart person,
just compartmentalize things and 

2967
02:11:18,441 --> 02:11:19,274
figuring out how to control the 
variables in your mind and just be 

2968
02:11:21,441 --> 02:11:22,610
refocused on what you're doing.

2969
02:11:22,610 --> 02:11:24,650
It's not to say that people come back 
aren't smart,

2970
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:26,050
but I think,
uh,

2971
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:27,013
I mean people,
it's not to say also that people who 

2972
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:29,234
don't,
who fight aren't smart because a lot of 

2973
02:11:30,681 --> 02:11:32,270
people think of fighters is not being 
smart.

2974
02:11:32,271 --> 02:11:33,104
I think that's not true at all.
I think there's a lot of people who 

2975
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:36,254
fight who aren't smart,
but I think the people who excel have 

2976
02:11:38,961 --> 02:11:43,070
exceptional mind power as well as 
physical power.

2977
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:47,920
I think some of them are like a,
like a guy like a dominant Cruz.

2978
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:50,050
It's like a very smart guy.
I mean there's guys like that,

2979
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:50,884
right?
Stands by saying I'm very intelligent 

2980
02:11:51,921 --> 02:11:52,754
guy and then when you go to champions,
like mighty mouse is super smart and 

2981
02:11:54,641 --> 02:11:55,474
he's a very,
very articulate guy and it doesn't show 

2982
02:11:57,411 --> 02:11:58,990
any damage at all.
I mean,

2983
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,740
I'm sure there are some meat heads also 
out there,

2984
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:01,730
but you know,
it's,

2985
02:12:01,730 --> 02:12:02,900
it's certainly like a mix.

2986
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:03,830
It's A.
Yeah.

2987
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:05,390
Carlos condit,
he's another one.

2988
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:07,640
There's a lot of guys who fight,
um,

2989
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:10,670
that just aren't like that though.
There's a lot of guys who were just like

2990
02:12:10,671 --> 02:12:14,560
super aggressive and they just do well 
and they kick ass and you know,

2991
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:20,170
the guys who know that they're 
experiencing traumatic brain injury,

2992
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:23,580
they,
they understand the consequences are,

2993
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:25,373
they're unavoidable.
Unless there's some new medical 

2994
02:12:26,541 --> 02:12:29,210
breakthrough that allows you to heal 
cte,

2995
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:31,070
which is super,
super possible.

2996
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,600
Yeah,
well absolutely.

2997
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:36,080
I mean if you described the medical 
breakthroughs we have now 50 years ago,

2998
02:12:36,081 --> 02:12:38,280
you'd be talking about magic.
So yeah,

2999
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:39,163
my buddy Steve Graham was on the US ski 
team like in the 19 eighties and he had 

3000
02:12:44,511 --> 02:12:46,890
scars when I first met him.
He had already had like,

3001
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:50,750
I mean in his life,
I want to say he's had more than 20 knee

3002
02:12:50,751 --> 02:12:51,584
surgeries and I think I'm being super 
conservative because I think it's way 

3003
02:12:54,081 --> 02:12:54,914
more than that.

3004
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,813
I think he literally had.
He's had 50 surgeries including eye 

3005
02:12:59,001 --> 02:13:00,930
surgeries.
Um,

3006
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:03,290
he's had shoulder surgery,
everything.

3007
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:07,010
But when I met him,
his knees were so fucked up.

3008
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:07,844
He had these big slices up and down the 
side of his knees where they had opened 

3009
02:13:11,301 --> 02:13:14,360
him up and tried to screw things back 
together again from skiing,

3010
02:13:14,361 --> 02:13:19,361
just mangling his knees in the old days 
of skiing and those same operations.

3011
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:22,130
Today I have one on this knee.
You can't even see the scar.

3012
02:13:22,131 --> 02:13:25,760
It's little tiny dots because they did 
it arthroscopically and they put it in a

3013
02:13:25,761 --> 02:13:29,420
cadaver unit and healed in six months.
I was doing Jujitsu again.

3014
02:13:29,421 --> 02:13:31,610
No pain,
no loss of range of motion.

3015
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:32,340
Everything feels

3016
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:33,173
stronger than I felt before.
So like that's just the medical science 

3017
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:36,564
that occurred in 20 years,
20 years from his operation to my 

3018
02:13:40,201 --> 02:13:42,120
operation.
What's it gonna be 20 years from now,

3019
02:13:42,121 --> 02:13:42,954
it's totally possible they'll develop 
some sort of stem cell technique to 

3020
02:13:45,031 --> 02:13:46,500
regenerate brain tissue.
Yeah.

3021
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:47,334
Well this is why it's so.
It's so crazy the bulb in human history 

3022
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:50,131
where at,
where we're like,

3023
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:50,964
guys,
if we can just not kill each other for 

3024
02:13:52,411 --> 02:13:56,310
like another couple of years,
we might do some really beautiful,

3025
02:13:56,311 --> 02:13:57,670
amazing shit.
Right?

3026
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:59,220
Like we really might.
We might.

3027
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,533
Why?
It's crazy that one of our big threats 

3028
02:14:02,391 --> 02:14:03,870
is North Korea.
Yeah.

3029
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:07,800
Because that represents like one of the 
oldest styles of running a country ever.

3030
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:09,830
And it's really,
um,

3031
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:11,250
I do,
I do.

3032
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:14,370
I think trump's been really bad on a,
on that issue.

3033
02:14:14,371 --> 02:14:15,270
And like,
that's fucking,

3034
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:16,140
that is terrifying.

3035
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:18,990
I was really happy when you had a 
Michael Malice on because I've learned a

3036
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:21,000
lot about North Korea from that.
Yeah.

3037
02:14:21,001 --> 02:14:23,420
He knows so much about his book,
dear readers,

3038
02:14:23,421 --> 02:14:24,360
excellence.
And yes,

3039
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:28,590
it's an excellent book.
And he's just a fascinating human being.

3040
02:14:28,730 --> 02:14:29,280
Yeah,
got it.

3041
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:29,941
But it's,
you know,

3042
02:14:29,941 --> 02:14:31,740
it's like you have,
as we were saying before,

3043
02:14:31,741 --> 02:14:32,574
like it's like a hostage situation,
but the guy holding the hostages has 

3044
02:14:36,151 --> 02:14:36,984
nukes,
which makes that like a very different 

3045
02:14:38,761 --> 02:14:39,594
type of hostage situation.
Any shooting them in the sky but also 

3046
02:14:42,901 --> 02:14:44,370
duds over Japan.
Yes,

3047
02:14:44,371 --> 02:14:46,890
yes.
But there also is like people,

3048
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:47,753
because again,
the media which just absolutely has a 

3049
02:14:50,671 --> 02:14:54,420
blind spot for the military industrial 
complex and the horror of American wars.

3050
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:57,300
So you get,
you don't get the full picture.

3051
02:14:57,301 --> 02:14:58,134
I think like to me it's very logical why
he's shooting off rockets left and 

3052
02:15:02,011 --> 02:15:02,220
right.

3053
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:03,053
Like he,
I mean self preservation is a pretty 

3054
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:10,620
obvious motivator and people like 
Gaddafi who come out and say,

3055
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:11,311
oh,
okay,

3056
02:15:11,311 --> 02:15:12,144
you international community,
you said you don't want us to have 

3057
02:15:13,951 --> 02:15:15,600
nuclear arms.
So then will disarm.

3058
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,060
We'll end our nuclear program where they
do that.

3059
02:15:18,061 --> 02:15:18,894
We move in there and throw them out and 
get the ends up getting sodomized to 

3060
02:15:21,571 --> 02:15:22,321
death,
you know.

3061
02:15:22,321 --> 02:15:23,910
So that's like if you're this guy you're
like,

3062
02:15:23,911 --> 02:15:26,350
well I'm going to not go that route 
right.

3063
02:15:26,351 --> 02:15:27,184
So now I'm going to show you,
and basically he's showing you I can 

3064
02:15:29,311 --> 02:15:30,144
fucking nuke South Korea.
I can nuke these fucking places if you 

3065
02:15:32,881 --> 02:15:34,040
come at me.
Uh,

3066
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:34,861
that being said,
you know,

3067
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:35,694
he's a madman,
he's totally a madman who's holding 

3068
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:42,830
people hostage and it's horrific.
But there are like certain,

3069
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:44,640
okay,
if you have a hostage situation,

3070
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:46,343
there are some reasonable ways to handle
that and some ridiculous ways to handle 

3071
02:15:50,041 --> 02:15:50,520
that.

3072
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,080
So like when you have a hostage 
situation,

3073
02:15:52,081 --> 02:15:56,550
I think it's reasonable to negotiate 
with the guy.

3074
02:15:56,970 --> 02:15:59,370
I think it's reasonable to take them out
if you have a shot.

3075
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:01,710
You know what I'm saying?
If someone has a shot and like too many,

3076
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:03,120
like,
like people won't be hurt,

3077
02:16:03,121 --> 02:16:04,650
we can take them out,
take the shot.

3078
02:16:04,890 --> 02:16:08,220
What you don't do is stand outside and 
start talking shit.

3079
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:10,400
So the guy who's got the hostages.
Yeah.

3080
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:11,243
Know if trump's not thinking of it as 
anything other than like a Rosie 

3081
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:15,380
O'donnell.
Yes.

3082
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:18,000
He talks shit about Rosie O'donnell.
Who's calling the sky rocket man?

3083
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:19,560
Where's that?
Kind of like with Rosie O'Donnell.

3084
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:20,610
But you know,
there's the,

3085
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:21,800
there's a thing about trump.
I'm no,

3086
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:23,250
I'm no fan of his,
but there's something,

3087
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:24,084
I kind of get a thrill.
I got a kick out of how he'd Piss off 

3088
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:28,290
people who I'm not a huge fan of.

3089
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:31,810
I'll tell you though,
I love Hillary.

3090
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,390
When she did the things he,
Bernie Hillary.

3091
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:37,120
I love the nicknames until it was rocket
man.

3092
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:39,040
I was really into the nicky nicknames 
and you're like,

3093
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:40,240
whoa.
Hey Buddy,

3094
02:16:40,241 --> 02:16:42,700
this isn't funny anymore.
This guy's got nukes.

3095
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,620
But there's the um,
well,

3096
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:45,251
look,
when he,

3097
02:16:45,251 --> 02:16:48,090
it was a morning Joe,
a cohost,

3098
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:52,640
Mika Brzezinski shape.
So she made a thing and on the show were

3099
02:16:52,641 --> 02:16:53,474
they,
there was a picture on Time magazine 

3100
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:55,413
with trump with like this,
with his hands under his arms and she 

3101
02:16:57,791 --> 02:17:00,130
made a joke on the show and she goes,
oh,

3102
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:01,510
how come he doesn't want to show his 
hands?

3103
02:17:01,511 --> 02:17:03,580
Maybe because they're teeny.
Okay.

3104
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:05,600
That was a joke.
She made the sentinel essentially.

3105
02:17:05,620 --> 02:17:06,790
It's a little Dick joke.
I mean,

3106
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:08,740
that's what she was making herself.
So Donald Trump,

3107
02:17:08,910 --> 02:17:12,220
like immediately tweets out I think 
about her and he goes,

3108
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:13,570
when she was at my,
uh,

3109
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:15,130
when she was at my party,
she had,

3110
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:17,410
she had scars from the facelift.

3111
02:17:17,630 --> 02:17:20,810
She's still bleeding,
bleeding from the face looks for that.

3112
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:22,780
They asked me to sit with her,
did not go.

3113
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:23,281
Yes,
yes.

3114
02:17:23,281 --> 02:17:26,980
So it's this thing now.
Then of course the media goes right into

3115
02:17:26,981 --> 02:17:29,500
the mode of like,
how could you insult a woman's,

3116
02:17:29,501 --> 02:17:30,910
you know,
like looks and it's like,

3117
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:33,460
I don't know man,
like if you can't take the heat,

3118
02:17:33,461 --> 02:17:34,294
get out of the fucking Dick joke.
And then people were like actual 

3119
02:17:38,831 --> 02:17:41,900
journalists like grown up people who 
consider themselves journalists.

3120
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,240
I saw reporting a week later.
It's been confirmed that Mika Brzezinski

3121
02:17:45,241 --> 02:17:47,050
wasn't even at that event and didn't 
even.

3122
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:49,150
Yeah,
you fucking idiots.

3123
02:17:49,151 --> 02:17:51,640
This isn't a real thick.
He's just getting her back.

3124
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:53,500
Like she hit him and he's hitting her 
back.

3125
02:17:53,501 --> 02:17:54,071
Like,
yes,

3126
02:17:54,071 --> 02:17:54,904
if you're,
if you're vain enough to be having 

3127
02:17:56,771 --> 02:17:57,604
plastic surgery,
probably you're not going out while 

3128
02:17:59,141 --> 02:18:01,540
you're still bleeding from the plastic 
surgery.

3129
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:04,330
But like it's the point is,
and I kind of liked that about trump,

3130
02:18:04,331 --> 02:18:04,961
it's like,
oh,

3131
02:18:04,961 --> 02:18:07,270
finally someone being unapologetic and 
being like,

3132
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:12,030
I disagree with you hardcore because I 
think it's stupid and childish and like,

3133
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:12,953
are you fucking dumb?
It's beneath being the president of the 

3134
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:17,103
United States and this idea that you're 
going to make up a story about a woman 

3135
02:18:19,781 --> 02:18:20,614
bleeding from plastic surgery to get 
over because she said you have little 

3136
02:18:23,711 --> 02:18:25,440
hands.
That's some weak bitch.

3137
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:27,100
Okay.
As you repeat it back to me,

3138
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,640
it does sound like some wheat.
Sweet.

3139
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,520
If that was your friend.
Hold on a second.

3140
02:18:30,521 --> 02:18:31,354
Okay.
That was your friend and one of your 

3141
02:18:32,681 --> 02:18:34,700
friends was making fun of the fact that 
you,

3142
02:18:34,701 --> 02:18:35,534
you had small hands and so you went on a
radio show or podcast and may not the 

3143
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:44,070
whole story about him.
Bitch.

3144
02:18:44,071 --> 02:18:44,820
Okay.
So far.

3145
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:45,160
Okay.

3146
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,540
So I'll agree with you on that.
You're right,

3147
02:18:46,570 --> 02:18:50,560
it is kind of a bitch move 100 percent.
So I'll agree with you.

3148
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:51,453
It doesn't really happen even so I could
get where you could say it's kind of a 

3149
02:18:55,001 --> 02:18:56,620
bitch move.
Like you should be above this,

3150
02:18:56,770 --> 02:18:57,603
but I get what I enjoy about it is if 
then everybody else like the like 95 

3151
02:19:02,861 --> 02:19:03,694
percent of the mainstream media's 
reaction is how could you attack a 

3152
02:19:05,951 --> 02:19:10,330
woman's looks like how you dummies that.
Maybe you'll think next time about.

3153
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:11,373
I just.
I hate the thing that Mika feels 

3154
02:19:12,731 --> 02:19:16,420
entitled to make a small Dick joke and 
then feels entitled the next day to play

3155
02:19:16,421 --> 02:19:17,254
though.
Are you insulting a woman's looks like 

3156
02:19:20,110 --> 02:19:21,460
it's actually worse,
right?

3157
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:24,520
If he was telling the truth because what
she's saying,

3158
02:19:24,521 --> 02:19:27,530
he has no control over his.
No control over her head with the of his

3159
02:19:27,531 --> 02:19:28,070
hands and he was

3160
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,903
born with,
but she does have control over whether 

3161
02:19:30,291 --> 02:19:32,990
or not she's so vain.
She lets a doctors stick a tube down her

3162
02:19:32,991 --> 02:19:33,824
throat and cut her half alive body and 
stitch it tighter to give the illusion 

3163
02:19:37,761 --> 02:19:38,990
of youth.
Now.

3164
02:19:38,991 --> 02:19:39,824
I don't think that really happened.
At least that's what a lot of it didn't 

3165
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:42,583
really happen,
but if it did happen and he was talking 

3166
02:19:45,111 --> 02:19:47,510
about that after she was talking shit,
then it makes sense.

3167
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:49,460
What doesn't make sense?
It's not true.

3168
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:50,600
Yeah,
so I get,

3169
02:19:50,660 --> 02:19:52,730
I guess what I.
I do agree with you the point you made,

3170
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:54,620
so I will walk back that a little bit.
You're right.

3171
02:19:54,621 --> 02:19:55,454
It's kind of a shitty move,
but there's just something I did like 

3172
02:19:58,011 --> 02:20:01,310
the fact that he's willing to do that.
Someone's like fighting back against the

3173
02:20:01,311 --> 02:20:02,144
PC authoritarianism,
which I do see as a really big fucking 

3174
02:20:04,581 --> 02:20:05,000
problem.

3175
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,400
I don't see this as like a little 
problem that's annoying.

3176
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:08,383
Like I think it's a really big problem 
and I don't care about the dignity of 

3177
02:20:10,851 --> 02:20:13,490
the president.
I liked that being undermined as much as

3178
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:13,730
possible.
I,

3179
02:20:13,730 --> 02:20:14,563
I don't think the whole idea that 
there's dignity to this bullshit job 

3180
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:19,430
that shouldn't even exist.
I hate.

3181
02:20:19,431 --> 02:20:21,980
So I liked that being.
I like that aspect of trump do.

3182
02:20:22,030 --> 02:20:22,863
What do you.
What'd you think about when board Dang 

3183
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:26,120
got shit?
Because they asked him at the airport.

3184
02:20:26,121 --> 02:20:28,580
Just one of them tmz things.
You walk through the airport,

3185
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:29,653
they go,
if you had to cook for Kim Jong Un and 

3186
02:20:31,311 --> 02:20:32,420
Donald Trump,
what would you serve?

3187
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:37,400
It goes hemlock and they lease.
That's a fucking bordain throw away.

3188
02:20:37,401 --> 02:20:40,940
Funny punchline.
That's just good chef humor right there.

3189
02:20:40,941 --> 02:20:43,520
God Damn Dude.
I was looking at all the comments and so

3190
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:44,354
many of them were using Hashtag Potus to
talk about potus that way and to talk 

3191
02:20:48,930 --> 02:20:50,450
mean they were talking about like,
he's the king,

3192
02:20:50,630 --> 02:20:51,560
like these sheep.

3193
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:54,680
But they also switched sides.
It's like the Obama people in the trump.

3194
02:20:54,681 --> 02:20:56,990
People are so happy to just,
just literally one day.

3195
02:20:57,070 --> 02:20:57,903
Oh,
you take that position and I'll take 

3196
02:20:58,551 --> 02:20:59,930
this position now.
No problem.

3197
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:01,310
No,
no feeling of like,

3198
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:02,450
oh,
this is a little bit weird.

3199
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:03,284
I was literally three days ago lecturing
people about how he's our president and 

3200
02:21:07,011 --> 02:21:10,190
now I'm like not my president.
Like you don't feel any,

3201
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:11,113
any,
you know.

3202
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:12,730
And,
and there's this thing that I go,

3203
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:15,140
you know,
I remember you said this and I've quoted

3204
02:21:15,141 --> 02:21:17,840
this many times on my show.
Part of the problem,

3205
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:20,530
my podcast,
they're a plug in a problem.

3206
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:22,940
I would have a part of the problem,
but no more alliteration.

3207
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:26,630
But I don't know if you were quoting 
someone or this was years originally,

3208
02:21:26,631 --> 02:21:27,940
but you were describing the,
uh,

3209
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,983
the occupy Wall Street movement and you 
use the white blood cells as the way to 

3210
02:21:32,781 --> 02:21:33,540
describe them.

3211
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:34,373
You might,
might've been quoting someone else when 

3212
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:35,630
you said it,
but,

3213
02:21:35,630 --> 02:21:38,030
or maybe it was years originally,
but I remember hearing you say this,

3214
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:39,093
I think it was mine when I was saying is
it's obviously there's a disease and 

3215
02:21:41,721 --> 02:21:42,554
they don't know exactly what it is,
but the white blood cells are moving in 

3216
02:21:44,841 --> 02:21:48,320
and they're surrounding this infection 
that's trying to figure out what it is.

3217
02:21:48,321 --> 02:21:49,154
I thought it was like such a perfect 
analogy and it applies to occupy Wall 

3218
02:21:52,371 --> 02:21:53,204
Street.
It also applied to like the tea party 

3219
02:21:53,931 --> 02:21:55,850
movement in some other way.
And you're right,

3220
02:21:55,851 --> 02:21:56,601
the point of being like,
look,

3221
02:21:56,601 --> 02:22:00,170
a white blood cell does not understand 
the complexity of a virus.

3222
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:02,840
It doesn't have the cure for a virus.
It doesn't have like that.

3223
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:07,340
But it knows corruption rush.
Like that's the thing.

3224
02:22:07,341 --> 02:22:08,174
It's like corrupt and rush.
And I think that a lot of the trump 

3225
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:13,640
thing is that too.

3226
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:14,953
It's like white blood cells and they 
know that this pc authoritarian thing 

3227
02:22:18,650 --> 02:22:22,610
that trump fights,
that they know that's the virus and this

3228
02:22:22,611 --> 02:22:27,611
is to them the most anti audit report.
He has half fake people.

3229
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,503
You know,
I did that to me today and I posted it 

3230
02:22:31,861 --> 02:22:33,930
on instagram.
I'm very happy with the results.

3231
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:37,310
You're doing way better than trump's.
Way better than that motherfucker.

3232
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:39,690
I don't have any fake people on twitter 
because first of all,

3233
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:41,730
I'm not the president.
I think when you're the president,

3234
02:22:41,731 --> 02:22:43,980
you automatically get like a shit ton of
fake people.

3235
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:45,353
Billionaire gop,
patron behind trump's social media bot 

3236
02:22:47,791 --> 02:22:48,511
army.
Yeah.

3237
02:22:48,511 --> 02:22:50,670
Of course he has a media bought.
Of course.

3238
02:22:50,671 --> 02:22:52,110
Why would he not use that?
I mean,

3239
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:54,300
it's just like to him that's like a 
tool,

3240
02:22:54,301 --> 02:22:55,134
like what?
It's like when the Samurai's refuse to 

3241
02:22:56,431 --> 02:23:00,810
adopt gun pile gunfire,
they refuse to adopt firearms.

3242
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,793
That fuck that shit.
We're using bows and arrows and swords 

3243
02:23:03,631 --> 02:23:04,464
like men and they got gone down.
That was the end of the Japanese empire 

3244
02:23:08,161 --> 02:23:08,994
as we knew it at the time.
They just aged version of what Kodak 

3245
02:23:11,941 --> 02:23:12,900
did.
Oh,

3246
02:23:12,901 --> 02:23:13,351
right,
right,

3247
02:23:13,351 --> 02:23:15,000
right.
Kodak was when digital came out,

3248
02:23:15,001 --> 02:23:15,631
they were like,
Eh,

3249
02:23:15,631 --> 02:23:17,580
we don't really like digital will be the
film guys.

3250
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:20,810
Fuck you guys go with digital and then 
after awhile they tried.

3251
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:24,000
They'll put out to digital cameras,
but then this cameras were on phones.

3252
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:25,710
Bitch,
you missed the whole thing.

3253
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:27,090
You were an industry leader.
Yeah,

3254
02:23:27,091 --> 02:23:27,924
you went way behind the curve,
but you're the number one typewriter 

3255
02:23:29,851 --> 02:23:31,350
distributor now.
That's all it means.

3256
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:34,350
If you are running for President Dave 
Smith and you don't use a Bot army,

3257
02:23:34,351 --> 02:23:35,910
I'll be very disappointed in you.
I'd be like,

3258
02:23:35,911 --> 02:23:36,744
how can I give you my support if you're 
not even willing to use a bot army when 

3259
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:39,770
we.

3260
02:23:39,770 --> 02:23:41,220
We're talking about Smith Twenty four 
now,

3261
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:42,623
20,
24.

3262
02:23:42,630 --> 02:23:44,870
I think bots are like old technology.
To your point.

3263
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:45,780
You're right.
I'm sorry dude.

3264
02:23:45,781 --> 02:23:47,130
I'm not going to get elected with that 
crap.

3265
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:48,810
How short sighted of me I go,
dude,

3266
02:23:48,811 --> 02:23:49,920
that's totally.
That's 2020 things.

3267
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:51,440
That's bullshit thinking.
Yeah.

3268
02:23:51,650 --> 02:23:52,483
Yeah.
The new stuff is all you get to figure 

3269
02:23:53,641 --> 02:23:56,520
out how to hack into neural implants.
That's right.

3270
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:57,413
I'm also.
A lot of my campaign is going to be 

3271
02:23:58,171 --> 02:23:59,004
running against the previous four years 
of the Kanye West Administration and 

3272
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:03,030
everything that they did wrong and be 
like,

3273
02:24:03,031 --> 02:24:04,290
look,
trump didn't solve the problem.

3274
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:05,133
Kanye didn't solve the problem.
Now let's take a nice libertarian 

3275
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,073
position.
Will be Kanyi will have established 

3276
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:11,393
colony in Africa and uh,
he will have read designed Calabasas in 

3277
02:24:15,421 --> 02:24:20,421
Africa and they'll all be just driving 
around and bentleys and shit and duck in

3278
02:24:20,611 --> 02:24:21,444
Lyons.

3279
02:24:21,470 --> 02:24:22,920
It's like,
it really is though.

3280
02:24:22,921 --> 02:24:23,754
Like it's,
it's almost like seems anything seems 

3281
02:24:25,651 --> 02:24:29,260
plausible show will live into reality,
but it is a thing that it is like a,

3282
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:33,000
like Andrew Breitbart said,
this is what I've realized over the last

3283
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,030
year is that a politics is downstream 
from culture.

3284
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:37,021
Yeah.
That was the truth.

3285
02:24:37,021 --> 02:24:38,550
I completely missed this.
Uh,

3286
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:39,990
uh,
maybe not completely,

3287
02:24:39,991 --> 02:24:40,824
but I definitely underplayed how 
important the culture is and how that 

3288
02:24:43,051 --> 02:24:44,250
really dictates.
It's not,

3289
02:24:44,251 --> 02:24:46,110
it's not.
It's not like,

3290
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:47,070
Oh,
if you went to like,

3291
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:48,560
like a,
you know,

3292
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:51,060
central Africa tomorrow and went,
don't worry,

3293
02:24:51,061 --> 02:24:52,850
I changed the minimum wage law.
Like,

3294
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:54,300
things will be okay.
It's like,

3295
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:56,580
it's like there,
there's a cultural element that you have

3296
02:24:56,581 --> 02:25:00,030
to account for also,
and the Donald trump thing.

3297
02:25:00,031 --> 02:25:02,120
It's just kind of like,
in a way,

3298
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:03,330
what's so interesting to me is it's 
like,

3299
02:25:03,331 --> 02:25:04,164
okay,
so like trump's a buffoon and he's a 

3300
02:25:05,281 --> 02:25:06,114
cartoon.

3301
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:11,130
I mean literally a cartoon like he's got
is the color of his skin,

3302
02:25:11,131 --> 02:25:12,870
the color of his hair.
Like you watch CNN,

3303
02:25:12,900 --> 02:25:16,530
the fitting suits,
overweight body like crazy hair.

3304
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,620
You're watching the news and then a 
cartoon character comes on,

3305
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:23,040
but in this weird way he's had this 
ability to like hold up a mirror.

3306
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:26,950
The rest of American society is also a 
billionaire,

3307
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:30,580
so he's an undeniably a winner and as 
far as we decide,

3308
02:25:30,730 --> 02:25:32,710
hard to argue.
Then on top of that,

3309
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:33,723
he's unapologetic and that's something 
we all admire because we all wish we 

3310
02:25:36,821 --> 02:25:39,400
could do that because we can't.
And that's something that pisses off the

3311
02:25:39,401 --> 02:25:40,234
left.
Yeah,

3312
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:41,453
I like that.
That I think is right at the heart of 

3313
02:25:42,731 --> 02:25:45,490
why they hate trump,
which is something I'm fascinated by and

3314
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:46,324
I think it is.
I really think being an unapologetic 

3315
02:25:48,281 --> 02:25:51,010
white man,
[inaudible] rubs the left wrong.

3316
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:51,520
Like,
look,

3317
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,800
you can be a white man and you can be an
ally,

3318
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:56,260
but you gotta be you gotTa.
Be Down here,

3319
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:58,540
you know you can't be like up here.
You can't be like,

3320
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,433
Hey,
I have an opinion and this is how I 

3321
02:26:00,101 --> 02:26:01,360
feel.
You got to be down here.

3322
02:26:01,361 --> 02:26:02,194
Like I have an opinion and I know my 
opinion's been overrepresented on his 

3323
02:26:04,181 --> 02:26:05,014
Jamie kill scenes taken enough heat.
You don't have to go after him again on 

3324
02:26:08,381 --> 02:26:10,690
this podcast like you just did.
I saw what he did.

3325
02:26:11,970 --> 02:26:13,800
Will welcome Jamie back.
I will do.

3326
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:18,790
I will come back and he did some silly 
things.

3327
02:26:18,791 --> 02:26:20,050
Got a little carried away.
Exactly.

3328
02:26:20,350 --> 02:26:22,060
People make bad decisions.
He got a.

3329
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:25,330
He got influenced by a silly ideology 
and you know,

3330
02:26:25,331 --> 02:26:26,164
and it came out.
But then he did some great work for 

3331
02:26:27,761 --> 02:26:28,594
those people.
Like there was a fucking speech that he 

3332
02:26:29,741 --> 02:26:31,600
did in front of this giant thing in 
Brooklyn.

3333
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:33,970
I forget what it was about,
but he was doing this,

3334
02:26:33,971 --> 02:26:38,840
a speech about about Donald Trump and 
about black lives matter and it was rick

3335
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:41,500
really well worded stuff,
whether you agree with it or not.

3336
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:46,420
Like he did good work inside that,
that little sort of paradigm.

3337
02:26:46,910 --> 02:26:50,110
I met Jamie Kilstein when I was like a 
brand new comedian,

3338
02:26:50,130 --> 02:26:53,320
like just starting standup comedy and he
was,

3339
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:56,680
you know,
to me like doing things that were really

3340
02:26:56,681 --> 02:26:57,514
cool,
like he was on the road with Stan hope 

3341
02:26:58,061 --> 02:26:59,180
and like to me that was like,
oh,

3342
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,220
you're like,
you made it,

3343
02:27:00,250 --> 02:27:01,083
like that's amazing.
Like you're doing the thing that we all 

3344
02:27:02,321 --> 02:27:03,154
want to do.
And he was just super kind and helpful 

3345
02:27:06,581 --> 02:27:07,414
to me.
I was a young comment and so I always 

3346
02:27:08,441 --> 02:27:10,960
just have like a,
as a person,

3347
02:27:10,961 --> 02:27:11,794
I like Jamie and all the things I don't 
like about Jamie where we like seeing 

3348
02:27:14,231 --> 02:27:17,440
him on your show or seeing something he 
tweeted or something like that.

3349
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:20,860
So it's like as a person I always liked 
him and then the public persona,

3350
02:27:20,861 --> 02:27:22,720
like he knows a few people.
Apologies,

3351
02:27:22,721 --> 02:27:23,790
but I'd be happy to.
Yeah,

3352
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:24,663
I mean I think we're all vulnerable to a
certain extent and we're vulnerable to 

3353
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:28,863
like if you tap into a vein and you have
success with a certain way of behaving 

3354
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:34,024
and thinking and you know,
you put blinders on because this is 

3355
02:27:37,001 --> 02:27:37,834
benefiting you.
I mean we see that financially with 

3356
02:27:39,461 --> 02:27:42,280
people were talking about before you see
that culturally,

3357
02:27:42,281 --> 02:27:43,114
socially,
and I think Jamie tapped into like the 

3358
02:27:44,381 --> 02:27:49,330
social vein of success in this very 
extreme ideology,

3359
02:27:49,331 --> 02:27:53,140
this extreme feminist male feminist ally
ideology,

3360
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:56,290
the denial of the differences between 
the men,

3361
02:27:56,291 --> 02:27:59,800
the women in.
And it's like he's a cliche and a lot of

3362
02:27:59,801 --> 02:28:00,401
ways,
right?

3363
02:28:00,401 --> 02:28:01,234
Because he's a small guy and you know,
he's very slight and you always see a 

3364
02:28:05,201 --> 02:28:06,970
small guy who a Vegan and a feminist.

3365
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:07,461
You're like,
oh,

3366
02:28:07,461 --> 02:28:09,490
it's just,
he's one of those guys.

3367
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:12,070
You know what I mean?
It's like you fall into these weird sort

3368
02:28:12,071 --> 02:28:15,820
of predetermined patterns of behavior,
these categories and he just was a black

3369
02:28:15,821 --> 02:28:17,140
belt at that,
you know,

3370
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:21,290
but also banging chicks.
It turns out you can't,

3371
02:28:21,410 --> 02:28:23,300
you can't be in that world.
And also like plus eight.

3372
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:24,930
As it turns out,
so crazy me.

3373
02:28:24,931 --> 02:28:27,440
Isn't that the ultimate feminist?
He loves women,

3374
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:28,363
top to bottom.
I don't know what the actual issue that 

3375
02:28:29,601 --> 02:28:31,700
they had with them.
I don't really know either,

3376
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:33,110
but I will say this,
okay.

3377
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:34,003
That he hangs out in that social justice
warrior crowd that he was hanging out 

3378
02:28:36,951 --> 02:28:37,784
with.
They will throw out the rape word for 

3379
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:41,433
everything.
You can look at someone the wrong way 

3380
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:47,120
and they'll call that rape and what they
accused Jamie have was inappropriate and

3381
02:28:47,121 --> 02:28:48,920
manipulative behavior toward women.

3382
02:28:50,570 --> 02:28:52,420
I mean literally means trying to get 
posted.

3383
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:53,413
Like it's not even.
You're not even exaggerating if you go 

3384
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:58,610
to them to this in this social justice 
warrior world,

3385
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:00,230
if you were to be like,
hey,

3386
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:02,450
why don't we like get outta here and go 
back to my place and you're like,

3387
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:03,141
no,
we can't go.

3388
02:29:03,141 --> 02:29:04,230
Come on,
let's go.

3389
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:05,660
She said no,
and then you said,

3390
02:29:05,661 --> 02:29:06,910
come on.
That is.

3391
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:09,710
That is inappropriate manipulative 
behavior.

3392
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:10,773
Skeptics conference and a man in an 
elevator asked a woman if she wanted to 

3393
02:29:15,831 --> 02:29:16,664
come to his room and have some coffee 
and she did a whole speech the next day 

3394
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:20,893
about how men should not,
if they're with a woman alone and it's 

3395
02:29:24,981 --> 02:29:28,490
late at night,
do not ask them to coffee because you're

3396
02:29:28,491 --> 02:29:29,324
going to imply that this woman is in 
danger and make her feel uncomfortable 

3397
02:29:32,511 --> 02:29:34,370
and all this crazy shit like,
oh,

3398
02:29:34,371 --> 02:29:35,630
so a guy was trying to fuck you.

3399
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:38,100
Doesn't that happen all the time like 
you're,

3400
02:29:38,101 --> 02:29:38,934
you're,
you're making a speech about this t 

3401
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:43,310
trying to control the behavior of men to
the point where they're not mad anymore,

3402
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:44,713
is shaped them and formed them into some
weird sort of pc version of you would 

3403
02:29:48,471 --> 02:29:50,870
like this.
No biological difference between the men

3404
02:29:50,871 --> 02:29:54,740
and the women.
Men being only allies and like what?

3405
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:57,510
It's so strange.
The whole thing is so weird and like,

3406
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:58,393
you know,
it's always these people who seem to be 

3407
02:30:00,531 --> 02:30:01,364
so resentful and angry at the male 
female relationship and interplay and 

3408
02:30:07,401 --> 02:30:10,250
like ankle and God wanted to fuck you is
so horrible.

3409
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:12,770
Coincidentally.
Almost always not attractive.

3410
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:15,800
It's you don't see a lot of tens walking
around going like,

3411
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:17,090
oh,
it's so unfair.

3412
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:17,953
There's a few that snuck in there,
but you don't see a ton of them like 

3413
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:21,541
publicans.
Well,

3414
02:30:21,541 --> 02:30:22,374
here's,
here's the thing is like the sheriffs 

3415
02:30:23,061 --> 02:30:24,560
Clark's that's right.

3416
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:26,870
And they put them right up front.
We put them right up front,

3417
02:30:26,890 --> 02:30:29,540
like see,
look at her tits,

3418
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:33,020
giant tits and a little waist.
She's a fucking feminist.

3419
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:35,540
Well the truth is if you want to get 
into a conversation,

3420
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:38,060
a real honest conversation about 
privilege,

3421
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:39,403
right?
And who has privileged and who doesn't 

3422
02:30:40,641 --> 02:30:43,220
have privilege.
I mean hot chick privilege,

3423
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:45,590
it's pretty shit is pretty strong.
I mean,

3424
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:46,443
but you know,
hot chicks walk around in a different 

3425
02:30:47,961 --> 02:30:48,794
world than regular women and men do.
I mean it's just a different thing and 

3426
02:30:52,191 --> 02:30:54,260
that's part of the nature of.
But you know,

3427
02:30:54,261 --> 02:30:56,300
whatever.
I mean that's like who human beings are,

3428
02:30:56,301 --> 02:30:57,134
but it's like I,
you don't hear her complaining about it 

3429
02:30:58,821 --> 02:31:01,280
as much because she's winning at this,
at this exchange.

3430
02:31:01,281 --> 02:31:02,114
You know,
women have to sort of keep their mouth 

3431
02:31:03,241 --> 02:31:07,550
shut about that shit.
Have to like kind of wanting to get away

3432
02:31:07,551 --> 02:31:09,470
with it.
We're working on our end over here.

3433
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:11,540
You know,
I,

3434
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:16,540
I saw this a tweet this woman put out 
that said a pro tip if you,

3435
02:31:16,611 --> 02:31:17,444
uh,
don't ever date a man who doesn't 

3436
02:31:18,531 --> 02:31:20,160
identify as a feminist.

3437
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:22,380
And I was like,
that is so crazy.

3438
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:25,090
That's such a crazy thing to say.
Like,

3439
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:26,093
first of all,
pro tip is one of the Douchey is things 

3440
02:31:28,081 --> 02:31:29,700
you could ever say and not say something
funny.

3441
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:32,640
If you say pro tip,
what you say after that,

3442
02:31:32,641 --> 02:31:35,800
better be proposed truss.
He's Jesus Christ.

3443
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:37,760
See pro tip and you're serious.
I just,

3444
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:40,820
you're a fucking condescending,
angry person from the jump.

3445
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:44,780
And it's very rarely a very successful 
pro who's giving me this protest.

3446
02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:45,650
Second of all,

3447
02:31:45,650 --> 02:31:48,350
the idea of every man that you date 
should be a feminist.

3448
02:31:48,380 --> 02:31:51,470
Well,
every man date shouldn't be a person who

3449
02:31:51,471 --> 02:31:53,510
discriminates.
I agree with that.

3450
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:56,510
They should be openminded tissue,
be egalitarian,

3451
02:31:56,840 --> 02:31:57,673
but the idea that they have to subscribe
to a feminist ideology that this can't 

3452
02:32:00,191 --> 02:32:05,090
just be fair and honest and curious and 
have real conversations with you.

3453
02:32:05,091 --> 02:32:07,490
Open and objective.
That's not good enough.

3454
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:08,533
Now they have to identify with this 
ideology that the only way you could 

3455
02:32:11,961 --> 02:32:12,794
ever have equality,
true equality within the sexes of the 

3456
02:32:14,691 --> 02:32:16,610
man,
identifies as being a feminist.

3457
02:32:16,910 --> 02:32:20,090
Like that's what feminism is.
Feminism is not supportive.

3458
02:32:20,091 --> 02:32:20,924
Women know feminism is total uniformity 
and there's no discrimination 

3459
02:32:26,631 --> 02:32:28,160
whatsoever.
And until that happens,

3460
02:32:28,190 --> 02:32:29,150
you have to be a feminist.

3461
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:30,850
Yeah.
And feminism to me is like,

3462
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:34,700
like modern day feminism at least.
It's just like a hate group.

3463
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:36,740
I just don't know how else to describe 
them.

3464
02:32:36,741 --> 02:32:37,574
They're just a hate group.
It's like if you take them at their 

3465
02:32:39,471 --> 02:32:40,520
word,
you know,

3466
02:32:40,521 --> 02:32:41,354
the way you,
you could take any hate group at their 

3467
02:32:42,561 --> 02:32:43,460
word,
you know,

3468
02:32:43,461 --> 02:32:44,211
and they'd be like,
Oh,

3469
02:32:44,211 --> 02:32:45,380
you know,
we're not a hate group.

3470
02:32:45,381 --> 02:32:46,214
We just care about white people,
white people's rights and the white 

3471
02:32:48,291 --> 02:32:49,100
children,
Blah Blah.

3472
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:49,940
And then you're Kinda like,
oh,

3473
02:32:49,941 --> 02:32:50,774
okay,
well let me come to a meeting and then 

3474
02:32:51,981 --> 02:32:53,210
by like that meet and you're like,
man,

3475
02:32:53,211 --> 02:32:55,290
they sure do seem to hate black people 
at this meeting.

3476
02:32:55,291 --> 02:32:56,124
We're not hate group.
We just think that all straight white 

3477
02:32:57,591 --> 02:32:59,990
men are trash until proven otherwise.
Exactly.

3478
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:00,853
Exactly.
And if you want to be there and you're 

3479
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,710
of that group,
you better first,

3480
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:04,580
uh,
you know,

3481
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:05,413
like confessed to your original sin for 
being and be guilty the whole time and 

3482
02:33:08,751 --> 02:33:09,584
be constantly,
you know,

3483
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:11,990
kind of repenting and then you can be 
there.

3484
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:12,790
But even with them,

3485
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:14,110
there's a giant spectrum,
right?

3486
02:33:14,111 --> 02:33:14,944
There's a lot of women that are just 
what they don't want is some fucking 

3487
02:33:17,801 --> 02:33:19,810
creepy boss to talk,
you know,

3488
02:33:19,811 --> 02:33:21,730
crazy,
creepy sexual shit to them.

3489
02:33:21,731 --> 02:33:24,820
And they have to absorb it because they 
want to move up the corporate ladder and

3490
02:33:24,821 --> 02:33:26,800
they're discriminated sexually in the 
office space.

3491
02:33:26,890 --> 02:33:28,740
They're discriminated when it comes to,
uh,

3492
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:29,633
you know,
uh,

3493
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:34,300
promotions and raises and you know,
the position in the company that's.

3494
02:33:34,390 --> 02:33:35,090
Yeah,

3495
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:35,923
sure.
Yeah,

3496
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:38,460
that's fucking gross.
If I don't want that to be a woman

3497
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:41,330
working in an office filled with fucking
men,

3498
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:43,010
think about trying to have sex with you 
all the time.

3499
02:33:43,150 --> 02:33:44,560
Absolutely,
absolutely.

3500
02:33:44,561 --> 02:33:45,394
And there are certain struggles that 
like guys are unaware of the or maybe 

3501
02:33:48,611 --> 02:33:50,590
not unaware completely because you like 
you're bringing it up right now,

3502
02:33:50,591 --> 02:33:51,424
but we don't experience certainly like 
you don't know what it's like to walk 

3503
02:33:53,561 --> 02:33:57,820
around life as like a tiny hot chick 
that men just constantly want to fuck.

3504
02:33:57,821 --> 02:34:02,200
I mean that's,
I'm sure that comes from being catcalled

3505
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:03,053
you know when they first came out with 
that video that went viral of the chip 

3506
02:34:05,050 --> 02:34:05,883
being catcalled around New York City.
My first reaction was I thought it was 

3507
02:34:07,751 --> 02:34:09,800
very interesting and I said,
because you go,

3508
02:34:10,120 --> 02:34:12,760
if you're a guy who doesn't cat call 
checks,

3509
02:34:12,761 --> 02:34:13,594
which is like the category I fall into.
That's just not my style of getting 

3510
02:34:16,091 --> 02:34:17,920
laid.
I've never thought of just be like,

3511
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,380
let me get that ass Motha like as you 
walked by me.

3512
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:22,830
But that did roll off the tongue kind of
naturally.

3513
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:23,673
So maybe I should try try that.
Maybe that'll get me a little more and 

3514
02:34:26,041 --> 02:34:26,874
made me get it nervous.
So it's interesting to see that because 

3515
02:34:30,401 --> 02:34:30,821
you're like,
oh,

3516
02:34:30,821 --> 02:34:32,890
I don't do that.
So as a guy who doesn't do that,

3517
02:34:32,891 --> 02:34:35,480
I'm the only category of people who are 
unaware of it.

3518
02:34:36,450 --> 02:34:39,970
Me Know how they made that video.
I found out later.

3519
02:34:39,990 --> 02:34:40,970
Yeah,
I did find out later,

3520
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:44,350
please tell everybody like hours and 
hours of footage.

3521
02:34:44,351 --> 02:34:48,190
They basically went all day long and 
disproportionately took footage of black

3522
02:34:48,191 --> 02:34:49,024
neighborhoods.
They went around in circles in this 

3523
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:55,030
black neighborhood in Harlem and in 
Times Square in these two areas.

3524
02:34:55,240 --> 02:34:57,160
And they basically got a lot of black 
guys,

3525
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:58,910
uh,
talking,

3526
02:34:59,010 --> 02:34:59,843
uh,
you know,

3527
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:00,750
uh,
to uh,

3528
02:35:00,810 --> 02:35:02,500
a very attractive,
very attractive.

3529
02:35:03,090 --> 02:35:05,620
But yes,
the crime of the century,

3530
02:35:06,010 --> 02:35:07,030
but at least it's like,
look,

3531
02:35:07,031 --> 02:35:09,550
I do think there's something to be said 
for like,

3532
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:10,091
oh,
okay,

3533
02:35:10,091 --> 02:35:10,924
look,
I don't know what the experience of 

3534
02:35:11,441 --> 02:35:12,530
getting cat called is.

3535
02:35:12,730 --> 02:35:15,010
This might be pissing off some women.
So okay,

3536
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:15,610
like,
let's,

3537
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:16,443
let's look at that.
But then there's also lots of struggles 

3538
02:35:19,301 --> 02:35:21,820
of men that women don't necessarily know
about.

3539
02:35:21,910 --> 02:35:22,743
And the problem with feminists is that 
in modern feminist is that they're not 

3540
02:35:25,061 --> 02:35:26,110
going like,
hey,

3541
02:35:26,111 --> 02:35:28,450
we both have struggled here,
let's have a conversation.

3542
02:35:28,780 --> 02:35:31,050
We're not like we're humanists were 
people lists,

3543
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:31,983
let's have a cup.
They're like,

3544
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:32,853
were feminists were on this team and 
we're going to talk about our struggles 

3545
02:35:35,861 --> 02:35:39,550
and lecture you about it and you can 
never discuss the opposite.

3546
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:42,940
The truth and the past gets so perverted
like they,

3547
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:43,793
they'd speak.
The past was all just oppressive gender 

3548
02:35:45,731 --> 02:35:47,590
roles toward women.
It's like A.

3549
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:48,453
Actually in reality,
there were oppressive gender roles for 

3550
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:51,073
everybody in the past.
And it's very debatable who they were 

3551
02:35:53,561 --> 02:35:57,280
more oppressive for.
Like in my grandmothers and grandfathers

3552
02:35:57,281 --> 02:35:58,114
day,
oppressive gender roles landed my 

3553
02:35:59,381 --> 02:36:02,340
grandfather in combat fighting and war 
like it.

3554
02:36:02,341 --> 02:36:04,000
It wasn't that,
you know,

3555
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:05,080
it wasn't like,
oh,

3556
02:36:05,081 --> 02:36:07,690
the men didn't have any struggles that 
the women didn't know about.

3557
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:09,940
Like again,
we technologically advanced,

3558
02:36:09,941 --> 02:36:10,774
we don't need those gender roles,
which we did need for lots of years 

3559
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:16,810
before technology.
There's no way for humans to survive.

3560
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:18,033
I mean,
go go for a hundred years ago and say 

3561
02:36:19,361 --> 02:36:20,920
let's abolish gender roles.
It's like,

3562
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:21,983
what's it like?
You're going to have kids until you 

3563
02:36:23,861 --> 02:36:25,150
know,
three of them died from polio.

3564
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:27,440
I mean that's what that was the point of
the Google memo.

3565
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:32,330
There's still things that people 
gravitate towards that or male with more

3566
02:36:32,331 --> 02:36:36,290
frequency than they do with are female 
and then you have these aberrations,

3567
02:36:36,291 --> 02:36:37,124
these women that want to be mma fighters
and these men that want to be florists 

3568
02:36:39,770 --> 02:36:40,603
and you have all these,
all the different people in between and 

3569
02:36:43,050 --> 02:36:43,883
to try to get equality and that was like
one of the things that was so 

3570
02:36:46,761 --> 02:36:47,594
frustrating about people is that we're 
not saying that women shouldn't be 

3571
02:36:49,821 --> 02:36:51,110
equal.
They can't be equal.

3572
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:52,093
We're saying they're not equal.
They're not equally represented in this 

3573
02:36:54,890 --> 02:36:58,040
particular field.
This particular discipline.

3574
02:36:58,350 --> 02:37:00,280
Now let's explore why.
Sure.

3575
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:01,153
Things that I thought was so crazy about
the google memo was that the guy had 

3576
02:37:03,411 --> 02:37:08,411
like a page and a half of like dedicated
to what would be a way to get women more

3577
02:37:08,721 --> 02:37:09,554
interested in tech and he had all these 
citations for all these different 

3578
02:37:12,591 --> 02:37:16,010
studies that he was quoting.
When they reprinted it and several

3579
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:18,860
sources,
they remove the citations and they,

3580
02:37:18,861 --> 02:37:20,210
you know,
they would put like these,

3581
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:21,093
they take these quotes out of context 
and highlight them and make them larger 

3582
02:37:23,841 --> 02:37:25,940
and it's like,
which I find strange to be like,

3583
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:26,813
oh yeah,
I read part of that thing and it seems 

3584
02:37:28,191 --> 02:37:29,024
fairly reasonable to me.
And I saw it very misrepresented in the 

3585
02:37:31,401 --> 02:37:33,110
way people were talking about it on the 
news.

3586
02:37:33,310 --> 02:37:34,143
Um,
and like it's just this weird thing 

3587
02:37:36,051 --> 02:37:36,801
where you're like,
okay,

3588
02:37:36,801 --> 02:37:37,970
look,
if you do like,

3589
02:37:37,971 --> 02:37:41,240
I like,
equality is what exactly do we even mean

3590
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:41,601
by that?
It's like,

3591
02:37:41,601 --> 02:37:42,434
yeah,
the equality under the law or something 

3592
02:37:43,281 --> 02:37:43,650
like that.
Like,

3593
02:37:43,650 --> 02:37:44,483
okay,
sure.

3594
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:45,141
But like,
no,

3595
02:37:45,141 --> 02:37:48,230
like men and women are different.
Men are different.

3596
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:50,000
Like you and I are different,
you know,

3597
02:37:50,001 --> 02:37:50,834
way more about politics than I do.
And you know way more about hunting elk 

3598
02:37:53,331 --> 02:37:54,290
and shit like that.

3599
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:55,213
Well that's always going to be the case.
It's not an equal thing because we're 

3600
02:37:57,411 --> 02:37:58,244
not mathematics.
I've got a huge gap to close on your El 

3601
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:01,780
content knowledge.
I got to get at it.

3602
02:38:01,790 --> 02:38:02,623
I tried to get out of time.
That's a weird one that I'm probably 

3603
02:38:04,671 --> 02:38:06,970
shouldn't have done.
Dipped my toes into.

3604
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:09,770
So absorbed.
No,

3605
02:38:09,771 --> 02:38:10,604
but you're absolutely right.
In the case with all of it is like 

3606
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:14,233
snowflakes I've been working on 
completely different and have different 

3607
02:38:16,101 --> 02:38:16,934
and the idea that equality,
I mean you'll never have that have any 

3608
02:38:19,401 --> 02:38:21,740
true science and then the thing with 
like,

3609
02:38:22,390 --> 02:38:23,223
okay,
with women it seems like feminist 

3610
02:38:24,351 --> 02:38:25,184
basically like they almost well bashing 
men and bashing the traditional kind of 

3611
02:38:28,761 --> 02:38:29,594
masculine gender role.
They also seem to embrace it and want 

3612
02:38:34,941 --> 02:38:36,910
that for women.
So like if men are,

3613
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:38,990
they really want it for transgender 
people,

3614
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:40,363
that's where it gets super slippery 
because the left wants really classic 

3615
02:38:43,131 --> 02:38:45,610
feminine,
like Transgender People.

3616
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:46,753
When Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner,
he's painting his toes and wearing high 

3617
02:38:49,701 --> 02:38:53,720
heels and short skirts and it gets a tit
job,

3618
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:56,270
gets his jaw sod down.
Like,

3619
02:38:56,271 --> 02:38:59,600
you can't just be a woman.
Got to be looking woman.

3620
02:38:59,601 --> 02:39:02,240
You got to be a woman with a fucking 
facial surgery.

3621
02:39:02,270 --> 02:39:04,010
You've got to be beautiful.
And we go,

3622
02:39:04,011 --> 02:39:04,821
yes,
you,

3623
02:39:04,821 --> 02:39:06,350
you're amazing.
You go,

3624
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:07,213
that's right.
If a girl embraces those classic gender 

3625
02:39:09,081 --> 02:39:11,510
roles,
like wearing high heels and short skirts

3626
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:14,650
and her tits are pushed together and 
like,

3627
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:15,523
Oh God,
you're falling into this classic gender 

3628
02:39:17,001 --> 02:39:17,960
trap.
That's right.

3629
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:19,430
Or,
or if a woman said,

3630
02:39:19,610 --> 02:39:20,443
oh,
I want to be a housewife and like raise 

3631
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:23,270
my kids and live a traditional 
lifestyle,

3632
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:26,260
or if I'm going to move for my husband 
or something like that,

3633
02:39:27,190 --> 02:39:30,200
a married man and you say that,
well for you go girl.

3634
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:33,140
And you see the same thing happen where 
they literally the same thing.

3635
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:35,890
They'll hate if a man does the law.
So if you had read,

3636
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:36,730
uh,
you know,

3637
02:39:36,730 --> 02:39:40,370
a feminist article about mma seven years
ago,

3638
02:39:40,670 --> 02:39:41,503
it would have been all about toxic 
masculinity and male aggression and all 

3639
02:39:44,841 --> 02:39:45,674
this stuff.
But as soon as Ronda Rousey was doing 

3640
02:39:46,581 --> 02:39:46,970
it,
it's like,

3641
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:48,500
that's our girl,
let's go do it.

3642
02:39:48,570 --> 02:39:51,050
If dirty comedy,
offensive comedy,

3643
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:51,591
they're like,
no,

3644
02:39:51,591 --> 02:39:52,670
fuck that,
that's your mail.

3645
02:39:52,671 --> 02:39:53,930
But,
but as soon as amy Schumer is doing it,

3646
02:39:53,931 --> 02:39:54,764
it's like,
let's go.

3647
02:39:55,010 --> 02:39:59,210
Like they love for a woman to do all the
things that they always said they hate.

3648
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:00,373
And the crazy thing is like they'll,
they'll say these things where it's 

3649
02:40:02,031 --> 02:40:02,581
like,
you know,

3650
02:40:02,581 --> 02:40:03,940
like women,
um,

3651
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:06,010
whatever it is,
women are uh,

3652
02:40:06,610 --> 02:40:07,850
you know,
whatever percentage,

3653
02:40:07,851 --> 02:40:10,850
like 51 percent of the population and 
they're only like 10 percent of Congress

3654
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:12,150
or something.
I'm just making these numbers up.

3655
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:14,010
Something like in that ballpark.
And there'll be

3656
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:15,240
like,
well this is a problem.

3657
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:15,991
And you're like,
well,

3658
02:40:15,991 --> 02:40:18,420
wait a minute.
I mean I'm all for freedom so if there's

3659
02:40:18,421 --> 02:40:20,220
any barrier in someone's way,
get that out of there.

3660
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:21,173
But if people are free and like men 
choose to go be politicians and women 

3661
02:40:24,691 --> 02:40:26,530
more choose to go into like,
you know,

3662
02:40:26,531 --> 02:40:27,364
like nursing and like these other light 
kind of like maternalistic fields that 

3663
02:40:30,481 --> 02:40:32,370
women go into a lot and you're like,
okay.

3664
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:35,010
So like,
are you sure?

3665
02:40:35,011 --> 02:40:37,170
The answer is just that they should be 
more like men.

3666
02:40:37,171 --> 02:40:39,690
Like maybe this is like saying something
better about women,

3667
02:40:39,691 --> 02:40:40,524
like men are going on or like going into
ruling over other people and women are 

3668
02:40:43,381 --> 02:40:44,214
going into like a nurturing field.
Like maybe the fact that women 

3669
02:40:46,141 --> 02:40:50,670
prioritize family over money is not a 
bad thing that needs to be reorganized.

3670
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:52,033
Great thing.
There's gonna be some women that choose 

3671
02:40:53,581 --> 02:40:54,414
to pursue a career at the very highest 
levels of capitalism and there's gonna 

3672
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:01,260
be some that have zero interest in doing
that.

3673
02:41:01,530 --> 02:41:02,363
And that's the same with men as well.
It's just we can't deny the patterns 

3674
02:41:06,781 --> 02:41:07,614
that we see.
Well we should figure out is like are 

3675
02:41:09,661 --> 02:41:14,070
there barriers if there's bears unjust 
barriers to keep women from things.

3676
02:41:14,071 --> 02:41:16,980
And I'm sure there are those things we 
should concentrate on.

3677
02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:19,260
Yes.
But concentrating on leveling the number

3678
02:41:19,261 --> 02:41:22,920
of people in Congress and that's 
essentially sexual affirmative action.

3679
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:26,060
You want to get more women in those 
positions because you think they have.

3680
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:28,800
How many women do you have running?
That's when you get to Hillary Clinton.

3681
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:30,570
I mean like we want a woman to be 
president.

3682
02:41:30,571 --> 02:41:31,404
Okay.
How about a lying old lady who faints a 

3683
02:41:33,151 --> 02:41:34,350
lot?
Is that one?

3684
02:41:34,351 --> 02:41:35,910
Okay?
You'd be like,

3685
02:41:35,911 --> 02:41:36,900
no.
Well that's ridiculous.

3686
02:41:36,901 --> 02:41:39,360
Well that's what you got when you wanted
to get only women.

3687
02:41:39,361 --> 02:41:40,680
You got that one?
Okay,

3688
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:42,420
so what the fuck do you want to do now?

3689
02:41:42,690 --> 02:41:46,740
Because what you're doing is you can't 
just decide that you only want,

3690
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:48,120
you know,
you want 50 percent men,

3691
02:41:48,121 --> 02:41:50,310
50 percent women in all.
What about coal mining?

3692
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:53,550
You want to have 50 percent of women who
die had fucking coal mining accidents.

3693
02:41:53,551 --> 02:41:56,220
You know the disproportionate number of 
men who die on the job.

3694
02:41:56,430 --> 02:41:57,610
It's,
it's staggering.

3695
02:41:57,611 --> 02:42:00,530
But that's my point with the feminist 
thing where it's kind of this,

3696
02:42:00,531 --> 02:42:01,680
this is why it's,
there'll be like,

3697
02:42:01,681 --> 02:42:03,120
well,
we're just for equality.

3698
02:42:03,210 --> 02:42:03,721
It's like,
okay,

3699
02:42:03,721 --> 02:42:04,554
well if you're just for equality,
how come I never hear about how the 

3700
02:42:06,541 --> 02:42:07,374
death,
the workplace death rate is like 

3701
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:10,590
disproportionately men.
I don't mean disproportionately,

3702
02:42:10,591 --> 02:42:12,180
a little bit.
It's like over 90 percent.

3703
02:42:12,460 --> 02:42:14,970
Then about prison sentencing differences
though.

3704
02:42:15,050 --> 02:42:16,620
These are major,
major things,

3705
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:19,440
but people die or get thrown in a cage,
but we,

3706
02:42:19,441 --> 02:42:21,120
you know,
that doesn't come up at all because it's

3707
02:42:21,121 --> 02:42:21,954
like if it's black men they look,
well that's right then and only then 

3708
02:42:24,571 --> 02:42:25,081
okay,
because,

3709
02:42:25,081 --> 02:42:25,914
but then of course it's also gotta be 
like the white racism white male and 

3710
02:42:28,930 --> 02:42:30,220
that's linked with the fee.

3711
02:42:30,450 --> 02:42:32,340
The woman's struggle.
Like the black struggle,

3712
02:42:32,341 --> 02:42:34,020
like they've kind of piggybacked onto 
that.

3713
02:42:34,050 --> 02:42:39,050
They should take it back on to Lbgtq w.
well they kind of are.

3714
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:41,090
I mean I hear that all the time.
I actually,

3715
02:42:41,091 --> 02:42:44,160
I heard one person on Msnbc and they 
were like,

3716
02:42:44,161 --> 02:42:44,994
we just care about the rights of,
of women and minorities and lgbt people 

3717
02:42:48,511 --> 02:42:50,490
and immigrants and something else.
And I was like,

3718
02:42:50,580 --> 02:42:53,910
just say not white men.
Can I just save you some time?

3719
02:42:54,130 --> 02:42:58,770
Say Not Straight CIS white men.
We don't everyone else your name in them

3720
02:42:58,771 --> 02:43:00,300
all in groups.
So just say it like,

3721
02:43:00,301 --> 02:43:01,134
just cut to the chase just for time.
And they're doing it to align 

3722
02:43:02,971 --> 02:43:03,804
themselves.
They're doing it to align themselves 

3723
02:43:04,921 --> 02:43:07,020
with other people that are going to have
their back and agree with them when they

3724
02:43:07,021 --> 02:43:10,860
go to war with it that way because the 
truth behind them,

3725
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:12,100
like what you said before,

3726
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:13,690
that where you go,
if there's any barriers,

3727
02:43:13,691 --> 02:43:14,524
let's remove that.
But then you get to a certain point 

3728
02:43:15,431 --> 02:43:16,870
where you're just like,
if we're being honest,

3729
02:43:16,871 --> 02:43:20,270
there are no real barriers.
There are no real barriers to,

3730
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,030
to and,
and,

3731
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,800
and if there are,
let's go after them.

3732
02:43:23,801 --> 02:43:25,810
But just on the big picture,
like talking about things,

3733
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:30,960
if you're like a woman who really wants 
to do something in 2017 in a first world

3734
02:43:31,661 --> 02:43:33,280
country like the United States of 
America,

3735
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:36,490
I don't see.
I mean there are laws against paying,

3736
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:38,800
uh,
a woman less than a man at the same job.

3737
02:43:38,801 --> 02:43:41,550
There are all these rules that are lots 
of people who will like,

3738
02:43:41,590 --> 02:43:43,400
like actually bend over backwards 
[inaudible].

3739
02:43:43,401 --> 02:43:46,030
They're really looking to have like a,
a,

3740
02:43:46,070 --> 02:43:46,871
you know,
diversity.

3741
02:43:46,871 --> 02:43:47,704
Like corporations really love diversity.
Everyone in show business knows that's 

3742
02:43:50,171 --> 02:43:52,360
true.
So it's like,

3743
02:43:52,361 --> 02:43:54,040
okay,
I don't see a real barrier.

3744
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:56,050
But then when you do,
when they can't find one,

3745
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:59,350
they'll,
they'll kind of create this barrier that

3746
02:43:59,351 --> 02:44:00,184
you can't say.
So if we give people a bunch of freedom 

3747
02:44:02,231 --> 02:44:03,910
and then women make certain choices in 
men,

3748
02:44:03,911 --> 02:44:04,744
make certain choices in this leads to,
on average men making 23 percent more 

3749
02:44:07,661 --> 02:44:09,100
than women.
Then they go,

3750
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:10,750
well,
and I go,

3751
02:44:10,751 --> 02:44:11,471
well,
there's no barrier.

3752
02:44:11,471 --> 02:44:12,670
It's just women making choices.
They go,

3753
02:44:12,671 --> 02:44:13,900
well,
well there's this,

3754
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:17,590
this barrier called Patriarchy that's 
somehow,

3755
02:44:17,700 --> 02:44:18,640
you know,
and we've got to like,

3756
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:22,380
it's because these women have been 
socialized into thinking that they're.

3757
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:25,840
So then they'll find this thing that you
can't prove or disprove.

3758
02:44:25,841 --> 02:44:27,850
You can't test it.
Just kind of like.

3759
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:29,720
But we live in a rape culture,
right?

3760
02:44:29,770 --> 02:44:31,540
It's like fighting terrorism,
the war on terror.

3761
02:44:31,541 --> 02:44:32,470
It's the same shit.
It's like,

3762
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:33,430
well,
if it's just an idea,

3763
02:44:33,431 --> 02:44:35,110
I guess we're always fighting that idea.

3764
02:44:35,890 --> 02:44:36,723
And until women assume the power 
position and there's a disproportion of 

3765
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:41,493
number of women in Congress and this 
proportionate number of women who are 

3766
02:44:44,141 --> 02:44:46,390
police officers and women who are 
judges,

3767
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:47,243
women,
her lawyers and when they were in all 

3768
02:44:48,551 --> 02:44:49,384
positions of power,
if men feel the heavy boot of the 

3769
02:44:52,391 --> 02:44:55,900
oppressive woman until then until fuck 
up.

3770
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:57,940
And it's so.
It's all so ridiculous.

3771
02:44:58,570 --> 02:45:00,710
It's just all so silly.
It's like what?

3772
02:45:00,711 --> 02:45:05,170
What area of life is there where things 
are proportionately representative while

3773
02:45:05,171 --> 02:45:06,860
black people in basketball?
No,

3774
02:45:06,870 --> 02:45:08,970
not unproportionate.
I'm saying proportionately.

3775
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:11,110
So they don't make up 13 percent of 
basketball.

3776
02:45:11,111 --> 02:45:11,944
Yeah.
Like they make,

3777
02:45:12,010 --> 02:45:13,300
they make up.
I mean it's like where,

3778
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:16,600
where do you find racist?
We need to even that out.

3779
02:45:16,630 --> 02:45:17,470
Yes,
absolutely.

3780
02:45:17,530 --> 02:45:21,070
More white people and Asians and whites 
and down a little bit.

3781
02:45:21,130 --> 02:45:23,020
Make it easier to follow.
Yeah.

3782
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:24,850
More black people in hockey.

3783
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:28,510
That's a mess.
But it's all just so it's all so fucking

3784
02:45:28,511 --> 02:45:32,580
like we should celebrate the differences
we have and just don't be.

3785
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:34,720
Don't be racist.
That's it.

3786
02:45:34,730 --> 02:45:36,790
Now let's say don't be sexist,
don't be racist,

3787
02:45:36,791 --> 02:45:37,624
but you don't get Brownie points just 
because you're a chick you don't know 

3788
02:45:40,241 --> 02:45:41,074
and you shouldn't,
you shouldn't get into this thing where 

3789
02:45:42,161 --> 02:45:42,994
it's like,
and I know it's like I've heard like 

3790
02:45:44,981 --> 02:45:45,814
people particularly like a left wing 
leading feminists or like female comics 

3791
02:45:51,461 --> 02:45:52,294
who are feminists,
who I know several of them out without 

3792
02:45:56,890 --> 02:45:58,300
calling out by name,
but uh,

3793
02:45:58,480 --> 02:45:59,620
but I've,
I've heard and they'll,

3794
02:45:59,650 --> 02:46:01,840
they'll get very.
And one of them said to me once they go,

3795
02:46:01,841 --> 02:46:02,261
you know,
Dave,

3796
02:46:02,261 --> 02:46:04,030
you're whole thing is just that you hate
women.

3797
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:04,993
Oh,
like,

3798
02:46:05,250 --> 02:46:06,083
but it's like hate women.
Like what do you saw women say that to 

3799
02:46:07,961 --> 02:46:08,990
Brian and you?

3800
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:10,310
Nobody said it was hilarious.
He goes,

3801
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:12,170
you know what?
I've heard that before.

3802
02:46:12,171 --> 02:46:17,171
And every woman that said that I hated 
it was a great response because it was a

3803
02:46:18,261 --> 02:46:19,540
stupid argument.
It is.

3804
02:46:19,541 --> 02:46:22,310
She was just like saying like a blanket 
statement.

3805
02:46:22,311 --> 02:46:23,490
You hate women.
No,

3806
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:25,370
no you.
But I just go.

3807
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:29,330
I challenged a lot of people on,
on the left who,

3808
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:32,150
who talk about race or sexism in these 
things.

3809
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:33,013
I just challenge you to to just 
entertain the possibility for like one 

3810
02:46:37,701 --> 02:46:38,534
second,
entertain the possibility that you're 

3811
02:46:40,611 --> 02:46:41,444
not right about all of this stuff and 
that the correct position is to treat 

3812
02:46:44,330 --> 02:46:46,670
everybody equal.
Now I know that sounds really,

3813
02:46:46,671 --> 02:46:48,800
really wild and out there,
and I'm not taking into account my white

3814
02:46:48,801 --> 02:46:49,634
privilege and the history,
but just entertain for one second the 

3815
02:46:51,201 --> 02:46:52,034
possibility that the correct answer is 
to treat everybody equal and not judge 

3816
02:46:54,831 --> 02:46:55,700
them based on their race.

3817
02:46:55,790 --> 02:46:57,710
And then you,
if you entertain that for one second,

3818
02:46:57,800 --> 02:46:59,000
you'll start realizing like,
oh,

3819
02:46:59,001 --> 02:47:00,470
holy shit,
if that's true,

3820
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:02,540
I'm really the one being the biggest 
here.

3821
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:04,250
I've seen this.
So like,

3822
02:47:04,251 --> 02:47:05,084
uh,
um,

3823
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:08,060
if you know the roast battle shows at 
the comedy store here,

3824
02:47:08,061 --> 02:47:10,130
it goes up and they started doing them 
in New York too.

3825
02:47:10,131 --> 02:47:10,964
Now they're really popular.
There are like these group of female 

3826
02:47:13,401 --> 02:47:16,430
comics that will come out and I don't 
even begrudge them for this,

3827
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:17,443
but they'll come out and just hardcore 
like root for the female comic like 

3828
02:47:20,940 --> 02:47:21,773
there they'll post about like just want 
to see more women succeed at roast 

3829
02:47:23,451 --> 02:47:25,610
battle coming out tonight to cheer on my
girl,

3830
02:47:25,611 --> 02:47:26,444
Blah Blah,
and there'll be this dynamic where like 

3831
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:29,000
their first two jokes,
you know,

3832
02:47:29,001 --> 02:47:30,650
they'll just get this like it's just 
like,

3833
02:47:30,651 --> 02:47:31,484
you know,
female voices from the corner where the 

3834
02:47:33,501 --> 02:47:36,330
comics hang like super,
super loud for,

3835
02:47:36,430 --> 02:47:38,120
for the chick comic and like whatever.

3836
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:39,410
I don't begrudge them anything like,
fine,

3837
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:41,480
come do that.
But it's just like those same people who

3838
02:47:41,481 --> 02:47:43,040
will be like,
you're like against women.

3839
02:47:43,041 --> 02:47:47,780
Like I would never in a million years go
out to a show and be like,

3840
02:47:47,810 --> 02:47:52,060
I'm just rooting for the men today.
Like I don't think this way.

3841
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:55,700
I'm not like on team man,
but you are on team women.

3842
02:47:55,820 --> 02:47:56,653
Like it's just,
it just seems to me that there's a lot 

3843
02:47:58,311 --> 02:47:59,780
of that going on.
You know what I mean?

3844
02:48:00,220 --> 02:48:01,053
That shit where it's like you kind of 
project this thing that you see racism 

3845
02:48:04,581 --> 02:48:05,414
everywhere or you see sexism everywhere,
but all I really see is you fucking 

3846
02:48:08,631 --> 02:48:09,464
lecturing people based on race.
In their mind they're allowed to do it 

3847
02:48:11,721 --> 02:48:14,690
the same way Cain Velasquez allowed to 
have brown pride and his chest.

3848
02:48:14,970 --> 02:48:16,340
Yeah.
Kinda the same thing.

3849
02:48:16,370 --> 02:48:20,390
Like you're,
you're disenfranchised or marginalized,

3850
02:48:20,391 --> 02:48:21,560
so you're allowed to stay.

3851
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:22,423
Even if you're not you playing that 
victim card as a woman and you're 

3852
02:48:25,371 --> 02:48:27,110
allowed to say,
I'm here to support my girl.

3853
02:48:27,450 --> 02:48:28,940
Like I was talking about this on stage 
of the day.

3854
02:48:28,941 --> 02:48:31,880
I saw a bumper sticker on a car and said
girls kick ass.

3855
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:34,100
And I was like,
some of them,

3856
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:36,710
yeah,
some of them are lazy slobs equity.

3857
02:48:36,730 --> 02:48:39,980
Going to align yourself with 150 million
women just in this country alone.

3858
02:48:39,981 --> 02:48:40,814
That's ridiculous.
He was saying if a guy had a bumper 

3859
02:48:42,351 --> 02:48:44,300
sticker,
it said boys kick ass.

3860
02:48:44,660 --> 02:48:45,493
He'd be like,
follow that guy and find out where he's 

3861
02:48:46,731 --> 02:48:48,650
been fucking these kids because first of
all,

3862
02:48:48,651 --> 02:48:51,410
you'd never say boys,
boys kick ass.

3863
02:48:51,411 --> 02:48:52,770
You put that into your bumper.
Sit.

3864
02:48:52,771 --> 02:48:54,530
What the fuck are you?
You'd pull them over.

3865
02:48:54,531 --> 02:48:55,850
Let me see your license.
Where do you live,

3866
02:48:55,851 --> 02:48:57,050
man?
What do you do for a living?

3867
02:48:57,270 --> 02:49:00,050
What's that bumper sticker about?
What the fuck do you mean by that?

3868
02:49:00,110 --> 02:49:02,390
Yes,
and I don't need like I almost feel like

3869
02:49:02,391 --> 02:49:05,140
an asshole sometimes where I preface 
everything with a disclaimer like,

3870
02:49:05,150 --> 02:49:07,980
and I'm not saying this and I'm not,
but I just want it to be clear

3871
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,620
that I'm not saying there aren't 
exceptions to the rule,

3872
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:14,040
but it's also kind of strange to me that
like if you want to celebrate women,

3873
02:49:14,190 --> 02:49:16,770
why are you celebrating such a masculine
quality?

3874
02:49:16,890 --> 02:49:18,030
Like it's kind of like,
it's like,

3875
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:18,923
look,
there are white players who are great 

3876
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:20,730
basketball players,
right?

3877
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:23,580
There are the Levitsky was an amazing 
basketball player,

3878
02:49:23,710 --> 02:49:26,760
but if I just wrote some like white 
people kick ass at basketball,

3879
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:27,953
it's like,
well actually that movie tone in 

3880
02:49:30,511 --> 02:49:32,550
general,
women don't kick ass in general.

3881
02:49:32,730 --> 02:49:35,070
Generally speaking,
that's a male thing to do.

3882
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:37,020
So I'm not saying there's not exceptions
to that,

3883
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:37,854
but you're like,
you're writing white people kick ass in 

3884
02:49:39,271 --> 02:49:40,860
basketball.
It's kind of misleading,

3885
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:41,790
right?
Well,

3886
02:49:41,791 --> 02:49:42,624
there's that thing that's coming out,
that movie with Steve Carell where he 

3887
02:49:44,761 --> 02:49:45,594
plays a,
that man who had a basketball tennis 

3888
02:49:47,431 --> 02:49:50,490
match against Billie Jean King and he 
was like barely ranked,

3889
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:51,393
who's terrible tennis player and he fuck
Billie Jean King up and it was and he 

3890
02:49:54,121 --> 02:49:56,160
was like,
sort of mocking her the whole way and it

3891
02:49:56,161 --> 02:49:57,940
was like a real hallmark,
right?

3892
02:49:57,960 --> 02:49:58,793
I don't know about that.
He just played professional tennis 

3893
02:50:02,461 --> 02:50:03,294
player,
but he wasn't the best and Billie Jean 

3894
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:05,213
King was the best woman in the world and
they played and the Steve Carell 

3895
02:50:07,861 --> 02:50:10,050
character beater is now was not what 
happened.

3896
02:50:11,220 --> 02:50:12,620
I believe that's what happened.
I'm,

3897
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:15,390
I'm getting them conflated with Renee 
Richards,

3898
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:16,253
the guy who used to be a man and then 
became a transgender woman and starts 

3899
02:50:19,011 --> 02:50:22,110
stomping everybody in tennis is a 
terrible as a man.

3900
02:50:22,290 --> 02:50:24,450
And then it became a woman who was one 
of the best of the world,

3901
02:50:24,890 --> 02:50:28,140
but there's no biological difference.
Even without a penis,

3902
02:50:28,141 --> 02:50:31,260
you still stomping on it again is like 
so funny because once you.

3903
02:50:31,330 --> 02:50:32,163
It's so funny,
like how much this stuff starts 

3904
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:37,130
undermining their own arguments.
Billy Jean King One.

3905
02:50:37,390 --> 02:50:38,360
Okay.
I get that wrong.

3906
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:40,460
So I got wrong.
The Renee Richard One.

3907
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:41,730
Yeah,
that's what I could fuse.

3908
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:43,110
So,
um,

3909
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:44,100
what was the.

3910
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:46,260
And he was like particularly Gross,
right?

3911
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:47,183
And Steve Carell plays them really well 
and movie same Steve Corral who played 

3912
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:55,740
that crazy guy in that wrestling.
He did a really great job with a story.

3913
02:50:55,770 --> 02:50:59,090
What a crazy story that espn 30 for 30 
on the side too.

3914
02:50:59,110 --> 02:51:00,190
Good man.
You know,

3915
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:01,373
not a good in the sense that the stories
are just such a compelling unbelievable 

3916
02:51:04,801 --> 02:51:05,790
story.
Oh my God.

3917
02:51:05,820 --> 02:51:06,653
Yeah.
So when Steve Carell played that 

3918
02:51:08,341 --> 02:51:10,790
character and then you watch the video 
video,

3919
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:12,960
the actual character that like,
whoa,

3920
02:51:12,961 --> 02:51:15,260
like he just nailed that guy.
Steve Curls.

3921
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:16,123
Incredible talent.
He's such a good fucking act to be that 

3922
02:51:19,021 --> 02:51:19,854
funny of a comedian.
And that good of a dramatic actor 

3923
02:51:21,370 --> 02:51:22,650
spoken.
Pretty incredible.

3924
02:51:22,800 --> 02:51:24,810
I guess it's comedy though,
is always kind of his acting,

3925
02:51:24,811 --> 02:51:26,460
you know,
is like that's his strength and comedy.

3926
02:51:26,461 --> 02:51:28,570
Like he owned that character,
you know.

3927
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:30,360
Well Roger Federer said that recently.

3928
02:51:30,390 --> 02:51:31,260
He got in trouble,
right?

3929
02:51:31,261 --> 02:51:33,030
That the best women.
No,

3930
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:35,020
it wasn't,
it wasn't the older guy.

3931
02:51:36,390 --> 02:51:39,540
Fuck John McEnroe mock McEnroe said 
that,

3932
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:41,490
and they let us,
they let him into it.

3933
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:44,430
He said he,
he started by saying Serena was the best

3934
02:51:44,431 --> 02:51:47,370
female player and then they go,
why female?

3935
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:48,180
Oh,
well.

3936
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:48,661
And he was like,
well,

3937
02:51:48,661 --> 02:51:49,494
what do you mean I,
because I think she's the best female 

3938
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:51,361
player goes,
well,

3939
02:51:51,361 --> 02:51:53,060
why female?
Why not say male egos?

3940
02:51:53,130 --> 02:51:53,963
Because the men are way better.
He was literally just answering the 

3941
02:51:56,911 --> 02:51:57,744
question,
started off giving this woman in 

3942
02:51:59,150 --> 02:52:01,420
extraordinary compliment.
That was the story I remember.

3943
02:52:01,470 --> 02:52:04,770
Didn't serina play against an unranked 
male player?

3944
02:52:04,930 --> 02:52:05,763
She did.
They used to play when they were 

3945
02:52:06,701 --> 02:52:08,010
younger.
I think she,

3946
02:52:08,290 --> 02:52:09,123
she played against some guy that was the
story and the guy kicked her ass and 

3947
02:52:11,861 --> 02:52:12,880
everybody was like,
what?

3948
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,880
It just seems to me to be this thing 
where I kind of look at,

3949
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:16,743
obviously we're talking in 
generalizations here and there are 

3950
02:52:18,521 --> 02:52:20,200
exceptions like,
you know what I'm saying?

3951
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:21,370
Like there are like,
you know,

3952
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:22,263
uh,
a Rhonda Rousey could beat the shit out 

3953
02:52:23,711 --> 02:52:27,460
of me as an example,
but it's a bad example,

3954
02:52:27,461 --> 02:52:28,510
but I'm not a fighter.
No,

3955
02:52:28,570 --> 02:52:31,930
but I'm just making the point that like 
if you have this stereotype that men are

3956
02:52:31,931 --> 02:52:33,250
stronger than women or something like 
that.

3957
02:52:33,251 --> 02:52:35,250
There are exceptions to the rule if you 
get.

3958
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:36,250
And there are,
there are.

3959
02:52:36,450 --> 02:52:38,740
I still use Ronda Rousey even though 
she's not championing more,

3960
02:52:38,741 --> 02:52:40,900
she's just still got that ring to it.
Um,

3961
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:42,760
but I'm saying there are exceptions to 
the rule.

3962
02:52:42,940 --> 02:52:43,773
There are exceptions and,
and to treat someone based on a group 

3963
02:52:46,871 --> 02:52:49,710
dynamic is,
is ignorant like to.

3964
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:52,660
But if you're going to like.
I do think there are differences between

3965
02:52:52,661 --> 02:52:53,494
men and women generally speaking and if 
you believe that it's like if we're 

3966
02:52:56,411 --> 02:52:57,244
going to celebrate women,
I just think it's kind of odd that we 

3967
02:52:59,531 --> 02:53:02,650
have to celebrate the most masculine 
achievements of women.

3968
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:03,633
It's like celebrating them kicking ass.
There are these things that I feel like 

3969
02:53:06,041 --> 02:53:09,730
women are superior to men in that I'm 
very impressed by them.

3970
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:11,230
Like I,
I just think women.

3971
02:53:11,290 --> 02:53:12,123
Hold on,
let me stop you because you think that 

3972
02:53:12,910 --> 02:53:16,840
running a corporation is masculine,
like do you think that being involved in

3973
02:53:16,841 --> 02:53:17,674
any creative endeavor is masculine?
I think that being involved in anything 

3974
02:53:19,960 --> 02:53:22,810
in tech is masculine.
Know what they're talking about.

3975
02:53:22,820 --> 02:53:23,653
Well,
I was more responding to the women kick 

3976
02:53:25,751 --> 02:53:27,580
ass.
That's just stupid bumper sticker.

3977
02:53:27,610 --> 02:53:28,011
No,
you're right.

3978
02:53:28,011 --> 02:53:31,290
It is really a group thing is.
I think my issue with it was if,

3979
02:53:31,370 --> 02:53:33,650
if you see things like um,
well I just did,

3980
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:34,493
but the element I'm responding to is 
that kick ass to me it just seems to be 

3981
02:53:36,431 --> 02:53:39,280
kind of like a masculine thing.
I'm describing that as masculine.

3982
02:53:39,310 --> 02:53:41,170
Yeah.
It was just one silly stupid bumper.

3983
02:53:41,660 --> 02:53:43,440
Like to say those things,
right?

3984
02:53:43,441 --> 02:53:43,991
Yes.
Yes.

3985
02:53:43,991 --> 02:53:45,430
But I just think there's something about
it.

3986
02:53:45,431 --> 02:53:46,264
It seems to me like the nurturing 
element of femininity is almost like 

3987
02:53:49,361 --> 02:53:50,194
denigrated and the ass kissy asked kicky
element is like his praise where it's 

3988
02:53:55,051 --> 02:53:58,660
like if I'm talking kicking ass and 
nurture and I'm talking men,

3989
02:53:58,661 --> 02:54:03,160
verse women in general,
just broad speaking like I tend to think

3990
02:54:03,161 --> 02:54:05,680
of one being male and one being a 
female,

3991
02:54:05,730 --> 02:54:06,563
right?
To wrap this all up and bring it all 

3992
02:54:07,420 --> 02:54:08,253
day.
I think we'd all be better off male 

3993
02:54:10,031 --> 02:54:10,811
women,
White,

3994
02:54:10,811 --> 02:54:11,621
black,
Asian,

3995
02:54:11,621 --> 02:54:13,660
whatever.
If we just reasonable nice people,

3996
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:14,553
you know,
and that's the real problem is that we 

3997
02:54:15,940 --> 02:54:16,773
lock off as we've been discussing all,
all day into these camps and we are on 

3998
02:54:21,401 --> 02:54:22,234
camp white male and we are on camp 
blackmail or camp gay or transgender or 

3999
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:28,133
camp woman and we just locked into these
ideologies and we hate anybody else 

4000
02:54:31,361 --> 02:54:32,194
different and we have these divisive 
things that we say like all white men 

4001
02:54:36,011 --> 02:54:38,090
are trash unless proven otherwise,
you know,

4002
02:54:38,091 --> 02:54:39,430
like that kind of crazy shit.

4003
02:54:39,430 --> 02:54:40,720
Like you're,
you're setting it up.

4004
02:54:40,721 --> 02:54:41,860
So the guys like,
sorry,

4005
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:43,000
sorry.
Like you come in,

4006
02:54:43,001 --> 02:54:44,460
sorry,
do it.

4007
02:54:44,830 --> 02:54:45,663
I didn't do it.
Instead of just being a reasonable 

4008
02:54:46,841 --> 02:54:48,970
normal person,
but there's not enough reasonable,

4009
02:54:48,971 --> 02:54:49,804
normal people,
so women are constantly dealing with 

4010
02:54:51,011 --> 02:54:51,844
assholes,
so they develop these kinds of behavior 

4011
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:54,423
patterns of behavior.
They think about men as being these 

4012
02:54:56,561 --> 02:54:57,394
intrusive,
shitty people just want to get in your 

4013
02:54:59,201 --> 02:55:00,034
pants and really don't care about you 
and they're manipulative and they just 

4014
02:55:01,551 --> 02:55:03,460
want to fuck you.
Which when do you say it,

4015
02:55:03,470 --> 02:55:04,303
I mean that it's somewhat true to 
describe and then men think of women as 

4016
02:55:06,621 --> 02:55:08,570
being manipulative too.
Always looking for the bigger,

4017
02:55:08,571 --> 02:55:09,404
better deal.
You know where they're going to fuck 

4018
02:55:10,491 --> 02:55:14,000
their personal trainer while you're at 
work and we think about getting divorced

4019
02:55:14,001 --> 02:55:16,260
and losing all your money because you 
were too stupid.

4020
02:55:16,290 --> 02:55:17,930
You didn't sign a prenuptial agreement.

4021
02:55:17,930 --> 02:55:18,763
She has some kick ass attorney and then 
you're fucked and we all know guys who 

4022
02:55:21,651 --> 02:55:25,100
have experienced that before too,
that she lies about you beating the kids

4023
02:55:25,101 --> 02:55:27,350
and then she gets full custody.
That's all real,

4024
02:55:27,351 --> 02:55:29,290
but then the good stuff is all real.
To know what I mean.

4025
02:55:29,291 --> 02:55:32,540
It's real and that does happen,
but then there's also like the chick who

4026
02:55:32,541 --> 02:55:34,190
just like gives a guy like,
you know,

4027
02:55:34,191 --> 02:55:36,650
like the security and competence.
He never had to go be great.

4028
02:55:36,651 --> 02:55:37,484
There's the guy who does support his 
chick through like her endeavors and 

4029
02:55:40,011 --> 02:55:40,311
like,
you know,

4030
02:55:40,311 --> 02:55:41,530
it's like,
it's like you got it,

4031
02:55:41,531 --> 02:55:41,961
you know,
it's like,

4032
02:55:41,961 --> 02:55:44,510
it's like that shouldn't in the 
hurricane in Houston.

4033
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:46,820
Kind of put some perspective on that for
me where it's like,

4034
02:55:46,821 --> 02:55:47,654
you know,
it's like you see just like all these 

4035
02:55:48,321 --> 02:55:49,154
people,
it's like Antifa versus Nazis as the 

4036
02:55:50,571 --> 02:55:52,360
state of the country and then you see 
like this,

4037
02:55:52,390 --> 02:55:55,550
this horrible hurricane happened and 
just the acts of kindness after,

4038
02:55:55,551 --> 02:55:56,660
when you see these people,
like,

4039
02:55:56,720 --> 02:55:58,000
like young guys,
like,

4040
02:55:58,030 --> 02:56:00,380
like these group of like 20 year olds 
maybe they were,

4041
02:56:00,381 --> 02:56:01,040
I saw took.

4042
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:01,873
They're like,
they're like a motor boats down to 

4043
02:56:04,041 --> 02:56:06,980
Houston and are pulling old people out 
of their homes and you're like,

4044
02:56:06,981 --> 02:56:08,080
God damn it,
motherfucker.

4045
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:09,980
Like that's our country too,
you know?

4046
02:56:09,990 --> 02:56:10,823
And like,
like it,

4047
02:56:10,870 --> 02:56:12,860
it's all like the Nazis are our country 
too.

4048
02:56:13,010 --> 02:56:14,080
But that guys,
our country,

4049
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:17,390
that is also as people responding to a 
very real problem,

4050
02:56:17,391 --> 02:56:18,224
we're really unites people.
They feel like they have to help each 

4051
02:56:19,851 --> 02:56:20,684
other because it's a weird problem.
Most of the time we're separated from 

4052
02:56:22,791 --> 02:56:23,624
each other by buildings and cars and 
there's this weird alienation we have 

4053
02:56:26,601 --> 02:56:27,434
with one another.
It's one of the reasons why places of 

4054
02:56:29,361 --> 02:56:30,194
high density you get much more liberal 
ideologies or liberal in terms of 

4055
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:34,760
accepting,
I should say,

4056
02:56:34,761 --> 02:56:35,594
not necessarily conservative,
but there's a lot of that to a 

4057
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:40,490
democratic versus conservative or left 
wing versus conservative.

4058
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:44,060
But these big population culture is 
people interact with each other more.

4059
02:56:44,270 --> 02:56:46,340
You know,
you don't get the same kind of racism,

4060
02:56:46,341 --> 02:56:47,174
you know,
you get less and it's less accepted I 

4061
02:56:48,861 --> 02:56:49,694
think in like maybe say New York City 
and probably anywhere because in New 

4062
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:53,661
York City,
especially in Manhattan,

4063
02:56:53,661 --> 02:56:55,850
everybody's got to interact.
Not saying you don't encounter it.

4064
02:56:55,851 --> 02:56:58,790
You certainly do sides.
White racism,

4065
02:56:58,791 --> 02:57:00,590
black racism.
You're gonna encounter racism,

4066
02:57:00,610 --> 02:57:04,310
pizza flaw in human nature.
That's the same thing that we're talking

4067
02:57:04,311 --> 02:57:06,410
about with the assholes of the Tiki 
torches.

4068
02:57:06,630 --> 02:57:07,463
It's a flaw.
Everyone likes to feel like they're the 

4069
02:57:08,991 --> 02:57:09,824
best and my team is the best at my local
bar is the best and my aunt makes the 

4070
02:57:13,371 --> 02:57:16,250
best chili towns and it's like,
no,

4071
02:57:16,251 --> 02:57:17,990
your aunt does not make the world's Best
Chili.

4072
02:57:17,991 --> 02:57:19,130
That's fucking ridiculous.
It's,

4073
02:57:19,170 --> 02:57:19,910
it's,
you know,

4074
02:57:19,910 --> 02:57:22,310
the odds are very against it.
Let's just say it's a very,

4075
02:57:22,311 --> 02:57:24,320
very low chance to prove it,
but people.

4076
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:25,183
Right.
But people want to feel that way and so 

4077
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:28,173
there will always be these certain kinds
of in group preference things where 

4078
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:31,000
there's.

4079
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:32,240
But like you said,
there are.

4080
02:57:32,330 --> 02:57:34,910
I do think like growing up in New York 
City,

4081
02:57:34,911 --> 02:57:35,744
you also just see,
and this is the beautiful thing that we 

4082
02:57:37,551 --> 02:57:39,440
fucking lost in America.
That sucks,

4083
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:43,670
but it's like freedom does fucking bring
people together and capitalism,

4084
02:57:43,671 --> 02:57:44,504
even though it's become a dirty word,
like all that shit brings people 

4085
02:57:45,951 --> 02:57:46,700
together,
man.

4086
02:57:46,700 --> 02:57:50,210
Like I'm a Jew and I can go in a New 
York City Street and put my hand out and

4087
02:57:50,211 --> 02:57:51,044
like a Muslim guy comes and picks me up 
and drops me off at home and just use 

4088
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:56,470
uber.
Do you wasting your time with all that?

4089
02:57:56,540 --> 02:57:57,321
I mean,
to be honest,

4090
02:57:57,321 --> 02:57:59,590
I really do use Uber,
but Uber,

4091
02:57:59,820 --> 02:58:02,550
I uh,
I was doing lyft and now I just switched

4092
02:58:02,551 --> 02:58:03,384
over to uber.
Do you feel bad that Uber was getting 

4093
02:58:04,441 --> 02:58:05,274
locked out of London?
Like I'm going to step up and help out 

4094
02:58:06,540 --> 02:58:07,130
uber?

4095
02:58:07,130 --> 02:58:10,080
I don't know about that.
I knew they're locked out of Austin.

4096
02:58:10,081 --> 02:58:11,250
I think Austin,
Austin,

4097
02:58:11,251 --> 02:58:12,540
Texas,
they left there.

4098
02:58:12,541 --> 02:58:14,070
I think they're locked out of London 
now.

4099
02:58:14,071 --> 02:58:17,100
I think the marriage you said that the 
way they operate socks fuck off.

4100
02:58:17,220 --> 02:58:18,053
Well,
I do.

4101
02:58:18,520 --> 02:58:20,840
I love anything that undermines 
government monopoly.

4102
02:58:20,860 --> 02:58:23,430
So I thought that was great that they 
undermined that home medallion thing.

4103
02:58:23,440 --> 02:58:24,273
I think it's like,
I think technology that undermines the 

4104
02:58:25,921 --> 02:58:27,570
government is the most beautiful thing 
ever.

4105
02:58:27,571 --> 02:58:29,910
As you know,
that ways app,

4106
02:58:30,250 --> 02:58:30,790
uh,
they,

4107
02:58:30,790 --> 02:58:31,623
they have that now in New York City.
They'll tell you if there's a camera on 

4108
02:58:34,381 --> 02:58:37,200
the next red light,
they'll tell you if there's a cop on the

4109
02:58:37,201 --> 02:58:38,970
highway waiting the check,
you know,

4110
02:58:38,971 --> 02:58:39,804
like there'll be like police ahead.
So there's literally the system where 

4111
02:58:41,551 --> 02:58:44,070
the cops,
cops will sit there and wait for someone

4112
02:58:44,071 --> 02:58:44,880
to come,
you know,

4113
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,380
speeding so they can come,
you know,

4114
02:58:46,420 --> 02:58:48,390
extort you for some money and understand
how that works.

4115
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:50,490
The waste thing that it's just people 
calling in.

4116
02:58:50,491 --> 02:58:53,850
So cops calling fake cars.
I did not know that,

4117
02:58:53,851 --> 02:58:56,730
but I know that I knew that it was other
people calling in very upset because the

4118
02:58:56,731 --> 02:59:01,080
police officers actually call in fake 
cop on the side of the road calls.

4119
02:59:01,110 --> 02:59:01,943
But.
So what is that doing?

4120
02:59:01,950 --> 02:59:04,050
Making people drive the speed limit.
Fucks it up.

4121
02:59:04,060 --> 02:59:05,220
It's a car.
It's crying wolf.

4122
02:59:05,250 --> 02:59:07,200
So you basically just don't believe it 
as much anymore.

4123
02:59:07,220 --> 02:59:08,940
It's interesting.
But I thought there was something really

4124
02:59:08,941 --> 02:59:12,110
beautiful about that server protect.
I get to know.

4125
02:59:12,140 --> 02:59:17,140
I mean that's the third thing.
Protect and rule and take you out.

4126
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:19,030
Yeah.
But I,

4127
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:20,033
I thought when they first did it,
what a beautiful thing that you're 

4128
02:59:21,631 --> 02:59:22,381
going.
Because look,

4129
02:59:22,381 --> 02:59:23,640
if you,
if you,

4130
02:59:23,641 --> 02:59:25,720
uh,
if you tell them there's a cop ahead,

4131
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:27,570
what you're going to do is make sure 
you're not speeding.

4132
02:59:27,570 --> 02:59:30,240
I mean that's the only trick.
So essentially it's doing what you would

4133
02:59:30,241 --> 02:59:31,074
claim the law wants you to do.
It's just doing it in a way where the 

4134
02:59:32,761 --> 02:59:34,740
state doesn't fucking extort,
you know,

4135
02:59:34,830 --> 02:59:35,930
of course.
So then they'll start going out,

4136
02:59:35,931 --> 02:59:37,860
we've got to fuck with that.
I did not let that work.

4137
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:38,753
Yeah.
They'll eventually figure out a way 

4138
02:59:39,631 --> 02:59:40,464
around that or we're going to get to a 
point I think in our lifetimes where 

4139
02:59:43,081 --> 02:59:43,914
it's impossible to lie.
I think that's where it's headed and I 

4140
02:59:45,901 --> 02:59:48,180
think that's gonna solve a lot of our 
issues socially,

4141
02:59:48,430 --> 02:59:49,740
a lot of very.
She's politically,

4142
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:50,633
we're going to understand motivations 
behind things in a way like maybe 

4143
02:59:53,131 --> 02:59:56,190
motivations will seem color coded.
That is when someone's envious,

4144
02:59:56,210 --> 02:59:58,470
you literally see green with some new 
program.

4145
02:59:58,471 --> 03:00:01,280
We're all running.
I think what you're sit like,

4146
03:00:01,290 --> 03:00:04,470
we've already started to see it and it's
like it's much,

4147
03:00:04,471 --> 03:00:05,304
much harder.

4148
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:06,233
I think that it's much,
much harder for people to pull off 

4149
03:00:07,861 --> 03:00:08,694
lying.
It was much harder for Hillary Clinton 

4150
03:00:09,780 --> 03:00:10,613
to pull off then for traditional 
politics in the past because they're 

4151
03:00:12,331 --> 03:00:13,164
leaking everything online now and it's 
just harder for the government or the 

4152
03:00:15,661 --> 03:00:18,690
big corporations have the media to 
convince you of this narrative.

4153
03:00:18,691 --> 03:00:19,524
It's getting harder and harder,
like we haven't figured out exactly how 

4154
03:00:21,661 --> 03:00:24,030
to move it in a good direction,
but like it is.

4155
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:27,780
You see the control that they have being
undermined.

4156
03:00:27,781 --> 03:00:29,940
The control of the mainstream media is 
being undermined.

4157
03:00:29,941 --> 03:00:32,220
The control of certain universities.
What's already gone.

4158
03:00:32,221 --> 03:00:33,054
The,
the Internet has sort of eroded all the 

4159
03:00:34,441 --> 03:00:35,274
control of mainstream media.
CNN is now called fake news a million 

4160
03:00:38,791 --> 03:00:39,624
times a day all throughout the country.
And you look at these people constantly 

4161
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:44,440
calling.
The president calls it fake.

4162
03:00:44,490 --> 03:00:45,690
That's fucking CNN.
Oh,

4163
03:00:45,691 --> 03:00:46,140
that's right.

4164
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:49,890
And then you say like a w when you said 
it earlier in the show with Fox News had

4165
03:00:49,891 --> 03:00:54,330
had a monopoly on right wing news.
Well that's fucking over.

4166
03:00:54,420 --> 03:00:56,670
When you look at the bench,
Shapiro comes and shows.

4167
03:00:56,700 --> 03:00:58,020
Look at the numbers.
That thing does.

4168
03:00:58,021 --> 03:00:58,950
I mean it's like,
oh yeah.

4169
03:00:58,960 --> 03:00:59,793
Fox News as a big competitor on their,
on their hands now and all these other 

4170
03:01:02,291 --> 03:01:05,250
guys at crowder and all these guys were 
like huge and all of the.

4171
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:07,560
If you look at like and Jordan who's 
more,

4172
03:01:07,590 --> 03:01:08,423
you know,
like he calls himself a classic British 

4173
03:01:10,061 --> 03:01:10,894
liberal and it looks at it that way,
which is like a sort of a different 

4174
03:01:12,851 --> 03:01:13,684
definition.
It's more of a pragmatic sort of more 

4175
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:18,633
conservative pragmatic,
probably closest to what is called 

4176
03:01:21,941 --> 03:01:23,740
Libertarian in the American School of 
thought.

4177
03:01:24,430 --> 03:01:28,600
The classical liberal people in 
disingenuously call him outright.

4178
03:01:29,080 --> 03:01:29,913
It's just so freaking ridiculous.
But this is the thing where it's like 

4179
03:01:31,661 --> 03:01:33,850
everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders 
is a Nazi.

4180
03:01:33,880 --> 03:01:36,780
It's like there's just these words don't
even mean anything and he just installed

4181
03:01:36,790 --> 03:01:39,710
so it's like people shouting in your 
face and it's like Lion Hillary,

4182
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:42,550
like that kind of thing.
But you take the most fucked up word you

4183
03:01:42,551 --> 03:01:45,310
can think of to justify the legal 
position.

4184
03:01:45,340 --> 03:01:46,930
And then culturally you say,
oh by the way,

4185
03:01:46,931 --> 03:01:47,764
that word applies to everything.
It's like women are getting raped on 

4186
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:52,090
college campus,
so we get the law passed.

4187
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:53,290
Well,
that's one of the real problems with the

4188
03:01:53,291 --> 03:01:54,124
guy like Donald Donald trump said,
when he boils things down to these 

4189
03:01:56,291 --> 03:01:58,540
slogans,
then they boil things down to slogans in

4190
03:01:58,541 --> 03:02:01,600
return and we just have a fucking fight.
Were you throwing rocks at each other?

4191
03:02:01,690 --> 03:02:05,320
That was one of the amazing things about
trump and the moment is that trump comes

4192
03:02:05,321 --> 03:02:07,690
out,
he's like this simplistic buffoon,

4193
03:02:07,900 --> 03:02:10,030
and in every in the normal mind you're 
like,

4194
03:02:10,031 --> 03:02:10,864
well,
at some point he's going to meet a a 

4195
03:02:12,371 --> 03:02:13,204
professional who will embarrass him and 
then you start to realize after a while 

4196
03:02:15,971 --> 03:02:16,271
I was like,
oh,

4197
03:02:16,271 --> 03:02:18,690
there's just no professional plans.

4198
03:02:18,700 --> 03:02:20,110
Neither did Hillary Clinton.
They were all.

4199
03:02:20,290 --> 03:02:21,123
They were all completely empty.
The difference between him versus 

4200
03:02:23,261 --> 03:02:24,094
Hillary versus what we just had with 
Mitt Romney versus Obama to really 

4201
03:02:27,431 --> 03:02:32,431
reasonable well spoken people who are 
accomplished and quite intelligent,

4202
03:02:32,711 --> 03:02:34,360
and while the one of them believes that 
nonsense,

4203
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:36,660
I don't know which one.
They both believe in nonsense.

4204
03:02:36,690 --> 03:02:37,523
Right?
But one of them believes in like one of 

4205
03:02:40,211 --> 03:02:43,840
those magical underwear at a 
presidential debate with them.

4206
03:02:44,250 --> 03:02:44,921
Yeah,
he has to.

4207
03:02:44,921 --> 03:02:47,170
Or it goes straight to like a cabin in 
hell.

4208
03:02:47,830 --> 03:02:49,930
You have to stay there with no satellite
TV.

4209
03:02:50,320 --> 03:02:51,153
I don't know what the rule is.
You only get to have your wives that we 

4210
03:02:54,461 --> 03:02:55,294
sling back.
I hope we have this blow back this way 

4211
03:02:57,401 --> 03:03:01,220
and I hope I don't mean I don't know 
who's going to emerge between now and 20

4212
03:03:01,221 --> 03:03:04,450
slash 20,
but it's gonna have to be someone that's

4213
03:03:04,451 --> 03:03:05,170
interesting,
right?

4214
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:07,810
What's going to be have to be someone 
that we look at and go,

4215
03:03:07,811 --> 03:03:08,644
okay,
this is a viable alternative to what 

4216
03:03:10,091 --> 03:03:10,924
we're currently dealing with and they 
probably shouldn't say shit for a long 

4217
03:03:13,301 --> 03:03:14,134
time.
They should probably just build up and 

4218
03:03:15,551 --> 03:03:19,120
prepare and just constantly say I'm not 
running.

4219
03:03:19,150 --> 03:03:20,530
I'm not running.
I don't know man.

4220
03:03:20,531 --> 03:03:22,570
I don't know if there's any bringing 
this thing back together.

4221
03:03:22,810 --> 03:03:23,643
The United States of America.
I think we might be going our separate 

4222
03:03:25,811 --> 03:03:26,644
ways in the future.
I just think we might be headed toward 

4223
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:33,400
some type of Soviet style breakup.
Like,

4224
03:03:33,440 --> 03:03:35,920
like where some of the countries still 
exist,

4225
03:03:35,921 --> 03:03:38,110
but we're not all a part of the same 
thing.

4226
03:03:38,360 --> 03:03:39,280
I just,
I look,

4227
03:03:39,281 --> 03:03:41,470
I look at these two trends that I see 
happening,

4228
03:03:41,471 --> 03:03:43,250
right?
And one is that content,

4229
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:44,920
and this to me is the biggest moral 
issue of our time,

4230
03:03:44,921 --> 03:03:45,754
but the continued growth of the state,
which is just like gets like we live 

4231
03:03:49,601 --> 03:03:51,520
under choice happens just like a 
corporation,

4232
03:03:51,521 --> 03:03:52,354
universal growth.
They want to get bigger and stronger 

4233
03:03:53,471 --> 03:03:55,840
every year pretty much always seems to 
happen.

4234
03:03:55,841 --> 03:03:56,651
I mean,
and that government,

4235
03:03:56,651 --> 03:03:58,130
unlike,
like corporations always want

4236
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:58,963
to grow,
a lot of them go out of business but 

4237
03:03:59,661 --> 03:04:01,670
they always want to get bigger 
governments,

4238
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:03,650
uh,
they can force you to pay them.

4239
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:07,330
So it's a lot easier for them to grow.
And this is our most advanced society.

4240
03:04:07,331 --> 03:04:08,380
Start as,
you know,

4241
03:04:08,381 --> 03:04:11,240
a constitution with a somewhat limited 
government and then it grows.

4242
03:04:11,241 --> 03:04:14,780
And that was the big appeal of trump.
The only appeal drain the swamp.

4243
03:04:14,781 --> 03:04:16,700
This is what it was then.
And a lot of it was,

4244
03:04:16,920 --> 03:04:18,140
you know,
some of it was,

4245
03:04:18,200 --> 03:04:19,033
was good.
The idea of draining the swamp is good 

4246
03:04:20,001 --> 03:04:22,370
and not fighting these wars anymore I 
think is really great.

4247
03:04:22,850 --> 03:04:25,480
But you know,
you have this thing where we,

4248
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:26,433
we live under the biggest government,
most powerful government in the history 

4249
03:04:29,121 --> 03:04:30,160
of the world.
I mean,

4250
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:32,480
there's never been a government that 
spends $4,000,000,000,000

4251
03:04:32,481 --> 03:04:34,280
that can drone bomb anyone on the 
planet.

4252
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:35,000
That's,
you know,

4253
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:36,950
we,
we have bases all over the world,

4254
03:04:37,340 --> 03:04:38,173
hundreds of different countries or at 
least well over 100 and everything is 

4255
03:04:43,671 --> 03:04:45,320
going up.
I mean every budget,

4256
03:04:45,321 --> 03:04:46,154
you know,
Bush spent the most effort then Obama 

4257
03:04:47,061 --> 03:04:49,040
spent the most ever trump will outspend 
Obama,

4258
03:04:49,070 --> 03:04:52,910
no question about it.
And all of the major major problems that

4259
03:04:52,911 --> 03:04:53,744
I see are our direct result of this.
Like the longest wars in American 

4260
03:04:56,061 --> 03:04:56,894
history,
the mass incarceration rate spying on 

4261
03:04:59,421 --> 03:05:01,410
all of our citizens record debt.
You know,

4262
03:05:01,411 --> 03:05:04,310
like all of these things are a result of
government being way too big and way too

4263
03:05:04,311 --> 03:05:06,380
out of control.
And then at the same time,

4264
03:05:06,560 --> 03:05:07,393
while we're like spending ourselves too 
far into debt way to extended 

4265
03:05:10,161 --> 03:05:13,220
militarily,
the culture is also completely decaying.

4266
03:05:13,370 --> 03:05:15,620
And we're more at war with each other 
than we've ever been.

4267
03:05:15,621 --> 03:05:17,240
And like I said before we go from like,
you know,

4268
03:05:17,241 --> 03:05:22,000
a Buckley Vidal debate to trump Clinton 
like this.

4269
03:05:22,140 --> 03:05:25,610
We've had a jerry springer culture and 
now we've got a jerry springer president

4270
03:05:25,611 --> 03:05:27,920
to go with it and I just see this 
culture breaking up.

4271
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:28,873
The government getting too big.
I don't know how this all works out so 

4272
03:05:32,361 --> 03:05:37,100
that like we're all friends again.
But I'd love for someone to maybe spoken

4273
03:05:37,101 --> 03:05:39,620
like a true white man.
Great privilege gave.

4274
03:05:39,621 --> 03:05:41,030
We got to wrap this up.
Thank you very much.

4275
03:05:41,160 --> 03:05:44,790
So can I plug my on,
just put a new comedy special.

4276

4277

4284
03:06:04,340 --> 03:06:05,360
Absolutely.
Dave Smith.
