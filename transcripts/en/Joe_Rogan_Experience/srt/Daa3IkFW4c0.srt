Yeah. What's up everybody? This is a,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,680

it, the 20th? 20th of September,

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,540
20 years now. It's really the 19th
for everybody that's paying attention.

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:20,190
It says September 20th, but
it's really Friday night,
Friday night at midnight. Um,

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,480
and uh, this is a lie. Five Pat,
uh, fight companion podcast.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,000

but of course he's fucking late.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,170

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
And he bravo in the house and uh,
we're,

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,120

blank screen right now.

00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,270

Um,

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,290
we might not be able to smoke weed
with Brendan Schaub in the room though.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,460
I'll just hold my breath.
December six. Hmm. What's today?

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,570
We had some time about 13 weeks.
I'll just hold my breath.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,610
Can you do that?
Are you good at holding your breath?

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,790
I know you have awesome cardio to fish.
We're good.

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,660
I'll just suck on this coffee real quick.

20
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,120
Usually go to bed at 11 sip tea,

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,070
usually in bed by 11 sipping
team guys, are you really? Yeah.

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,670
11:00 PM Evan every night. Wow.
Are you training tomorrow? No,

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,620
I trained twice today cause I knew
tonight's gonna be a doozy. When you, uh,

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,500
when you schedule like your,
when you ramp up for a fight.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,420
So you're fighting December,
December, December,

26
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:35,100
December 6th when you're racing on h
one. Oh Shit. Where's that beast? Vegas.

27
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:39,510
Mandalay bay. Ooh. Two title fights
then my fight and Travis Browne.

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,050
Ooh,
that's um,

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,810
Vitorin Weidman to showtime and Melendez.
Oh Shit.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,040
And then us big one. Good Lord. Uh,

31
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,810
not yet.
Not that I know of.

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,090
I don't want you to go seize
unless there's a chick flight.

33
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,280
And I hear you speak in a chick.

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,050
The one tonight is telling you guys she's
a little monster that you got an issue

35
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:08,670
with her. I do. So filter thinking
a little crush on her. Yeah,

36
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,780
she's Kinda hot. She was a little plump
and she got in some serious shit. Yeah.

37
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:16,740
Right. And it has down
like, she's like curvy.

38
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,890
She's like Kim Kardashian, but
Japanese. Yeah. Come on in.

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,450
How cool would it be if she came out
and, uh, the school girl uniforms,

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,220
they used to do that for pride.
He used to come out with pigtails.

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,810
Weird stay one dude.

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,400
It's the national pastime
is to be into school girls.

43
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,510
How weird is her biggest thing that she's
ever done? She dressed up like a bunny.

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,490
Ooh. I know this, I don't know
dirty, but maybe I did some research

45
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,420
and by research I mean maybe I jacked off.
Um,

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,690
we'll let you know as soon as the
fight start. I don't know why. Uh,

47
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,590
the fights are a little bit late.
It says 1205 on my phone.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,490
Amateur hour smells like weed in here.
Says 1205 on my phone.

49
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,580
I don't know if that means I'm somebody
fucked up or they're having a problem.

50
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,740
There they were, we were watching it
earlier though. It doesn't make any sense.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,470
It was the live from Japan Goldberg and,
uh,

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,910
Brian Stan calling the APP

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,500
action. Maybe it's just a delay
for the main card, by the way.

54
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,170
I fucking love fight pass dates.
Awesome.

55
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,520
If fucking love it tweeted that fight
pass is great. And everybody was like,

56
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,500
you fucking chill. I know. It's great.

57
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,520
Any fight you could think of in the UFC,
you could just watch it

58
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,460
and it works. It, it's crazy.
When I cornered Ben Saunders at,

59
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:46,870
at the Tulsa event, I get there Friday
night, I've never worked with Ben before.

60
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,510
He asked me to corner him like
a week before and he goes, dude,

61
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,550
you want to come down?
And uh,

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,080
he had been playing rubber guard off and
on over the years and he was playing a

63
00:03:56,081 --> 00:04:00,770
different version. He was playing
a version I never played. And uh,

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,840
then he kind of moved away from it because
I figured, I figured that it would,

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,120
he hit hit,
hit a dead end with that style,

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,460
but I didn't want to say anything
cause it was kind of working for him.

67
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,230
And then he got cut from the UFC,
went to bell inventoried when,

68
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,580
when somebody lose some and I kind of
lost track of what he was really doing.

69
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,890
And then he saw the Hixson video, the
video that we did here. And, uh, he,

70
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:24,160
he, he twittered me direct
message was, hey man,

71
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,720
when are you going to
do a seminar in Florida?

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
He realized he was playing stuff wrong
and he wanted to fix it. So I said, well,

73
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,660
I don't have anything planned in Florida,

74
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,720
but I do have a little rubber guard
genius out there. Guy Named Tyler Woolsey.

75
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,430
I go, let me hook you up with them.
They hooked up. He, as soon as he,

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
as soon as he got done
with Tyler, he said, dude,

77
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,950
I want you to corner me next week. Can you
do it? I know it's last minute. And um,

78
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,323
did it.

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,250
And so Friday night I get that Friday
night and go right to his hotel.

80
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,840
He has fight pass hooked up. Right.
So cause he was studying his opponent,

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,780
his opponent, and I think,
hmm. It wasn't on, he wasn't,

82
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,200
I don't think he fought in the UFC before,
but he had bypass. So I said, Oh shit.

83
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,160
So we put on, I wanted to keep it really
simple form would rubber guard. There's,

84
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,320
it's so sophisticated and so vast.

85
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,840
There's pieces of the rubber guard
that I don't even know how to play yet.

86
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,200
There's new pieces. I'm like, Shit, what
are you guys doing over here? Right?

87
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,670
There's a new shit that's incredible.

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Half Guillotine a guillotine
from the rubber guard.

89
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,490
Guillotine with your leg

90
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,240
on. Hold on a second. It's on. The
fights are on guys walking out. Right?

91
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,890
And what is this? I don't
know what you got here. Oh,

92
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,660
is it a different thing? My on the wrong
thing. That doesn't make any sense.

93
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,980
Live events. Let's see. Yeah,
you gotta press live live now.

94
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,180
That'll be it. So it didn't
switch over from the pre. Oh,

95
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,600
it didn't switch over from the prelims.
That's goofy.

96
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,810
That's goofy. Tell you what a different
stream is. Coffee, bulletproof coffee,

97
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,650
French jobs got a little bit of a
fucking coffee problem. Addiction.

98
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,670
And when I stopped siding, it's
going to become drugs. Well,

99
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:06,170
my point was with the UFC fight pass is
I get there Friday night and we kept it

100
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,530
really simple, simple rubber guard,
Michigan troll with elbows. We,

101
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,880
we put on Jason Day versus Alan
Belcher. Uh, that was a real,

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,080
an amazing display of elbows from,

103
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:19,640
from the guard and Matt Horwitz versus
Dan Miller. You know, just right there.

104
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,250
We would've, it would've been hard
to find those fights, you know,

105
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,310
I guess you could go to MMA core.
It's always tricky though, right?

106
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:29,600
You're like tough to find that. Yeah.
Yeah. But with UFC fight pass man, boom.

107
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,650
Any UFC fight,

108
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,270
is it every single fight that the UFC
has ever single fight the UFC has had and

109
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,680
every single one.
Another one of those too.

110
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,740
There's everything yesterday
on the phone too. Yeah. Um,

111
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,450
every single fight in pride to even the
early ones, like u of c to everything.

112
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,140
Everything. Everything. Wow.
All the Strikeforce fight.

113
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:50,210
Cause that's one thing that I can think
of came up. But I'm like thinking maybe,

114
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,100
maybe the,
the old ones,

115
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,120
maybe UFC one even there's offered
he sure if I'm wrong I apologize.

116
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:59,510
But I'm pretty sure in between,
in between these fights, that's,

117
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,170
let's throw it on my glass so we can,
we can,

118
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,460
otherwise we'll go off the screen because
it's running through my laptop, but,

119
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,360
but we'll figure it out.
I don't,

120
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,640
I don't think there's
anything that's not in there.

121
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:14,360
I mean there's also a crazy show called
UFC now with a couple of cutie pies on

122
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:19,070
their Kapow, Brendan Schaub and
Kenny Florian. Damn show relevance,

123
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,270
Horny and Shit. Man, man,
himself and his girl,

124
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,060
he's talking about himself
being acute. It was true. Oh,

125
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:26,894
you don't even paying attention.

126
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,370
He said Brandon Shab couple
cutie pies like Brennan and shop.

127
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,550
You got to talked to in the
third person. I'm, I'm sorry,

128
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,410
I was just really paying attention to
you. She's, I'm used to that with Callan.

129
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,250
Don't worry. Just keep on keeping
on towns the worst with that.

130
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,010
Like he'll get into
modes where he wants to,

131
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,260
he wants to say something and it doesn't
matter what the fuck you're saying.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,180
What he has to say. Like it has no
relation whatsoever to what you're saying.

133
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,080
Oh Wow. That's great. I met
a guy, he wrote a book and
I'll go on to this fucking,

134
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,980
why are you talking about economics now?
Like how do we get an economic,

135
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,320
he's like, he has this thought in
his head. It's like a runaway train.

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,390
He's just trying to get out of the way,
man.

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,660
That's why he's so funny too.

138
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,360
It's like what's his face you
recognize about comedians?

139
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,140
It's like that same thing that makes
them like really funny. It's this,

140
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,370
this mad dog bum rush to
get attention. Madness, man.

141
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,590
Nobody's better at like commanding
attention and count. Brian called me.

142
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,730
He was dead serious. He goes,
Bro, instead of selling t shirts,

143
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,630
I got a great idea. He's never came
to me with an idea for shit. He goes,

144
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:40,480
good coozies we should sell to God. I
went, are you fucking kidding me? Disease?

145
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,670
Yes. Who Buys Beer?
Koozies still put mean.

146
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,760
W how much of it is
just a little insulated?

147
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,300
I thought you meant jacuzzis

148
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,813
you going to kick

149
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,180
can out of the warehouse.

150
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:02,181
You would need to keep an inventory
fighter in the kitchen that's not there.

151
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,310
That makes, that makes more sense
than a Koozie. But first for a second,

152
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:11,100
I'm like, they get, damn, they're
jumping on Brian. Poor Brian.

153
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,770
But then you said his
idea. I'm like, oh no shit.

154
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,880
[inaudible] trying to sell Jacuzzi.

155
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,200
What Natalie that I mean who? Well, it's

156
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,670
got room for a Jacuzzi. Kai,
Kai Yohji. Horry Gucci. I don't,

157
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:31,390
I'm not familiar with him.
Who's his opponent? Do we know?

158
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,990
We've got to pay attention here.
I got a bad ass because I've used it once.

159
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,560
Seriously, three years once. Let's see
who these guys are there to fight in here.

160
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,870
Powerful Aryana in Japan. Oh,
la. And seen her in awhile.

161
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,540
I thought maybe she was taking
a break. She's well, she's busy.

162
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:54,360
She's got a TV show now. Really?
Yeah. She's on overhauling
shush. She's the host.

163
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,660
Oprah. Yeah. Spike. Right. That's
uh, that's bud show. Brian,

164
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,990
her Gucci and Delos Reyes.

165
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,690
That's bud show where they
take a card and they, they,

166
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,490
they completely redo it for like a
week. He doesn't get it. Yes it does.

167
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,390
Now that's back.
But what owns it again?

168
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,780
Or it's a producer over it again.
One of those things that was his show.

169
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,850
I don't know what happened. I, you know,
I'm just happy he's doing it to get, oh,

170
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,470
it's all over. It's all never know. Never
know the smart thing. Recovering. Yeah.

171
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,870
He's, he's on the bottom.
You don't recover from that.

172
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,080
You can't let this though like
this though. He can. You can.

173
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:35,290
If the guy stays on him. See if the
guy was smart and he's a striker.

174
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,930
If he's that good of a striker, he would
probably try to get away, right? Yes.

175
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:42,310
100% because that guy would be much
more helpless in a non clinching.

176
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:47,020
The rubbish from the standup to Leo
Machida told me that you get hit to the

177
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,980
body, drop to your butt and to buy
time until the ref Stan job. Well,

178
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,590
Tito did that with him. Remember
he, he caught Tito. What?

179
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:56,590
That body shot that need of the body.
That's pulling guard though.

180
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,330
It was a slick move by. That's
pulling guard. He's being sued.

181
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,490
You're going to get finished. He's
peeing. Eddie Brown was being sarcastic.

182
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,130
He's a master mastercard player and 90%
I think 90% of the people won't catch

183
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:13,030
it. I'm just telling you right
now, I know that Eddie Bravo humor,

184
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,810
you've got to stand up. He's, you
know, he ended up to him it's like,

185
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,210
it's like chess moves that
are like really stupid.

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,610
You see someone doing a dumb
chess move and you and I are like,

187
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,460
what is he talking about?
Well,

188
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,520
other other people you know who know
Eddie and know exactly what he's doing.

189
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,580
He's, he's always said that. I mean we're
seeing it. We saw it with your arms.

190
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,880
You got to pull guard. We saw
at times you got it. You don't,

191
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:37,110
it shouldn't be our first option,
but it should be.

192
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,030
Look how, look how good Ben Saunders
control was. It was amazing.

193
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,210
If I'm for doom and Keynes,
eat me up against the cage,

194
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,410
I'm pulling half cars sometimes.
Sometimes you have God. Meanwhile,

195
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,750
this is a good fucking fight.
Yeah, it is really good fight.

196
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,380
He recovered. He got out of it
man. But that a hard gootchie dude,

197
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:02,350
that guy's got a nasty
left kick to the body. Oh,

198
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:07,000
he's trying to pay him back for oh
he did too. He did two or these guys,

199
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:11,110
45 hours. Um, they look on no fibers.

200
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,390
See I was going to say 35, 25 no, no.

201
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:21,370
I wait. Oh my God. Giant. No Way.
Well, you know these hoes shit.

202
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,460
No one is really a
fucking fly with anymore.

203
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,630
They're all like 150 pounds
and then fly away for an hour.

204
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,370
I mean that's what's going on now
with all these weight classes. Dude,

205
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,950
you know I have dolce on,
Jesus don't,

206
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:41,951
she was telling me that nick lense walks
around it like a buck 70 a buck 75 and

207
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:48,241
he gets down to one 45 and
he was struggling to get
down to 55 before he came to

208
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:53,000
dolce. Either way, there's
going to be diminishing return.

209
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:53,471
You know what I'm saying?

210
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:58,090
Like I don't care what dolce says and
I love dolce as much as the nice guy,

211
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:01,610
but no matter what you say, that can't
be healthy. I'll tell you what though,

212
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,420
be that big. No, no, but there's,

213
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,840
there's healthier ways to good generally
the healthier ways, but it's still kit.

214
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,460
There's no way performance. He says,
well, he says it. I think you're right.

215
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,830
The Way Nick Lens cuts though.
He was saying yes,

216
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:17,450
he walks around to one 75 or whatever,
but,

217
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:21,490
and he does get to 45 but he
does it. Oh, he heard him again.

218
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,970
Oh Jesus.
He's boys a scrap and these guys are,

219
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,290
oh, heart. Gucci is a bad
motherfucker. Eat soon. Jesus Christ.

220
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,760
Nasty striking. But he dos Rios
got some gummies back again. Oh,

221
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:40,440
but he's getting eaten up. Oh, these
are hard shots. Oh, he's in trouble now.

222
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,890
He's might be that. I usually stop.
That's it. That's it. He's a bad man.

223
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,480
Shit. The kids here, the kid is teas.

224
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,700
Is that a bottle of wine? You
savage? Of course he did. Yeah,

225
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,990
he would bring wine camping. If you let a
kid, he'd be that guy on a hunting trip.

226
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,720
Brian, I'm on your side today.
Okay. I'm not going to gang up on

227
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,870
me and you kid against these guys have
to worry about my feelings by before he

228
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,230
came in. I feel a count sacrifice. You
guys came down to me a little hard.

229
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,570
You didn't believe my nose story.
I mean it was very bad.

230
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,330
40 came in and he goes,

231
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:26,770
we should sell koozies which
sell pcs. I was like, Nah,

232
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:27,581
I don't think so man.

233
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:31,180
As Brian and Eddie Bravo was thinking you
should probably sell like some sort of

234
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,260
hot tub type equipment.
Maybe Jacuzzi.

235
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,150
The equipment just missed this part.

236
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,440
Gucci's a bad motherfucker,
dude. These are slight weights.

237
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,670
Can you believe these are one 20
fibers perspective issue? Yeah,

238
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,050
apparently it is. They might
be the four foot five. No. Um,

239
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,690
there is this, the height is up there.
Crazy. It's on the, the thing one guy,

240
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,740
65 inches.

241
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,390
You have to go 66 and I have a new
boyfriend so it doesn't really matter. Oh,

242
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,180
Brian Loves Akiyama. It's
importance without beautiful
man. He's a beautiful man.

243
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,820
He's a, he's a well, but he
always sings voice of an angel.

244
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,860
I know he saves our superstar.
Correct. Like Korea, right?

245
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,090
Auditorium, Japanese. He's got an
amazing voice. Well, he's a Japanese guy,

246
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:18,140
but he's of Korean descent,
right? I believe so. Set from him,

247
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,360
I believe is a Japanese name.
Yeah. I think for some reason,

248
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:25,510
and he's got some sort of a
Korean background, I'd look,
but my teeth with my, uh,

249
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,760
Jamie, can you, he's actually Korean
and Jamie, do you have any one?

250
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,800
He's half Korean, half Japanese. No
wineglasses dude. This is a man's place.

251
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,340
He's a good coffee mug.
You use a goddamn coffee mug.

252
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,670
You don't need a special glass for
your fucking fruity drink. Brian.

253
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,120
Brian figure Brian style cause enormous.

254
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:50,610
He looks like Godzilla
compared to that dude. Oh,

255
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,430
so that's why it's a perspective issue.
I'm with you.

256
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,410
As I said, that guy is a bad
motherfucker. Super Bad. Wicked striking.

257
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,850
There is no room for anybody but bad
motherfuckers at one 25 every a black belt

258
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,450
and everything, everything. And in
a black belt in cardio 70 and below,

259
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,840
you better be a black belt at every
job. Oh, you won't be here that small.

260
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,360
Especially in wrestling
and Jujitsu technique.

261
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,150
You have to be so technical to just
survive in the sport. Bang home.

262
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,120
Yeah, in everything. Right.
Everything in everything. I like.

263
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,570
I actually like watching
the lighter weights. Dude.

264
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,120
When you got a guy like a
Hector Lombard out there,

265
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,980
what terrified of that guy
who's not terrified to him?

266
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,590
To Hector Lombard is terrified of himself.

267
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,070
That's how scary Hector Lombard is.
Dude.

268
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:45,890
I'm never saw anybody
ragdoll Jake shields,

269
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:50,690
the way he did tossed around just smashed
him in the first round like a fucking

270
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:55,630
hurricane. Like refrigerators were flying
down the street and Kansas tornadoes.

271
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,410
It was just, Jake shields is tough
as fuck. He's beaten some chicks,

272
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:06,140
feels almost caught him.
He almost caught him and he gets him.

273
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,400
He got locked up in the bell, rang the
fucking Buzzer rang with Jake on his neck.

274
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,430
When you look at Hector Lombard,

275
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:16,431
he can't believe he gets down to one 76
he's got the street from a nice ass on

276
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:21,830
the planet. Yo Brian Cowen. Russell. Why
Bob? I'm sorry man. I'm so sorry. Hold on.

277
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,610
Fuck Buddy. Hold. Get a
little 2005 book Hojo, Yo.

278
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,420
And you're actually knowing
what that would it is 2005 book.

279
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,980
Did you like buy it on purpose?

280
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,410
Like you knew what it was when you went
out to buy it. How did you find out?

281
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,900
You'll say taste it and you tell
me. No, I believe it's good.

282
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:39,470
I'm not questioning when you know. How
do you, what do you know about one?

283
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,870
Because I like old world wines.
What's that mean?

284
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,230
The Europeans like earth in their wine.
You taste that earth. You say that.

285
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,980
It's like, it's like cheese. Meat.
Mushrooms are good. Yeah. I don't taste

286
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,300
any of those things.
I taste wine.

287
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,040
Callup fucking people married the
American palate likes an obvious Jamey big

288
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,340
wine for the most part. Bronco with
the old world wines. Listen Gentlemen,

289
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,950
serious question.
Who?

290
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Who has the best acid MMA but without
question 100% and do a lot of dead lifts.

291
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,990
Watch health watch
question without question.

292
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,450
Why don't you a couple of honeydews
couple of honey dews with common stressful

293
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,440
for us. Without question. Hector lumbar.
I couldn't peel my eyes from the man.

294
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,420
He was in the air in the airport and he
was quite the security and he took his

295
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:27,980
shoes off and I could not feel
my eyes from his ass. You know,

296
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,590
there's a few guys like
that in the UFC didn't move.

297
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,040
They move it like a notch over.
Everybody Woodley.

298
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,770
Tyron Woodley when Woodley's on correct.
When he knocked out Jay,

299
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:43,860
her Ron just expose the movement.
It's like get out of the way.

300
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,610
Just get the fuck out of the way.
When he's got this rush,

301
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,060
you certain guys that have this rush
and Lombard has it too. You know?

302
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,120
They asked Woodley to fight Lombard
and he's like, Nah, I'm cool.

303
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,120
And it's showed up. By the way, Dana
said he was like, Dana was like, no.

304
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,790
He literally was like,
no, I'm good. I say,

305
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,020
same thing too, right? Find non cool man

306
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,990
necessary the baddest dude on the
planet. No, I'm cool. I'm good.

307
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm going to go crazy. Is it that Dana
will bus these guys out like that? Well,

308
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:20,130
hey mean that's for his business. That's
the best move. But it's not even like,

309
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,690
you know all the guys
were like, oh no, hell no.

310
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:26,460
It's like they won't even consider it.
Well, no, no, no. Is that 100% true?

311
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,070
What are it's, here's the
thing, what are you selling?

312
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,800
If you're selling a product like the UFC,
I could see two arguments.

313
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,490
I can see one argument where you're like,
you shouldn't talk about that.

314
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,620
Cause that's private. That's the
fighter's business fighters fight.

315
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,090
But you're selling the
baddest motherfuckers on the
planet and the the push is

316
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,990
always like the tank Abbott.
Anyone anywhere. Anytime.

317
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,560
It's one thing everybody loved about
tank habit was the fact that he fight

318
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:54,561
anybody off a bar stool to Tj Dillashaw
cowboy Cerrone's exactly like it's a

319
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:58,420
double edged sword though. It's a
double edge sword Franklin about that.

320
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,290
Oh well it's most likely.
Depends upon your success.

321
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,670
I mean ask anybody UFC about the benefit.
Finish your point.

322
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,600
What were you saying about Joe?
You were saying you went,

323
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,970
you were talking about in the planet,
but him,

324
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,500
him saying if someone turned down a fight,
right.

325
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,550
It's like now you will believe him when
he says this guy will take any fight.

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,950
I'll tell you know I could call them
up anytime. Like Donald Cerrone, he,

327
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,870
he'll say that about ceremony. I can
call Donald Serone up and say, Hey,

328
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm sending a fight with fill in the
blank. He goes, all right, let's do it.

329
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,740
He probably has a Budweiser in his,
he probably fishes the Budweiser,

330
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,760
then goes jet skiing.
Then probably fucking shoot some guns.

331
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,990
What were you saying about age?

332
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,680
What were you saying about [inaudible]
j Dilla shot. Well, he's another one.

333
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:48,130
He'll fight anybody. Tj fought, I mean
they changed it. His fight to Joe Soto

334
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,100
the fucking day of the Wayans,
the day of the weigh ins.

335
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,530
Burrell can't make weight.
Falls hits his head.

336
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,840
Joe Soto who had won
the belt toward title,

337
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,770
lost it to Joe Warren got signed by the
UFC one, a bunch of fights in a row.

338
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,750
Good fights came to the UFC.
He's fucking debut his UFC debut.

339
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,930
He fights for the title against Tj
Dillashaw. Dillashaw. I was like,

340
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:11,290
I'll take it that. That's
a little different. I think
that's a little different.

341
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,820
It was day of the fight. He's in shape.
He's in camp looking for a fight.

342
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,890
That guy steps up.
That guy's kind of screwed.

343
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,730
It's a different kind of animal to
call some like Yo Hector Lombard,

344
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,140
you've got eight weeks.
Like cool.

345
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,830
That's a different animals fighters
out there that get off on fighting the

346
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:35,110
scariest guys. Oh yeah,
for sure. Who's like that?

347
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,840
Like they want the next, he has Mark Hunt,
Mark Kahn. He wants the scariest guys.

348
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,830
Yeah. Like literally like when me and
him are going back and forth on Twitter,

349
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:48,100
the stuff you'd say to me and like me,
I was like, damn, this false for real.

350
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:53,060
It's like
he just wants to help my ass.

351
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,870
I'm trying to get paid
and get a title shot. Joe,

352
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,410
he just wants you to whip my ass. By
the way, this guy kind of McGregor.

353
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,010
It seems like the kind of guy I'll take
all comers. So is Dustin Poirier a man,

354
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:07,390
Dustin Poirier. He's a bad motherfucker.
That's a significant test from a Gregor.

355
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:12,080
I figured Gregor's sensational. I even
Gregerson say I'm a huge McGregor fan.

356
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,730
Boxing is phenomenal. Well,
his movement, he just,

357
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,070
he's like a snake like his in and out,

358
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,850
but I'm telling you we haven't
scoring Yay is fucking legit. I agree.

359
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:26,740
I can see him winning. He Eric
Coke. I was like, Oh shit. Yeah,

360
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,940
that's a coin toss. You and anybody
could land a big shot and change.

361
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,150
Really good fight though.

362
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:36,151
Those guys are both really technical
and and Mcgregor is very unorthodox man.

363
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,720
He fights from a south position. He
moves like a snake. He's trained for.

364
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,550
He's got this in and out style.
That's very deceptive man. It's not,

365
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,940
there's a lot of dudes and you see them
throwing punches and throwing kicks,

366
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,550
but they're very mechanical, right?
Step forward and they just throw a,

367
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,870
get a rhythm.
But Mcgregor's got like this wiggle,

368
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,150
he's got this wobble in and out.
He can,

369
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,210
he can counter off Google almost Anderson
Silva guys into these things and then

370
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:07,690
counters heal, heal, heal. Did
doc come back with a right?

371
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:12,550
He's just really good box jack slacks.
It did a great slip. He slipped.

372
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:16,540
The guy wasn't in the UFC. He's just
does stuff that you don't usually see.

373
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,750
Don't think he's ready for a,
for like a a top top level guy.

374
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,840
I want to see him get built up.
Dustin Poirier is going gonna be,

375
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,730
it's a hell of a big test look.
Poor.

376
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:27,880
Yay is no fucking job shit.

377
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,760
And the kid has been fighting
for a long time and he's not.

378
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,300
And he's young and he's not scared
of it. And it got, yeah, it's true.

379
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,950
And a guy like poor Yay is a guy that
you could see a giant jump from him and

380
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:42,970
just four or five months because he's in
his confidence groove now. He beat coke.

381
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,250
You know y'all, you know he's, he's at
the stage where he's like, he knew coke

382
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,060
was about the fight for the title.
Yup.

383
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,270
When the fight got
called because of injury,

384
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:53,240
coke is like set to fight
for the title piece. Yeah.

385
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,910
He was ready to fight for the title.
So poor ea beats him.

386
00:23:55,911 --> 00:24:00,480
It beats him convincingly. I mean, that's
a big fucking wind, man. He's a beast.

387
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,590
You know how we're talking about guys
who take whatever fight. Just go. Yep.

388
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,424
Give it to us.

389
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,120
There's a fine line in this where
management comes into place because the

390
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:11,660
fighter should always accept the
fight. Always a five. She always right.

391
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,890
Always accepted by Ivo. Anytime I man,
let your manager saying, Yep, let's do it.

392
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,910
It should be a manager's job. Like, ah,

393
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,020
probably not homeboy like manager being
the guys who is his ego is presumably

394
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:28,100
not attached to any bullshit.
A true fighters who like, yeah,

395
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:31,700
I can beat anyone in the world came to me.
But when you're dealing with at,

396
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,580
say you have a client at
one 70 and they go, hey,

397
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:38,330
we want to fight Hector
Lombard in Australia where
he lives once you fly down to

398
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,720
the 20 hours to get that
ass, well you gotta fake.

399
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,890
It ain't going to,
a manager's going to be like,

400
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,720
I don't hold out a little bit. Yeah.
And there's, there's, I mean you've,

401
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,550
I'm sure experienced it yourself.

402
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:55,520
The difference between you now
and you when you're on tough,

403
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,800
if you could go back and fight
you when you're on tough,

404
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,740
you'd probably beat your ass.
Oh my God. I've last 20 seconds.

405
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,790
I was such a bad ass.
I was, I was so shitty.

406
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,710
Just super competent.
Just crazy confidence.

407
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,070
What do you think of the APP with the
girls? Just two episodes. Yeah, I did.

408
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,350
You know, I fucking love it. Do you
write? It's really good. It's good

409
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,810
that rose, that rose. So I trained with
her endeavor when she very first started.

410
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,230
She's your next showtime Pettis.
She can jump off the wall.

411
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,130
She can do flying armbars
she's a little pieces there.

412
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,020
You seen her flying arm bar finish.
You've seen his flight.

413
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:36,560
She is going home after this
chick. Have you seen it? No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's a,

414
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,110
she's going after this chick. I
mean, they're going to war and roses.

415
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,340
Chase her down with combinations.
The grow clinches up with her.

416
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,430
Rose throws out fucking perfect flying
armbar and tasks or she's your next

417
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:52,480
superstar. If she does well on this
show, she's going to be your next,

418
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,850
her a grinding grappling on the
ground and position. I don't know.

419
00:25:56,851 --> 00:26:00,110
That's the only thing. She's more
fancy. You know what I'm saying?

420
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:00,801
I know what you're saying.

421
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:04,240
I had sex with someone might be
able to take her wrestler. Yeah,

422
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,340
you might be right. You might
be right. But God, I very flashy

423
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,100
that fucking reply she's doing flying
armbars that she's gotta be at least a

424
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,960
pretty good blue belts the way she did it.
You got to see the way she did it.

425
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,630
She did it like a goddamn black
belt. It was like, you know,

426
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:27,530
sometimes there's those people that like
they have one crazy move and they're

427
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:30,260
like, oh, do a shrimp from me.
Right. What the fuck? That's true.

428
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,910
They came in shrimp [inaudible] bar.

429
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,950
It's cause they came to the gym and the
first day they came in they showed him a

430
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:40,070
flying triangle, a flying arm. But
that, but they can't do anything else.

431
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,800
The first fight, uh, that a huge
other areas. There it is right here.

432
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,420
Do you remember when,
uh,

433
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,930
paid a pano fought Vinnie Magallanes and
Vinny magalogs caught him walking shit.

434
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,270
Full flying trend data.
How wicked was that? Uh,

435
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,260
she's at that pictures while to look at
her. She's, she's, she has the rice. Why?

436
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,070
If you watch that again,
that if you watch it again,

437
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,280
look at these. He's not a
breath look. And he said,

438
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,100
don't think so. No, no,
no, no, no. Let's see.

439
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:19,020
Her legs are in a very bad
spot as far as an armbar.

440
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,870
Let's see. Look at her legs.
Look at this. Boom. Left leg.

441
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,590
Look at her and left leg
between the two arms. No.

442
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,410
Her left leg is between the girl's legs.
Well,

443
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:31,830
when at the end of it wasn't though,
right? Yeah. Let me see. I see it again,

444
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,430
but at the end she looked
at her arms in her left leg.

445
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,140
Look at her left. Boom. Left
leg left or you're right.

446
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,900
It's your trash leg

447
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,283
about

448
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,400
Jan Galera. That was glaring. Yeah,

449
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,590
that's true. I don't see it. Well,

450
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,420
every day I'm analyzing every
book like I'm an analyze mode.

451
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,150
The whole time I'm just looking
at everyone's techniques.

452
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,030
I can't help it every time. I'm
just correcting. That's so true.

453
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,400
If she got into the situation,

454
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,580
you think she should have tried to finish
it before she got her leg free or if

455
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:15,391
she felt strong,

456
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,750
should she had gone for it the way she
did because she was obviously tangled up

457
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:23,520
like that wouldn't immediately in trouble
was going on in your mind like maybe

458
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:26,440
she thought, I know my legs
in a bad spot, but she's not.

459
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,280
She's just leaving her leg hanging
so I'm just going to keep it there.

460
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,240
I don't know.

461
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,740
She must be pretty confident in that
girl's right leg was just like dangling

462
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,380
over. She was amazing
it to defend, but damn.

463
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,040
How quick did she hit that fucking flying
armbar man, that shit was beautiful.

464
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,460
She is the attitude to be a champion.
I'll put this down.

465
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:46,720
Wild man and that whole wild dance.
She did have the chef.

466
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,750
She's definitely the hottest one. That's
uh, that's, that's important too. It's a

467
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,760
legit, she's and she's a trashy. She's
with Jet Star and she is here by the way.

468
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:00,770
She is beautiful.

469
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,030
Her face is Angelina Jolie.
Yup. She's a cutie pie.

470
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,340
She's a straight a cutie pie. So
be respectful. Good work. Yeah,

471
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:12,870
he did well.
Okay.

472
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:17,871
So we got kind mono versus Richard Bro.

473
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,320
Thanks for the invite to dinner Brian.
Hey guys. There's fights going on right?

474
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:25,140
And I know fucking selfish
bitch. All right. Kiki Coonan,

475
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:27,810
Modo and Richard Walsh.

476
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,270
Companion to life ex friend Lou,
my brother.

477
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,230
Unbelievable catching the bad
positioning and the legs. Right.

478
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:42,040
I didn't see it because I'm with my
family. Nice. Fix that rose. Fix it. Pat.

479
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,350
Pat,
come on.

480
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,470
Oh, Cuna. Modo. Pat for sure.

481
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:56,710
Teacher that flying arm bar. Everybody
goes to the deep half now Eddie. Huh?

482
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,600
Keep your hands up wrong.
I miss that.

483
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,560
A lot of guys go to the deep half on
the ground now don't they? In and out.

484
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,910
You got to go in and out. You don't
have time to play around. Boy.

485
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,430
It's not crane set, right? The deep, deep
half. You just got to just go with it,

486
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:13,330
right? Yeah. Boom. Boom. Slingshot bro.
Everyone's growing their beard out though.

487
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:17,840
Huh? Sexy and I care. I can't do it.
Very lumberjack like you can't a beard.

488
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,180
I can't do it. You smooth. I'm Travis
Brown got me beat in that area.

489
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,590
So when you grow a beard,

490
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,340
does it just look like a homeless
Banjo player type beard? Yeah,

491
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,740
I look like like Venice,
Venice

492
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,130
Bullshit. Giant got cracked. Big Kick.

493
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,730
Oh look at that
wall.

494
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:45,160
She's a beached strong striker.
He looks like Kit Dale. He does.

495
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,210
My motto is in Japan, he
cannot lose coattails.

496
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:54,250
Got a funny Instagram page. Oh Coonan Mona
is busted up, man. Somebody busted up.

497
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,710
It's a lot of blood and it
looks like his nose though.

498
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,970
Oh, nice knee to the body. Yeah.

499
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:13,960
That is like a standard like masculine
look now the big crazy beard,

500
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,410
everyone's kind of doing it.
I know everyone's kind of doing it.

501
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,830
It didn't exist just a few
years ago. Well, it's weird.

502
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,850
It's kind of like the tramp stamp exist
in the 70s it's all cyclical styles come

503
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,200
and go.
Okay,

504
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,410
well you give it a lecture.

505
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:37,210
Is that why does some trends and like why
do people, our sons are growing beards.

506
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:41,550
Wah Bell Bottoms. That happened. What
is it? How do, how does it trend?

507
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,391
Do me jeans,

508
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:47,391
skinny jeans now you got big guys means
it's so interesting how I think it's a

509
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,234
culture.

510
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,140
It's something happens in a culture and
it manifests seven how people just pop

511
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,580
in pop culture. They see celebrities
doing it. Then they jump on. And Brendan,

512
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,020
are you using the diamond club?
What do you use to diamond?
Yeah. Diamond Cup. Yeah.

513
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,840
Only the best for this hot. Have you,
I hear you brother. Have you ever uh,

514
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,200
fucked around with a tie
steel cup? I have. Yeah.

515
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,490
Once it gets more in the way of things,
especially grappling.

516
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,890
Have you grappled in a lot?
Well, that's what I was to know.

517
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,310
I have never grappled in a tie steel cup,
but I would imagine that first of all,

518
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,880
you know I rolled with you remember
Amir Amir? A mirror? No, the other,

519
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,500
I've already near Renovar bed.

520
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,060
I rolled the mere renova
already at legends and he
used to roll with a tie steel

521
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:31,990
cup on and he would mount. You had used
it as a weapon. It was really rude.

522
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,500
Dance with it too. Strong guy.
Anyway, he's a strong guy. Crazy.

523
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,310
That is so crazy that

524
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,670
the IB,
Jj have outlawed cups.

525
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,950
You're not allowed to protect
your balls because of their,

526
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,670
so it cups are so dangerous. I agree
with it. I agree. We are not alone.

527
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,630
I agree, but I think like a s a cup
that doesn't hurt like a diamond cup.

528
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:59,030
I got softer Plastic Cup
I think should happen.

529
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,850
This should be a foam one, but you know
what I mean, Tim. I broke my balls once.

530
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,480
I had Blake Dick Bleeding once.
You know I only,

531
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,560
I only wear a cup when I'm fighting.
I'm only where a cup when I'm fighting.

532
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,210
I never wore a cup in football
all the years. Really. Only
when I fight I work up.

533
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,740
Cause it cause you might
get kicked in the balls. No.

534
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,560
Oh well you have to wear it in the UFC.

535
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,130
I was saying we are one if I didn't
have to one of the military because why?

536
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,510
Because there's liability lost a ball.
One of the military guys got it.

537
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:34,250
Forget his name and in training and it
was one of those things where you're like

538
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,710
ah, I don't need a cup.
We'll just go, go live.

539
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,900
And you sent me, you got you hooked.
Got me hooked up with the Diamond Cup.

540
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,510
Since you told me the story,
I still don't give a shit.

541
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,540
What's the difference Armstrong did with
one between a regular dog watcher has

542
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:55,910
one nut. Remember that if you, if
you think about like Lance Armstrong,

543
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,800
man, first of all, Lance Armstrong,

544
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:01,490
like you could never do what lands storm
was Armstrong was dude in the UFC cause

545
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:04,070
you'd get caught,
you'd get caught simply

546
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,770
because he's taken a lot of drugs.

547
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,660
I think that maybe him taking them out
of drugs was one of the reasons why.

548
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:18,200
And one minute, one minute, I'm the
same being some chemicals were involved.

549
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,500
I The fucking science experiment, man.
He was a fucking science experiment.

550
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,530
What everyone was though. Let's be
honest. Everyone says you're 100% right.

551
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,070
She'll sign it, said it best. You know
Chell son was talking to, he would know.

552
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,700
He's like, look, the guy was the best
cheater. He goes, that's what he was.

553
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:35,810
He was the best cheat here.

554
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,490
He probably gets some genetic data
with baseball too. They're like,

555
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,210
oh these guys steroids. Woah. The
pictures on steroids too, man.

556
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,880
I hate to tell you at the level
level playing field, oh it's over.

557
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,070
We missed the ending. We're
talking all this shit. Oh,

558
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,120
you hooked him on the left Hook.

559
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,940
That guy is tannish Oh,
oh.

560
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,470
Ah, that's got to hurt.
Ugh. It's tough though.

561
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,280
If there's anything to suck at in MMA or
to not be as good or suck in comparison

562
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:17,090
to your opponent. The scary
thing is striking. God Damn.

563
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,280
That's why a guy like a lumbar is so
fucking terrifying because he does both.

564
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,270
He does both.

565
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,180
He ever see a video of him breaking that
dude's lag and grappling competition

566
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,590
here at snap.
You've seen it as Hector Lombard

567
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,460
part of his leg? I don't know.
It looked like an ankle lock,

568
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:38,370
so probably his ankle or down

569
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,840
by horrifying. The bottom of his leg.
I mean he just snapped this dude's leg.

570
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,590
You hear it? You hear the crack. I don't
remember what kind of leg lock it was,

571
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,120
but it was nasty. Did he hang under like
Paul Harvey Stone? It just snapped it.

572
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,310
It just,
the guy screamed and it was over.

573
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,410
He's a fucking freak dude. Okay.
This fight is not over, man.

574
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:03,310
That was just in between rounds. Jesus.
Wow. That guy is still in there. Who,

575
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,200
by the way,

576
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,840
who is fucking tougher like PR as I like,
uh,

577
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,590
if you had like a generalization
about a nation for tea,

578
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,740
like guys who can take it. I know,
which, I know these guys can't fucking,

579
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,280
I actually know that
they've actually gone through the hardest.

580
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,990
So they've done some studies on that.
People that can endure the toughest.

581
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,610
Don't forget about the basics.
The toughest, toughest soldiers,

582
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:34,190
they say traditionally are
Koreans and Turks. Their ability,

583
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,160
there's legendary ability to endure
hardship and stuff. That's interesting.

584
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,230
But then again,
you would think Mexicans is tough.

585
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,260
Mexican's Koreans that are really good.
There's a few,

586
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,330
Korean fighters are really good.

587
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,890
Korea started to build like
this really good base now. Well,

588
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:51,120
Korea was in Baden 400 times home.
Enjoy making a comeback. Izzy. Yup,

589
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,200
I heard looking for scrap. Is he
getting his pituitary gland operate on?

590
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,730
He's one of those guys. He's like 600
pounds. Who's going to fight him? Nobody.

591
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,830
But like big foot was like way over 300
pounds. Remember he fought that dude.

592
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:09,000
Uh, the big Jujitsu, uh,
Eric Guy from Hawaii.

593
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,810
Eric Palae. Oh, Eric Pale Ale. Huge guy.

594
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,580
A big foot. That's right. Back in
the day. I think Eric Palae beat him.

595
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:22,170
I think he knocked him out. It was that
an elite Xc, goddammit. I don't remember.

596
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:26,910
Find that Jamie. Eric Palae
versus big foot Silva. Man,

597
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,450
I can't remember what happened that, but
Palae was huge. She was like 300 pounds.

598
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,261
This is this,

599
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:36,000
this big giant [inaudible] you hear
Mark Hunt started camp at 340 pounds.

600
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,710
What? It's nice and light from
Barbara. I know. It's beautiful.

601
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:45,490
He's in good shape. 300. That's what you
want. It really may barely made weight.

602
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,980
Had to [inaudible]. See, I've heard 14
year old Simone. Keep it all that way.

603
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:54,000
Just the blueprint of healthiness.
Just he's an animal.

604
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,680
I'm a Mark Hunt fan to the end.
I'm a mark so far.

605
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:02,970
I think everyone's a Mark Hunt. You
have to be so fun. And by the way,

606
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,760
he's got some of the most
beautiful walkaway Kaos.

607
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:10,250
He's Kao Stephan Struve and usher
and yeah. Yeah. Chris Tucker.

608
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,310
And uh, how about um, uh,

609
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,900
Chango God damn that
precision with that left hook.

610
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:20,220
He landed your black Bot. Scary
dude. Man always toughest fuck.

611
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,530
And by the way,
barely throws any leg kicks.

612
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,920
He's got legs that are like
fucking telephone poles.

613
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,020
They're the most frightening legs.
You think?

614
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,460
If that guy doesn't really throw him,

615
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,930
he would fuck guys up if he
threw a lot of leg kicks,

616
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,670
me throws him occasionally and
they have a lot of power behind.

617
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,450
His legs are enormous. They're
fucking a new one. If you block it,

618
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,680
you didn't get fucked up,
dude.

619
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:45,250
Anybody who doesn't incorporate
leg kicks in their game,

620
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,480
if they could have been there when I was
first starting to do commentary and I

621
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,261
got to see Pedro,

622
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,310
his Oh fight when he was in his
prime kicking Randy couture's buddy,

623
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:55,780
we'd be doing leg kicks.

624
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,320
It's such a ruthless weapon was in
the hand of a guy like Pedro, his,

625
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:01,120
oh Jesus Christ.

626
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:04,530
I never heard anybody's leg kicks
sound like that before crack. Oh,

627
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:09,531
why inspired me to go and kick the bag
like hundreds of times more just being

628
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:14,290
there from him doing that. Maybe want
to work out your leg kicks Brit d crazy.

629
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:18,250
My man. I guarantee when we
trained with Dwayne at your house,

630
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,190
you are kicking it all hard and my uh,
my best friend and my brother were there.

631
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,680
You're like, ah, brighten
your term. I was like God damn

632
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,720
joking. Kick like a mother fucker.
Ridiculous speed and power.

633
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,740
It's hard to kick after him. It's weird.
I tried to follow him and comedy. Yes.

634
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,000
I was trying to be funny. I like
made some joke or something stupid.

635
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,890
We tell some stories before, man, man, we
got in the car and my brother was like,

636
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:48,080
you a rolling guitar in you?
Huh? I'm like, yeah man.
Better kicker. Fuck you guys.

637
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:52,310
All right, big deal. Hey
check. Check this out.

638
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:55,790
When he caught up maybe 15 years ago,

639
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,010
I was hanging out with Joe.

640
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:01,940
We dropped off his car to get a new
stereo and we had a kill. I got two hours.

641
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,430
So there was a gym across the street,
kickboxing gym,

642
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,590
owned by some Middle Eastern brothers
that were going to come full and

643
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:12,410
kickboxing. Aw, sweet.
We just go, we show up,

644
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,460
we show up and Joe is just hanging out.
And I asked the guy,

645
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,200
I made it seem like we were interested
in joining. So I asked them, I go,

646
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,710
what kind of kicks do you guys
throw here? And he goes, oh,

647
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,450
we do with these kids and those
kids. And I go, uh, uh, can you,

648
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,540
can you show me what kind of kicks you
throw here? So he's all warming up,

649
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,171
stretching out,

650
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:34,160
and he's about to kick this bag and he
looks over at Joe and he sees Joe like

651
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:36,910
shadow boxing and all.
But as Joe Joe didn't want to,

652
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,110
I wanted to say I was setting them up.

653
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,950
I wanted him to kick the back first and
then have Joe kick and look at his face.

654
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,170
I, I've done this before,
like at John Jocks,

655
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,470
there's like an old thing that I
did and I, and I was setting him up,

656
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,140
but before he kicked the back,
he looked the Joe and it says,

657
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,290
have you ever trained? And Joe didn't
want, he goes, yeah. And it goes in what?

658
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:56,150
In a taekwondo and the knee.
It goes for how long?

659
00:40:56,151 --> 00:41:00,860
It was quite a long time and he goes, let
me see what you got. So then Joe said,

660
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:03,380
okay, so Joe murders, this fucking bad,

661
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,520
destroys the fresh after he
gets done with this fear,

662
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,660
this flurry of hurricane cakes,
that guy goes, hey listen,

663
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,310
fuck that noise. He goes,
I do this for a living.

664
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,250
If I have a kicking contest with him,
I can get hurt my classes.

665
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm going to teach. If you guys want to
come to the class, I'll show you this guy,

666
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,050
dude,
he's a smart guy and my mind

667
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,490
where he's kicking with Mike Della
rotting, whatever his name is,

668
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,430
guys play podcasts. He doesn't know
Mark Telegraph. I watch that fucking,

669
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,940
I watched this shut up. Shut up.
Both of you. I watched that video.

670
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,760
We work with a fucking professional
fights. No near the top 10 heavyweight.

671
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:53,600
No worries. I've seen a lot of guys
kick out like I've grown up in Jim's,

672
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:58,430
I've seen Duane Ludwig. I'm just saying
the hardest kicked I've ever seen.

673
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:01,280
I'll go on record saying, this is Joe
Rogan. It's not just because he's my boy.

674
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,950
It's the hardest cake I've ever seen.
Crazy shit.

675
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,620
And I thought it was gonna be
talking about my boxing. Right.

676
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:10,930
But no one said Shit. If I'm talking about
Romans kids as like, yeah, pretty cool.

677
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,620
Fuck that guy anyways. And just, you know,
it's like damn man, nutty shades insane.

678
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:16,970
If you've never seen it,
check it out.

679
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,460
I started doing it when I was a little
kid when I was trying to tape for King of

680
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:23,420
the cage back in the day.

681
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:27,440
This was like in 2000 I would
work with Joe every now and then.

682
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,420
He was trying to show me some shit
and man, I was holding back from an,

683
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,440
I felt that this was like 2000 2001 and
I'm thinking are kicks from a guy this

684
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,110
size supposed to be this hard.

685
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,410
I didn't know he was showing me how
to hold bags. I'm like, this is,

686
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,880
I can only imagine if I didn't
have the bags on my arm.

687
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,250
So I start at,

688
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:53,240
John Jackson was a bag one bag in
his Jujitsu school and it was filled.

689
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,300
The class was filled with guys
that were black belt in karate.

690
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,480
They were trying to add Jujitsu to their
system. We had a bunch of black belts.

691
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,260
So I wanted to know if,
if maybe this was just normal,

692
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:07,010
maybe all dudes can it like, so I would
say I would have guys that go, Dave,

693
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:09,680
can you kick the bag right here
due to the coach on the crowd.

694
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,030
So he would kick in. I go, Joe, now you
kick it. And then everyone goes, oh shut.

695
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,640
And then we're like, oh
my God, it is incredible.

696
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,090
So then I kept doing that over and over.
I wanted to just make sure,

697
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,970
just to make sure I was telling him
I knew what I was talking about.

698
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,220
So I remember commentating for King of
the cage and Rico Rodriguez was uh, uh,

699
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,620
backstage and we were hanging out
and he was the only one I saw.

700
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,360
They would throw turning sidekicks and
I felt Joe's turning side kick. He was,

701
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,880
he's right away.
He was showing me how powerful it can be.

702
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,020
And I remember taking a video of Joe
doing turning side kicks in his old house

703
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:45,770
and the garage showing it backstage
at Kink to Ricoh Roderick is,

704
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:47,600
there was no youtube or
anything. I'm like, look dude,

705
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,380
you got to take lessons from Joe
Rogan. You've got to throw it. And He,

706
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:54,650
I remember him looking at the screening,
you couldn't really tell on that little,

707
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:58,220
it was a little LCD screen from my
blog video camera, my video camera.

708
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,170
And he was like, hmm, I'm trying to show
him there's no technology in 2000 at all.

709
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,860
I had to show him what the LCD screen and
he was like, interesting, interesting.

710
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:11,450
And you know, and he was, he thought
I was crazy. The guy fear factor,

711
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,040
can it, can I watch that Instagram video?

712
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,400
I showed probably 50 people that you know
who can kick like a fucking mule and I

713
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:27,080
would beg him to kick. I would beg
him to kick Shankar Carwyn. I said,

714
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,200
when you fight Brock Lesnar,
throw this fucking kick.

715
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,370
Well he's just in that weird way.

716
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,930
He's like, everything is too
big. His shoulders are too
big. His hands are too big.

717
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,610
He walked into fucking um, uh,
the boulder Jujitsu school.

718
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,270
He walked him all eastern
spices and I swear to God,

719
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,720
it took me a half a second to realize it
was Shane Carwyn cause I thought it was

720
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:52,170
watching like a movie. I thought it
was watching a movie. We're like,

721
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,820
like the thing shows up.
He's,

722
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,780
he was practicing kicks and we
kept telling we got to use them.

723
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,820
You've got to use them. This is right
before I went in the tough house.

724
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,210
This motherfucker's,
I start using them for my,

725
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:08,400
tore my MCL the week before I went
to the ultimate fighter house.

726
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:12,240
So I went in the house with a torn
MCL. He kicked in once. I said no more.

727
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:15,270
You fucking imagine if you
look at how big his hands are,

728
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:20,271
if you see how hard the punching power
is going to directly translate to kicking

729
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:25,020
power, freaky punching power, he's
going to have freaky kicking power.

730
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,700
Almost always. It's just a matter of his,
has he put in the same amount of time? Oh

731
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,890
Wow. This chap got of, got hung in
there, man. Yeah, he's got this dude,

732
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:38,430
this is just trying to his back. If he
chokes him out, this would be incredible.

733
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,641
Betty,

734
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:41,760
how funny is it that almost everybody
goes with the body triangle now when they

735
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:42,594
take the back?

736
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,440
Isn't it funny though that she used to
be a thing to say that all the time?

737
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,410
Never going to disagree
with Eddie Bravo ever.

738
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:52,680
I'm just saying for my game personally in,
in MMA,

739
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:57,090
I'm not a fan of that body
triangle y flexibility. So
no, I can do it. I can do it.

740
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,490
Why aren't you a fan?
I just feel like, um,

741
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,490
especially guys are so good at defending
a blue belt in the UFC with those big

742
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:09,210
gloves can defend forever. So it's almost
a stalling technique. Now if you forget,

743
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,140
unless you're just a Henry
Gracie, Gracie, Eddie Bravo,

744
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,580
fuck Verdo fucking nasty on
someone's back. You gotta move,

745
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,740
you gotta move.
Got Trend just from the arm bar.

746
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,580
You got a transistor site control from it.
I ain't no problems with that.

747
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,940
I'm not disagreeing.
I wouldn't disagree with that.

748
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,080
I was going for the kill on the back.

749
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:31,470
I would definitely put the body
triangle and I would, but if I wasn't,

750
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,680
if I was thinking he's
too fresh as in MMA,

751
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:38,520
it seems like if you get the
guys back and he's fresh,

752
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:42,900
Tuft finishment the our transition
to spiderweb, the arm bar position,

753
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,520
I would go right to that.
Just would Rhonda.

754
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,200
Rhonda don't mess around with the back.

755
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,770
But if you get someone's back late
and they're kind of tired and hurt,

756
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,330
that's when you make a choking because
guys are, it's hard with the gloves.

757
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,070
Like you said,
they grabbed the glove though.

758
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,690
If you notice it and
you're not allowed to,

759
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:59,760
but they grabbed the
clubs so it's super tough.

760
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,500
Then it's tough to slow to sneak the hand
in around the neck because because of

761
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:05,334
the cloud.

762
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,570
Do you think that there could be an
argument because the fact that they're not

763
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:12,480
fighting with anything on their feet and
they're kicking each other in the face,

764
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,110
like why aren't they punching each
other in the face with no gloves on?

765
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,740
The reality being that if you did punch
incorrectly and if you were more wild

766
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:24,660
and reckless with your punches,
you would have to pay a price for it.

767
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:29,740
So we're really more protecting hands than
we've run our the fighter. And in fact

768
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,520
it's probably better for your brain
if you're getting bare knuckled.

769
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,160
If you're not allowed to tape your
wrists up and you're not allowed to put

770
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:40,000
anything on your hands. I'm sorry. You
just can't hit as hard. You just can't.

771
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,440
You're going to have some movement.

772
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,320
You're going to have some movement
in your wrists when you punch,

773
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,480
you can have a lot of
movement with your kicks.

774
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,730
You don't want to be fucking movement.
You're shinning people in the head.

775
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,460
There's no movement and thicker,
denser and like, like Terry Adam,

776
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,840
when Edson Barboza wheel kicked him Gibbs.
No movement in your fucking he'll man.

777
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,040
None. So that the amount of impact that
you can make with a heel like that,

778
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:06,160
like you're saying, you're saying people
should maybe wear pads on their feet.

779
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,640
The hands. No, I'm not saying get
rid of the gloves, the gloves.

780
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,100
I think there's an argument for
getting rid of the glare. Why?

781
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:15,430
There's not mainstream media.
Right? What'd you be like? What

782
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,400
fucking morons? It's a four ounce glove.
It doesn't do much. It's just perception.

783
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,240
I think the PR,

784
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,780
I think honestly it probably protects
the hand more than it protects anything.

785
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,840
I think Bella tour for liking the hand.
Bella toward gloves.

786
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:31,230
They have a good idea cause
it's more curved and it's,

787
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,490
it's more padded and it protects the hand.

788
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,550
Would there be patting your back of
the hand? Why do they have patty?

789
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:39,970
Can I get back fist? This dude's
you could spinning back. Jesus.

790
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:42,970
There should just be pads on the knuckles.
Not on the back of the hand.

791
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,390
That big thick thing. It's harder
to give you a bunch out. It's true.

792
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,230
But the but the belt or glove.
The reason why it's so fat like that.

793
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:54,760
The idea being that this,
it's everlasting. He gave
it to the Japanese guy, pat.

794
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,810
Whoa. Maybe he won that second
round. I Dunno. We didn't.

795
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:04,550
We were really barely paring it down to
that first round. Should have been dead.

796
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:06,820
I hate, there's no way this
should have been a draw.

797
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,570
I think what I was saying is the belt
or glove it supports and there's still

798
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:13,270
four ounce.
They're still friends but there's more,

799
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:14,890
there's more support because it's more,

800
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,800
you had hated even more Eddie cause
there's like more stuff on top.

801
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,150
It's like thicker on top. And the idea
being, I think that's what she said.

802
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,510
Oh Shit. Brian at chop. I think they um,

803
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,800
they found that they had
way less handbrakes though.
Once they started using it,

804
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,070
they had a bunch of hand to balance
for gloves. Yeah. They're a,

805
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,870
they protect that significant because
the handbrake and keep you out of there,

806
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,140
take you out for he cans.
Right, right. But Eddie, do
you see my argument or my not,

807
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,920
it's not even an argument.
I'm not married to it.

808
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,200
I'd be happy if they kept
fighting with UFC gloves.

809
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:49,230
But I think there can be a debate that
it would probably be just as safe with no

810
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:55,531
gloves and probably maybe even possibly
safer and way better for grappling.

811
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,380
Have there been less pokes to the eye
or more or has it been like a steady

812
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:03,640
amount happens all the time.
Yeah.

813
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:09,030
I would say with no gloves if
it's easier to knock a guy out,

814
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,110
good for the show,
good for the sport.

815
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,220
If it's easier to get submissions because
you don't have all that shit that's

816
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:19,360
good for the show, it would.
If it adds chaos and add
submissions, get rid of them.

817
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,420
I think that um, if, uh, I
think if you have gloves on,

818
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:27,800
you probably can kale people better.
I really do.

819
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,310
I think you have way more protection
on your wrist. That's a big thing.

820
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,670
You're hands are wrapped up. You feel real
confident with it. It's nice and tight.

821
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,360
Yeah. Anything to get more
knockouts and more submissions.

822
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,870
That's what we want to see.
We don't, we're not paying
for decisions. Yeah. I mean,

823
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:46,760
and also it's like how much, how
much work is getting done. I mean,

824
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:49,730
how much work is getting done
with those fucking gloves on?

825
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:54,150
Spend a lot of time wrapping the
hands for what really again? Yeah.

826
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,310
Got To protect those hands, man.
Those hands are precious. Yeah.

827
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:02,820
I mean think about like the
cheekbones killer murderer sockets.

828
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,060
That's it. This kind of weird, right?

829
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,730
Why won't they pat up the eye
socket have like, well this is all,

830
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,130
I think it's all remanence of boxing.
You know,

831
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,820
I think we have like a lot of ideas and
and we, we have their scoring system.

832
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,650
We told we don't have
our own scoring system.

833
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,430
Our scoring system is based entirely on
the boxing's corns to the 10 point must

834
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:19,910
system.

835
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,360
We just arbitrarily started using 10
point must cause the athletic commissions

836
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:24,410
had already prepared for it.

837
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:27,920
They already had judges that knew how to
score a 10 for the winter nine for the

838
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:30,140
loser. If it's bad
round, he scored an Nate.

839
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,290
I mean this is a way
different game than boxing.

840
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:36,110
It needs its own type of fighting.
Super Score.

841
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,600
I know we don't,

842
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:41,300
you think that we need a
more complex scoring system

843
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,250
when we work together with Eddie Bravo
used to do the in round scoring at the

844
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:53,210
UFC and it was fucking great because Eddie
had a sister. She'll unofficial judge,

845
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,600
unofficial in round score the hell.
So he would sit next to us.

846
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:59,290
It was sitting next to us. Then in
between rounds we would, you know,

847
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,240
would show a highlight or something and
then I'd say, Eddie, what do you think?

848
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,580
And Eddie would say, you know,
I gave it to this, to this,

849
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,440
I think for doomed did
that and blah blah blah.

850
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:10,280
And he would break down why and he had
a sheet and on his sheet who would write

851
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:13,700
kicks on one side take downs on their
side submissions on the other side.

852
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,520
And he would write like what type
of submission, how close it was.

853
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,840
And he had all that stuff laid out and
then afterwards he would give a detailed

854
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:24,350
reason why I thought that Kane
won that round because of this.

855
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:27,920
And then he would go over all the
various, write it down. It's so hard.

856
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,240
I didn't write it down. There's so
much that went on in that round you,

857
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:36,870
it's hard to visually see if he
was a question. If somebody takes,

858
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,900
if somebody attempts 10 takedowns
and the guy stuff's 10 takedowns,

859
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,740
the aggressor is more valuable,
but then he gets one.

860
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,670
You know that you don't let a question.
What about wins around for sure.

861
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,970
He's winning the round. If he's attempting
more, right. The guys stuffing it.

862
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,440
That guy is, he's not giving
up two months. So aggression,

863
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,130
aggression should count as
sure. Yeah, it'd be something.

864
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,300
What about a foma submission artist?
I pulled,

865
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,350
I pulled half guard and I'm
throwing all these submission tents,

866
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:09,710
all these Amish temps and the guys kind
of getting out of them. I'm getting,

867
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,040
I'm going to give nothing but judges see
the guy on top. He's getting the true,

868
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,210
but I see that again, that say that
again. A Guy's trying to sell it.

869
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:18,650
So let's say you and I are fighting.

870
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:22,220
You pull guard and you're
throne Ooma Plata triangle,

871
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,910
a armbars nonstop per five minutes,
nonstop moms.

872
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:31,080
The whole time on defending, I win the
round. That ain't right. That ain't right.

873
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:33,750
But, and you're doing and I'm
doing no damage, but let's say,

874
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,670
let's say in that Ben Saunders fight,

875
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:39,390
let's say that exact same
thing happened every round.

876
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,920
He ended up taking him down and just
assaulted him with those elbows and rubber

877
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:48,600
guard. But he didn't finish him.
I think when it's that clear,

878
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,600
the judges will give it to the guy on
the bottom. Cause it has happened before.

879
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,100
It just needs to be,
you know what?

880
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,970
Clear with some serious
that's up for debate.

881
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:01,080
You would think they would. I bet it'd
be 50, 50 depending where you're fine.

882
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,320
They shit, I'll fucking crazy.
Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. Cause uh,

883
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,670
thinking I think if the NFL,
NBA where like that where it's 50,

884
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:13,250
50 pence on, don't leave it
up to the judges. It's a,

885
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,070
Ben Saunders didn't get the Alma plot that
the guy survived and the time run out.

886
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,420
Who would I won that round?

887
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:23,280
You think the judges would have really
gave it to the dude on top? Probably.

888
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,750
He was the whole time.
I know,

889
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,670
but all they do is they just, a lot of
them are just mentally geared towards,

890
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:36,240
he's on top. He's winning the round
cause they're on educated with Jujitsu.

891
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,730
You know what ends up happening? I'll
tell you some of these judges, man,

892
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:43,850
they look at the replays and if in the
truck they're showing [inaudible] doing

893
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,540
all that stuff they've got,
okay,

894
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:49,020
they must in the truck think that
due to winning. So they do that.

895
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:54,210
They do that for 100% for sure.
100% for sure. 100% not all of them.

896
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:58,650
Not all the judges. Not all the judges
and a few, but I know what's happened.

897
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,840
This is the fight. I'm looking. Brendan
Schaub is a weird fascination with this.

898
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,910
I know.
I don't think it's about fighting.

899
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,900
I'm going to just choosing the young lady.

900
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,463
She looks,

901
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:18,630
look at [inaudible] her picked her up
for the UFC thick shoes like a little

902
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,730
Paula Hardy's looking at,
I think Michigan is very attractive.

903
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,680
Marion was attractive female.
She doesn't do steroids. No Way.

904
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,320
Oh look at that Japanese book. Look. So,

905
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,370
so tell me she's a cutie
pie. No. First of all,

906
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:40,020
Rin grew up doing gymnastics. Judo, she,

907
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:44,910
she takes, she trains every day. Takes
only one day off a month, 24 hours a day.

908
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:50,010
She has that fricking crazy workouts.
He's undefeated to look at those arms.

909
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,850
Come on. She's undefeated, undefeated
16 and no one. Look, there's no Joe.

910
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,370
She, she's asking right now. I'm
a huge Pratt. All of us. I hope.

911
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,550
I hope she's awesome. She
doesn't get smoke. Well,

912
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:06,330
what is that thing that she does?
Weird cheered photographs that she does.

913
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:11,190
She does like me. I'm awesome. Sexy
pictures. I'm not saying it's bad.

914
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:14,790
It's called marketing. It's called
marketing. You mean the awesome.

915
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:19,020
I'm just saying it was your mom.
I would say it's odd.

916
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,060
Are you going to a store?
Brian is

917
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,140
in my car.
It's weird.

918
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:29,590
You have one store in your car if
you're a pony to another party. Right.

919
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:30,580
Travis Browne,

920
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,680
Travis Brown water to fight you in a
rash guard and the commission, you know,

921
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,310
since they're allowing girls that
fighting rash guards, they decide, Ooh,

922
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:43,450
let's make it, uh, you know, it's
up. Leave it up to the fighters.

923
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,820
Would you allow if it was up to you,

924
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:49,450
would you allow Travis Browne to where
rash guard and you're fine? No. Why not?

925
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,200
Because, uh, girls wear them
all the time. It's true. Why

926
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,850
would you say no or would you say
whenever he wants it doesn't matter.

927
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,340
What would you say? I would probably
say no because if he wants to wear it,

928
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:07,810
there's some sort of advantage that he
thinks that he's going to have by wearing

929
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:11,750
it. So he must be Hella comfortable in
this rash guard. If I pull the power moon,

930
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:14,560
I'm like Nah son, take that rash
geared off cause I'm not wearing one.

931
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:19,180
You know what I'm saying? Friendly,
sharp playing mind games. But you can't,

932
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:22,930
you and you'd think, hey look,
look what could be the advantage.

933
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,830
I don't know. You're nasty and a rash
guard. What are you talking about?

934
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:30,670
Nasty look, look at this.
No behind you. Brendan Chop.

935
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,210
Did she shout? Whoa. Look at those legs.

936
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,440
There's all the photographs
of her but on her son,

937
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:43,280
her arms man cause too much. As long
as much I know a little much. No. No.

938
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,460
Because I think she would
be kind of submissive.

939
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:49,810
It'd be Kinda hot cause she's like
the super strong kind of advantage.

940
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:54,270
Do you show that you would have probably
a group, maybe a grip advantage. How, how,

941
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,990
how would he get him?
Because let, let's say, uh,

942
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,240
you're fighting a guy like for
breach over doom. Who you're,

943
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:02,170
you're worried about is you're going to
get a really good sweat and warm up on

944
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:04,510
before. So I'm a little more
slippery, you know what I'm saying?

945
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:07,030
You want to be slipper? Yes. Oh I see.

946
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:10,210
So you think that it would be an
advantage cause it, you would,

947
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,940
it would limit Dior defense?
Yes.

948
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,480
Especially with a guy like for
doom, right. That's what I'm saying.

949
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,570
Well you're dealing with us.
So what she's wearing,

950
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:21,790
what of Travis Brown wanted to wear
that you would object to it. Yeah.

951
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:26,230
It's slapped him the face at the press
garments slap in the face for even

952
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:30,070
considering it. What if the guy you
were fighting, okay. What if the guy,

953
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:34,930
you were filed Jon Jones Gacy what does
the guy you were fighting? Uh, let's see.

954
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:37,570
Who could it be? Did it help
him? If he wants to wear a mask,

955
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:42,880
you were guiding lactose. Carlos wore that
in pride. I'm down for that. It would,

956
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:46,510
if you were fighting cro cop and
he wanted to wear a rash guard,

957
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,590
would you allow him think about it? He was
not going to try to submit you. I know,

958
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:53,770
but I kept saying you would want to submit
but I kept taking, I fought cro gun.

959
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,370
Oh wait, that's right. You beat him.
Right. I forget. I forget. Yeah.

960
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,920
And not only that,
that was a panic.

961
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:02,590
So that would be a bad example
because a kickboxer would want to be,

962
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:05,860
have a really good guard like you would
want him to and he wants to get up.

963
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,690
But if he,
you're on the bottom,

964
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:11,250
how is that going to help people with
extra grip holding a guy onto, you know,

965
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:15,940
it be just try to get stood up
two bottles or loss gain.

966
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:18,310
Cro Cop did the same. So you, uh,

967
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,000
so you would be against that if they,
if you had a

968
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,700
sign,
a petition against,

969
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:30,050
are you for or against rash guards in MMA?
Men don't care that much.

970
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:34,030
But if you were a rash guard on when
we're wrestling shoes take in the face

971
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,180
wrestling shoes.

972
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,770
What if you were going up against
a guy like Paul Harris then? No,

973
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,330
no wrestling shoes.
No recipe boil these things.

974
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,300
Yeah, we're a little leg locks
illegal. I want to see the dude's name,

975
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:53,090
but I know a dude who would
lay in a mineral bath.

976
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,900
He would take mineral oil and lay in the
bath the night before and then he would

977
00:59:56,901 --> 01:00:01,490
take a shower and dry off and then he
would make weight. Even though he was,

978
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:06,050
he was not wearing any oil on him.
He was so oily from the night before.

979
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,340
But as soon as you broke a sweat,

980
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:10,850
it would all come through his pores
and he would just be like a seal.

981
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,720
Just us seal does heal.

982
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,400
Do you think you could
beat in an MMA fight?

983
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:20,950
Do you think you could be Gabby Garcia?
Are you being, you being Farrell's?

984
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:25,460
Yeah. Yeah. You're talking to a man,

985
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,000
Garcia. I know it doesn't match and
then pushes images. She lost weight.

986
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,040
She got to slim 300 pounds real quick.

987
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,210
I like it. He should take, I think she's
very attractive. However, written the Chi.

988
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,470
Yes. Britain. The Chi. I
just feel like she keeps,

989
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,760
and it's going to be good for the sport.

990
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,660
Could you imagine if she became the well
to which are the bantamweight champion?

991
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,290
I've written to Chi if she's got all
these freak pictures of her in her

992
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,550
underwear,
you know,

993
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,570
wearing fucking little fucking
bunny rabbit slippers and shit.

994
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,440
Dangerous fight. Dangerous
fight for me. She's 10.

995
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:10,220
She doesn't know what to expect, but
she could be sent us a little bull dog.

996
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,220
What did she do? Her up.
This Japanese bulldog.

997
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,770
It doesn't necessarily mean she
doesn't know what she's doing.

998
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,370
She's gonna try getting her down. Oh,
she does know what she's doing. She's,

999
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,200
come on, she's stiff, but
she could still land man.

1000
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:29,230
But she looked very stiff nerves. You've
got first UFC fight. Fuck yeah. USC.

1001
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,410
No, I bet she's real strong.
Dude. Me Tastes gonna fuck her up.

1002
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,430
Meisha Tate's later turn into the mic.
Aggressive.

1003
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,760
How long has Ron show business?
My math is wrong with you.

1004
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,120
He wants to be on that Mike. So bad. I
got hungry. Starving when he's eating,

1005
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,090
he can't push it away.
That's my friend.

1006
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,660
It looks like me. She was going
to dominate it does me just said,

1007
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:56,490
oh you train everyday stuff for one.
Check this out me.

1008
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,390
She looks very strong and very aggressive
and you know there's another thing

1009
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:03,170
that she's coming off of a
fight where she wasn't. Oh Wow.

1010
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:07,170
Bragged on Michelle's
digit. Pretty solid. Yeah.

1011
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,980
Well her overall technique is very solid.

1012
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,390
I mean she's the only person to ever put
Rhonda in a compromising position in a

1013
01:02:14,391 --> 01:02:17,840
fight. Let's call this Carmouche.
That's true. That's true.

1014
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,370
But that was when used,
she still does.

1015
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:23,190
She does that hip toss where
she grabs a hold the headlock,

1016
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:27,390
the headlock and she gives up the back
all the time cause she wasn't trained

1017
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:28,640
with a cage so she wouldn't eat.

1018
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,570
She wasn't used to it and
got in a weird position.

1019
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,810
I just feel like she's so
confident that it doesn't,

1020
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:36,150
she feels like it doesn't matter
if they get her neck or whatever,

1021
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:37,200
she's going to fuck them up.

1022
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:42,560
That girl has such incredible like
laser beam focus towards victory does.

1023
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:45,270
She doesn't have any doubt.
It's,

1024
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:49,710
it's so rare that Beth career batch
Cocheco hair, that's going to be a great,

1025
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:54,480
that can actually happen. And then the
next one, she's got Rhonda. So, uh,

1026
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:59,100
work pissed off. She, she
looks like a giant stuff.

1027
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,640
We'll compare to this check written
to Chi. Well, Nikai is very thick,

1028
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,120
but it doesn't seem to be working out.
Reney Chi.

1029
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:08,940
Better figure something out here. Not
that impressed. I gotta be honest. Well,

1030
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:11,790
she's very stiff. I mean she is
still when anything can happen,

1031
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:16,140
fights or she went with a
submission. You never know, man.

1032
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,640
You never know. She's not going to win
striking unless she just has some, oh,

1033
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,350
she got tagged with that knee.
Just lighten her own. Now.

1034
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:28,330
Ameesha looks very smooth. Yes, she
does. Close to taking her down. Oh,

1035
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,340
but I'm telling you, do weird things
happen when people are durable.

1036
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,880
And this chick seems very durable. I'm
not saying she's going to win the fight,

1037
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:40,840
but weird shifts can happen.
Yes,

1038
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,690
he's written. It guides me like,
Holy Shit, I'm a use of sin.

1039
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,050
That's what she's thinking right now.
Oh Shit. I'm in the UFC. Well, this,

1040
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,390
by the way, this is like one of the
best versions of Meesha we've ever seen,

1041
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,920
if not the best.
You don't think it's a she's facing.

1042
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,680
I'm sure it has something to
do with it. No, but seriously,

1043
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:02,010
she looks very good shopping.
Nice. No, he's being honest.

1044
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,860
I'm being dead on dead on.
It's like when Overeem fight Frank Mir,

1045
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,170
Frank Mir fan in the world, everyone's
like, oh my God, they'll redeem his back.

1046
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,300
Or was he fighting a human punching
bag? Frank Meir did nothing. Well,

1047
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,560
Frank's had a long career,
man. Danny, you got car I left,

1048
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,530
got hit by a car. It was on a motorcycle
and the car literally hit his leg.

1049
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:28,210
The car slammed into his leg,

1050
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,290
but he's saying he still a
great fights after fights.

1051
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,250
He had good fights after
that. Brock Lesnar, it took
him a long time to recover.

1052
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:38,310
It took them a long time to
recover. I think that, um,

1053
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:42,750
that was a devastating injury,
frankly, one of the best ever to do it.

1054
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:46,590
Ever without a doubt. When the best
submission artists without a, she's hurt.

1055
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,800
She's hurt. She's really
hard. It's over. Oh boy.

1056
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,780
Nisha just chicks durable man.
Very durable.

1057
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:59,400
The sport needs Misha Women's,
women's fighting needs. Misha Tate,

1058
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:03,930
Bob Brennan show magic. I'm telling
you, cause she's attractive.

1059
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:06,750
She speaks well and she
has some skills. Yeah. Oh,

1060
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:09,400
she definitely has some
scales down. Shit. She got to,

1061
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,640
you know what is a
chick like Nisha though?

1062
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,840
Like what does she do with a girl like
Rhonda out there that is kind of a

1063
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:18,020
prophecy to Stacy second.
Koizumi

1064
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,150
second place. Second place. Second place.
Isn't that bad. It's like shake and bake.

1065
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:27,070
It's shaken baby. Shake your shake
it. Rhonda shake. I mean she was big,

1066
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:32,380
big. Hey Becky still lived in a nice
crib. Bake. Still had a nice brim.

1067
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:37,330
Big wound up fucking shakes. Wife
remember shit got crazy. Shit gets crazy.

1068
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:41,710
Crazy. Oh Marty. That was
what calls him up. He goes,

1069
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,120
why is the TV on?

1070
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:46,150
What you want the TV on the legal on
the same time because I liked to party.

1071
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:51,580
How do you get the sound stereo
but still watching the TV.

1072
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:00,070
That's such a good movie. Great shake and
bake. But nobody, I'm telling you man,

1073
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:03,430
they're not good friends. Look at my
face and to always be little Zur. No,

1074
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:07,690
they fucking hate each other. So No,
I'm just saying shaking baby. Yeah,

1075
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,810
but being second place to
someone as ruthless as Rhonda,

1076
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:13,450
like when they were doing the ultimate
fighter together and they were doing that

1077
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:16,180
thing where they're climbing the
wall and Rhonda winds and she goes,

1078
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,710
fuck you bitch. Hey, she fucking
hates her. Nobody does that.

1079
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,920
Everybody else if is Gilbert and
didn't guys don't do that guys.

1080
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:26,500
Brian is a different animal man.
She absolutely does.

1081
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:30,850
Does she literally has hate in her heart?
Oh yeah. I don't hate anyone in the UFC.

1082
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:33,820
I don't hate anyone.
No one Rhonda literally hates me.

1083
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:38,500
Should tailor hates she's on.
She's on some next level shit.

1084
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:42,940
She done some demonic next level.
She's got some fury in her and,

1085
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,750
and you don't want to be Misha
Tate on the receiving end.

1086
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,330
Well you need to be not only if
you do need to match her skillset,

1087
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,950
which is good fucking luck, but you need
to be able to match that intensity man.

1088
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:59,920
Fuck thing. He's really fucked as this
written Nikai okay. She's fucking like,

1089
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,660
cause we're talking
about Rhonda right now.

1090
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,670
This girl's only half ass double leg.
She's freaking,

1091
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:10,230
I don't know what she's
doing. Turned on her. I

1092
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,020
was planning out our kids and say no,

1093
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,310
not with head movement like that.
No.

1094
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,860
Oh excuse me sir.
She doesn't come on.

1095
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:33,090
Get this and Brennan my like you more.
She's

1096
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,460
checking the oil. You don't, she
doesn't have any oil in there.

1097
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:44,490
[inaudible] was knuckle deep
in that Knuckle d women.

1098
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:49,480
It's not an oil situation. The knuckle
deep meter hits Red Hot Friday night.

1099
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:55,060
Taylor with a knee lube made from real
butter oil. Well it fits if you're,

1100
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,530
if a guy has oil, does a gal have oil
as well? If we're not checking your oil,

1101
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,480
checking your honey, checking
your honeypot, come on.

1102
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,400
Sympathetic conversation.
Checking the Koolaid.

1103
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:15,720
Let's not do this because this is bad
for the sport. I get answers path, man.

1104
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,200
I was trying to stay out of
it with you guys directly.

1105
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,240
Faults.
It's none of our faults.

1106
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:25,290
We had been drinking and
we're not responsible for our
word, correct? No, I am. No,

1107
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,660
I'm just drinking coffee. I'm sober
as shit, but things like that.

1108
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:30,850
It's like getting kicked in the junk.
I don't ever know what to say.

1109
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,790
If a girl kicks a girl,
I'm not coming up.

1110
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:38,920
They showed me. How have they
stopped? No. What about this?

1111
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:44,210
What about going to Haiti? Shot hurt.
Are you going to show it in slow motion?

1112
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:47,230
You show the ball shots in slow motion
is my point and everyone goes, oh,

1113
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,440
the whole stadium go home.

1114
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:54,200
By the way, I joke about it sometimes,
you know I'll make light of it like no,

1115
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:57,310
that is not fun.
You all say something like that,

1116
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,560
but I'm not going to say that
if it's a girl punt a you said,

1117
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,580
excuse me.

1118
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:07,140
[inaudible] is on her back that up

1119
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,070
throw. What did I tell you? Man
Opens when people are durable.

1120
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,030
This little fire hydrant,
just keep talking.

1121
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:22,031
Keep [inaudible] get this.

1122
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,070
We'd give you big brown,
but listen Jeezy

1123
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,650
don't win one and get the breath.

1124
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,620
Let's see if she holds the back

1125
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:41,760
body triangle. But no, look, she's hanging
on man. She's kind of hanging out with,

1126
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:44,040
she's going to be in her garage guard.
Well,

1127
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,690
let's see what kind of guard she's got.
Maybe she's,

1128
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:54,030
she might have some NASA. Well, me,
she's a very good grappler. Yeah,

1129
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:57,420
she's a better graph within.
She's a strike. 100% oh man. It's,

1130
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:00,730
but you're right guys.
Hey guys.

1131
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,830
Durable Little Gal. She's game. Yep.

1132
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,580
Taking shots. Yeah, but now she's got me.

1133
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:13,400
Y'all talk for dropping bow Chihuahua.
She's trying to set up an arm bar.

1134
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:17,750
Look at this. She's good. She's
got good hips, man. Active hips.

1135
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:20,940
This is a tricky situation for me.
Misha. She better be careful. Oh,

1136
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:26,120
this chick's legit. Legit off her
back. But Misha, good defense.

1137
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:29,900
All Straw on top.
It comes to Nissan.

1138
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,030
Oh,
attempt there.

1139
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,440
The more she can slow Meesha down on it,

1140
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,840
the more she turns into a grappling
match. She got some good positions, man.

1141
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,960
I mean, she didn't come close to finish.
She's winning this round right now.

1142
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,230
You're in Japan to
remember the last part was,

1143
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,370
I wonder if they're using Japanese judge.

1144
01:10:54,371 --> 01:10:59,170
I got a text from Dana saying that in the
fight that we were talking shit during

1145
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:02,320
the whole fight,
the referee go grab the guy's glove.

1146
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,000
I don't know what the
situation was because we were
just laughing and having too

1147
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:11,650
much fun. We missed, we missed if
he's listening to it. Yeah. Yeah.

1148
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:15,210
Dana was going crazy and
he texted me and he's like,

1149
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,330
I'm sure you know that. If I
saw it, I would have called it.

1150
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,480
But I told him in the text message,
I go, did, we didn't even see it.

1151
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:25,230
We were talking so much shit. This is
the worst way to watch a fight ever.

1152
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:29,150
I don't know that we've
gone some weird tangent,

1153
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,960
barely paying attention to amazing fight,
but it's so fun.

1154
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:36,020
This is my favorite way to watch my
timber loan. The guys got that single,

1155
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:37,973
oh boy.

1156
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:45,000
We were doing this, uh,
this my comment, oh boy.

1157
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,750
We were doing this video
breakdown of Bryan caraway
the other day and it's funny,

1158
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,620
Bryan caraway on his, on his resume
like they have, you know your resume,

1159
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:57,440
like the fighters resume they gave me
like fought in Strikeforce. Funnily Dixie,

1160
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,720
13 four records.

1161
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,300
Hey said boyfriend of
me. She said girlfriend,

1162
01:12:04,301 --> 01:12:04,930
Misha Tate.

1163
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:09,910
It said boyfriend of mishit tape that
was in his bio and he's a good fighter.

1164
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:12,520
He's foreign one in the UFC.
He's a very good fighter.

1165
01:12:12,521 --> 01:12:14,110
He's beaten some very good guys.

1166
01:12:14,111 --> 01:12:17,110
It's just his girlfriend is
hot and they want the logon.

1167
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,560
No saved his mom's

1168
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:21,481
she went into,

1169
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:25,860
she had had an asthmatic
attack and me's in like Shimmy.

1170
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:29,570
She saved her life. Wow.
Yup. Meets your say save.

1171
01:12:29,571 --> 01:12:32,610
Whose life his or her mother
Bryan Caraway. Oh, look at this.

1172
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,250
This is what she went for. She went
for a Tampon to got her back. Hmm.

1173
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:42,270
Damn. I like it. There's something right
there. Do you see something right there?

1174
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:43,560
What do you see right there?

1175
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,350
What do I see where here she was
just completely on the side arm.

1176
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:50,400
Triangle position. You know what
I love Eddie? Tell me about this.

1177
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:54,390
Are you doing that arm bar where the
arms in that arm bolt where everybody's

1178
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,230
doing it now?

1179
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:58,890
Like a lot of guys are doing an MMA
with the arms trapped inside the legs.

1180
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:03,240
Like um, like the pass the arm
to the side from side control.

1181
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:08,020
You said Pat, the arm gets passed to
the side. It's like this. Yeah. Yeah.

1182
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,740
It's totally stretched out and then
the guillotine goes on over it.

1183
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,210
You know what I'm talking
about? I don't know. Anytime.

1184
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,630
A lot of guys have been doing it
where they're getting the arm.

1185
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,580
I'm completely pinned
up to the side he gets,

1186
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,470
I think this is one. I think this
is one to one grab real quick.

1187
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,813
I think this is one

1188
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,690
one. I'm just going to throw
that out there. You guys. Um,

1189
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,150
have you seen Brian couns wig?
A wheel kick.

1190
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:33,550
Beautiful. Oh, back again.

1191
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:37,120
She likes jumping on bags.
That was a good little combo.

1192
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:41,770
She turned it on Japanese bulldog. That
looks like a very shiny outfit, man.

1193
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:46,490
Mischa's clean today. Kimora
attempts here. This chick
is so strong, man. Look at.

1194
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,710
Oh,
she comes and

1195
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,520
she's jumping on the back.
Really Quick Hook once side.

1196
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,190
That means you're right. She's
telling you. What did I tell you, boy?

1197
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,590
Right there. You got instincts. I've
been doing this a while. Netflix,

1198
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,470
you're out the Japanese bulldog

1199
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,220
show you rooting against Tate now,
bro,

1200
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,830
me or Brian, any one of
us. Does anybody here? No,

1201
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,670
I love him. He should take. Okay.

1202
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:22,760
If you could choose to be a tropic island
with one of them free. She taped me.

1203
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:27,610
Go do this to me. Don't do this
to me. Don't do it. You, you.

1204
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:32,340
You have a thing with the Japanese chick.
You would have, I think the party came.

1205
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:38,260
She is a cutie pie. She's on that
brand and you can handle it. They're,

1206
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,790
they're both of area track. Who Lie?
You find her jacket? Both of them. Well,

1207
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,810
let's just,
let's admired them for their skill.

1208
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:48,610
The traffic because their
skills are, oh me, she's out,

1209
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:52,790
but she's struggling, man. Oh, elbow.
Big issue. It's a little tiny chairs.

1210
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:55,960
Top angry man.
I thought she looked a little annoyed.

1211
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:00,520
That whole Combo or she that takes down
to the back. That was really smooth.

1212
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:04,300
How was much more difficult? Is
it for my beautiful girls? Tired.

1213
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,780
How much more difficult is it for a
beautiful girl fight? Oh, big yawn.

1214
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:10,090
A lot more pressure.
Well,

1215
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:12,790
I met this girl the other day who said
she wants to get into fighting shoes.

1216
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,650
She was stunning and I went, why would
you do saying like a girl like Misha,

1217
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,210
she has a beautiful face,

1218
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,410
whereas like body to go Vandelay Silva
and I mean everything. She's beautiful.

1219
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,600
She's a great person too.
Very nice. Very smart too.

1220
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:30,880
But let's think about like Vendelay Silva
is also a mixed martial arts fighter

1221
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:34,420
now. I've been a fan of Andrew Lee
silver from the Golden Day. Tired today,

1222
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,313
retired today.

1223
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:40,770
His face has changed so much from
impacts and scar tissue and damage.

1224
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:45,640
And we remember like when he fought
like Dan Henderson, he had this one,

1225
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,780
he was actually handsome guy.

1226
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,910
He had this one look and then over
the years of just getting smashed,

1227
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:54,010
his nose completely flooded out.

1228
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,000
And then he had to get an operation
to open his nose passage up.

1229
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,130
He had zero like May and
Miller's the same way.

1230
01:16:00,131 --> 01:16:02,920
Man can't breathe out of his nose.
His mate is, no, just doesn't work.

1231
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,090
It's just smashed from now. A girl
like me should take. It was my point.

1232
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,280
She is in the same sport.
It's them.

1233
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:12,610
It's very possible that I can hit
like a man though. She would've.

1234
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,290
She fought that batchko hair.
She'd get hit, but she was

1235
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,800
kissing God. I'll catch and
eat cheese. That's true.

1236
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:23,890
She had a blow to the elbow,

1237
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,610
but an average Wanderlei Silva
was going against a cro cop.

1238
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:32,890
These monsters just can break your nose.
It's true. It's a little different.

1239
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:36,610
Good point. That's a good point, but
still, you're a girl still scholar.

1240
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:39,010
My daughter fight,
like look at this scar on.

1241
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:42,820
Let's think of a big scar that
happened in MMA. Okay. Like Joe Lozan.

1242
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:46,620
He's got this big scar that he had.
He had that gate, that Graston method.

1243
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,290
From what? From a knee, I believe it was
a knee or a kick from one of his fights.

1244
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,830
What to grass.
The method.

1245
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,570
They take like a piece of metal and
talk about breaking up the scar tissue.

1246
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:57,420
These are for injuries.
Athletes use it for,

1247
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,450
it's like a high tech form
of that rolfing stuff.

1248
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,140
It's like breaking down, which we've
ever done. Roffman yes, fucking painful.

1249
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:09,520
It's painful but it could affect, it
leaves a mark for forever. You're fucked.

1250
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:09,980
You're

1251
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,281
saying,

1252
01:17:10,281 --> 01:17:12,770
you're saying the girl like Ronda Rousey's
Rumi state who has a really pretty

1253
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:17,210
face. Yeah man. They could get a giant
like fucking gash across their face.

1254
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,650
Like we haven't seen that yet,

1255
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:21,740
but how weird is it going to be
when there's a chick that has like,

1256
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:25,490
like John John, John Jack has that
cut from fighting frank Trigg.

1257
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,520
He was shooting in for a take down.
He got caught with a knee and he has,

1258
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:31,700
I mean he had perfect surgery done on it.
Like you can't pay attention,

1259
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,380
but John Jack is a manly man. If he has a
scar, it doesn't hurt. The way you look,

1260
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:40,070
makes it more hit some really
important girl. You're, Ooh girl,

1261
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,660
a girl with a four inch scar,

1262
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:46,560
a scarlet letter face because it's not
going to change much. Guys are so horny as

1263
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:53,300
single leg. Is that, well actually even
bigger like Gina Carano though, man.

1264
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,300
That face a guy that you
see whether it's happening.

1265
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Does that count as a point when she
takes her down against Toronto had a toy

1266
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,100
like a boxing match,

1267
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,000
but I'm saying that that should be scored
right when you take somebody down and

1268
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:10,020
single accounts up,

1269
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:14,300
but it depends on the judge to take
somebody down. Somebody stands right up.

1270
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,990
Take a little pride, a
little thing there, man.

1271
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,230
Damn.
Oh,

1272
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,210
I bet you they'd give it
to a Rin Raisie really?

1273
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,080
They might two rounds, right? He's a
superstar too. She got the back twice.

1274
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:35,480
Ultimate fighter. How they have to two
rounds and a third. If they go a third,

1275
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:38,840
the third decides that. That's a
great idea. Don't take the bad idea.

1276
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:41,630
They used to do that in k one, two.
I think that's a good idea because

1277
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,740
it eliminates that Misha is disappointed.

1278
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:49,940
Those fights where you have three rounds.
The first two are kind of close,

1279
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:53,420
but the judges gave it to like the same
dude and then the third round the other

1280
01:18:53,421 --> 01:18:56,670
guy beat his ass and he still
loses. It's true. You know?

1281
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,340
It was weird though in the
tough house when I was on it.

1282
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:01,610
When you go to round them
like you wouldn't know, you
go back to court. I'm like,

1283
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:05,760
we're gone a third like Jesus
man. You know? I think it's,

1284
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:10,580
it's easier to beg for that way. I
agree. It's kind of cool to know.

1285
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:11,780
You know what I would do if I would,

1286
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:16,040
if they were a brown one went by and
it was like uneventful could have went

1287
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,240
either way.
I would just not even score that rally.

1288
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:22,370
He would wait till the next round.
If we add another round like that,

1289
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,040
I would give him one piece. I agree.
And then you know what I mean?

1290
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,630
Why would you automatically,

1291
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:30,890
I give someone around when it could've
went either way and maybe she didn't

1292
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,560
give it to man. I don't know. We
were talking so much sugar in.

1293
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,990
It could be the worst judges of,
I don't even know who the guys were.

1294
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,040
Four judges.
They're going to give it to the car.

1295
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:49,560
Oh Shit.

1296
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:54,020
Let's see, man, I'm a seasoned
here. Foods there, any booze?

1297
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:55,963
They don't even

1298
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,890
respect the warriors chair
fights in Japan is awesome, man,

1299
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,970
because while the fights are going on,
everyone's dead quiet. It's really cool.

1300
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,460
She going to call out Rhonda here. She
needs to go to a and work on our striking,

1301
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:10,150
powerful Brian Stann looking slick.

1302
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,720
Got That bug

1303
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,430
look. It's not my favorite sexy accent,
but goddamn Japanese is pretty hot.

1304
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,890
Something about it.
My top stomp my feet.

1305
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:27,740
I thought then uniquely sexy about
it. Really. The English accent.

1306
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:37,170
Well, Spanish is pretty hard to
actually, let's say you're Mexican

1307
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,080
modern family chick, that Cuban chair. Oh

1308
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:47,900
Jesus. It's impossible to get hotter
kids with her. They called me.

1309
01:20:47,901 --> 01:20:51,060
I get hot to do it right.
They need to do an episode one,

1310
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:55,780
like how did he get hurt? They need
a rewind. Go back. Who got her like,

1311
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,380
how did they,
where did they pull that off?

1312
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:05,660
Maybe he's richest shit
and she's a fricking,

1313
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,290
maybe he'll get a dick like
Donald Cerrone's arm. So big.

1314
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:15,530
The black belt in Jujitsu. Not, not giant,

1315
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:20,550
not like she's just like a
fucking strong 155 pounders lead.

1316
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:25,550
Exactly. 155 pounder. Who throws
hard with not aggressive attitudes?

1317
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:28,700
Would they be online or just pulls it out?

1318
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,390
She just pulls it out like
it's a fucking fighting a fire.

1319
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,340
It's holds it out by just saying,

1320
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,350
my index finger think she is
fighting a fire. It's hip,

1321
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:44,550
not a big old angry piss hole.
Like a fucking one of those snake fish.

1322
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:50,350
They can crawl out of a lake and
walk for a mile. That's what I look.

1323
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,193
So you can see

1324
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:59,860
with a cock flares out in the
mushroom head, it's got guilt limey.

1325
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:03,680
It's always slimy.
Always just in the middle of the desert.

1326
01:22:03,681 --> 01:22:07,850
He pulls it out as Dick. Alissa
has a runny nose, runny nose,

1327
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,640
Harry Salmonella, like aliens tongue.
Remember when the alien pulls,

1328
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:14,440
timeouts everything drips,
looks like

1329
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:18,141
tomato,

1330
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:23,141
red veins and the length and

1331
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:34,190
if I'm not around, he has been out for
a long time. Brought brought two years.

1332
01:22:34,191 --> 01:22:37,700
Jamie pullout Amir's the dollars record.
He's been out there two years for sure.

1333
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:38,541
Wow.

1334
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:42,710
He was a really good fighter and then he
fought Ludwig and Ludwig kind of picked

1335
01:22:42,711 --> 01:22:46,890
him apart and that was like,
that was a big loss with broke,

1336
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:51,230
broken Ludwig Glue really lit him up
because he was really becoming a very good

1337
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:54,920
striker, very high volume. He
was into that Moy Thai style.

1338
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,280
But there's certain guys,
other guys were they,

1339
01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:00,350
when they begin their career and they
face the guy where they can't do anything

1340
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:03,710
and they never, they never come back
from it. Well it was, it's weird, right?

1341
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,180
Was the style matchup.
He had lost a recipes

1342
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,750
before it came back stronger,
but Duane Ludwig when he's on,

1343
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,790
was one of the most technical,

1344
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:16,870
most proficient in most educated
strikers in MMA ever. Ever, ever.

1345
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,040
He's so educated,

1346
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:22,330
which is why Korea on both sides
of his life in such a good trainer,

1347
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:26,470
the reason why he's such a good trainer
is because he's so educated in tall

1348
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:30,160
tactics. [inaudible] he's been
there. That tells trainers habit.

1349
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,840
When we were working out with him,
man,

1350
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,920
I saw him correcting all
these little things with you.
And all I can think of is,

1351
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:39,310
God damn, if Shab could work
with this guy every day,

1352
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:43,450
if you could work with Dwayne every day,
it would change your game a lot.

1353
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:46,840
You're a sponge and when you're with
that guy and he's showing you stuff and

1354
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:49,210
he's a freak.
I love sponge in a freak.

1355
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:51,790
He's trying to just fill you up and you're
like, come on, show me what you got.

1356
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,810
And you guys were, that was a fun
workout session to watch. Oh so much fun.

1357
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:00,360
But that fight was just a bad fight for
Amir was the wrong style. Dwayne was too,

1358
01:24:00,361 --> 01:24:04,210
God damn good on his feet and Dwayne
came into that fight, healthy, you know,

1359
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,940
there was like that was always Dwayne's
things you is cut too much weight.

1360
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,970
He's never healthy.
Too hard.

1361
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:14,140
He's been fighting for so long and
kickboxing and fucking, you know,

1362
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:17,830
it finally caught up to him when he got
to the UFC and Dwayne's the guy where he

1363
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:18,221
came in.

1364
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:23,221
Now you're talking superstar with his
skillset and his work ethic is just,

1365
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,710
he was a little too late, you
know what I'm saying? Honestly,

1366
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:30,450
coachings worked out for him with
tremendously, I'm just saying, you fell.

1367
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:33,270
You fast forward and start
Dwayne 10 years later.

1368
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,450
He's a superstar when he does his work
ethic. Dwayne is not genetically gifted.

1369
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,120
He's got a a regular athletic body.

1370
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:43,410
It's his intelligence and his
knowledge and his drive demeanor,

1371
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:47,830
demeanor's demeanor. Listen, when we'd
come to the gym and they're sparring,

1372
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:50,800
Dwayne be the first one. The cage means
Shane. We look at each other like,

1373
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:54,210
I ain't going with them. You Go, is
that my ankle? When you go argue,

1374
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:58,160
good to go first with them. He would
walk through everything. Keep going. Wow.

1375
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:02,560
Why kickstand. Yeah. He was a fantastic
strike with heavyweights, with God,

1376
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:06,010
and he talks to us like, you
better not. Don't take me down.

1377
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,560
Don't be a bitch and take me
down. And we, I'd like, okay,

1378
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:09,710
but I'm going to take the hit now.

1379
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:14,370
So I'm sitting there striking with this
to him. What are you thinking about care?

1380
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:19,520
Are you practicing turning sidekicks
or wheel kicks? A not Wilcox yellow.

1381
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:24,060
Can we listen to his music please wait.
Comes up to the Sopranos Music. Brian.

1382
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,210
It's boring.
So you've actually taken it.

1383
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,700
No. Turn inside, man. That would be
a good fucking idea. He's right here.

1384
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:37,730
He's your boy. We did a
little kicking something. I'm
coming to think about hardy.

1385
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:42,880
I'm telling you this. I'm telling
you he's got it. We got some stuff.

1386
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:44,260
I believe you.
We have the,

1387
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,400
I will have the best stirring up the
Malik guys I'm bringing to Mimic Travis

1388
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,490
Browne. I'm telling you, we
got it. You'll be just fine.

1389
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,130
We'll working on dealing with
that front snap kick. He does.

1390
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:00,010
Well, the biggest, fight them
on that too. The Jackson's camp.

1391
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:02,590
They're really the hidden
that Jackson's anymore though,

1392
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,950
but he's still going to train there.

1393
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,420
He's trying to, he's not just, he's
doing the whole camp in Glendale. Okay.

1394
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:08,990
Ron Does camp well. Look, he learned,

1395
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,110
still learned a lot from 100% still
like still going to have that cheat.

1396
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:17,060
Just Christ. How jacked his doctor
Yama looked at one 17 bodied up.

1397
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:18,840
We call her [inaudible].

1398
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,940
He said 1111 when we
got to make a new meter.

1399
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:26,120
He certainly isn't all that GSP liquor.
A little pudgy.

1400
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:30,620
He does and he's got a beautiful, he goes,
nobody does. That's kind of impossible.

1401
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:35,420
No bullshit. He is fucking
unbelievable. Shred old trunk.

1402
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:39,970
Did you see Captain America? He did a
good job. Oh fuck yeah, he did. Yeah.

1403
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,920
He's got a a martial arts killer.

1404
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:46,850
What do you think it would have fucking
greatest welterweight of all time was

1405
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:48,200
also good at playing

1406
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,670
the kids shredded.
Look at Akiyama.

1407
01:26:55,671 --> 01:26:59,560
He's doing very well where you get
what he's saying. He had one 80 feet.

1408
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,930
Practice singing. You have to, your
body has to be in very good shape.

1409
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:06,710
I think he's getting a couple
of fights at one 70 if not,

1410
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,120
this might be his day.

1411
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:14,010
What's usually five one 85 you'll see
the fight with Lieben leaving like you

1412
01:27:14,381 --> 01:27:18,500
didn't see one of the greatest fights
ever as far as entertainment value,

1413
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,460
entertainment,
entertainment for

1414
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,810
those last chip,

1415
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,600
is that what it is?
Judo.

1416
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:34,040
That's a famous singer and
he's a famous Japanese 35.

1417
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:38,160
Do you think he's, do you think
he's uh, the married, I'm not,

1418
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:41,750
I'm going to be faithful. A celebrity
or do you think he just running shit,

1419
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,990
running stuff trains on Japanese women.

1420
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:53,540
They did some weird shit
up shit on each other.

1421
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:56,933
I'm not saying,

1422
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:01,550
I'm not saying he doesn't too far,
man.

1423
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:05,730
You mean when they wrap Saran wrap
and they just, then they breathe out?

1424
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:11,430
Shouty is podcasts all shouting past
2:00 AM 2:00 AM and we're lit up like

1425
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:15,920
Christmas trees? No, I'm only
drinking coffee. I'm drinking.

1426
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:19,610
But when you do wrap your face and
Saran wrap bottom of his lats, the line,

1427
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:23,870
he doesn't have a lower back.
By the way. I got a nice back.

1428
01:28:23,871 --> 01:28:28,280
It's hard for me to give it up. He's got
a beautiful back. It's shoot us the same,

1429
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:31,910
but he looks, he's so, he was
always like a very fit, fit guy.

1430
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:36,200
But at one 70 he looks like a
fucking alien. Wow. He's shredded.

1431
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,800
Look at him boyfriend and I'm going
to start bowing before my fights.

1432
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:42,750
Wait a minute. It says boyfriend
on his banner. I hope so. Yeah,

1433
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,300
that's his girl probably right
there. This is people said, oh,

1434
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,000
Amir suddenly took two years off.
Hey,

1435
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:52,001
we got one flight at the dime piece has
taken some time off to Diane pieces.

1436
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:57,540
Busy making bank saying
singing, painting, Hungry Day.

1437
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:00,050
I agree.
That body keeps you hungry.

1438
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:03,940
Here's a dollar doing for a living these
days. He hasn't fought in two years.

1439
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:08,570
He's been teaching lots of the
year. Come on. Who has better last?

1440
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,510
Pretty bouncy and who has better lat
Amir's movement was always good, man.

1441
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:16,620
It was just Dwayne was just a step
ahead of him in that fight and drain.

1442
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,710
Heard them with like a left
hook, I think. Left Hook. Yeah.

1443
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,480
There's never been known for his power.

1444
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:24,270
I feel like Akiyama is gonna have
some power. Yeah, that is true.

1445
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:27,690
Akiyama to has some ball.
That's a big wakeup. Come on.

1446
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:29,720
Seriously from the beginning.
I've never wore power.

1447
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,970
My just stoned out of my mind. Oh No.

1448
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:38,030
He's very big lats and he has
a chin to Akiyama can take.

1449
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:41,430
So I took him down. Guys. I
want to use this expression,

1450
01:29:41,431 --> 01:29:45,450
but he's a high level judoka but
[inaudible] has some good Jujitsu.

1451
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,260
He won some fights in the UFC and
is a the ultimate fighter dude.

1452
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:52,080
He wants some fights with armies
fighting a high level tough house.

1453
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:57,030
Finding a high level judoka
with beautiful skin.

1454
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,380
I cannot skip it. It's not almost,

1455
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:05,250
you can take almost out of that
statement. He's got cold skin. Fuck, fuck.

1456
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:08,830
Be Ground. How about big
goals? Damn right ma'am.

1457
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:12,080
Goal we call a medium goal.
Oh Man.

1458
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,810
Well there's some Asians that
cross into that like darker relm.

1459
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:21,020
They got a little pops in Asian and then
the wholesaler with the ties can get

1460
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,010
really dark.

1461
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:26,750
He's just straight Japanese and just
and goes to the Korean tanning salon.

1462
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:33,890
Thousand 14 you comes from a different
land. He's a gold card to Brazil.

1463
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,710
My boyfriend right there.

1464
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:40,030
Step back into why would he step back
in and you guys are grappling as one.

1465
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:40,980
He didn't like it,

1466
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:46,470
didn't like something he thought maybe
was going to get us back to the why

1467
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:47,670
didn't he?
Why would he go backwards?

1468
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:51,630
That's the sign of his short
say body unsure passer.

1469
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,570
Some show like to hold this position too,
right?

1470
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:58,350
Randy couture said they're
not comfortable for grounds.

1471
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:04,020
Guys who are heavy top grapplers stay in
half guard. They're comfortable there.

1472
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:09,090
They can do damage and control scapes.
Yeah, that's what Randy was saying,

1473
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:13,330
that his skin is straight.
Let's just all develop it's distractions.

1474
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:16,020
All I can see this gold as well.

1475
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:18,780
That's the only thing that matters in
this fight about the gold shorts to go

1476
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:22,070
with the gold
shorts.

1477
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:24,480
It's like a black on black Mercedes

1478
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:30,420
roll down the street with a high tech
and the boyfriend patch on his shorts.

1479
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:35,610
Aki yamas mirror window soccer.

1480
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:37,940
Robbie used to go into the cage
with a shirt that just said water

1481
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:43,610
and weird fake glass and
the Japanese look so good.

1482
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:47,670
It's just like an ancient symbol
like walking in water like this.

1483
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:51,600
Just the irony full of
written a symmetry to them.

1484
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:56,790
Hi, I regrets. We're goofy Shit Shit.

1485
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,770
Who's have Japanese things tattooed on.
They don't even know what it means.

1486
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,500
Brian got in,
I think it was Chinese.

1487
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:05,980
He thought he was getting Brian Tattooed
on his arm and it says waterfall.

1488
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:09,970
He didn't know he wanted his.
Yeah,

1489
01:32:09,971 --> 01:32:14,170
he wanted his name tattooed on his arm
and the dude fucked it up. Waterfall.

1490
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,340
Probably an American dude.
Oh,

1491
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:19,660
big elbow by Akiyama doctor
Yama looks heavy on top.

1492
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,090
Both such good grappler.

1493
01:32:22,091 --> 01:32:26,050
You know that those judo
guys are so God damn strong.

1494
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:31,210
Gonzaga similar.
This Gonzaga is another one.

1495
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,790
Like Shane car went in a lot of ways,
has knockout power.

1496
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:38,010
When he gets onto the scale like and he
walks onto the stage where the scale is,

1497
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:42,580
it's a different thing. It's like a stone
man is walking on. It's fine, he's fine.

1498
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,010
And I know you know what's up,
Darling.

1499
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,600
Just turn that standard crouch against
him. You know, you guys back up.

1500
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:52,630
Look at this.
A real legit judoka

1501
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:58,450
backing notes. Dan Kick,
no extension, no extension.

1502
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:03,280
He hit it and then he pulled out of it.
[inaudible] American Jim it right. Well,

1503
01:33:03,281 --> 01:33:07,030
it's not that. No. These guys,
they don't have the extension.

1504
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:10,560
It's an they're doing the technique
in a way that works. Who closed.

1505
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:13,660
It's not the most, no. Even
when it's in close man,

1506
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:17,740
still extent you could extend it.
Whenever you throw that kick.

1507
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,920
It's never bouncing off ever.
You never bounce off.

1508
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:23,490
You can always extend and landing always.

1509
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:27,520
It's just a matter of they're doing it
wrong. It's a, it's a complex technique.

1510
01:33:27,521 --> 01:33:30,910
There's a lot of steps to the spinning
back kick or turning sidekick with her.

1511
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:34,060
They're two totally different kicks
really. But everybody started,

1512
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:36,700
we always called it the turning
side kicking the taekwondo schools.

1513
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:41,140
But when I started doing kickboxing they
would say show them that spinning back

1514
01:33:41,141 --> 01:33:41,351
kick.

1515
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,570
So I would start calling it depending
back here cause I figured that was the

1516
01:33:43,571 --> 01:33:47,740
karate guys. That's what they called it.
But it's, it's, it's, it's a sidekick.

1517
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,080
It's the knee comes up high
and this is an extension.

1518
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:52,780
That's how Akiyama through it
does the back kick version.

1519
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:56,020
How chuck used to throw it
with the toes down, heel up.

1520
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,350
And that's a powerful kick too. It's like
a donkey kick. It's a little different.

1521
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:03,040
But you can fuck a guy up at that too.
It's all a matter of reps.

1522
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:05,980
And most importantly when you do the reps,

1523
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:10,150
you have to extend and a lot of guys
don't extend. They bounce off of it. Your,

1524
01:34:10,151 --> 01:34:15,130
your shorts kicks all on, or all
of them, all the ones he throws,

1525
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,730
if they would,
if they land perfectly,

1526
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,550
very hard to survive one full like
thank God I have a video, right?

1527
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,010
Hitting somebody with one video from
that taekwondo till you finally have

1528
01:34:27,011 --> 01:34:31,930
something as a defense.
Nice one. It landed, it was
good. He just didn't extend.

1529
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:35,380
See how he bounced off when,
when it should have been the opposite.

1530
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:38,860
He should have it through the right leg
should have been forward at the end of

1531
01:34:38,861 --> 01:34:39,190
it.

1532
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:42,190
It should have been so much force going
forward that his right leg was forward.

1533
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,210
There's no,

1534
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:46,900
it should have been an a no denial
thing and if you throw a front kick,

1535
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:50,290
front kick is perfect example because
it's a pretty easy technique to master.

1536
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:52,810
You'd pick the knee up.
It's very normal mechanics,

1537
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:56,770
but when you throw a front kick, you
almost always go forward with the kick.

1538
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,410
You very rarely throw front kick and
then pull it all the way back behind you.

1539
01:35:00,411 --> 01:35:01,370
Right.
That's not,

1540
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,910
it's not a natural movement cause to do
the front kick and put weight into it,

1541
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:06,610
you're going to naturally
step forward will the,

1542
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:09,530
you should do the same thing with the
turning sidekick. It's just people.

1543
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,810
They just haven't been
taught. Right. It's all it is.

1544
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:15,060
There's the one thing that drives
me nuts. Nice high kick by said, aw,

1545
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,650
there's a one thing that drives me
nuts at all martial arts techniques.

1546
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,590
It is that one technique that spinning
back kick or the turning side,

1547
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:25,100
so one that drives me nuts because I
know the potential of it and then I've

1548
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:28,070
shown it to people and they'll go,
I didn't even know this. I'm like,

1549
01:35:28,071 --> 01:35:30,560
I know you didn't know. There was
a lot of people that don't know it.

1550
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,070
It's just a matter of doing the
technique correctly. Like Dennis Seaver,

1551
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:37,310
he does it correctly. Fuck
Gaydos. When that guy throws it,

1552
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:41,300
that motherfucker extends and you never
know what's coming because he'll throw

1553
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:43,190
that shit only like once
or twice in a fight.

1554
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:47,630
Him have similar builds for that kick
though the toy. He's so good at it. No,

1555
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:50,820
because my friend Larry Jones had a
better turning side than me. How bad.

1556
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,260
It was like six foot three, six foot
four somewhere around then and he was,

1557
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,350
he fought it. Heavyweight in
taekwondo tournament's Larry.

1558
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,850
I was always short but Larry was always,
he had these ridiculous legs.

1559
01:36:01,851 --> 01:36:06,230
They would go up to his tits and he
would throw this front leg side kick like

1560
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:07,250
you couldn't fuck with it.

1561
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:10,470
It was the reason I developed my front
leg side because the way I developed,

1562
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,550
cause my friend Larry,
his is way superior to mine.

1563
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:18,560
There was like three guys that had these
vicious front lake sidekicks and Conor

1564
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,070
Mcgregor almost, right? No, no way
better. Way better than, he's pretty good.

1565
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:25,240
He's good with it.
But have you seen guys who've been doing,

1566
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:27,140
telling you there was just one
of the guys that can break?

1567
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:28,670
They break your insides man,

1568
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,390
because they use it as they use
it as defense as you come in,

1569
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:36,140
they'll time at and and use your body
as you move in. Dealt, dealt back.

1570
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:39,680
You have all the other stuff.
They're just missing all the other stuff.

1571
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:44,330
Akiyama keeps getting hit with this head
kick, man. This left high kick. Yeah,

1572
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:47,840
but Amir's just like just grazing them
with, I know you're not committed to it.

1573
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,540
My friend Leroy Rodriguez was,

1574
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:55,630
he had kicks front leg kicks that we're
so fucking fast when people would spar

1575
01:36:55,881 --> 01:36:58,760
him, like when he was in his
prime, he was like one of uh,

1576
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:03,440
Jay Kim's top black belts,
right. He tagged and ice,

1577
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:07,490
right. Akiyama has got a vicious
right hand man heavy. Oh, this dude,

1578
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:10,370
him and Larry Jones, this other
dude, his name was major battle.

1579
01:37:10,371 --> 01:37:13,610
That was his real name.
Larry Leroy. Major black.

1580
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:17,620
Don't fuck with Larry Lee Baker battle.
Meanwhile,

1581
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,250
three of the nicest guys
you'd ever want to meet.

1582
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,880
And Leroy is still a good
friend to this day. But if you,

1583
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:24,020
you saw those guys throw front leg kicks,

1584
01:37:24,021 --> 01:37:28,430
it would change your whole idea of what's
possible with those things. Oh, oh,

1585
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:31,790
he's her. Oh No, I'm here's in trouble.
Oh Amir. Still throwing that kick.

1586
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,740
He got tagged again.
Tough man.

1587
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:38,000
He's just Amir's pretty good at keeping
guys off to them when he's getting

1588
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:38,960
tagged about this.

1589
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,430
He's got to get some distance
here to the ground and pound man.

1590
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,140
But look at mears.
Got The heat on the hips,

1591
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:49,880
but those judo guys are always
so good standing up there.

1592
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:53,000
He's got him dead to rights
here. Look at this. Oh,

1593
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:57,450
this new miracle throwing up
some not gonna work. Oh Man.

1594
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:02,280
Yeah. I said, oh you guys
put words on your shorts.

1595
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:04,910
Fuck that took this picture
of a watch out. Huh?

1596
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,740
I've gold skin bitches.

1597
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:12,630
I got gold skin picture isn't one check
on my Dick. It's right between your legs.

1598
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,700
Herat to the sun. God, I'm a Ratu
has chosen me to be his messenger.

1599
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:22,890
Boom. My point when I moved out to when
I was talking about these cakes shop,

1600
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:26,070
you got long ass fucking legs.
You could throw some vicious kicks.

1601
01:38:26,071 --> 01:38:30,060
If you ever met my friend Larry who was
about your size and you saw with that

1602
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:31,050
guy can do with his front leg.

1603
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:35,470
He would fold bags in half with his
front leg side kick. Just shooting.

1604
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:38,250
Just shooting. Chris Extend, you know,

1605
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:42,690
he's big black guy and just long
fucking legs and just extend.

1606
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:46,800
Oh,
folding back on foot sidekick.

1607
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:51,780
He would kick box guys and do to it
never faced together at a front leg like

1608
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:53,570
that. They had no idea what
to do with them. Right.

1609
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:56,700
They couldn't figure out how to get in
on them really hard and maybe the problem

1610
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:59,640
with it though is what it was all being
developed when there was no leg kicks.

1611
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,500
So I think I a good Thai guy,

1612
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:04,850
we just started attacking his legs and
it would limit a lot of the techniques

1613
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:05,713
you could pull off.

1614
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:09,750
But those guys were all above the waist
kickboxers and he was fucking them up.

1615
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:13,230
And all that tells me is that that's
a technique that's not being utilized.

1616
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:17,640
Well good up kicks by Amir Talos
use pancakes though. They do.

1617
01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:21,210
Some of those guys do, especially the
guys, the more Thai guys from Holland,

1618
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,340
you don't make shit up.

1619
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:25,410
Badr Hari that motherfucker throws
wheel kicks and I thought, hey,

1620
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:29,310
you're going to raise a fighter
from the time he's five and on,

1621
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,310
it's almost better to get
him into taekwondo early,

1622
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:36,130
selling him to get them used to the
aerials at all the fancy crazy questions.

1623
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:40,790
And then at 12 get them into Muay Thai.
So He'd be different distance.

1624
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:45,900
He'll still throw the and distances and
it's a two different techniques like,

1625
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:49,530
yeah, but it's not so, so if you had a
five year old and you had to train them,

1626
01:39:49,531 --> 01:39:53,890
what do you start them with? Taekwondo.
Yeah, because he's not a mastic.

1627
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,440
It's also you're going to,

1628
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:58,620
you're going to develop the dexterity
for those weird moves that are super

1629
01:39:58,621 --> 01:40:00,870
dangerous when you get really good
at them, right? Like you know,

1630
01:40:00,871 --> 01:40:04,350
any always equates, oh look, it's the
dog gets out from the back door almost.

1631
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:08,280
Is he out? I might get into Jujitsu that
five. Well, Eddie always equates it.

1632
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,080
That's not a bad call either.

1633
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,980
But Eddie always equate it to like
rubber guard techniques because like if

1634
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:14,400
someone,

1635
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,190
if you teach someone rubber guard
techniques and it's the first time they've

1636
01:40:17,191 --> 01:40:20,010
tried it, like, oh, this shit isn't
going to work. I'm not flexible enough.

1637
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,470
Well that's the same thing.
If you show someone a wheel kick,

1638
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:24,030
can you tell me the wheel
kicks never going to work.

1639
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:28,650
Hold the pad for a guy like Barboza hold
the pad and let him, we'll kick you.

1640
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:32,800
Right. And you hit that pat and you
go, Oh shit, I need to know this. Yep.

1641
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:38,350
Forces is a Pi's opponent to really focus
on that and take time away from other,

1642
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,050
you gotta be terrified of that wheel kick.

1643
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:44,550
You got to be terrified of all of his
catch part of the training camp to stay

1644
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:47,490
away from that move away
from those fucking crazy kid
every day they're going to

1645
01:40:47,491 --> 01:40:51,470
be dealing with it. Yeah.
Stop Two fucking guys in the,

1646
01:40:51,471 --> 01:40:54,010
in the UFC with leg kicks.
I mean his kicks are brutal.

1647
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:58,540
First John Jones is doing Jon Jones.
I would suggest,

1648
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:00,440
and I don't know shit cause
I've never fun. I mean,

1649
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:04,090
but I would guess I would hypothesize to,

1650
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:08,500
if you want to be a striker or you want
to be a fighter rather, and the UFC,

1651
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:11,910
if you're interested in
fighting in the UFC and, and,

1652
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:16,980
and challenging for the belt one day
do a Jon Jones is doing as far as uh,

1653
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,760
everything on your feet, including
the wrestling it and the striking,

1654
01:41:21,761 --> 01:41:25,940
especially he's stolen everything.
Jon Jones is throwing every,

1655
01:41:25,941 --> 01:41:28,270
the spinning back,
spinning back,

1656
01:41:28,271 --> 01:41:31,060
elbows turn inside kicks
come food kicks in.

1657
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:34,630
There's not a kick that he hasn't thrown,
gave me that.

1658
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:38,800
Maybe the jumps spinning
inside crescent kick.

1659
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:43,330
We really haven't seen that one. Only in
Jackie Chan movies. That's the last kick.

1660
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,310
That's the last of the
kicks. Well, you know,

1661
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,190
there's a car spinning crest and kicked.
That's really effective.

1662
01:41:48,191 --> 01:41:50,340
Do you know what I'm talking about
when you're coming in with this side?

1663
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,660
We haven't seen that one. It doesn't, it
doesn't work too much for me. At least.

1664
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:56,770
Didn't work too much this way.

1665
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:59,500
Like the inside crest kick
I gave up on a long time.

1666
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,430
But if you heard a guy
standing and he's kind of,

1667
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:03,040
and then you finish
with that motherfucker.

1668
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,420
Have you ever just because of the angle,

1669
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:08,290
have you ever seen me do a
spinning crescent kick? I
never showed you that. Yeah,

1670
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:10,840
you showed me everything. I'm
sure. No, I bet I haven't.

1671
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,020
It's like you hit like this with
the outside of the foot like that.

1672
01:42:14,021 --> 01:42:17,740
You Spit Sima knock out with that either.
We haven't seen an asset with that.

1673
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:21,700
It's a close range kick. It's a weird
kick. You do it from a different range.

1674
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,840
I never did it,

1675
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:26,560
but my friend Ed shorter was really
good at my friend Ed shorter knocked out

1676
01:42:26,561 --> 01:42:29,710
guys with that.
He had a wicked spinning crescent kick.

1677
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:32,140
He would throw that and more than
he would throw the wheel kick.

1678
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:36,670
But it was an awkward, I think Jon Jones
throws everything except those I don't,

1679
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:41,680
I think we still have those are the last
new kick I think was to make a a big

1680
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:46,660
impact in all of them in
May and how everyone trains
is that front snap kick and

1681
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,970
the rear snap kick right to the jar,
right to the chest.

1682
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,970
Travis bound be thrown them.
I know you've been studying that shit.

1683
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:56,500
And also Josh Thomson throws him a
la a lot so Rony throws him a lot.

1684
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,870
And of course cocoon.
No is known for that Shit.

1685
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:03,190
Just so now that is the hottest
kick right mass. The newest,

1686
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:08,080
hottest kicked that people are actually
spending time trying to master it.

1687
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:13,170
When before there was no special time
spent for that front snap kick butt.

1688
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:17,260
Now what's real and oh we haven't
talked about that on video.

1689
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:21,720
That's the craziest thing we talked
about a years ago. Like they asked you,

1690
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:25,210
I asked you in your gym. I
said, why have we haven't?

1691
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:29,270
We seen the front snap kick to the
fucking jaw and then you add you,

1692
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,440
you said some great shit about it
and then boom. That's when Anderson,

1693
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:37,480
that was the first one in the Machida
on unknown Radica tour and then now

1694
01:43:37,481 --> 01:43:41,590
everyone's fucking throwing them and
then you board Travis Browne on Alistair

1695
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:45,650
Overeem. Yeah. You know what? I think
the next one is the ax kick acts.

1696
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:49,660
Hicks are very effective. We don't
really see him. Totally home throws him.

1697
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:52,340
There was this guy, this
Canadian guy, his name was jersey

1698
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:56,210
long and that was one of the reasons why
I realized how effective and powerful

1699
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:57,044
acts kicks where.

1700
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:00,200
There's this Guy John Lee who had a
really good ass kick who was a national

1701
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:01,034
taekwondo champion.

1702
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,770
I have only seen it a number of men
because we haven't seen a guy who's really

1703
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:04,604
good at it.

1704
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,990
There's a guy named Jersey long that
was from Canada and he had a fucking axe

1705
01:44:08,991 --> 01:44:11,660
kick that was like a rifle shot.
It would just,

1706
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:16,580
it would be up in on your job before you
knew it was happening. He just had this,

1707
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:22,130
he would be concern and he would just
step in full split and slam you on the

1708
01:44:22,131 --> 01:44:25,100
head with that heel in Jesus.
He knocked my friend Larry Jones,

1709
01:44:25,101 --> 01:44:29,390
I'll cold or maybe in the beginning Larry
my friend that I was telling you how

1710
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:34,040
good he is. That's the guy got knocked
out cold by Law by this Guy Jersey Long.

1711
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:38,090
You know we seen any in k one a
few times but no. Well Andy Hook,

1712
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:39,013
Sandy Hook and I,

1713
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:42,290
Andy Hook had also had a technique we
haven't seen the spinning wheel kick to

1714
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:46,660
the leg hug was the master at that. He
would never take that heel into the leg.

1715
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:51,200
It was a straight movie Kung Fu kick
where he would get down, squat down,

1716
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:56,201
do like a spinning at break dancing moves
and do a wheel kick to the guys thigh.

1717
01:44:56,810 --> 01:45:00,950
A low we'll kick. It's like doing a
wheel kick butt almost on your ass.

1718
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:02,820
So dollar trying to set something up.
What?

1719
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:05,900
What was the greatest crazy
movie technique of all time?

1720
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:10,420
I say it was real CHONe and submitted
Anderson Silva with that fucking flying

1721
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:11,480
trying or the Friday,

1722
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:17,780
I think that was like the greatest all
time movie technique in an MMA fights

1723
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,780
happened in uh, in grappling. Yeah.

1724
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,650
But in like fighting Anderson Silva and
an MMA fight. True. And your real CHONe an

1725
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:31,460
underdog. The guy at shoot the
box, he caught him in good time.

1726
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,260
Anderson wasn't it shoot the box
anymore? You know, they had like a,

1727
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:39,530
he was at Anderson Anderson at the
time though. No, he wasn't quiet.

1728
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:44,740
He wasn't quite the match before me and
Hoya went the first time in 2003 he went

1729
01:45:44,991 --> 01:45:48,470
against a guy named Charles Pierce and
the match right before me and that guy

1730
01:45:48,471 --> 01:45:49,670
did his fucking flat,

1731
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:54,170
the exact same heel hook that reader
CHONe entrain Anderson and almost had him,

1732
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:57,350
he almost tapped out. Hoya, Gracie.
A lot of people don't know that.

1733
01:45:57,380 --> 01:46:01,170
Heuler escaped by the skin of his teeth
and then got us back and then choked

1734
01:46:01,171 --> 01:46:06,000
them. Oh my God. Since the fight. Since
you're talking all the time. Okay. Yeah.

1735
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,650
We hang out party and shit.
Just checking

1736
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:14,270
the guard. Oh, you weren't
here for the guard talk.

1737
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:18,600
Eddie Bravo has the weirdest
sense of humor. Man sneaks things.

1738
01:46:18,601 --> 01:46:20,750
Talk About Eddie Bravo.
No bullshit.

1739
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:24,090
If he wasn't such a great Jujitsu
fighter and he wasn't so into music,

1740
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:27,110
great troll, he would be a
great fucking comedian. He just,

1741
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:30,230
he just didn't have the time to get into
it. I talked to him and going on stage.

1742
01:46:30,231 --> 01:46:31,700
You went downstairs like
eight or nine times.

1743
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:36,180
Really Dick a few times whatever workout.

1744
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:41,660
Oh, he stopped. I had this two week.
He my one. He dominated though.

1745
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:46,280
Robbie get on top. Did they just
send the fight and the fight?

1746
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:48,880
I've been watching it though.
I've been watching a little worse.

1747
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:49,983
Missing the vital.

1748
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,500
Imagine if the fucking I like
the UFC said, listen man,

1749
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,480
we've been thinking about your commentary.

1750
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:58,260
We heard you've been doing this fight
pass thing. You're fucking terrible

1751
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:03,420
fights. Brian's stands
doing these all from now on.

1752
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:07,080
Oh see that was good movement
by Akiyama very relaxed.

1753
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:09,330
Even though the head kick was
coming just slid out of the way.

1754
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:14,040
Nice right hand just dominated this.
He's such a stud athlete,

1755
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:17,430
but see that like that's like
some blue belt shit. Yeah,

1756
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:20,610
but that's also on a moving
target. You know, he's also,

1757
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:24,000
he's tossed it and he's fine. Yeah,
he's fighting an MMA fight. It just,

1758
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:28,530
that's the one technique that I
think this that I'm telling you man,

1759
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:32,670
there's gonna be some Francis Karmapa
dude who knows how to throw a fucking,

1760
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:36,030
actually they cut friends
believe it one by one.

1761
01:47:36,031 --> 01:47:41,031
All the every a Kung Fu kick that
was once laughed at the one by one.

1762
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:47,020
They're all coming back. I'm telling
you, that guy's Levy. Some Kung Fu.

1763
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:51,980
It's all coming back. I won a type
one term taekwondo tournament with

1764
01:47:56,370 --> 01:48:00,660
all those comfort food kits
branded shop.

1765
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:04,320
Could you imagine if you fucking axe
kicked Travis Brown and the head,

1766
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:08,790
do you imagine how nutty the world would
go if you had the first ax kick Kao in

1767
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:09,241
the UFC?

1768
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:14,241
You step in and six six can catch
him crazy with this fee for Brennan.

1769
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,320
Shop fucking goes nuts.

1770
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:21,830
You decide for six months to just really
dive into kicks and you want to in six

1771
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:22,321
months,

1772
01:48:22,321 --> 01:48:26,880
you want to transform yourself into this
fucking vicious kicker when that'd be

1773
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:27,714
crazy.

1774
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:33,020
She could do it from your response
time for that shit real trainer.

1775
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,720
You found the right
trainer who can teach you,

1776
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:41,500
teach you that style of kicking dude,
you'd be, you'd be fucking guys up it up.

1777
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:43,470
How are you having your legs?
I've seen you.

1778
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,260
I've seen you lift weights
or senior do dead lifts,

1779
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,600
all these things you're doing,
what are you building?

1780
01:48:48,601 --> 01:48:51,330
You're building up your core, your,
your, your, your whole column,

1781
01:48:51,331 --> 01:48:54,900
but you're also building up
your SAP bottoms. Ridiculous.

1782
01:48:55,030 --> 01:49:00,030
And then our Paul Barman is launching
bones and your opponent just launching,

1783
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:04,920
but bones
launching shin bones.

1784
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:08,160
Like if there's one bone you wouldn't
want to get hit in the fucking face with.

1785
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:12,060
It's the shinbone number one
terrible blade of a bone.

1786
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,700
That's the one bonus shaped like a weapon.

1787
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:16,710
All of these other ones
are covered up with meat.

1788
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:20,720
Even an elbow like you got to catch a
motherfucker on the point of an elbow to

1789
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:23,610
otherwise you're hitting him with a
forearm smash and there's a lot of meat

1790
01:49:23,611 --> 01:49:27,420
involved in the forum smashed when
you shinned someone to the dome.

1791
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:31,710
That's up fucking, that's
a weird edged bone, man.

1792
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:35,760
This is a weird feeling to
that fucking comes at you.

1793
01:49:35,761 --> 01:49:40,200
Six miles an hour on your head.
WOMP womp womp.

1794
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:45,560
Spain from such an intense grumpy fuck.
Who really knows how to kick hard,

1795
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:51,860
dude, man. Oh,

1796
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,380
some scary fucker.

1797
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:57,440
Just throwing these laser
beam through your head.

1798
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:00,940
I'm telling you,
anybody who doubts me,

1799
01:50:00,941 --> 01:50:03,820
you just needed to see Pedro
his own in his prime. Brian,

1800
01:50:03,821 --> 01:50:07,730
where'd you get those golden
pickles from there? They're good,

1801
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:09,040
right?

1802
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:16,810
Many, many jars in there. Grillo's
pickles are very generous.

1803
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:20,620
He sent me a giant fucking case of them.
They're the best pickles of all. Tada.

1804
01:50:20,621 --> 01:50:24,250
So real quick is the latest I've
stayed up in Oh, about 10 years, dude,

1805
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:26,180
you're going to be since
college. Oh yeah, I'll be fine.

1806
01:50:26,181 --> 01:50:28,450
It's only two o'clock in the morning.
I know she got training tomorrow.

1807
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:32,260
We're in California. God did double
today to make up. If you were in Hawaii,

1808
01:50:32,261 --> 01:50:36,950
we'd only be 11:00 PM that's how
you got to look at Shit, man.

1809
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:41,530
We should all be in Hawaii right
through that door. There's a curtain.

1810
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:44,770
Pull that back and go to the, there
you go. We should all be in Hawaii.

1811
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:45,730
Let's be realistic.

1812
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:50,080
If we could all make a choice to bail and
go to one place and bring our families.

1813
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:53,070
Everybody exists. It probably be like
the big island. I'd be wanting to.

1814
01:50:53,090 --> 01:50:56,320
I want to be Bj Penn's neighbor. I
love it. Just all hang out together.

1815
01:50:56,321 --> 01:51:00,400
Maybe we do during the
day just hanging out. No,

1816
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:05,140
can't do that shit. Said wives.
We're married. We're kidding.

1817
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:10,780
What I think we would do is have a good
time by the water. Be With our families.

1818
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:14,850
Did you guys collide
by the way he that

1819
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:18,040
rumor a Brennan.

1820
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:23,250
There's a rumor that when he does
the title Udo fucking Hawaii.

1821
01:51:23,951 --> 01:51:26,180
That's what I'm saying.
Know we had due to some, ah,

1822
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:31,180
we won't do that.
What are you saying?

1823
01:51:33,190 --> 01:51:35,680
You guys can put mask on and watch me how

1824
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:40,650
I was there a few months
ago. Shit. Oh Miles Jones.

1825
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,450
Oh Shit.
This uh,

1826
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:46,990
this dude was telling me that he got to
go there like in March or April to the

1827
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,000
big island.
He said that's when the whales,

1828
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:51,550
they're either breeding or giving birth.
I don't remember which,

1829
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,080
but he said they're everywhere.

1830
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:55,880
You said it's almost dangerous
to be out in your boat. Wow.

1831
01:51:55,970 --> 01:51:59,560
Cause you were out in the boat and the
whales will breach like 20 yards from you.

1832
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:03,910
Blues guy was killed. My shell both that
way. Killed on a sale book. I was a pussy.

1833
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:09,720
I would have saw the way, I wouldn't
have panicked when a dove in the water,

1834
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,960
the shore
holding,

1835
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:17,260
nobody yelled help because their ears
are really good and they would have come

1836
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:19,470
by. Here's the trivia question.
We've already asked them.

1837
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,760
How much has a blue whales heart way?
Same as my dad.

1838
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:28,510
He put my Dick next to a
blue whales close on a scale.

1839
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:31,930
It would balance out blue owls.
Heart weighs 1500 pounds.

1840
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:34,270
That's about what my Dick was close.

1841
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:40,030
That's about all my dick is made out of
dark matter. Call me fought Nick Diaz,

1842
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:44,020
right? Yeah. Yeah. You fought Nate,

1843
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:46,130
Nate and nick.
Both of them lit him up.

1844
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,620
Nate, Nate, Nate lit him up with strikes.

1845
01:52:48,621 --> 01:52:52,540
Then I believe Carmen and arm bar and
a nick caught him with a Google. Duh.

1846
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:58,400
How big of a star was go me back in the
nic test. It's so high for marijuana.

1847
01:52:58,410 --> 01:53:02,900
They believe he might've been high
while he was fighting. Oh No. Oh yes.

1848
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:06,260
He Won. You know, people
were arguing like, oh,

1849
01:53:06,261 --> 01:53:11,261
you know that the pain that he got
when he got hit with those shots,

1850
01:53:11,331 --> 01:53:13,040
he didn't feel it because
he was high on marijuana.

1851
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:16,040
That's the one thing that
you have to argue like, well,

1852
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:20,270
marijuana is prescribed for
pain. I mean, it is true,

1853
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:24,410
right? I mean, I would imagine it
would help you or does it absorb pain?

1854
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,410
You guys still the manage
knows the Mary Jane,

1855
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:33,110
but I was borrowing when
I was doing kickboxing. I
wasn't smoking weed back then.

1856
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:36,360
I didn't, I didn't. I've never felt was
true. Everybody. It'd be high fight,

1857
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,930
but they can't. They get
tested, everybody gets tested.

1858
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:43,700
That doesn't make any sense but getting
punched in the face hard with a right.

1859
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:47,060
I don't think he's going to help you
with that. It helps if you nick Diaz.

1860
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:50,890
I Bet Nick Diaz gets in there lit up.
I bet he doesn't give a fuck.

1861
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,100
Fuck anyway,

1862
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:58,160
they wouldn't be fighting but on the off
Nick Diaz Eat your jab sober or high.

1863
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,680
A lot of guys don't like to
train technique high though.

1864
01:54:00,681 --> 01:54:01,550
It's kind of interesting.

1865
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:05,690
They say they don't learn things is good
high like when someone's trying to show

1866
01:54:05,691 --> 01:54:07,730
you like a stutter step and an attack.

1867
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:11,750
Like sometimes I get a little bit twisted
up but when they can just flow with

1868
01:54:11,751 --> 01:54:13,670
what they know once it's in the DNA,

1869
01:54:13,671 --> 01:54:18,671
that's where the weed comes in because
when you're high muscle memory work on

1870
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,920
instincts way you flow,

1871
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:26,490
but when you're not high it's there's,

1872
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:30,380
there's glitches here and there because
you have so too much shit on your mind.

1873
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:34,310
You're thinking about some bits. When
I smoked some weed and drank some wine.

1874
01:54:34,311 --> 01:54:37,130
I actually say 10 years ago
I came up with some bits.

1875
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:39,200
Are you saying that as
if it's a new thing?

1876
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:44,930
That's how you do comedy and you go on
stage. Do you come up with new shit?

1877
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,230
You're ridiculous. That's
hilarious. Hey Bro,

1878
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,920
I was just saying, because I'm
about to, I'm not this Sunday.

1879
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:55,100
What happened this Sunday? I'm doing
my one hour. Come on down. When he's,

1880
01:54:55,101 --> 01:54:57,830
when he survived him for, he said
he was high bacon, new stuff.

1881
01:54:57,831 --> 01:55:00,650
I said was that 10 years ago? Are you
saying no? Right? Being mean to you

1882
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:05,000
like somebody to stand up,

1883
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:08,160
stand up about 60 times.
Yeah.

1884
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:12,790
I'm saying if I come down to Irvine
on Sunday and I see old Gato, he shot,

1885
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:17,960
got to do. First of all, don't kill my
friends confidence. It's about to go.

1886
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:22,940
I can't kill my second. Don't bring up.
Don't bring up the nature of his bits,

1887
01:55:22,941 --> 01:55:25,790
which we'll fucking ruined them for the
thousands of people that listen to this

1888
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:30,380
podcast, so let's not just
that either. You're working,

1889
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:33,870
working thematically. So my one
hour you'll see completed new stuff.

1890
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:38,270
Told him to be there then
you'd be there.

1891
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:40,280
Just makes my dick hard.

1892
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:45,370
I feel conflict between you two guys does
this because of the [inaudible] invite

1893
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:49,770
me to dinner tonight. What?
Didn't you have a sense that bro,

1894
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,930
you told me how to set man.
You live in Phoenix and 11 bro.

1895
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:58,230
I don't get calls anymore. You guys
still friends? I'm in camp though. Yeah,

1896
01:55:58,231 --> 01:56:02,100
but my fields. Oh, now he's in camp. He
isn't camp though. You can't get needy.

1897
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,200
These are the guys I know. It's
weird. When he gets in camp,

1898
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:08,590
we asked to be the end of it.
I know. He knows I'm, I'm,
I'm really not in camp. Yep,

1899
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:12,760
we can. You do though. You, they
tell you, you got to find anyone the,

1900
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:16,200
and a hard time for chewing on Mike
and Allen wants too. And I'm like,

1901
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,300
Oh yeah. It was like a fucking job
was giving him the hardest time,

1902
01:56:22,301 --> 01:56:27,210
but he was chewing right into that
fucking my like 35 years old. Yes, he is.

1903
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:31,090
I deep throated these hot ass
pickles are delicious. They are.

1904
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:36,000
I'm not into that. You want to
pickle those tastes like cock.

1905
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:39,990
We're out. Almost tastes like Cutco.
Yeah, we're out. These are writing.

1906
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,890
I'm not a fan of these. These are the
sea salt. Pop pop's, those pickles,

1907
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:49,500
heaven. Those pickles are the
best ever. I don't they good cone.

1908
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:52,440
You know what though?
When you chew on a pickle though,

1909
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,030
the mix is going to pick it up.

1910
01:56:54,030 --> 01:56:58,320
They're so fucking crunchy and fresh
like you should go in the other room.

1911
01:56:58,321 --> 01:57:02,310
I can be. I can hear that shit. I wish
we had some of them. Sriracha cashews.

1912
01:57:02,370 --> 01:57:06,410
God dammit right now. I
could go for it. Ron Pickles,

1913
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:11,430
those kinds of warrior bar here. I'm
that getting rid of shit. No Man.

1914
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:15,810
All we have
pickles and Stevia.

1915
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:20,420
I mean door to a pizza. I
wouldn't, I wouldn't yell at you.

1916
01:57:20,421 --> 01:57:22,740
I don't think the pizzas are going to
deliver at two o'clock in the morning,

1917
01:57:22,741 --> 01:57:26,100
brother, where we live in in New
York City. We're in the valley.

1918
01:57:26,101 --> 01:57:29,270
Sun Shit's shuts down.
I live in Venice son.

1919
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:34,140
There's two in the morning or your
studio is kind of scary looking.

1920
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:37,530
Of course it is charged. Scared is
a werewolf in there. Open the door.

1921
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:43,090
You imagine you deliver a fucking pizza.
You opened the door. See that thing? Yup.

1922
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:49,040
I'm yawning. Yachting. He's working over
everyone. Snacks in this bitch. Well,

1923
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:52,500
I got a new nature box coming this week,
naturebox.

1924
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,200
Do you guys worry the bars tastes like
a sweet or what? No, no, no, no. Well,

1925
01:57:58,201 --> 01:58:01,590
it's cranberry and buffalo dude.
It's super healthy for you.

1926
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:04,320
140 tastes like it tastes good.

1927
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:07,980
It tastes like a beef jerky type bar.
But if church

1928
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:13,130
more fresh, there's,
there's no artificial. Um,

1929
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:16,710
it's like there's no
artificial preservatives.

1930
01:58:16,711 --> 01:58:20,310
There's no artificial sweeteners.
No, no, no. There's nothing.

1931
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:23,760
There's nothing artificial in
it. And it's brand new. Right.

1932
01:58:24,270 --> 01:58:25,370
We've had it for a couple months.

1933
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,800
They would look and tell you exactly
what's in it, but there's no cranberries.

1934
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:32,940
The bill, they sent me 10 of them in
a box. I hate him in two days. Yeah.

1935
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,950
I felt sick. I felt sick. Eight
10, 14, 14 grams of protein,

1936
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:41,650
140 calories. Jamie, go grab another
bottle of them. Brent get one man.

1937
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:43,910
They're um,
they're really,

1938
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:47,950
or bars or something really good
for you to only two grams of fat,

1939
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:52,270
140 calories, 14 grams protein.
Just super healthy. And they,

1940
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,070
that's how they used to preserve them.
I guess.

1941
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:56,050
They used to use cranberries and sea salt

1942
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:59,800
when they used to have to get sea salt.
Man,

1943
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:04,690
these to have to take salt water from the
ocean and Cecil and actual fucking sea

1944
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:09,610
salt. That's what do they do now? But
they still call it sea salt, right?

1945
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:12,490
I mean some of it is sea salt.
Some of it is I. Dot. I mean,

1946
01:59:12,491 --> 01:59:14,080
some of it is made in the lab,
I guess.

1947
01:59:14,081 --> 01:59:18,340
I don't know how the fuck they make
salt as a stone. I know the Himalayan,

1948
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:23,080
oh, miles. Jury, he's fucked. He's,

1949
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:24,790
Oh, it's all, it's all, it's over.

1950
01:59:24,850 --> 01:59:28,360
Damn miles jury with a big
good man with a big win.

1951
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:33,340
It hasn't lost yet. The kid keeps getting
better too. He's putting in the work,

1952
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:38,290
man. He's putting the work. He drinks
down there. Had a alliance and San Diego,

1953
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:42,610
Huh? Yeah. That's a big Kale. He has
a Jiu Jitsu gym too and San Diego.

1954
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:48,330
Mild jury does phone shit.
No Shit. What happened there?

1955
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:52,570
The black belt in Jujitsu? Yeah. Oh
yeah. Yeah. Just was his strong point.

1956
01:59:52,571 --> 01:59:55,960
He's just a nasty as Stryker to Damion.
He's a tall kid. Look at this lead,

1957
01:59:55,961 --> 02:00:00,830
this good move. Very
smart fighter. Bang. Oh,

1958
02:00:00,831 --> 02:00:04,870
that was why it's right hand.
Oh. Oh, you can do well,

1959
02:00:04,871 --> 02:00:08,840
go me as this weird kind of striker.
He's a knockout puncher, but he's like,

1960
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:10,490
everything is home runs.

1961
02:00:10,491 --> 02:00:15,320
It's all home runs and it just doesn't
seem like he's setting things up in any

1962
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:18,020
way by a little bit.
Let's be honest.

1963
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,580
But is it the game passing by or is he
not as fired up as he was when he was

1964
02:00:22,581 --> 02:00:25,490
younger? He doesn't have the body
that he had when he was younger.

1965
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:28,830
Two
armored cars.

1966
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:33,870
Grub fucking
pickles are in town.

1967
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:36,220
The hot ones too.
Do y'all like the hut?

1968
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:39,910
They got like hub and arrows and shit
and if you've got balls eat those.

1969
02:00:39,911 --> 02:00:44,890
I have to eat the pickles, digging.
They're powerful miles. Jury.

1970
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:50,470
The kids really impressed me.
Undefeated. Me Too. Super impressive.

1971
02:00:50,471 --> 02:00:54,420
He's gonna be tough to beat.
Yes. Just is really good at it.

1972
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:56,260
Oh Damn.

1973
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:02,640
11 first round fitness.
It's inquiry.

1974
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:06,400
These pimples are not easy to
get into line to be honest.

1975
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:12,040
He wants the English tough.
I forget

1976
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:17,520
he was, no, no, no, no. He's just a
beast from San Diego. From Cali Kid.

1977
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:19,390
Yeah.
Stimulus.

1978
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:22,380
No.
Oh Shit.

1979
02:01:24,630 --> 02:01:27,120
You confusing him with Dan
Hardee cause they're both sexy

1980
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:35,760
and I had one. The fucker right there.
Fuck Yeah Dude. Look at this movement man.

1981
02:01:35,761 --> 02:01:39,980
Very nice. Look at this setup for this.
She's is moving. It's Diego Sanchez.

1982
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:44,660
We did good. I am good ground and
pound him. That was his first big win.

1983
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:46,450
The Diego San Doz,
he put,

1984
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:49,400
he's putting a lot of weight behind those
punches to a lot of length and a lot

1985
02:01:49,401 --> 02:01:53,960
of weight. Diego was his first
big win. He outclass Diego.

1986
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:57,980
It's a good fight, man. Practice.
I am crucified. I don't,

1987
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:02,240
you shouldn't be giving this
up on the air. Oh, okay.

1988
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:06,600
Trash brand can text me if he wants.
Look,

1989
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:12,010
it's really the only thing to get like
go counter act that ground and pound from

1990
02:02:12,141 --> 02:02:17,020
the horse stance position.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1991
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:20,720
yeah. What we do, you gotta be,
you gotta be really good. Yeah.

1992
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:24,740
That's the perfect spot for him to
avoid submissions and be able to throw

1993
02:02:24,741 --> 02:02:28,790
punches and say stay standing on your
feet and squats cause you could reach the

1994
02:02:28,791 --> 02:02:32,120
face and right there there's
no submissions. But the only,

1995
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:34,320
the only thing you got to
worry about is I up kicks. Yup.

1996
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:38,730
Cause you're in a perfect
spot for an upkick. So you,

1997
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:43,020
you would think that most MMA fighters
would work on that? Yeah, we do.

1998
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:47,480
There's levels man.
Cause you know as I,

1999
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:52,720
I still haven't seen anybody throw kicks
off their back as hard as hoists and

2000
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:56,960
I'll tell you what man, Harry
Crow cops, fricking nasty.

2001
02:02:56,970 --> 02:03:01,550
Adam hit me with a UPC cake to my knee
and to the face. It was like boom, boom.

2002
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:04,280
You would think a kickboxer
would be the best at them. Right?

2003
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:07,970
It was literally like that movie a
rush hour. Which one are off kicked me.

2004
02:03:07,971 --> 02:03:08,211
It was like,

2005
02:03:08,211 --> 02:03:11,810
oh well you know who the first guy was
to kick really good off of his back?

2006
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:16,340
The one of the most impressive
early today. Henzel Gracie
gets all tech tar off.

2007
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:17,090
Remember him,

2008
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:20,660
he k owed him for his back and then stood
up and blasted him in the face of the

2009
02:03:20,661 --> 02:03:23,310
punch and broke his hand.
Do you remember the story in that part?

2010
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:24,081
That was bare knuckle.

2011
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:29,081
The story was nobody like Hanzo actually
practiced up kicks to get really good

2012
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:34,301
at them and move Bustamante Bustamante
thought cause I guess there were clothes.

2013
02:03:36,681 --> 02:03:40,790
Thought it was a waste of time. You're
not son until, oh, pulled it off.

2014
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:46,380
March person had strikes. Dude,
is that to your head? No, no.

2015
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:50,600
That's delivering son to him.
I'm 300 attempts.

2016
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:57,020
Not a big deal. It's whatever. Not
bad brother. We got work to do.

2017
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:59,960
My man's in shape. I'll
go train right now, son.

2018
02:04:01,730 --> 02:04:04,550
I got from her bell share.
Don't tempt to brother.

2019
02:04:04,551 --> 02:04:09,551
I'm all hyped up on fucking bulletproof
coffee and a bait about 17 hot pickles.

2020
02:04:10,310 --> 02:04:12,700
I'm either going to shit my pants
and get a workout in the bowl.

2021
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:16,100
You picked gentlemen,
both. Both make you sweat.

2022
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:20,460
He says nights here and an
archery target we can take.

2023
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:25,760
That dude is you get in the bows
and arrows or what not. Hey,

2024
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,100
I thought you were gonna make fun
of me when we went to your house.

2025
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:31,160
I got someone went to your house
and you release those chickens.

2026
02:04:31,161 --> 02:04:34,430
I'll scare the shit, the
chickens. I told my brother,

2027
02:04:34,431 --> 02:04:38,190
I told my brother and my prayer, my
friend club was like, fuck man, a

2028
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:42,150
brilliant elisos chickens. I was scared
as fuck, but I was trying to act tough.

2029
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:45,180
I'm not, I'm not used to
like wild animals released.

2030
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:49,020
Those chickens are scared as fuck,
man. I'm starting to develop a farm.

2031
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:51,780
That's my first step. My first
step is having all these chickens.

2032
02:04:51,781 --> 02:04:56,610
I got like 24 chickens. I think it'd
be nice. I want to do it personally,

2033
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:59,910
but I think ultimately the best move
would be, and I said this before,

2034
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:03,930
the best move would be if like friends,
you know Uriah Faber, he lives,

2035
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:07,950
he lives on a corner. All these
houses, they own the whole corner,

2036
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,720
the whole neighborhood.
It's like you a neighborhood.

2037
02:05:09,721 --> 02:05:12,100
So dope move you and your homeys.
If,

2038
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:15,060
if someone could figure out how we
could all do something like that.

2039
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,850
You write on paper all of this family,

2040
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:21,570
well Uriah Faber has his own house but
Chad Mendez lives right next to them and

2041
02:05:21,820 --> 02:05:26,160
you ride owns a few mounts it to all
of them. It's all his training camp.

2042
02:05:26,161 --> 02:05:29,130
Holbys in his friends live in the same,
they call it the block.

2043
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:30,450
It's a brilliant idea.

2044
02:05:30,451 --> 02:05:34,110
So they have like this whole area where
they're all like they'd go grilling

2045
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:35,430
together,
they have parties,

2046
02:05:35,431 --> 02:05:37,710
they have people come over
and this super friendly dudes.

2047
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:42,510
So it's like a real warm,
fun environment and all this comradery.

2048
02:05:42,511 --> 02:05:43,590
They all live together like that.

2049
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:48,060
And I've always felt like that would be
the best thing if like all of our yards

2050
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:51,420
board each other. And then you
fucking grow vegetables together.

2051
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:55,440
That would be dope. When I
was a kid, when I was a kid,

2052
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,940
when I was a kid, my dad was in this
thing, my stepfather was in this,

2053
02:05:59,941 --> 02:06:04,860
um oh it was like a cooperative thing
in school and they would grow plants

2054
02:06:04,861 --> 02:06:05,880
together and they would all work.

2055
02:06:05,881 --> 02:06:09,810
It was a in the university and they
would all grow like a bunch of different

2056
02:06:09,811 --> 02:06:12,930
plans. I remember going there and thinking
this is what a great idea this is.

2057
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:14,910
Like everybody would
contribute like some days.

2058
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:18,390
I keep brought me down there on like a
Tuesday and I remember it very clearly

2059
02:06:18,391 --> 02:06:21,810
because it's goat attacked
me is fucking male goat.

2060
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,350
Like I was hanging out with little man
and it was like seven years old and it's

2061
02:06:25,351 --> 02:06:29,340
fucking gold starts headbutting me and
I'm grabbing the goat and I'm freaking

2062
02:06:29,341 --> 02:06:32,460
out. And then he came over and Jack
to goat and like get the fuck up,

2063
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:36,540
bitch pushed the female go
started attacking me when
I was holding onto the mail

2064
02:06:36,541 --> 02:06:40,490
go cause she decided I was the enemy.
I've been nearly as fucking cunt.

2065
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:43,830
I had been feeding her just a few
minutes ago. Yeah, I remember.

2066
02:06:43,831 --> 02:06:46,800
So I remember it very clearly
that I remember this thing like,

2067
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:51,480
like what a great idea to have
like a bunch of vegetables
like grown right there.

2068
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:55,370
And if you do that and
you've got chickens, just
vegetables and chickens. Joe,

2069
02:06:55,371 --> 02:06:59,130
you got days of food? Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm,
I'm done for the chickens and vegetables.

2070
02:06:59,131 --> 02:07:03,540
All that shit. How about we just get a
bunch of bad ass cars. We like share cars.

2071
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:07,210
We get girls as girls.
There's drugs.

2072
02:07:07,211 --> 02:07:09,260
There's also someone's already retired.

2073
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:14,160
That's when wait till you retire
as they say, but not in Calabasas.

2074
02:07:14,161 --> 02:07:14,671
Will the steward,

2075
02:07:14,671 --> 02:07:18,790
when did Michael Bernard deejaying
argue what I'm thinking right now.

2076
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:25,860
So does she forget your own hair?
Fucking slick.

2077
02:07:25,861 --> 02:07:28,710
Dj tide mark over look shots.

2078
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:32,990
He looks good on the tables that Pakistan.
What is that?

2079
02:07:33,130 --> 02:07:36,640
The Mgm Mike's head.
He looks like he was taking a nap.

2080
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:42,190
Dare you? I'm just saying head phones.
He doesn't have the luxury of the shape.

2081
02:07:42,330 --> 02:07:45,850
A color a DJ now I can't say not sweet.
Got there yet.

2082
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:51,340
[inaudible] guys like Michael,
cause a sweetie.

2083
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:55,750
Oh he's a good guy. We were talking
about, we talked about this before.

2084
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:57,520
Yeah we were,
it was weren't on air.

2085
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:01,480
We were talking about Mark Hunt Big
foot and the difference between what the

2086
02:08:01,481 --> 02:08:04,000
kind of punishment that big foot
was able to take in that fight,

2087
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,960
which is incredible.

2088
02:08:05,170 --> 02:08:08,320
And then his last fight with her Lawsky
two shots and he's down or are you

2089
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:11,140
talking about when he's off to you
or to yeah. Oh yeah. It's crazy.

2090
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:12,610
Crazy advantage.
It gives guys,

2091
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:17,440
is that the case or is it just the case
of the standard thing of seeing guys

2092
02:08:17,441 --> 02:08:21,670
just have Daniel Cormier, he knocked him
out. You know, there's a bunch of fights.

2093
02:08:21,671 --> 02:08:23,470
He's taken a lot of damage in fights.

2094
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:27,100
Cain Velasquez fucked him up in his
last fight. I'm just saying man,

2095
02:08:27,101 --> 02:08:31,450
when when you're on TRT and fighting
down in Australia and you're eating right

2096
02:08:31,451 --> 02:08:35,950
and left hamstring Mark Hunt and then you
fight in Brazil off tot he get knocked

2097
02:08:35,951 --> 02:08:39,850
out. One Punch. God, it's a good
argument man. It's not saying it is,

2098
02:08:39,851 --> 02:08:43,900
but it's a fucking good argument
kind of. But isn't it also, look,

2099
02:08:43,901 --> 02:08:48,760
the are lost face several times during
feel shit. You know what I'm saying?

2100
02:08:48,761 --> 02:08:52,660
But big foot's been taking punishment
before. It's weird men. Right,

2101
02:08:52,661 --> 02:08:56,330
but isn't it true though
that like sometimes you get
punched in the face and you

2102
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:59,500
just getting punched like on the
cheek? Sure. Egan, he punched here.

2103
02:08:59,501 --> 02:09:00,430
It's placement man.

2104
02:09:00,431 --> 02:09:05,290
You can get one tank like across the tip
of the Chin and that the legs just go.

2105
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,580
It's not even the chance.

2106
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:11,110
Most of the time it's behind the ear on
the side of the head or behind the ear

2107
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:14,860
that's observed. Marshall got tagged
tonight. She got hit in the year.

2108
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:18,130
Marshall got hit there
when DC fought big foot.

2109
02:09:18,131 --> 02:09:21,820
He tagged behind the Cain Velasquez
got hit behind the air against jds.

2110
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:25,420
I got him behind the air
against a big or big country.

2111
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:28,120
It's all about placement,
man. Big countries.

2112
02:09:28,121 --> 02:09:32,590
Really good at that looping right hand
and land's best casting style. Right?

2113
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:34,330
I Lens and a lot of different ways.

2114
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:38,920
If I was a betting man and I had,
you made me pick,

2115
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:42,310
I would say Roy is going to
land that he's going to wobble,

2116
02:09:42,311 --> 02:09:47,170
hunt that he's going to take them down.
Tkl Wow, that's crazy. The second round,

2117
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:52,210
do you remember when Roy was just
a grappler? It was a long time ago.

2118
02:09:52,211 --> 02:09:55,210
Wouldn't any and I first
met a long time ago at, no,

2119
02:09:55,211 --> 02:09:57,550
really doesn't use it anymore.
It's crazy.

2120
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:02,760
It's crazy because the dude didn't
even start striking into 2009 when I

2121
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:06,700
interviewed him in the boom.
I got fucking hard. He hits.

2122
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:10,640
Oh God. When I interviewed
mentality, he's not ferocious.

2123
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:13,000
His Chin is iron granite chin.

2124
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:15,880
The only time he's been stopped
as our Lawsky Scott stomped him.

2125
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:17,200
I think that's the only time,

2126
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:21,530
and that was a ridiculous
situation because he had
our Lawsky down immerse site

2127
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:25,630
control and they smelled him up.
It was ridiculous. It was pathetic.

2128
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:30,730
But see, he didn't even start striking
till 2009 I mean, think of that.

2129
02:10:30,731 --> 02:10:33,980
He's knocked out. No Garren knocked
out mitre own, you see knocked out

2130
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,830
Dave Herman there. There's
took, should that mean though?

2131
02:10:36,831 --> 02:10:41,420
That was a those Congo boom. Look
at that right hand. Boom, left hook,

2132
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:45,690
boom dude. This is the,

2133
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:47,620
now he's also a smart fight.

2134
02:10:47,621 --> 02:10:51,620
So when the going gets rough in this
fight and they're trading bombs,

2135
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:55,770
hunt has to keep trading. What's I'm
going to do? Take them down. Nope. We,

2136
02:10:55,771 --> 02:10:59,420
Roy can't take them now was going
to say fuck this. Abandoned ship.

2137
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:01,840
Emergency Brake. Boom, I'm
taking you down. Right.

2138
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:05,690
I can win the fight but just says,
Nah, you gotta keep throwing you far.

2139
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:08,660
What's the difference? He the hardest
hitter you've ever fought. No.

2140
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:12,350
Well it's tough be Shane's the
hardest you've ever been hit us.

2141
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:17,000
Roy hit me behind the ear. Roy landed
three right hands to or straight on.

2142
02:11:17,001 --> 02:11:19,640
I didn't feel anything like we
said, plays in, hit me here.

2143
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:21,890
Hit me here than the one I turned on.

2144
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:24,230
The Jab hit me behind the ear
and that was the ending shot.

2145
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:29,090
So I really didn't feel it. He's so
good at. But if you look case by case,

2146
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:33,500
Roy has to be the hardest hitter. You
know what I'm saying? It's amazing.

2147
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:37,220
It's amazing. Leverage is the leverage.
And the way throws that right hand,

2148
02:11:37,221 --> 02:11:42,221
just reckless is shit and all the power
and also this fucking confidence in his

2149
02:11:42,261 --> 02:11:43,040
chin.

2150
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:47,570
I mean junior dos Santos hit him with
everything but the fucking kitchen,

2151
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:52,100
Sam Dume dude, he thought he was
doing fine. Eaten those knees.

2152
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:56,240
He was like, that guy never
hurt me and he's a fucking

2153
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:01,850
tough though. [inaudible] everyone
here loves Roy at some point.

2154
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:05,870
That crazy durability chin.
It could be this fight,

2155
02:12:05,871 --> 02:12:09,620
it could be 10 fights from now. It
just goes away. It's like Oh shit.

2156
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:13,640
Or he is just that country motherfucker
that you hear about that lives up in the

2157
02:12:13,641 --> 02:12:17,630
mountain and chops wood with his face
and doesn't give a fuck one 70 I think I

2158
02:12:17,631 --> 02:12:21,590
want to know like that though is their
faith. You think feto would be that guy,

2159
02:12:21,650 --> 02:12:25,970
right? He can fight. He can fight one
70 if not all. Not caring. I mean Sally,

2160
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:28,520
but I mean he's got,
he's got a lot of weight on him.

2161
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,110
Well he's weighing about like what is,

2162
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:35,111
he went in to two CC to 60 is it possible
that beard could absorbs punishment?

2163
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:39,650
No. No. Is it possible otherwise
Kimbo slice to be the channel.

2164
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:43,100
You know what I'm saying?
I'll do that

2165
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:50,150
train with my like guilty. I'm like,
ugh. Jheri curl over your hand.

2166
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:53,240
I mean he has got that.

2167
02:12:53,241 --> 02:12:58,241
There's no reason Kimbo slice had the
best look of all time and nicest fighter.

2168
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:02,750
I know the greatest
guy says my sweetheart.

2169
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:06,400
You know what I'm having on my podcast,
man, can you see Alexander art?

2170
02:13:06,401 --> 02:13:09,460
You have a kid cutting. I'm having
kid Cuddy and huge. Me and my brother,

2171
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:13,100
huge kid Cuddy fence. He's and he
sits down. He say big brown loves Ya.

2172
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:16,220
I'm going to tell him, you know I
even walked out to one of his songs.

2173
02:13:16,221 --> 02:13:20,220
If he's cool, Ooh, I'll tell him, tell
him. I'll tell him I'm around a shadow.

2174
02:13:20,221 --> 02:13:24,050
I'll walk out to one of the
song. I'll tell him on Monday,
man, it's God. He's good.

2175
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:27,020
Yeah, he's good, but I'm going
to get Houston Alexander on too.

2176
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:29,810
He's another motherfucker.
God get some power.

2177
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:34,080
Are talking about styles make slight.
How about when Houston Kimbo slot,

2178
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:37,380
everyone was like, oh shit, this
will be the fight of the century.

2179
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:41,250
What are the fall by you? Actually
this was, it was a tough fight.

2180
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:45,540
It was so boring and they bought no
one committee because they both have

2181
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:49,020
knockout. Power is weird. How about when
you used to Alexander? Fuck Keith Jardeen.

2182
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:52,950
Nobody knew who he was.
Oh, I know cod. Ooh,

2183
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:57,330
Zander can got mark Hunt's a scary dude,
man.

2184
02:13:57,331 --> 02:14:01,800
And he's familiar in Japan.
Listen, he's a star in Japan.

2185
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:07,620
[inaudible] champion. He's fought some
of the best of the best of all time.

2186
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:11,580
If you have a tattoo on your neck,
do not talk shit to again,

2187
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:16,260
it looks like in the next chapter. House
slept good crowds. It's a good point.

2188
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:17,730
That's a good,
that's a legit point.

2189
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:19,430
There's a lot of guys in
Venice with dirty feet,

2190
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:22,620
neck tattoos and like fucking all skinny.

2191
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:25,410
I'm just saying mark on his
and gnarliest head. He's just,

2192
02:14:25,470 --> 02:14:27,570
I think that's his son's name,
whatever.

2193
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:33,030
I'm pretty sure that's his son's name
that he had written in Kanji on his neck.

2194
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:35,490
You don't mean I'm always coming
up with schemes or you know,

2195
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,060
something to get a guy to fight me.
I want this big fight. And with hunt,

2196
02:14:39,061 --> 02:14:41,340
we're talking shit back
and forth. I said, fuck it.

2197
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:45,120
Let's put our fight purses online. I
when I get all your money, you win.

2198
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:47,880
You get all mine thinking he'd
be like, Nah. He was like, cool,

2199
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:54,750
cool man. Uh, we'll ask Dana.
No. You know, knowing damn
well Dan's, we'll ask Dana.

2200
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:58,890
We'll see how it goes. You know,
he shut that shit down. Well,

2201
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:03,180
didn't have gangs. Just offer that to
Luke. Rockhold stole paid to shops.

2202
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:06,720
Book Gay did. Yeah, me and busy and
talked about that. Yeah. Bisping,

2203
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,900
he was being really funny about it too.

2204
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:14,160
Since since I get paid about five
times more true. Able to me, bro.

2205
02:15:14,161 --> 02:15:16,790
Let's talk about this though.
Mark. I'm really excited.

2206
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,680
I can't wait for this fight. Let's
talk about marketing real quick though.

2207
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:24,930
Just a couple of years ago,
if you remember, he got
taken down by Krista usher.

2208
02:15:24,990 --> 02:15:28,670
He lost a McCorkell by some economists,
emotional calmness,

2209
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:31,470
McCargo economist submission.

2210
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:35,310
He went to that weird fight
in Denver with Rothwell were,

2211
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:38,010
they call it the worst heavyweight
fight of all time. So you're like, damn,

2212
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:41,910
Mark Hunt is not doing well. Look
at this mother fucking now. Yup.

2213
02:15:41,990 --> 02:15:43,910
Killing the game, right. Killing the game.

2214
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:47,730
Well that Rothwell fight man was in
Denver and if you don't live in Denver,

2215
02:15:47,731 --> 02:15:51,120
good luck fighting in Denver.
She weighed 260 pounds. Listen,

2216
02:15:51,121 --> 02:15:54,420
if you're not in shape in New Zealand,
when you get to Denver,

2217
02:15:54,421 --> 02:15:59,160
you're also not going to be in shape.
If you're not in shape in California,

2218
02:15:59,161 --> 02:16:02,400
when you fly to Florida,
your fat ass still ain't in shape.

2219
02:16:03,390 --> 02:16:06,640
I used to fly train partners in and
they'd be crazy out of shape bra.

2220
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:09,900
This altitude, not your fetish
shit bro. No, it doesn't matter.

2221
02:16:09,901 --> 02:16:12,810
Where'd you come from? Jacksonville.
Yeah, you're fat and Jacksonville.

2222
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:14,160
You know what I'm saying?
Drive me nuts.

2223
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:18,230
Is how disappointing must that be for
professional athletes like they come in

2224
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:21,420
professional athletes to work with
you and their shape, like the kind of,

2225
02:16:21,450 --> 02:16:25,260
we would send them home the next day.
What'd you beat it? Nerd. Go kick rocks.

2226
02:16:25,261 --> 02:16:26,190
Get eat it nerd.

2227
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:31,880
So don't they say that the best to do it
is to sleep at sea level and trained it

2228
02:16:32,981 --> 02:16:37,390
out too? They say like no living in East
San Bernandino. Yes, that's what I meant.

2229
02:16:37,470 --> 02:16:41,060
Yeah. Train, train it where there's
no altitude and then sleep. Why?

2230
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:44,770
Because your body, you get the
harder work rate in at sea level.

2231
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:48,780
Plenty oxygen reps, the more energy
exerted because you're not, you know,

2232
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:53,290
you're not struggling but
there is a benefit to living
end training up there but

2233
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:56,530
it's not as much of a benefit as
sleeping up there. But training is you.

2234
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:59,680
I used to train it awfully high
altitude and live at high altitude.

2235
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:03,070
I feel 10 times better
living in California.

2236
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:07,030
I get better training in my body.
Recovers Better. I do eat better.

2237
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:11,500
Do you out [inaudible] in La Roxanne,
how are you getting?

2238
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,810
Very sorry man. They'll
sprinkles. Got me crunk shit.

2239
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,180
I'm also going to shit my pants
and he said it's also the,

2240
02:17:16,181 --> 02:17:20,380
there's a Hob and arrows and I know I
drank seven cups of coffee. Do you like?

2241
02:17:20,381 --> 02:17:23,380
If you were going to fight in Denver,
would you go to Denver and prepare?

2242
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:26,300
Kind of have to, right.
You know what? But Joe, uh,

2243
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:29,710
Joe Silva said he's never going to put
heavy weights on debit card again because

2244
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:33,370
of the thanks Rothwell and
Hon. Thanks. Thank you sir.

2245
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:38,850
It's hard it man, if you're fucking not
mark nine and eight number six in the,

2246
02:17:38,910 --> 02:17:40,570
that's a fucking gangster man.

2247
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:46,800
Nine eight five 10 to 64 [inaudible]
that a fellow and you throw nine

2248
02:17:48,251 --> 02:17:51,550
touchdowns, eight interceptions. You
don't have a job. I'm just saying. Yeah,

2249
02:17:51,551 --> 02:17:54,490
but this isn't the NFL.
This is Mark Hunt. I agree.

2250
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:59,520
It's k one grumpy champion and knocked
out check Congo k one grumpy champion.

2251
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:04,220
Who was the shortest fighter ever?
Like the difference between dot.

2252
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:07,450
This is a good fight and
they look exactly the same.

2253
02:18:07,451 --> 02:18:09,010
His fight and Stephan struve site,

2254
02:18:09,011 --> 02:18:12,670
it was the most disparity in
size ever in a heavyweight fight.

2255
02:18:12,671 --> 02:18:17,010
And Hunt landed a leaping left
hook that destroyed strips, drawl.

2256
02:18:17,060 --> 02:18:20,860
And so I'm playing against Caramel.
This is an interesting fight, man.

2257
02:18:20,861 --> 02:18:25,110
Very interesting. Hunt. Certainly,
certainly is more weapons, but he's,

2258
02:18:25,390 --> 02:18:27,250
he's also disagree.
Disagree.

2259
02:18:27,251 --> 02:18:29,590
I don't think coming to stand
up and not saying overall,

2260
02:18:29,591 --> 02:18:32,290
I'm saying as a MMA fight. Oh No,
he definitely doesn't. Overall,

2261
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:38,390
he's got more weapons standing up by 100%
but Roy arguably has more power in his

2262
02:18:39,221 --> 02:18:43,820
one weapon. That one weapon known
as a, as a good wrestler. He,

2263
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:45,740
he has see his trips.
Yeah,

2264
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:49,560
but Mark Hunt has been working
on as a takedown defense dude.

2265
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:52,850
Mark Cook is from fucking out of space.

2266
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:59,670
Oh, shut. He just, he just tagged Nelson.

2267
02:19:01,850 --> 02:19:04,380
Can you imagine it is the first fiber.

2268
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:07,750
See Roy gets stopped like it might be.

2269
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:13,240
He might not be able to take
more cut down. I think Roy's
to smart man. Very good.

2270
02:19:13,241 --> 02:19:18,100
It's slipping in and out of shit too.
He's really good at that check hook. Oh,

2271
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:20,110
Roy goes for the take
down early to tell you.

2272
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:24,220
I told my brother on the way down and
I said boys and choose to was a Roy.

2273
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:28,720
He's smart man. Oh, you cut all that
weight. You take them down early in,

2274
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:31,520
they exhaust him. He's not going to
have the same power. Not only that.

2275
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:33,860
Hunt is a very skillful striker.

2276
02:19:33,861 --> 02:19:36,590
He's not going to just stand right in
front of you like you see when Roy went to

2277
02:19:36,591 --> 02:19:39,890
throw that right hand, Hans slides
right out of the range of shit.

2278
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:43,130
Just out of the range
went up to the worst.

2279
02:19:43,131 --> 02:19:45,720
The fight stopped an eye poke in
solid wood in Japan right now.

2280
02:19:45,721 --> 02:19:48,650
This entire night would be
ruined. Yeah. Isn't that sad?

2281
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:53,090
At least no one would've gotten hurt.
I fucking hate.

2282
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:57,640
I hate the glove situation, man. I feel
like there's gotta be a way to not.

2283
02:19:57,641 --> 02:20:00,200
Oh yeah. He poked him right in the
fucking house till he goes. Sorry.

2284
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:05,320
He said enjoy your victim. One
fucking Huh. It's so disappointing,

2285
02:20:05,321 --> 02:20:09,820
man. I mean, nobody means to do it.
You try. That's a Moy Tai thing too.

2286
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:12,340
You know,
they train that with the glove on.

2287
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:19,600
He's all right. He's all right. He's
gonna keep going. Beautiful. Beautiful.

2288
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:22,900
They need to come up with a solution.
Big Brown. What's the solution?

2289
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:27,520
Is it something that covers the
fingertips? Oven Mitts, right.

2290
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:32,890
Condoms of, it's obviously
not. No gloves. No gloves,

2291
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:36,550
no solution at all for that. You have to
have the fingers out, man for grappling.

2292
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:41,890
Yeah, I know. Yeah, but is
it low left kick to the body?

2293
02:20:41,891 --> 02:20:45,960
God Damn. He puts some fucking pop
in that when it comes to school.

2294
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:51,220
Oh, he gets angry. Remember Huntsman
code before by Melvin manner?

2295
02:20:51,370 --> 02:20:56,170
Yeah, he did do an 18 seconds.
Melvin Manhoef is a motherfucker

2296
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:00,310
straight up. Scary. Meanwhile,

2297
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:03,160
we got a fight with Robbie Lawler so
much faster than he should have been.

2298
02:21:03,161 --> 02:21:05,680
He's beaten the show. Rob
Lewis, that leg kick, man,

2299
02:21:05,850 --> 02:21:10,120
that's you just get kicked by a
telephone pole. That's not a normal knee.

2300
02:21:10,121 --> 02:21:14,080
What kind of knee is that?
The size of that need some serious shit.

2301
02:21:14,110 --> 02:21:16,360
He is nice,
but you know what?

2302
02:21:16,361 --> 02:21:20,470
If hunts smart and he keeps sliding
towards his right after he lands shots,

2303
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:25,330
he takes away some of the right hand
slide to the right because Roy very rarely

2304
02:21:25,331 --> 02:21:29,240
throws lefse. He does. His
left is a measuring device. Me,

2305
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:31,870
he'll throw it like a left
to get you thinking about it,

2306
02:21:31,871 --> 02:21:35,920
but that right hand is the bomb with me.
He threw a double jab.

2307
02:21:36,130 --> 02:21:39,670
See there's the right, a double jab to
a huge right hand. That's his thing.

2308
02:21:39,671 --> 02:21:41,710
He goes, pop, pop, shakes
it, and then big right here.

2309
02:21:41,740 --> 02:21:46,660
See the thing about a striker like hunt,
like look how slick he is for a slick.

2310
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:51,870
He's basically 300 pounds right now to
move in like a fucking ballerina. Oh,

2311
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:54,370
and there's a clean right hand he landed.

2312
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:59,050
See that there's a disparity in
technical advantages when hyper tactical

2313
02:21:59,051 --> 02:22:02,830
advantage that Marchmont his
movement to his movement is,

2314
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:04,950
but that's also a blue advantage.
Yeah,

2315
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:09,100
100% he knows exactly where he's coming
and look if he avoids the right hand.

2316
02:22:09,101 --> 02:22:12,400
See it's just avoiding
the right hand though.

2317
02:22:12,670 --> 02:22:15,050
He doesn't have to
worry about knees kicks.

2318
02:22:15,220 --> 02:22:17,350
He's just worried about
that right in at his level.

2319
02:22:17,351 --> 02:22:19,810
If they go all this guy's a right
hand, he's going go, oh cool.

2320
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:23,450
It's a totally different animal. You're
dealing with a k one grand Prix champion,

2321
02:22:23,650 --> 02:22:26,100
but, but now you're talking
about a guy very who

2322
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:29,160
can stick in there and has
better cardio than you maybe.

2323
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:33,820
Who knows who's got better cardio so far,
but right now you just deal with mark.

2324
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:35,250
I mean,
Mark Hyatt was fat,

2325
02:22:35,251 --> 02:22:38,880
but it doesn't mean he's out of
shape just because he's 290 pounds.

2326
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:42,770
He could have been starting off at three
40 and gotten really good shape at two

2327
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:46,890
90 and had to cut down to two 65 and
still be able to kick some fucking ass for

2328
02:22:46,891 --> 02:22:51,270
three rounds. Fiber apparently. You're
right, it's five rounds. I'm very excited.

2329
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:54,420
When I found out was, I knew it was five
rounds, but I forgot for a second. Oh,

2330
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:57,750
that's what I wanted to talk to you
about water. I Dunno if this is true,

2331
02:22:57,751 --> 02:23:02,580
but if it is true. Oh, dumb. Roy got
him with a left hook to the fuck.

2332
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:05,910
Yeah, he did. I'll have someone
said that junior dos Santos,

2333
02:23:05,911 --> 02:23:09,930
the steep Emile chick fight.
She requested a three round fight for it.

2334
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:15,180
I hear that. Is that true? I body shot.
Roy heard he wants a three round fight.

2335
02:23:15,181 --> 02:23:18,570
Why do you think that is? I don't,
maybe those two fights with Kane,

2336
02:23:18,571 --> 02:23:20,550
those fucking horrible five round wars,
man.

2337
02:23:20,551 --> 02:23:23,340
Maybe he doesn't want to do that to
his body. If I'm steep am saying nope.

2338
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:24,174
Five rounds.

2339
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:31,710
The other thing that hunt is good
at is rolling with Shit Diff,

2340
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:35,640
but it looks a little tired, not to
me. He doesn't get stiff with stuff.

2341
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:39,670
He roles like when things are coming at
him, he rolls away from things. Yeah.

2342
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:43,800
He takes a lot of the power off of
those punches when he does that.

2343
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:47,820
And for someone who's not used to
a guy that says look like that,

2344
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:51,840
it also Uber Royal, the
leg kicks, spun him around.

2345
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,393
It also,
uh,

2346
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:56,670
makes you very tired because you're
decelerating your own punches instead of

2347
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:58,220
hitting something. Yeah. Missing a punch.

2348
02:23:58,221 --> 02:24:01,380
It makes you more tired than
actually hidden. So on. Yeah.

2349
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:04,950
When you're fighting to get, let's why
Ali would where guys out so well, yeah.

2350
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:06,840
Cause he would just be
standing in front of them.

2351
02:24:06,841 --> 02:24:11,370
They were just be fucking
eaten air sandwiches. Look
at that beautiful movement.

2352
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,860
You know what that is,
man, that's just knowledge.

2353
02:24:13,861 --> 02:24:17,070
Just knowing where the countries are.
Common sense man.

2354
02:24:18,110 --> 02:24:18,870
Okay.

2355
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:23,730
Oh Roylex hold his head. His
head's always in the right spot.

2356
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:28,800
Yeah. Well it's sort of tough if, if
he knows that you have to weapons,

2357
02:24:28,801 --> 02:24:29,611
right?
I mean royal,

2358
02:24:29,611 --> 02:24:32,900
he hit him with one pretty good leg
kick is pretty good leg kick though. Uh,

2359
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:35,220
not game changing. No, but pretty good.

2360
02:24:35,221 --> 02:24:39,600
Now here's a company landed a great left
Hook right hand. That was the, yeah,

2361
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,270
there's a nice right hand
and right to the eyeball.

2362
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:45,900
Boom and look slides away.
Boom.

2363
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:48,450
There's one over the top that tag
tomatoes are rolled with it though.

2364
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:50,820
You rolled with the left hook,
but there's a good leg kick,

2365
02:24:50,821 --> 02:24:53,730
but then he rolled with that too. Then
you roll around with this, went with it,

2366
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:58,590
but it's like when Roy mixes it up,
anytime a fighter mixes it up,

2367
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:02,790
he opens up all these other possibilities
because he's creates new variables.

2368
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:06,390
If you introduce new variables.
That's why GSP was so good.

2369
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,130
He never knew what the
fuck he was going to do.

2370
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:12,270
So that extra half of a second when
you're thinking what is he going to do?

2371
02:25:12,470 --> 02:25:16,380
Then he executes something.
Is that an extra half of a second?

2372
02:25:16,381 --> 02:25:21,381
It's such an advantage that along with
the comfort level that a guy like GSP had

2373
02:25:21,451 --> 02:25:24,190
from all those championship
fights was one of the reasons

2374
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:28,510
that led him to be one of
the great fighters of all
time is that he was so good

2375
02:25:28,511 --> 02:25:29,410
at being unpredicted.

2376
02:25:29,411 --> 02:25:32,260
You didn't know if he was going to strike
or try to grapple and guys would be

2377
02:25:32,261 --> 02:25:33,670
thinking, what's he gonna do? Fuck,

2378
02:25:33,671 --> 02:25:35,950
you already did it and then you're
always playing catch up. Yeah.

2379
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:37,960
I talked to Nate Marquardt about that,

2380
02:25:37,961 --> 02:25:40,240
who is his main training
partner and he would always say,

2381
02:25:40,241 --> 02:25:42,440
you didn't know if he was
to shoot a double leg on

2382
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:47,320
backwards bess levels all four.

2383
02:25:48,470 --> 02:25:52,940
It gets them, oh, hi.

2384
02:25:53,910 --> 02:25:58,040
They're thick. Look at how
his legs up. Roy is very good.

2385
02:26:00,030 --> 02:26:04,990
Oh, it is on my side. He's out.
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.

2386
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:08,110
Hunts out and Roy auto adjusts
his knee pad. That's interesting.

2387
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:12,640
What's that about? I think
it was uncomfortable. Yeah,
but I mean, what's up?

2388
02:26:12,641 --> 02:26:16,300
What do you think? He's got
a knee injury. Oh, back fist.

2389
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:21,760
That's a big, big moment for hunt,
right? Yeah. Getting up like that.

2390
02:26:22,310 --> 02:26:24,790
There's the fact that he could,
he was able to escape, dude.

2391
02:26:24,791 --> 02:26:27,490
He's tough to keep down now.
It's, it's all he's training.

2392
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:31,360
It looks like so fucking
strong to look at the back on.

2393
02:26:31,361 --> 02:26:34,450
That fucking takes a while to get it all
together. Some people would have quit.

2394
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:36,760
He just kept going and now he's finally,

2395
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:42,630
he's hard to take down and he's got a
little bit of Jujitsu and he's to 90 and

2396
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:47,400
five 10 that helps. Helps
us set up, did it get,

2397
02:26:47,401 --> 02:26:50,860
so we're fine for a little bit.
Shit for about 10 minutes.

2398
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:55,360
So we had to cut the two
65 pounds in one day.

2399
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:59,950
They said he lost 19 pounds in one
day. So he's at least, you know,

2400
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:04,410
a solid two 84 solid too.

2401
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:08,650
That's so ridiculous.
It's so ridiculous.

2402
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:12,850
If he got down at two oh five but
meanwhile he fucking moves good.

2403
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:17,920
He moves good. But you know what, Mike
Daltrey made some really good points.

2404
02:27:17,950 --> 02:27:21,550
He was talking about Cain Velasquez. He
was like, yeah, he's the best of all time.

2405
02:27:21,551 --> 02:27:25,720
Yeah, he's awesome and fade or, yeah,
he was fucking amazing in his prime.

2406
02:27:25,721 --> 02:27:29,110
And probably Oh nice,
right hand. But he goes,

2407
02:27:29,111 --> 02:27:32,200
he would have been even better if he
lost that. But I disagree. I disagree.

2408
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:36,460
I think you need some body fat.
It listen. And like I said,

2409
02:27:36,461 --> 02:27:39,840
we all love Mike Dolce. It's not
a bodybuilding competition. If,

2410
02:27:39,841 --> 02:27:42,460
if fate or Cain Velasquez
had both had six packs,

2411
02:27:42,461 --> 02:27:44,800
they wouldn't have the same cardio.
That's interesting.

2412
02:27:44,890 --> 02:27:47,830
I think you need some of that
fat halfs on that cardio.

2413
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:53,280
But when you're trying to cut weight,
uh, Dan heavyweights on 35 heavyweights.

2414
02:27:53,281 --> 02:27:55,900
Yeah, for sure. So why don't
we tango, wait a second.

2415
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:59,590
I have the best card in the game. Let
me change my diet and get the six pack.

2416
02:27:59,591 --> 02:28:01,930
Cause Dolce thinks I
need to be less or fat.

2417
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:05,530
Plus he's going to alienate a lot of
people that love Roy Nelson because Roy

2418
02:28:05,530 --> 02:28:09,560
Nelson looks at the average American,
oh shit.

2419
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:13,930
Oh boy.
Like that mark.

2420
02:28:13,970 --> 02:28:18,310
Oh Roy Nelson fires back.
This is what Roy wants, man.

2421
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:22,100
Man. If you didn't know Roy Nelson
was a UFC fighter and you saw that

2422
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,960
Dubai, a swearing pool, and
you talk shit to him, Bro,

2423
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:29,150
fucking colossal mistake. That
would be a huge, instead of,

2424
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:33,770
Oh my God,

2425
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:38,170
Oh my God,
a bad

2426
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:41,710
mother.
Oh my God,

2427
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:48,470
I've never seen that. Never Seen Ryan
else and take a shower. Holy Shit.

2428
02:28:48,471 --> 02:28:53,180
Wow. No, that's fucking scary.
What do you mean? Oh No,

2429
02:28:53,181 --> 02:28:57,160
you hate mar hunt. No, I'm just
saying. Wow. That was crazy. He said,

2430
02:28:58,090 --> 02:29:01,110
no,

2431
02:29:07,290 --> 02:29:11,500
no, no. Mark Hump walks away
to halo. How he does that,

2432
02:29:11,550 --> 02:29:15,380
that walk away. He's done that to
three dudes. Now how expansive this,

2433
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:19,370
Ooh.
Cheers.

2434
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:23,960
Mark Hunt is the king of the walkaway.
Kao He tripped right there looking at it,

2435
02:29:23,961 --> 02:29:28,420
but that's the referee gotten to watch it
again. The referee pushed him. Bullshit.

2436
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:31,700
Watches the fucking referee.

2437
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:37,850
Sowhat hey,
we should have blocked the rough,

2438
02:29:38,390 --> 02:29:41,470
but a foreign minister and the

2439
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:48,560
referee room. Beautiful.
Crazy, beautiful walk off.

2440
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:50,390
K got caught right in the chin.
Well,

2441
02:29:50,391 --> 02:29:54,890
he got caught by one of the best
strikers in MMA period. Hardest by far,

2442
02:29:54,891 --> 02:29:59,180
the serious heavyweight fighters.
Nobody moves.

2443
02:29:59,181 --> 02:30:00,720
I can with the scissors or juniors

2444
02:30:03,410 --> 02:30:06,320
junior harder than cane.
100% but he moves so smooth.

2445
02:30:06,321 --> 02:30:11,180
He moves like a big black
guy. Right? Oh Wow. Wow.

2446
02:30:11,181 --> 02:30:13,040
Yeah. That's all you Doug cream. No,

2447
02:30:13,050 --> 02:30:16,350
but you know what I'm talking about
talking about green. No money.

2448
02:30:17,050 --> 02:30:20,870
Roy's no professionally,
professionally,

2449
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:25,370
but he moved like a brother.
Well, I think what Samoans,

2450
02:30:25,470 --> 02:30:27,920
you know have one of the
things that they like.

2451
02:30:28,130 --> 02:30:30,620
There's so many guys like
David [inaudible], Mark Hunt,

2452
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:35,950
they have incredible ability to generate
power beast like David to do you

2453
02:30:36,291 --> 02:30:39,680
remember David too? When he's
his primary John Ruiz. Jesus.

2454
02:30:39,690 --> 02:30:41,490
Fuck Louisa's.

2455
02:30:42,110 --> 02:30:45,360
He had this Jesus,
Louise,

2456
02:30:45,361 --> 02:30:48,230
and no one has a bigger fucking jaw,

2457
02:30:48,290 --> 02:30:52,660
like who's got like a wider
mount Rushmore jaw and Mark Hunt.

2458
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:54,710
He takes a tremendous bomb.
How old is he?

2459
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:58,390
I think he's like 38 or 39 or
something like that. Every bit of it.

2460
02:30:58,630 --> 02:31:01,060
38 thank you.
Jesus.

2461
02:31:08,260 --> 02:31:09,220
He looks 29

2462
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:15,100
is that Chinese tomorrow or next week?
He's in his fucking prime. That's,

2463
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:15,953
that's a fact.

2464
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:21,150
Top 10 opponent is hurting
heavyweight out there.

2465
02:31:21,151 --> 02:31:23,220
You got your sights set on that.
You'd like to fight back.

2466
02:31:31,470 --> 02:31:33,060
It's about Ya'll.
My little buddy,

2467
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:40,640
he's a great guy.
I hung out with them in the airport,

2468
02:31:40,641 --> 02:31:43,880
him and his training partner.
He's a sweetheart, really,

2469
02:31:43,881 --> 02:31:46,640
really fun guy to hang out with
and talk to him. Very friendly.

2470
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:52,880
It's so common there. You know what
you were saying earlier about him,

2471
02:31:52,881 --> 02:31:55,460
about his career being in.
Here's one further.

2472
02:31:56,060 --> 02:32:00,740
When he first got signed by the UFC,
like they had a strike force contract.

2473
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:03,530
They didn't want to honor it,
and he did his pride contract.

2474
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:05,850
They didn't want to honor
his pride contract and not,

2475
02:32:05,890 --> 02:32:08,510
not that they didn't want to honor it,
but they didn't want him to fight.

2476
02:32:08,511 --> 02:32:11,330
They wanted to pay him off and
he said, no, I want to fight.

2477
02:32:11,710 --> 02:32:15,290
Not that they want to honor. Of course
they would honor any contract, but he did.

2478
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:20,340
They didn't think that. He was like, you
know, UFC material. What's happening?

2479
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:24,430
What's going on? They didn't think he
was UFC material. We thought, you know,

2480
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:26,960
he'd lost a few guys and he said,
look, I want to prove it to you.

2481
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:31,010
And then he loses his first fight and
fuck and they give them a second chance

2482
02:32:31,470 --> 02:32:35,680
and then man on a row. Super
impressive. That was insane.

2483
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:38,250
He lost how many straight?
Well,

2484
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:43,050
he lost to McCorkell and then he loves
to tell that to junior dos Santos,

2485
02:32:43,051 --> 02:32:45,540
is that the next loss or
was there a loss in Magento?

2486
02:32:45,541 --> 02:32:49,650
He lost to McCorkell than he did.
He lose that decision in Denver.

2487
02:32:50,490 --> 02:32:54,960
That's a good question. Did he
beat Brendan Schaub? I mean, not,

2488
02:32:54,961 --> 02:32:59,640
not burning sharp. He's right here.
Ben Rothwell, Ben Rothwell in Denver.

2489
02:32:59,641 --> 02:33:04,520
I forget. I knows a decision. Let
me pull it up. Mark Hunt. That damn,

2490
02:33:04,530 --> 02:33:09,480
I've never seen really get taken out like
that. Fuck. That was beautiful, man. Dude.

2491
02:33:09,481 --> 02:33:13,500
That shit was beautiful. Dope ass
picture on Wikipedia. You guys,

2492
02:33:13,501 --> 02:33:18,210
have you guys seen Josh Barnett and
a hand out do a scene from Brokeback

2493
02:33:18,211 --> 02:33:22,890
mountain? No, of course. I haven't
seen it. Have you seen it? No.

2494
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:23,970
Oh my God.

2495
02:33:23,971 --> 02:33:28,971
Did go hand out the [inaudible] show
episode for Josh Barnett and out the load

2496
02:33:29,290 --> 02:33:34,110
Anja doing a scene from Brokeback
mountain. It's branding.

2497
02:33:34,250 --> 02:33:38,610
What did I say?
I said we need to restart reenacting.

2498
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:42,900
The Silva fight was a draw, but wasn't
that fight changed because of the,

2499
02:33:42,901 --> 02:33:47,901
the drug thing then like
they disqualify who draw.

2500
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:51,300
So there's no, there's no winter
though. Is that what it was?

2501
02:33:51,301 --> 02:33:55,620
His draw big money and bonus
money for the fight of the night.

2502
02:33:55,621 --> 02:33:58,680
So he lost junior scientists before that.
He'd beat Stephan's true check Congo,

2503
02:33:58,681 --> 02:34:02,020
Ben Rothwell and tuck shirts.
So there's McCorkle was the last,

2504
02:34:02,021 --> 02:34:05,880
just the one that won for neuro and then
he fought Dosantos and then he had the

2505
02:34:05,881 --> 02:34:09,300
war with bigfoot shitload. Right?

2506
02:34:09,301 --> 02:34:11,790
Get that [inaudible]
two, three, four, five.

2507
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:15,770
He lost six in a row to the
gets submitted by Musashi.

2508
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:19,060
We get the guys who was filed by a
man who get the guys who was fighting.

2509
02:34:20,610 --> 02:34:23,920
Josh Barnett fader was an
interesting fight, man.

2510
02:34:23,921 --> 02:34:28,220
Remember when he had fade
or in an arm lock? Remember
that? I forget and I'm like,

2511
02:34:28,221 --> 02:34:31,530
you're Kamora, but he couldn't finish
it. Those are some and Josh Barnett,

2512
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:35,690
those early days though, he's a
pure striker, no nothing. You know,

2513
02:34:35,740 --> 02:34:37,990
they didn't know what he was doing.
He was learning,

2514
02:34:38,020 --> 02:34:42,860
but he beat Mirko Cro cop in his
prime t Vandelay Silva man. He,

2515
02:34:42,910 --> 02:34:43,241
he,
you know,

2516
02:34:43,241 --> 02:34:46,510
a lot of people think he was the guy that
ruined Vandelay cause Vandelay fought

2517
02:34:46,511 --> 02:34:49,870
him as a heavyweight and at
Vandelay was the 203 pound champion.

2518
02:34:49,871 --> 02:34:52,930
He was fucking everybody up at two
oh three and went up and fought.

2519
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:55,900
And he actually thinks, I
believe, if I remember correctly,

2520
02:34:55,901 --> 02:34:58,720
he was light when he fought, um, hunt.

2521
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:03,280
I think he was only like one 99
and he fought hunt white for him.

2522
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:06,040
Like when he fought cro cop, he
was super heavy. He was like,

2523
02:35:06,190 --> 02:35:09,220
he was heavier than Cro cop,
if I remember correctly,

2524
02:35:09,221 --> 02:35:13,270
Vandelay was like two 18
and cro cop was two 14. Wow.

2525
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:17,920
Vandelay was just said the cro cop is
the strongest guy you ever felt, right?

2526
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:18,833
Yeah.

2527
02:35:19,570 --> 02:35:24,130
What did you weigh when you fought
him to 21 or something like that too?

2528
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:28,970
Maybe that way he was he to 40
[inaudible] stronger than you are? Uh,

2529
02:35:29,050 --> 02:35:33,720
just like, just like so like, like
a rock couldn't move. I'm like, no.

2530
02:35:33,740 --> 02:35:36,670
You know some guys you move and
the like tilt, like kind of budge.

2531
02:35:36,730 --> 02:35:39,130
Do you think it's like, it's
like a statue. The legs,

2532
02:35:39,131 --> 02:35:42,430
like he hit the guy has giant, has a
good base. I just think he was like,

2533
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:47,200
there's no fat on them. Just like that
grown man strength when I fought him,

2534
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:49,130
you know? Yeah. You know,

2535
02:35:49,150 --> 02:35:52,780
you're talking about a guy who'd been
kickboxing for so fucking long and the,

2536
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:56,920
I think I would imagine that a guy who's
like a really strong kickboxer like a

2537
02:35:56,921 --> 02:35:58,990
hunt or like a cro cop.

2538
02:35:59,170 --> 02:36:03,250
Those guys had developed those monster
as legs and they have good balance from

2539
02:36:03,251 --> 02:36:07,540
throwing kicks and once he teach those
guys take down, take down defense,

2540
02:36:07,541 --> 02:36:11,680
it becomes very difficult. She's, they're
dealing with such a ridiculous base.

2541
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:14,230
Like Cro cop has some
giant ass fucking legs.

2542
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:19,950
You want to talk about a guy with
a ridiculous highlight reel stud.

2543
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:27,430
So tired.
Tired.

2544
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:32,250
I've just had such a long day.
Six Oh, shooting the Goldbergs.

2545
02:36:32,260 --> 02:36:36,010
I'm so cute as you shoot it today.
Yeah. Yeah. That's the fun part.

2546
02:36:36,011 --> 02:36:38,160
Do you like sucking the Dick Television?

2547
02:36:38,170 --> 02:36:41,010
Still do like playing
with television show.

2548
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:44,530
I have to say I really liked
what network is it for ABC?

2549
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:48,550
I play at the gym teacher from the
Eighties Oh my God. I can imagine.

2550
02:36:48,551 --> 02:36:51,990
It's so funny. I drink this protein
shake. I had to drink. I it's,

2551
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:55,000
it's actually was one of the best
things I've ever done. That's hilarious.

2552
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:57,280
What's the name of the
Shell? Uh, the Goldbergs.

2553
02:36:57,300 --> 02:37:02,300
It's such a funny Jeff Glennan who was
in a wedding bridesmaids and it's really

2554
02:37:04,931 --> 02:37:09,420
funny show. I heard bride is a fun part
of the shock. Yeah, it was. It really fun.

2555
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:14,410
Great movie. It's on youtube. Classic.

2556
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:16,250
What's called the Goldbergs.

2557
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:21,340
Okay. Time. No, never saw it.
It's supposed to be really funny.

2558
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:25,400
It's pretty funny movie. Amazing
movie. It tells me it's really fun.

2559
02:37:25,730 --> 02:37:28,390
It's a classic American classic.
It's fine.

2560
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:31,970
Know who else aren't seen bridesmaids?
Al Qaeda.

2561
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:35,060
Isis fucking seen bridesmaids,
man.

2562
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:40,090
[inaudible] American don't
see fucking bridesmaids.

2563
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:46,760
No, it in, it's been about three
years ago. You live in America.

2564
02:37:46,761 --> 02:37:49,840
It's bridesmaids was a huge hit.
Huge,

2565
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:54,370
huge terrorist. It's a great,
it's actually a really good movie.

2566
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:56,780
I liked the winter soldier,
Captain America.

2567
02:37:56,781 --> 02:38:00,350
I saw it recently know the last funny
movie that I saw was, was this at the end?

2568
02:38:01,970 --> 02:38:06,200
Pretty fucking hilarious and
funny. How funny. The fucking,

2569
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:08,150
what's the dude from eastbound and down?

2570
02:38:12,830 --> 02:38:17,330
Have you seen that this character did
awesome.

2571
02:38:17,331 --> 02:38:18,164

Spoiler alert. It's a million
o'clock. Nobody's out.

2574
02:38:32,991 --> 02:38:35,600
People get mad at me for
fucking spoilers for fights.

2575
02:38:35,601 --> 02:38:38,390
It happened like the day
before. I'll say, oh,

2576
02:38:38,391 --> 02:38:42,260
I just finally got around to

Through
your online shithead.

2578
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:51,670
You're online. You're reading the Twitter,
fucking MMA common data for the UFC.

2579
02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:54,530
What did you think was coming your way?
Stupid.

2580
02:38:54,531 --> 02:38:56,180
You're looking for
flower arrangement tips.

2581
02:38:57,140 --> 02:39:00,020
I'm going to talk about why you
want my fucking Twitter feed.

2582
02:39:00,110 --> 02:39:03,560
Do you go on MMA weekly, Twitter
feed to and go, Whoa, spoiler alert.

2583
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,260
You know what has to hurt
people's feelings when?

2584
02:39:07,430 --> 02:39:10,810
When I see you talk shit
to one 20 you'll dummy. Oh,

2585
02:39:12,020 --> 02:39:15,500
that's something you and I talked about
long time ago or like that's the most

2586
02:39:15,501 --> 02:39:19,700
thing. That was my, remember this sound
nice when you call somebody a simple name.

2587
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,390
I almost cut this guy off and be that guy
who this huge guys looking at me and I

2588
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:28,940
and I and I, and I pull up next to him
and he goes, you got a fucking problem.

2589
02:39:29,210 --> 02:39:33,280
And he was this really big giant guy,
fat. Really me. I looked at him, he goes,

2590
02:39:33,650 --> 02:39:38,120
and I go, what? And he goes, you got
our fucking problem, man. And I go,

2591
02:39:38,930 --> 02:39:41,570
you're fat.
He goes,

2592
02:39:42,730 --> 02:39:46,260
I just drove away like little car,
little insults like that.

2593
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:49,420
There's dumb or you're fat.
I would just start Lauer.

2594
02:39:49,670 --> 02:39:52,570
Those are flat pulled up to someone and
said, hey man, you got a fucking problem.

2595
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:56,680
He goes, you're fat. I'd be like, ah,
you fuck. But it hurt my feelings.

2596
02:39:56,690 --> 02:40:01,500
If they're like, you're a fucking dummy,
dummy, dummy. You fuck you did that.

2597
02:40:01,501 --> 02:40:04,970
This girl was talking, man.
Some people are dummies.

2598
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:09,830
I did do it to a girl's talking to show.
Yup. Heckler. You went no, no, no, no, no.

2599
02:40:10,130 --> 02:40:15,050
Your dog.
That's more than once.

2600
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:15,893
I'm not sure what

2601
02:40:19,270 --> 02:40:22,030
your dog,
your dog.

2602
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:25,500
That was a real problem with fucking
doing standup at the comedy store.

2603
02:40:25,590 --> 02:40:29,320
There's nobody, nobody does the
crowd. Nobody takes care of the crowd.

2604
02:40:29,321 --> 02:40:33,150
So you were constantly comic.
Shouldn't have to deal with that shit.

2605
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:35,190
That shit should all be
done by like bouncers.

2606
02:40:35,191 --> 02:40:38,850
They should have any improv you
go to that never gets out of hand.

2607
02:40:38,851 --> 02:40:41,700
They squash that shit like that.
They know what they're doing.

2608
02:40:41,730 --> 02:40:45,520
I think I can tell the
story. What happened tonight.
Tonight. What happened? Yeah.

2609
02:40:46,220 --> 02:40:47,910
Uh,
I was at,

2610
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,360
I was at the laugh factory and there was
a dude in the front row talking like an

2611
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:56,370
asshole and to the point where I, I, I
kicked his leg a little bit. I went, hey,

2612
02:40:56,510 --> 02:40:59,010
you got to shut up in the middle of my
set. And I go, hey, you got to shut up.

2613
02:40:59,010 --> 02:41:02,880
And he goes, oh, sorry, sorry. And then
he kept talking. I went to, I said,

2614
02:41:02,881 --> 02:41:06,420
it was fine.
It went well and Dane,

2615
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:11,750
Dane Cook follows me and I'm watching
Dane and the guy is doing the same thing

2616
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:17,340
and Dane literally at literally in
the middle of it went like this.

2617
02:41:17,341 --> 02:41:20,430
He just and tweet, if I'm
exaggerating, Dang goes,

2618
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:25,790
you shut the fuck up right fucking
now or I will knock you the fuck out.

2619
02:41:26,290 --> 02:41:28,050
You say one more fucking word.

2620
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:31,500
I'm going to knock you out and
send you the fuck out of here.

2621
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:36,710
Like right and cooks when do it some
time back the fucking show you asshole.

2622
02:41:37,090 --> 02:41:40,140
Yeah. And the whole place started clapping
the whole, cause the guy was so great.

2623
02:41:40,141 --> 02:41:42,600
Would it be if the guy stood
up and whoop, Dang. I was like,

2624
02:41:42,601 --> 02:41:45,420
I was like Dane in front of
everybody was ready to go.

2625
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:49,230
That guy was a plant put by
Jamie Masada. He's like, Dan,

2626
02:41:49,290 --> 02:41:53,850
cookie's going to be on a one to two
warm up with blind Kalin. You Go,

2627
02:41:53,910 --> 02:41:57,390
you tell a joke, you talk
to good, you speak on phone.

2628
02:41:57,720 --> 02:42:01,470
And then when Dane Cook come
on, he be so mad. He's like,

2629
02:42:01,471 --> 02:42:04,350
this fucking guy heckled me.
I'm Dane Cook.

2630
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:06,510
And then we get on TMZ,

2631
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:10,950
10 guys and the bad zoom
Assata uploading it to youtube.

2632
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:14,250
I'm sure somebody videotaped Brian.
Do me a favor.

2633
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:18,720
Tell them the dream you had that you
told me. I tell them the dream thing.

2634
02:42:18,721 --> 02:42:22,330
It's you telling me if this is normal,
I think it's appropriate. Okay. I had,

2635
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:26,880
this is my business partner and listened
to this dream. I had a boyfriend. Okay,

2636
02:42:26,881 --> 02:42:28,210
that's not Martin Luther King

2637
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:37,620
and what were you doing?
And they'll listen to this shit.

2638
02:42:37,621 --> 02:42:41,730
Any fucking me get a dream. He was having
sex with a man. Well, I'm glad you,

2639
02:42:41,830 --> 02:42:46,200
you told me this after I told Steve
Rinella that I don't want to share a tent

2640
02:42:46,201 --> 02:42:50,450
with you because he asked me. He goes,
is it okay if you're sure Taylor, Brian,

2641
02:42:50,490 --> 02:42:55,370
fuck yeah, I do. I still like a werewolf
or anybody. You look like a snooze.

2642
02:42:55,390 --> 02:42:59,130
I'm assuming you don't know. I have
an irregular NASA. Craziest, craziest,

2643
02:42:59,131 --> 02:43:03,030
loudest snore. I thought
you recall that. Mouthpiece.

2644
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:06,000
Mouthpiece of a new mouth
when we went hunting

2645
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:12,130
third or fourth version
up fitting, right, man,

2646
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:15,430
I kept falling off. Yeah, I kept
falling out, but the new one is,

2647
02:43:15,431 --> 02:43:18,400
it's uncomfortable, but it fits great
and it keeps my tongue in place.

2648
02:43:18,401 --> 02:43:22,280
Makes no sound. It looks like I sleep
like a baby. I make no sound. Right.

2649
02:43:22,281 --> 02:43:27,010
And then finish your gay story though.
I see. I'm sorry about scoring.

2650
02:43:27,011 --> 02:43:29,050
And I was like, and I was
like, I'm straight man,

2651
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:31,630
and I have a boyfriend
and this guy keeps fucking

2652
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:40,090
crazy shit and this guy's fucking
me and I got to keep this a secret.

2653
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:43,950
I'm not sure how to make sense of this.
That's a bit

2654
02:43:46,910 --> 02:43:50,260
dead serious. When he told me this and
I literally just looking at what it is,

2655
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:53,260
bro, next hour, it's gallery, right?

2656
02:43:55,420 --> 02:43:56,530
Write it down,
write down,

2657
02:43:57,710 --> 02:44:01,180
these are endless with this drain
can go wherever. Have you guys

2658
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:07,050
ever in my life, dude. I was
like, and I was like the guy,

2659
02:44:07,060 --> 02:44:11,170
but he had a back on them and I
was like, damn man. And I remember

2660
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:16,480
I didn't say this party cocktails,

2661
02:44:16,570 --> 02:44:19,720
we're having cocktails and I was looking
at Raga, I fucked this guy again.

2662
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:26,130
I
slide.

2663
02:44:27,490 --> 02:44:31,810
Yeah,
Fuck Shit.

2664
02:44:32,460 --> 02:44:37,090
It was crazy straight,
man. I'm fucking straight

2665
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:44,270
disturbing how many jokes you
have like arguing your sexuality.

2666
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:48,580
I know like a big part of your
act as arguing your sexuality.

2667
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:51,550
I was like 50% gain.
I issue

2668
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:56,750
you got Brody Stevens up
to 84% started the podcast.

2669
02:44:56,980 --> 02:44:59,300
It's was probably 10% gay but outcast.

2670
02:44:59,490 --> 02:45:04,230
He told me he was 84% Thailand's.
He said 15% after that dream.

2671
02:45:04,231 --> 02:45:08,760
I said full 50% you think you're gay?
No, a little bit and now I wish her well,

2672
02:45:08,761 --> 02:45:11,700
we went on when we went,
when we went hunting,

2673
02:45:11,701 --> 02:45:15,480
we were gone for six the first time
we were gone for six days in Montana.

2674
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:19,620
Second time we were gone for five days in
Wisconsin. That's 11 days at gay jokes.

2675
02:45:19,950 --> 02:45:23,400
I mean, the kid is relentless.
It never stops coming.

2676
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:26,670
It's a storm of locusts that there's,
there's no end.

2677
02:45:27,010 --> 02:45:30,830
It shows up on satellite satellite.
It's like

2678
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:36,000
crops die.
Rivers show the fucking,

2679
02:45:36,030 --> 02:45:38,700
the rivers get choked
leaving like there's no,

2680
02:45:38,740 --> 02:45:40,970
no one ever get tired of farmlands.

2681
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:44,670
Crops dry up there actually
something with that,

2682
02:45:44,671 --> 02:45:47,070
you know who is actually more
obsessed with male beauty.

2683
02:45:47,071 --> 02:45:51,420
Then Brian Count as big shit here. Akiyama
well, yeah. I mean that's my boyfriend,

2684
02:45:51,421 --> 02:45:55,680
but big brown, big brown. Big Brown is,
don't try and push it on me. Yeah, but

2685
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,980
you're,
you're a track

2686
02:45:59,030 --> 02:46:04,020
your dream. You had sex with a man. No
one else has that shit here. That's weird.

2687
02:46:04,050 --> 02:46:04,470
Brian,

2688
02:46:04,470 --> 02:46:06,270
why are you saying that
he's attracted to men?

2689
02:46:06,271 --> 02:46:10,040
Because you're attracted to men too. Are
you attractive? You're attractive, right?

2690
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:13,480
I would imagine you're attractive guy.
I'm a cutie pie. You're beautiful men,

2691
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:17,600
not that right now.
He looks like that's a good mood.

2692
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:22,700
I've never seen you look so tired.
This is how guys are like,

2693
02:46:22,701 --> 02:46:25,810
Brendan gave me his cold. I was
around is called. I had to go.

2694
02:46:25,830 --> 02:46:27,670
I was sick as shit or two weeks.
It's crazy.

2695
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:30,200
I had a performance San Antonio
and I'm dying. I'm like,

2696
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:34,490
I'm just slogging through and I
call him. I go, Bro. I go. He goes,

2697
02:46:34,491 --> 02:46:37,790
how are you doing? I go, I'm not doing
well, man. I'm sick and I got to,

2698
02:46:37,791 --> 02:46:41,360
I got two shows tonight and you gave me
your call and this is what I hear on the

2699
02:46:41,361 --> 02:46:44,900
other end. The phone [inaudible]
I mean, you were dying.

2700
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:50,360
We told you guys get acute cold. I got
in his fucking chicks think that's funny.

2701
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:54,530
No it guys love it. Then I got in his
fucking Prius. I get in there and he goes,

2702
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:59,630
I'm sick of shininess. I'm
never sick. Spray céline
solution his nose. And he goes,

2703
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:03,830
this is why. Two days later, two
days later, he's sick as fuck.

2704
02:47:03,831 --> 02:47:07,430
Kept telling me this for weeks. All
I heard from him was, there's a wait.

2705
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:11,540
You never get sick. I don't get sick
anymore. I spray the sailing solution.

2706
02:47:12,770 --> 02:47:17,210
Yeah, he got time. They got my
cold. So four days later I go, yeah,

2707
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:20,810
throat starting to hurt now moving down
to your chest. He goes, yeah. I said,

2708
02:47:20,811 --> 02:47:25,190
enjoy that for about another eight days.
I was sick. I wasn't sleeping. That's why

2709
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:32,570
your immune system so superior to the
average man. Thank you for saying that.

2710
02:47:32,930 --> 02:47:35,270
It's dear crush, crush all
disease. Well, you know,

2711
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:38,450
eats a lot of heartbreak and I meditate,

2712
02:47:38,810 --> 02:47:43,280
eat factory farmed fish,
nothing from the ocean.

2713
02:47:43,340 --> 02:47:44,480
I'm God's favorite too.

2714
02:47:44,481 --> 02:47:49,481
That helps even even as even as Brazilian
character is it gay Brazilian carrot

2715
02:47:53,210 --> 02:47:58,160
here. That was one of the most
hilarious moments of our life.

2716
02:47:59,150 --> 02:48:00,350
You got to write that down.

2717
02:48:00,351 --> 02:48:03,740
Take that sheet of paper off the top
and that I had a dream that I had a

2718
02:48:03,741 --> 02:48:08,240
boyfriend and he wants and he was
fucking me for Joe. Joe Rogan,

2719
02:48:08,330 --> 02:48:11,670
my snog of her. Thanks for the
idea. I had a dream. I had a boy.

2720
02:48:12,310 --> 02:48:16,280
Fucking good. Fold that up.
The best part when you go,

2721
02:48:16,281 --> 02:48:17,730
I gotta fuck this guy later.

2722
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:22,590
I know you guys to get fuck.
You must tell them.

2723
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:27,350
Just go hit a back. I remember his
back was very wide and he's fucked.

2724
02:48:27,351 --> 02:48:28,360
She throughout the dream

2725
02:48:31,730 --> 02:48:34,640
and there's nothing he could do because
it gives me like running and sometimes

2726
02:48:34,641 --> 02:48:38,440
you do run but you're like in
slow motion like it in the drain.

2727
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:40,890
I'm trying to shoot straight. It
should pull. It goes really slow.

2728
02:48:40,891 --> 02:48:44,330
Your rabbit gun and you shoot
the gun falls upon the slow

2729
02:48:46,550 --> 02:48:50,270
sample is like everyone likes never work.

2730
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:53,450
You know when you see a movie that's
really scary and you feel that,

2731
02:48:53,690 --> 02:48:57,080
that chill up your spine where
you're like, fuck, this is scary.

2732
02:48:57,170 --> 02:49:01,550
Like you're so uncomfortable and scared.
Sex with the guy felt the same way.

2733
02:49:01,551 --> 02:49:05,760
I was like this fucking song,
but God do it.

2734
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:09,450
All of us are dreaming.
Running brides like yeah,

2735
02:49:09,451 --> 02:49:14,130
you have that junior jack and a guy off
super slow and it just never ends in

2736
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:21,900
every now and then. Throwing that you
tried to escape when you had the gun.

2737
02:49:28,060 --> 02:49:31,460
They represented the,
the mistakes of my go.

2738
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:36,930
You're in your underwear like
wherever you go. It's freezing cold,

2739
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:39,730
but we had a cuddle this

2740
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:48,330
gay shit naked. I was treating
his frostbite while he was fucking

2741
02:49:51,030 --> 02:49:52,440
mosquitoes and hard on,

2742
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:58,940
oh my God, listen, we ran out of time.

2743
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,860
We're three hours in shit pop on some
powerful Mark Hunt. Congratulations.

2744
02:50:02,890 --> 02:50:06,410
Mark Hunt. Yeah. That
was fucking phenomenal.

2745
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:10,750
Materializing, right? Kind
of saw it materializing.

2746
02:50:10,751 --> 02:50:14,960
So how smooth he was the only guy in
this room who has to actually contemplate

2747
02:50:14,961 --> 02:50:17,130
fight.
That guy is breading shrouds

2748
02:50:19,460 --> 02:50:21,750
these deep 40, she'll
Maddie, if I'm talking,

2749
02:50:21,870 --> 02:50:25,670
I'm sure if I be Travis brown he could
be next. Let's get through Travis.

2750
02:50:25,671 --> 02:50:29,760
That's crazy job. You have crazy.
Do they want to be a fighter? Oh,

2751
02:50:29,900 --> 02:50:31,280
there's only a couple
of more minutes to go.

2752
02:50:31,281 --> 02:50:36,020
But if you had to think of like this
Travis Brown situation where he leaves

2753
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:38,030
Jackson's and now he's
treated with Edmond,

2754
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:43,360
is that a good thing or do you think
that that shows any sign of like,

2755
02:50:44,030 --> 02:50:46,850
you know, sometimes people were
in a state of turmoil, you know,

2756
02:50:46,851 --> 02:50:48,290
they feel like they need to change,

2757
02:50:48,291 --> 02:50:51,170
they lose a little bit of confidence
and they try to switch things up.

2758
02:50:51,350 --> 02:50:52,700
Is it good to switch things up?

2759
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:57,590
I can be good list and I moved to La
and switch things up. Um, obviously,

2760
02:50:58,280 --> 02:51:02,830
uh, my know Rhonda very well
and I know that camp pretty
well, I would say. And, uh,

2761
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:04,610
I'm not going to go into detail,

2762
02:51:04,611 --> 02:51:06,890
but I think it's a great thing
for me that he's trading there.

2763
02:51:06,920 --> 02:51:11,060
I'll put it like that without going
into detail. Did you just say,

2764
02:51:12,470 --> 02:51:16,050
can you
think for him?

2765
02:51:17,690 --> 02:51:20,270
That's what he said. Whoa.
He would say that though.

2766
02:51:20,271 --> 02:51:22,880
Even if he didn't even mean it.
Not, I promise I went, I would say,

2767
02:51:22,940 --> 02:51:27,230
I just want to say Shit, I'm 100% dead.
Seriously? Do I have no reason. You know?

2768
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:31,010
You know what?
They made a mistake by going 100% whoa.

2769
02:51:31,670 --> 02:51:36,590
What if he hears us and changes
his mind? Don't give a fuck. Wow.

2770
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:41,180
Brendan. Brendan, I'm not worried about
Aurora. I'm not worried about him. Yeah.

2771
02:51:42,270 --> 02:51:45,410
Did you used to train?
There were no where he's training.

2772
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:48,470
He never trained with note what he's
doing? Nope. Never trained with the admin.

2773
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:50,060
But you did do country might have,

2774
02:51:50,061 --> 02:51:53,240
like you might have someone telling you
how they're training because you know,

2775
02:51:53,241 --> 02:51:56,960
not at all. Not at all. Not
You mean? Nope, not even
close. I would never do that.

2776
02:51:57,860 --> 02:52:01,470
So you know what the training is like
at Jackson's? You know, it's like,

2777
02:52:01,471 --> 02:52:04,970
it's a pretty high level training and he
decided to leave that Jacqueline's has

2778
02:52:04,990 --> 02:52:06,220
traded partners for days.

2779
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,770
Can I just speculate?
Can you speculate?

2780
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:12,340
Do you think there was any issue with
the fact that Overeem came into the camp?

2781
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:16,390
No, not at all. Not at all. No. Travis
beat him. We'll never find them again.

2782
02:52:16,391 --> 02:52:18,700
I don't think that anything to do
with it easily find them again though.

2783
02:52:18,730 --> 02:52:23,010
That could happen. Nah, you don't think
so? No. Never. They would never do it.

2784
02:52:24,160 --> 02:52:28,190
Number three, let's say.
Yeah, no. Well, I'm a man.

2785
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:31,660
There's a chance. Yes.
Rankings don't mean shit. Yes.

2786
02:52:31,780 --> 02:52:35,320
But the chance of them finding again,
them doing rematches or not good,

2787
02:52:35,321 --> 02:52:38,770
unless you're at a very high level or
here's my opinion. I completely disagree.

2788
02:52:39,010 --> 02:52:41,980
And one of the reasons I completely
disagree is that the delivery with the

2789
02:52:42,010 --> 02:52:46,180
vision, the depth of the
heavyweight division is not
that there's not that broad.

2790
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:49,480
I mean there's not that many trains
with Andre Arlovski. Yeah, it's true.

2791
02:52:49,510 --> 02:52:51,970
So you think he was just like,
fuck it, I'm out of here, but look,

2792
02:52:51,971 --> 02:52:55,420
because our Lawsky stays in our
lost keys fighting over him,

2793
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:57,430
or lambskin Overeem are in the same camp.

2794
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:00,210
Just because they're both heavy weights.
It doesn't mean to,

2795
02:53:00,211 --> 02:53:01,450
Travis Browne agrees with that.

2796
02:53:01,720 --> 02:53:05,140
So Travis Browne could have been the
situation where he felt like he was one of

2797
02:53:05,141 --> 02:53:09,040
the top heavyweights in camp. He beat
Overeem, then all sudden ovary moves in.

2798
02:53:09,490 --> 02:53:12,820
And then on top of that he
loses the fight with VRE doom.

2799
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:14,560
He doesn't like how he felt in that fight.

2800
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:16,450
Feels like you need to add
some things to his game.

2801
02:53:16,690 --> 02:53:19,240
And one of the things that he said,
he said he didn't know how to fight.

2802
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:21,310
He said he knew how to go
out there and fuck guys up,

2803
02:53:21,311 --> 02:53:23,950
but he didn't know how to fight like
the technical aspects of fighting,

2804
02:53:24,370 --> 02:53:27,430
which is kind of, you know, it's
interesting saying that when he's like,

2805
02:53:27,610 --> 02:53:29,020
you're dealing with Mike Winkeljohn,

2806
02:53:29,021 --> 02:53:31,480
you know there's like an
outstanding striking coach.

2807
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:33,610
Like one of the best
in the world we called.

2808
02:53:33,690 --> 02:53:36,610
I've seen Winkeljohn cause the monster.
So wizard.

2809
02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:41,080
So Travis is working with him and then
he goes from that saying that he really

2810
02:53:41,081 --> 02:53:43,780
didn't know how to fight. And Edmund
is teaching them how to fight. I mean,

2811
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:46,750
it's interesting. Well, look what
Edmonds done for Rhonda. He's,

2812
02:53:46,810 --> 02:53:50,050
she wasn't negative,
a striker and the Tam and all of a sudden,

2813
02:53:50,110 --> 02:53:54,430
all of a sudden Rhonda can, it took her
a while because I was even doubting.

2814
02:53:54,431 --> 02:53:58,450
I was even thinking, damn, she ever
gonna be a serious threat on her feet.

2815
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:00,730
She's becoming a serious threat.

2816
02:54:00,731 --> 02:54:04,000
Fuck can at the rate she's going another
couple of years, two or three years,

2817
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:07,320
Rhonda might just stay standing
for a while longer. You know,

2818
02:54:07,330 --> 02:54:10,570
that's that chocolate dealt type thing.
You know, if you can't take her down,

2819
02:54:10,571 --> 02:54:11,410
what the fuck are you going to do?

2820
02:54:11,410 --> 02:54:14,590
If she could knock you out in the feed
when Rhonda blasted Sarah McMahon,

2821
02:54:14,591 --> 02:54:18,990
would that need of the body? That sense?
That was a big fucking message. You know,

2822
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:23,110
that was a big message. Samak last
time we were here you said you didn't,

2823
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:27,610
you didn't feel that Rhonda
Cyborg was a good, uh, uh,

2824
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:30,520
like you weren't happy about
that potential matchup.

2825
02:54:30,920 --> 02:54:35,680
Have you changed since then because of
all of that? Has there been anything?

2826
02:54:35,710 --> 02:54:36,191
I just don't,

2827
02:54:36,191 --> 02:54:40,440
I just don't think you would be good
for the UFC with Cyborg history,

2828
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:45,190
with steroids and, and, and Ronda
being very pretty and being in movies,

2829
02:54:45,310 --> 02:54:48,310
it's not going to be good if she were to
lose to Cyborg. That's all I'm saying.

2830
02:54:48,311 --> 02:54:49,720
I think Cyborg is a great fighter.

2831
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:53,080
I don't think as a marketing standpoint
and for the future of the UFC.

2832
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:54,970
Cyborg is your champ is a good thing.

2833
02:54:55,060 --> 02:54:58,530
Do you think that she should
be out forever because of
the fact that she did? Uh,

2834
02:54:59,870 --> 02:55:02,210
she keeps winning.
She keeps winning and I'd give her a shot.

2835
02:55:02,211 --> 02:55:03,890
She's got to have a shout.
The time everyone

2836
02:55:04,110 --> 02:55:06,020
see how she feels almost got fucking shot.

2837
02:55:07,600 --> 02:55:11,490
Cyborg is zeroed in on
Rhonda. That's all. What else?

2838
02:55:12,550 --> 02:55:16,790
Fucking but every fight. Every girl seems
like it's an evitable. Come on, Gina.

2839
02:55:16,791 --> 02:55:21,050
Carano they're like, no, it's
fine. Why don't we bring you back.

2840
02:55:21,290 --> 02:55:25,470
You tap out in like a minute or so and
we'll do all this marketing and then you

2841
02:55:25,471 --> 02:55:26,970
get out.
Everyone wants to fight Ronda.

2842
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:29,290
They know they're not going to win
the market and they get from it,

2843
02:55:29,291 --> 02:55:34,291
but saying the fight that
most MMA fans want to see MMA,

2844
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:39,050
not mainstream, but it would be,
it would be beautiful mainstream.

2845
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:44,150
All the regular. They'd be probably
behind Rhonda because cyborgs.

2846
02:55:44,540 --> 02:55:46,550
Yeah. Everyone would be
behind Ronnie. We a Cyborg.

2847
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:49,550
She had some steroid abuse before
and all that stuff, but still,

2848
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:52,850
that's what makes it an amazing fighters.
You have chickens,

2849
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:56,150
you super yolked crazy looking sheet.

2850
02:55:56,210 --> 02:56:00,950
Cyborg is the perfect nickname for
against Ronda. That pretty judo girl.

2851
02:56:01,130 --> 02:56:04,770
I think that is going to be the
fight of the millennium sidebar.

2852
02:56:04,830 --> 02:56:08,930
I don't want that anymore. She doesn't
look like that anymore. She does.

2853
02:56:08,931 --> 02:56:10,520
She looks like a strong woman now.
Yeah.

2854
02:56:10,670 --> 02:56:12,560
She just does not look like
she used to live. Well.

2855
02:56:12,590 --> 02:56:17,360
Still still stood up as far as,
as far as women's MMA,

2856
02:56:17,361 --> 02:56:21,500
that is probably the biggest money fight
right there. Yeah, that would be huge.

2857
02:56:21,580 --> 02:56:26,390
Moneywise I don't think so. Cause
more. The mainstream knows Gina.

2858
02:56:27,050 --> 02:56:30,770
The mainstream doesn't know
Cyborg and they're like, oh,

2859
02:56:30,771 --> 02:56:34,880
I don't want to see one eye on
cyber of countdown and that's over.

2860
02:56:34,881 --> 02:56:39,380
You know what I mean? It's
totally sellable. It's a
terrifying fight and it's,

2861
02:56:39,381 --> 02:56:42,080
I think it's completely sellable,
not only damn thing, it's sellable.

2862
02:56:42,230 --> 02:56:45,530
I think if she keeps winning, it's a
must. It's a must have fight. I mean,

2863
02:56:45,531 --> 02:56:48,110
I don't know if it's ever going to
take place, but if she, if Cyborg,

2864
02:56:48,111 --> 02:56:50,480
if you go back and watch the
fucking video of her beaten up,

2865
02:56:50,481 --> 02:56:54,110
Gina Carano beaten up. I talk too
much. When she found Gina, you're like,

2866
02:56:54,111 --> 02:56:58,580
what are we doing? It was like bully
beat down. You know what I'm saying?

2867
02:57:01,110 --> 02:57:03,830
What are we doing?
Do you want to be your champ?

2868
02:57:03,890 --> 02:57:06,940
You think that inspires other little
girls when they see bully, beat downs,

2869
02:57:06,941 --> 02:57:08,780
styles, sideboard, Regina, if you know,

2870
02:57:08,781 --> 02:57:12,980
if you're looking at it as a promoters
of the promoters point of view. Yes.

2871
02:57:12,981 --> 02:57:17,300
So quick. That's all. As far
as the fans, the fans go,
