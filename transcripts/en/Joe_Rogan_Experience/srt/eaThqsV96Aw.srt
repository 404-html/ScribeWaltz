1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,500
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,360
It's just like there's a lot
of dummies that we'll look at.

3
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:04,350
A guy like Mike Tyson,

4
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:05,970
I really think that they can kick his ass.

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,050
There are people that look at a guy like
you look on stage and they get upset at

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,740
you for some reason they get upset at
you for getting that attention to get

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:13,990
them,

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,810
so I feel like they should be getting it.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,990
Thank God every chair,

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,850
every time one of them have stepped up.

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,430
I had a baseball bat of jokes,

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,820
you know,

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,100
my,

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,350
my,

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:25,630
my,

16
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,070
my,

17
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,140
my reaction was always right on,

18
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,891
on time,

19
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,740
laser sharp and they was burnt
out of the audience like,

20
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,210
like a cigarette butt and he's been in
to witness it and I haven't been in the

21
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:36,511
witness.

22
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:37,081
You doing it.

23
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,780
I think you're one of the
best I've ever seen him do it.

24
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,370
You inspired me and I seen the,

25
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,340
how

26
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,630
you took it out.

27
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,081
That was like,

28
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:45,630
well I'm,

29
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,850
I could go much higher.

30
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,423
Wow.

31
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:50,770
No,

32
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,580
what I'm saying,

33
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,740
I see you evaporate.

34
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,240
People says that me.

35
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,480
That told me that it's something that you
definitely got to have as part of your

36
00:00:58,481 --> 00:00:58,871
game.

37
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,030
If you're going to be standing up
on the stage talking to people,

38
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,640
you have to have the ability to,

39
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,390
you know,

40
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,223
to do that.

41
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,261
If it comes up,

42
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:07,750
you've got to shoot them
down and keep it moving.

43
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,000
You can't be haggling
with them and you know,

44
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,220
cause that's going to break the
whole continuity of the show up.

45
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,070
The guys that can just hit him
with the hammer and keep it moving

46
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,330
best.

47
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,750
It's an unfortunate side effect of comedy,

48
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,280
but we started out freezing.

49
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,480
I were fucking comedy store veterans
man and that was a place that nobody

50
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,343
patrolled.

51
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,600
There was no manager Shush in the room
does the comedy store was run by the guy

52
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:34,470
on stage and occasionally dude's got
kicked out because the comic would go just

53
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,270
get these fucking people out of here.

54
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,980
God Damn it would get,

55
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,610
it would get to the point where it was
just you had to kick them out before the

56
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,391
show couldn't go on,

57
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,440
but there was always something
there that plays is always drama.

58
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,530
I've had glasses thrown
at me on stage there.

59
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,603
I've seen,

60
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,050
I remember when,

61
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:52,470
uh,

62
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,930
Holtzman got knocked
out by Martin Lawrence,

63
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,773
his bodyguards.

64
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,620
God Damn,

65
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,600
that place was chaos.

66
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,540
I remember that.

67
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,790
I remember Eddie Griffin,

68
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,380
we were in the main room.

69
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,131
We had a show.

70
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:09,450
It was Martin Luther King's
birthday and after the show,

71
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,401
this was the,

72
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,900
when the Dj came on,

73
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,490
this is the first time I heard this song.

74
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,780
No Vaseline.

75
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,960
Yeah.

76
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,800
And the Dj played it and Dr Dre and all
of the dog pound and it was about Dr

77
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:23,100
Jura.

78
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,461
Yeah.

79
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,241
They were all there.

80
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:24,351
And,

81
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:28,110
and dre went up on stage and
snatched the record off of the,

82
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:32,820
off the turntable and snapped it
in half and that kicked off a riot.

83
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,030
Treach was in there to
POC was in their trench.

84
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,700
Had that big change
with the padlock on it.

85
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,170
He was swinging that over his head.

86
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,250
Oh my God.

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,250
This went on in the main room on
Martin Luther King's birthday.

88
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,783
Wow.

89
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,100
I remember that.

90
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,420
Holy Shit.

91
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,510
Then my seatbelt places fucking crazy man.

92
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,810
His

93
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,560
last wave.

94
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,393
Flint,

95
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,330
there's surprise.

96
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:55,840
Laughs.

97
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Oh yeah,

98
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,233
yeah.

99
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Seeing him where there's women
out there that the counties,

100
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,630
I was in the parking lot.

101
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,220
What'd you was performing that night and
she was standing by the back door and

102
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,850
this other chick came around and it was
getting any come up about how they knew

103
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,211
each other.

104
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,070
Obviously she's,

105
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,120
she said that other chick did
not taking that to come no more.

106
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,993
Richard shows

107
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,410
every time she hit,

108
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,740
another piece of jury came off too.

109
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:21,760
When she got finished,

110
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,680
all of this women's rings and necklaces
and everything and her wig was laying on

111
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,970
and they was dragging her away man.

112
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,410
And then Richard Pride when on stage and
did 20 minutes on what just happened.

113
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,250
Classics took it straight
to the stage to stage,

114
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:40,701
to stage,

115
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,534
to stage.

116
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,280
What year was this?

117
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,310
They had to be eight in the eighties man,

118
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,710
you're like 89 90 something like that.

119
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,490
Could you imagine if you
fucking videotaped all the time

120
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,391
and that was that.

121
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:54,201
That was the only mom.

122
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,870
She said they're not taking
it to come no more of that.

123
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:56,970
Which shows pop,

124
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,330
pop,

125
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:57,600
pop,

126
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,910
pop and started firing on him.

127
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,650
How beautiful would that video be

128
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,510
to watch that watch the ass kicking to
prior walking on stage to prior talking

129
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,410
about the ass kicking to pray
all it went all three show.

130
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,753
Yeah,

131
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,700
I performed the 20 minutes on,

132
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,980
but just having outside,

133
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,700
I performed with Richard Pryor
for a few weeks right at the end.

134
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,563
Right when he was,

135
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,220
when he stopped performing,

136
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,690
when he was in a wheelchair member,

137
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:27,400
when they used to carry
him on the or room.

138
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,850
I had to go on after him for,

139
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,990
for weeks,

140
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,501
for weeks.

141
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:31,981
When he did that,

142
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:32,700
I always,

143
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:32,971
I was,

144
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:37,140
that was the only spot Mitzi always
gave me right after Richard Pryor act to

145
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,113
reach it.

146
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,300
You would,

147
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,250
you would eat dick like no other time.

148
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,480
Yeah,

149
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,530
because it wasn't,

150
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,490
it was sad.

151
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,270
It was sad watching Richard know.

152
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,513
I mean,

153
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,570
it was cool because once
Richard would open his mouth,

154
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,883
it was him.

155
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,400
I mean,

156
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,731
you know,

157
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:54,840
you could tell that he's,

158
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,470
and then it was,

159
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,800
it was a weird effect
because you'd be like,

160
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,311
oh Yo,

161
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:00,031
he's still there.

162
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,380
He's still in there.

163
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
But then you'd be like,

164
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:03,600
wait a minute,

165
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,650
he's in there.

166
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,000
That's his body now.

167
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,441
And that's what he's,

168
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:07,970
he's kind of,

169
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,140
it's,

170
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,140
it seemed like he was more in prison
after you heard him do stand up.

171
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Cause it was a realization like this is
a man who has his wits but does not have

172
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:19,581
his,

173
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:24,581
his motor skills and [inaudible] functions
as bodily functions too to match up

174
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:26,880
with his wit.

175
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,470
Right,

176
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:27,711
right,

177
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:27,930
right.

178
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,680
And that was,

179
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,513
that just was,

180
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,630
even though he was funny,

181
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:30,961
you know,

182
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:31,794
he's sharp.

183
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,790
That just,

184
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,623
it was sad.

185
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,301
Yeah,

186
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:34,710
he would,

187
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,270
it seemed to me like there was a,

188
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,460
there was a disconnect
too towards the end.

189
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:38,760
He,

190
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,440
I don't think he was completely lucid.

191
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,770
So when he would go on stage and talk
about things like they didn't always make

192
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:44,161
sense.

193
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,140
And you know,

194
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,451
was,

195
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:45,930
uh,

196
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,290
it was,

197
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:46,830
it was,

198
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,640
he was dying,

199
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,450
you know,

200
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,260
and he would get this huge
round of applause when he
got off stage where people

201
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:53,490
just would say,

202
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:53,701
you know,

203
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,121
hey man,

204
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,050
when you look at him right now,

205
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:55,291
man,

206
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,520
there's not much time left.

207
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,250
And this is of the greatest comedians.

208
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,890
Maybe the greatest comedians ever
walked the face of the planet.

209
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,310
Right.

210
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,710
The most influential I think of all time.

211
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,830
And you walk in and watching them as
they're carrying him away and then they

212
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,610
introduce you.

213
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:07,901
Jeff.

214
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,960
Reggie gets on the piano,

215
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,280
ladies and gentlemen,

216
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,020
Joe Rogan from hardball on Fox TV.

217
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,730
Please welcome Joe Rogan.

218
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,710
And you go on stage and
you have to do stand up,

219
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,850
have to Richard.

220
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,230
And it takes at least four or five
minutes to get them out of the room cause

221
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,610
they're walking with them
out of the room they have,

222
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,140
cause he can't really walk.

223
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,260
So they have to carry him and
walk with them really slowly.

224
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:32,180
And everybody's clapping and standing.

225
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,021
You know,

226
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,210
like a war veteran just got off stage.

227
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,073
You know

228
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,130
who they just get those states.

229
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,980
Yeah.

230
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,520
It's good one.

231
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,353
Yeah.

232
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,100
Yeah.

233
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,100
[inaudible].
