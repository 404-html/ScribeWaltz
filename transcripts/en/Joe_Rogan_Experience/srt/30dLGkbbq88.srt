1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,883
Hello Freak bitches think and I know 
that black Sabbath is getting back 

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,534
together with the original lineup to do 
two shows at the Birmingham Nec in 

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,190
England.
So I called Sharon Osborne.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,061
I said,
Sharon,

5
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:12,894
I got this great idea.
I fly out and hang out with black 

6
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,134
sabbath and bro down with a band and go 
to band practice and have a really good 

7
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:20,334
time and you put me on the guest list 
for these shows and I hang out for free 

8
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,264
and it's like the best time I've ever 
had and knowing she'd hang up on me and 

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,970
she said let me call him and ask him if 
that's okay because I already knew it,

10
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,700
but I didn't know the rest of the guys 
and she called me later that day.

11
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:33,270
She said,
oh,

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,830
they think it's fine.
Here's the address.

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm just let us know when to expect you.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,200
So I booked,
I booked it around my trip to Africa.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,710
So I went a USA London bus up to Wales 
where they were practicing a taxi?

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,160
No,
no,

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,230
the,
his assistant came and got me.

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,840
So I hung out with Sabbath at band 
practice.

19
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,690
Me and the band in full band rehearsals,
the best,

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,083
uh,
watch the shows that you reunion shows 

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,273
at the soundboard and then the next day 
I flew to Kenya and so it was just a 

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,080
good,
you know,

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,913
that was a good chunk of travel and I 
ended up in South Africa after all of 

24
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,330
that and said to myself,
okay,

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,100
I'm going to come to Africa once a year.
And I just started picking out different

26
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:14,934
chunks of it and it just started going 
and that was 20 years ago and I've been 

27
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:19,501
there,
I don't know,

28
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,860
like 20 sometimes.
Wow.

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,470
Yeah.
And you never don't learn it.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,790
I call it the big book.

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,460
It's where you learned about life and 
death and Oh,

32
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,420
you can learn that anywhere,
but you see big stuff.

33
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,254
You see people who suffer,
people who have no food or water 

34
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,250
security.
Like you and I,

35
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:40,710
we talked about retirement and life 
insurance and vacation.

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,090
They,
a lot of tribes,

37
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:45,480
there's no words or even ideas in their 
lives.

38
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,643
Like I was hanging out with some 
maturity people once in Uganda a few 

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,040
years ago and I had a translators at 
Dinka guy who spoke,

40
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,380
I guess whatever a truly people speak 
and I said,

41
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,230
can you ask them if they have any words 
in their language for life insurance,

42
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,650
retirement or a vacation?
And they understood retirement.

43
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,270
You get too old,
your kids take care of you,

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,313
but a vacation.
They said you leave somewhere and you 

45
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,100
come back.
Why would you want to leave your home?

46
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,540
It's where all your friends are in your 
family and you.

47
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,470
Why would you ever do that?
Or like life insurance,

48
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,540
like what the hell are you talking 
about?

49
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,050
And you start meeting people who their 
sense of time and space is,

50
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,620
I've got a bowl,
there's some rice in it.

51
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,370
So like today I got tomorrow,
we'll see where you and I think,

52
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:27,204
okay,
in December I'm going to do this and we 

53
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,034
really have a realistic expectation of 
being alive and breathing in December 

54
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,710
and in your life.
You've no doubt thought of,

55
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:35,544
okay,
when I retire or whatever that means to 

56
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,570
you money.
Some kind of security up the road,

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,110
there's parts of the world where people 
live their entire life 37 years and then

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
they don't have a day of that kind of 
security.

59
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:51,081
They got the t shirt,
a stick and some shade and I try and not

60
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:51,984
as some voitier I'm trying to understand
the world and I can understand it by 

61
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:57,690
reading some books and seeing some 
documentaries,

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,913
but there's nothing getting out into 
what Mark Twain called the territory of 

63
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,810
phrase I stole from David Lee Roth when 
he said it to me.

64
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,183
And David Lee was actually a real 
inspiration to do a lot of traveling 

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,870
because one time we were talking and he 
just come back from open sea kayaking in

66
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,490
the Pacific.
So I said,

67
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,324
so why is it Henry is because don't get 
eaten today is a great thing to have on 

68
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,320
your to do list every once in awhile.
I said,

69
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,120
damn,
that is profound.

70
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,000
You know what he was doing up until 
recently he moved to Japan.

71
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,850
I didn't know anybody there and he was 
taking Kendall lessons.

72
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,190
So learning how to sword fight the 
Japanese master.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,450
Yep.
But this dog.

74
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:34,850
No,
no,

75
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,660
he told me,
he called me one Sunday a while ago.

76
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:41,020
I helped him with this autobiography.
So I worked with Dave really closely for

77
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,741
many,
many months.

78
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,470
I met him when I was in black flag 30 
some years ago.

79
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,750
Uh,
I walked by him at an art gallery.

80
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,100
I went,
wait a minute.

81
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,750
And he went black flag,
right?

82
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,960
No Way.
It's the van Halen guy.

83
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,230
We became best buddies,
but he called me from Japan and said,

84
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,130
uh,
you know,

85
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,020
he's learning Japanese.
He's very smart.

86
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,854
And he was like learning Japanese and 
started speaking Japanese and he's just 

87
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,880
taking lessons,
you know,

88
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,150
you said the sword guy was just like 
everyday just like,

89
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:08,860
you're stupid.
He's just like,

90
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,110
just breaking them down.
Yeah.

91
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,840
And he just got an apartment there.
Yeah,

92
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:13,674
I mean there's loving rockstar just gets
like this normal apartment with his dog 

93
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,270
and just starts taking Kendo lessons,
everything.

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,410
David's always had a greater 
appreciation of,

95
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,890
of,
you know,

96
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,940
that kind of discipline in me comes up 
through martial arts since he was a kid.

97
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,600
And I think as someone else in his 
family's into it,

98
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,370
but he's been that way,
you know,

99
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,070
that kind of discipline and you can see 
it on stage.

100
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,880
The guy is very physical,
but it's coming from a real disciplined,

101
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,840
not messing around kind of aggression 
and control.

102
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,410
And I dave really loves Japan and he 
says he called me and so I'm living in a

103
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:52,390
small apartment.
I'm taking my language lessons,

104
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm taking my martial arts stuff.
And he was doing sword stuff for quite a

105
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,060
long time though.
Yeah.

106
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,500
He's always been involved in martial 
arts.

107
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,290
And even the way he sort of approach to 
hedonism,

108
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,340
I always felt like it was sort of like 
an applied approach to hedonism,

109
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,310
like his rockstar lifestyle thing,
what he was doing.

110
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,330
It's almost like,
look,

111
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,160
not a lot of people get a chance to do 
this.

112
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,073
Yep.
I'm going to do it.

113
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,200
Yeah.
One time he,

114
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,330
when we were working on his book,
he said,

115
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,370
you know,
I go home to Pasadena now.

116
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,370
And then were you born and raised in 
some of his high school buddies?

117
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,300
Seemingly like,
well Dave,

118
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,230
you know,
it must be nice,

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,950
you know,
being David Lee Roth and he,

120
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,130
and he said,
you know what,

121
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,420
on graduation day from high school,
we all were on the same starting blocks.

122
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,330
You chose the bank job,
that's a sure thing.

123
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,130
You're going to die in that cubicle I 
choose.

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,850
And he said to sail the seas of 
consequence.

125
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,350
I was like,
I love that.

126
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,210
And I was like,
yeah man,

127
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,910
that's daring.
And so he won.

128
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,970
I mean,
like he said it pretty good ride.

129
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,740
I record and,
and so in my own way,

130
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,510
you know,
I come from minimum wage work,

131
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,344
I'm nobody from nowhere and I got into 
music via punk rock because the band 

132
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,100
black flag said,
hey,

133
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,370
you're a crazy guy.
You want to try out to be our singer.

134
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm like,
what do I have to lose?

135
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,294
Yeah.
And so I went for that and it led to 

136
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:05,090
everything else.

137
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,640
And ultimately why I'm here in this room
with you today.

138
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,350
Do you miss rock?
Do you miss touring as a musician?

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,191
No,
no,

140
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,700
because I did it.
I did it really hard until I had nothing

141
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,290
left to give to it and so now if I went 
back to it,

142
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:24,320
it would just be repetition and it might
be fun repetition,

143
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:29,240
but it wouldn't be meaningful in that I 
wouldn't be putting out anything new and

144
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,074
for me the day I stopped doing music was
I woke up one day and I just sat up and 

145
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,900
he was like a,
a light bulb went on.

146
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,381
I went,
wow,

147
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:39,020
I'm out of lyrics.
And it wasn't like,

148
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:39,621
oh no.
I'm like,

149
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,540
okay,
well give me my scroll.

150
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,430
I guess I've graduated.
When was this?

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,070
A 2000,
three years that,

152
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,190
and I just call it the manager.
I said,

153
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:51,860
Hey,
I'm done with music.

154
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,870
And he saw 15 percent of that though,
poof.

155
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,370
And he's like,
no.

156
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,091
I went,
yeah.

157
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,924
He goes,
why?

158
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,730
I said,
because I got nothing new to add.

159
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,470
These will then just go out and do the 
hits.

160
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,304
I'm like,
man,

161
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,840
that's not what coltrane would have 
done.

162
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,730
It's not with miles Davis would've done.
I just can't.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,170
I don't want to repeat.
It's not artistically brave to me.

164
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,170
And so I'd much rather just try new 
things,

165
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,000
but thankfully by that time I was 
already doing talking tours all over the

166
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:20,210
world and they do very well.
Tons of acting,

167
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,450
voiceover.
I had all this other stuff I was doing,

168
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,880
had the book company,
a record company,

169
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,840
music publishing.
I had all this other stuff and so I just

170
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,170
kind of let all of that stuff fill in,
put it this way.

171
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,350
I'm busier now than ever and I don't 
miss the music.

172
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,830
I see bands in the airport all the time,
but like the laminates in road gear,

173
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,610
I'm like,
yeah,

174
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,710
rumble young man rumble.
I had my fill.

175
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,083
Well,
it's beautiful that you did it on your 

176
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,660
terms.
You decided to do it.

177
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,553
It wasn't just,
it wasn't like there's a lot of aging 

178
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,404
rock stars that have that sort of 
existence where they have to go out and 

179
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,540
do the hair.
No one wants to hear.

180
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,890
He knew shit.
That's a big part of the problem.

181
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,190
And so they have to do that weird circle
the wagons thing,

182
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:03,440
like we're going to play this album in 
its entirety.

183
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,780
Okay.
I go to some of those shows,

184
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,421
uh,
I,

185
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,190
I,
you know,

186
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,110
throwing my money down and go see that 
band,

187
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,480
do that album in its entirety.
It's cool,

188
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,430
but it's not for me.
Well,

189
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,790
I've heard the stones still put on an 
awesome show.

190
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,520
I think one of the cool things about it 
is like,

191
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,660
wow,
mick jagger can still fucking do it.

192
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,940
He still apparently works out twice a 
day.

193
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,260
Yeah,
he's amazing shame,

194
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,400
great shape.
Um,

195
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,310
there's some people and they're,
they're rare.

196
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,160
They actually,
it's not about money.

197
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,770
That's when I really start trusting 
those old rock stars.

198
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,540
Like Rod Stewart doesn't need a dime.
I mean,

199
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,520
that guy can buy four countries right 
now.

200
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,340
He's probably playing tonight and Las 
Vegas or somewhere.

201
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Elton John.
They just really liked doing the thing.

202
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,300
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards,
there'll be rocking.

203
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,170
They'll die on stage and it's not money.
It's not like,

204
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,520
hey,
we might get populous like,

205
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,410
man,
we really want to play brown sugar.

206
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,560
I don't,
but I admired them.

207
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,060
I think it's what I'm saying is I think 
it's real.

208
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,830
Yeah.
Well I'm sure it is real.

209
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,993
I'm sure it's real with a lot of them,
but what I like with you with what 

210
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,234
you're saying is that you had already 
figured out all these other paths in 

211
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,160
life that you were enjoying putting your
creative energy and just decided.

212
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,821
I just,
I,

213
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:11,730
I know it was summer 19,
84.

214
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,610
I was 23.
I was in black flag and we were touring.

215
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:15,444
We were staying out of California 
because the Olympics were coming and we 

216
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:22,290
knew the cops would just be looking to 
smash down any supposed Ne'er do wells.

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,420
So we just stayed on tour the whole year
pretty much.

218
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,853
And I noticed all these great bands 
around the very talented people and 

219
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:29,994
ever.
We're all broke between tours were like 

220
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,880
living like sharks.
If we don't like tour,

221
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,520
we don't eat.
And between tours,

222
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,620
the guys in that band,
they're all waiters.

223
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,880
I'm not putting that down and say,
but the music wasn't keeping you in rent

224
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,240
12 months a year and I'm not nearly as 
talented as any of them.

225
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:45,871
So I said,
man,

226
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,200
if there those guys are struggling,
then what am I going to do?

227
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,580
I better get plans B,
c,

228
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:50,971
d,
e,

229
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:51,804
F and g together,
and in those days I just started my 

230
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:56,130
little book publishing company,
so I'm going to work harder on writing.

231
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,530
I'm going to become much better.
Start doing the talking shows.

232
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,364
I'm going to get much better at that and
I'm going to start saying yes to things 

233
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,710
when they come along.
A couple of years later,

234
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,360
Hollywood started calling,
Hey,

235
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,640
can you act them because well as I can 
sing and click,

236
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,330
but I started,
you know,

237
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,330
acting is crispin glover,
the actor.

238
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,770
One day he said to me,
he said,

239
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:18,771
Henry as a just please consider acting.
Just like just if you get an audition,

240
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,530
don't necessarily say no just because 
you're the music guy.

241
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:25,200
Like he said,
I think you might really like it and you

242
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,630
could probably do it.
And so I said,

243
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:28,464
okay,
and within a year I was doing film and 

244
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:31,561
then,
Hey,

245
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:33,000
can you do a voiceover?
I'm like,

246
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,930
yeah,
I got a voice.

247
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,530
And so I just started saying yes to more
stuff and that was the plan.

248
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,113
Just have more things to do,
which is fine because I don't like 

249
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:44,310
sitting around anyway and then 
ironically music ended up being very,

250
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,210
very good in all of that for me.
But I had plans,

251
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,890
other plans and I've noticed that a lot 
of old geezers around my era,

252
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,710
they didn't come up with something else 
and they just,

253
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,850
I don't know why and they didn't make 
another plan and they get put into those

254
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,630
weird tours were there.
He,

255
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,483
you know,
you bring your kid all of that and it's 

256
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,863
more that they got more than they want 
to and I'd rather wake up wanting to do 

257
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,114
stuff not having to do stuff.
I think like you were saying a while 

258
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,164
ago,
like less obligation just so you clear 

259
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,330
the deck so you can really do what you 
want because life is short.

260
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,630
I mean last week I was 20 and now I'm 
56.

261
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,990
I mean it goes by really fast.
It doesn't matter if you're in a cubicle

262
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,820
or a prison cell and then you wake up 
one day,

263
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:30,690
you're like,
damn,

264
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,340
that was fast,
and so you might as well make it as much

265
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,940
as what you want it to be as possible 
because all you're getting is older.

266
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,600
I don't understand why people don't fear
that I wake up every day,

267
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,400
but with the,
uh,

268
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,260
the grim reaper side whistling by my ear
going,

269
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:48,900
you better get up man.
And it's all the up I need.

270
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,250
I don't ever sleep in.
