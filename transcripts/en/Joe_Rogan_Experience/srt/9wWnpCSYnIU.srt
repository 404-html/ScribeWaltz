00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,470
Hello Freak bitches.
Well,

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:08,140
you guys have been through such a
fascinating change in music too,

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,410
because I mean obviously lars was a huge
figure in the controversy surrounding

4
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:17,470
mp3s and that was during the napster
days.

5
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,410
That was the time where everybody
realized like,

6
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,300
Holy Shit,
something just happened,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,430
you know,
and I don't think we realized it back

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:28,270
then.
I think lars in a lot of ways was one of

9
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:31,540
the first people sounding the horn.
He was one of the first people going,

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,640
hey,
all this selling records,

11
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,460
shit is gonna go away.
Like,

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,070
do you understand what's going on here?
People just taking things and putting

13
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,530
them online and this was a totally new
thing.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,550
Absolutely.
And that poor guy still,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,410
you know,
he's taking bullets,

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,430
he's taking hits for it.
Still tell really where,

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,360
oh everyone who's got a beef with any
other thing than uh,

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,120
you know,
napster,

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,250
they,
it just gravitates towards that all the

20
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,020
time.
That poor guy.

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,660
Yeah,
he got beat up by that and we all stood

22
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,950
behind him.
Obviously.

23
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:07,620
He was the spokesman for it.
He,

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,130
he,
he chose,

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,440
he chose to do that.
Management said,

26
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:13,000
hey,
this is coming,

27
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,020
this is coming.
Let's be the ones that stand up for

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,410
artists.
And he took that,

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,030
he,
he grabbed the flag and said,

30
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:27,031
I'm going.
And there were lots of other musicians

31
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:32,221
and people that were on board as well,
but they weren't as vocal or taking the

32
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,010
hits like he did.
There was something about,

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,500
you know,
even like a doctor Dre,

34
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:42,820
he was on board with it.
But for some reason in the rap world

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,020
it's like,
well,

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,030
it's all about money anyway,
so,

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,630
so what,
you know,

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,920
for heavy metal,
there was some kind of stigma around,

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,790
you know,
you,

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,210
you're,
you're an asshole if you're rich or if

41
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,800
you've been successful or something.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,530
It's like we got to pull you down into
hell with us.

43
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:00,340
You know,
don't,

44
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,200
don't be getting good now.
You know?

45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,330
Yeah.
So that was that stigma.

46
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,960
But there were other artists that would
show up at shows saying,

47
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,750
hey man,
I'm really glad you're doing what you're

48
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:11,740
doing.
It's like,

49
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:12,770
come on,
you know,

50
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,740
join us.
Oh No,

51
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,080
I can't.
Oh No,

52
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,990
my career would be over.
It's like,

53
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:20,560
you fuck,
you know,

54
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,690
it's so frustrating.
It's like,

55
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:23,890
dude,
do you believe in it?

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,630
Yeah.
Then stand up like,

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,730
yeah,
but no,

58
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,530
it will fall apart.
Something will happen.

59
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:30,161
My fans,
blah,

60
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:30,970
blah,
blah.

61
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,390
So they,
they were concerned about their own

62
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:37,660
careers and not the big picture of
artists.

63
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:42,480
And obviously these days you can see
there's no copyright laws.

64
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,570
There's no nothing,
man,

65
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:46,540
you can rip this and that and whatever
and do whatever you want with it.

66
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,020
There's a beauty to that and a lot of
creativity comes out of it,

67
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,860
but it gets watered down.
It gets,

68
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,540
you know,
I dunno,

69
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,300
we,
we acknowledge that.

70
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,370
Yeah,
there's inspiration somewhere for

71
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,910
everything.
But blatantly taking that and using it

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,280
is,
it's pretty frustrating to me.

73
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,010
Um,
and we're,

74
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,050
we're,
we were at that point where we were,

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,040
we had a such a following.
We had such a strength in Metallica that

76
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,760
we survived all of that stuff.
Um,

77
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,200
but there was a lot of bands that
didn't,

78
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,610
you know,
uh,

79
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,450
they couldn't sustain themselves,
couldn't feed their families because of

80
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,350
what happened.
And I think the frustrating part was no

81
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,280
one really understood that music is our
life.

82
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,470
You know,
if you take that,

83
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,090
if you take hours like the way we wanted
to present our music is part of the art.

84
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,270
Well again,
in an album,

85
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:52,250
meaning like one song leads to the next
song weaning,

86
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,260
well like releasing an album,
here's how we'd like to release it.

87
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,290
We don't want it leaked over here.
We don't want this happening.

88
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,290
We don't,
you know,

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,580
uh,
present a presentation is part of the

90
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:05,070
yard.
Like when you walk into an art studio,

91
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,200
the artist has been in there putting it
together.

92
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:08,100
Like,
okay,

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,590
I want you to see this first.
And then that,

94
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,630
and then you go here and you get Bam.
You know that there's a passion behind

95
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,240
that.
And when someone just throws it out

96
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:23,100
there,
then it kind of loses a leaves as an

97
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,840
impact.
Um,

98
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,950
so if I'm complaining,
punched me in the face,

99
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,020
but we have survived and we feel good
about it and we've adapted.

100
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,210
But the record companies certainly did
not,

101
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,180
you know,
they took it

102
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,930
a hard hit.
But also,

103
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:40,580
you know,
when you look at the record deals,

104
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,490
the deals that record companies make
with artists,

105
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,190
and you see like what a record company
selling.

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,320
Well,
they're only selling your work without

107
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,000
your work,
without your creativity,

108
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:53,210
without your creations.
There's nothing to sell.

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,590
That's all they sell.
But then you look at these insane

110
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,700
insanely one side and deals that they
cut with artists,

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,100
especially emerging artists,
they might be a little bit more

112
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,530
desperate,
don't realize the potential,

113
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,110
especially the potential for income that
they might have in the future.

114
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,280
I mean,
I've seen some of those,

115
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,980
I don't know,
there was that one that somebody said

116
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,530
that courtney love didn't really write
it,

117
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:15,020
that it was ghost written.
I Dunno who the fuck wrote it,

118
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,030
but Courtney love put it out saying that
she wrote it.

119
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:22,031
But it was a breakdown of how artists
make money from the creation of an art

120
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,690
creation of an album to having it sold
in record stores to where the money gets

121
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,800
extracted and how much is left for the
actual artists.

122
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:31,970
It's pretty fucking disturbing.

123
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,650
Yeah.
Even,

124
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,390
uh,
well yeah.

125
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,830
A couple of years ago,
we,

126
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,550
we got the rights to our catalog,
our,

127
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:44,750
our music from kill 'em all up till now.
We own it finally,

128
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,000
which is weird.
I tell my kids,

129
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,740
Hey,
you know,

130
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,700
let's go celebrate.
We've got,

131
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,390
we got the master recordings,
we own it finally.

132
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,840
And they were just looking at me like,
what the hell are you talking?

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,260
You wrote it,
why isn't it yours?

134
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,400
Right.
Okay.

135
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,310
Well I had a little talk about how it
was back then.

136
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,920
You know,
you would somewhat sell a little bit of

137
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:10,490
your soul to get a bigger something.
You know,

138
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:14,930
it was basically the record company was
a bank and a marketing tool to get you

139
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,760
where you want it to be.
So,

140
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,201
uh,
you know,

141
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:23,180
it was a necessary thing at that time,
but it's great to have our stuff back

142
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,160
and be able to,
you know,

143
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:26,840
we own our own record press.

144
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,460
How cool is that?
Whoa.

145
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,020
In Germany,
uh,

146
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:35,021
one of our management people found a
place that had some machines that were

147
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:40,010
for sale and we bought one.
And so we press our own vinyl man.

148
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,620
Wow.
And we could kind of do whatever we

149
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,110
want.
What color vinyl today,

150
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,690
you know,
or what crazy things you can do.

151
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,160
You know,
uh,

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,890
you guys can kind of do whatever the
fuck you want now,

153
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:52,580
right?
Much.

154
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,040
You don't need a record company do
anything.

155
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,060
Well,
it depends.

156
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,680
Uh,
we have a record company.

157
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,670
We own our own in America or North
America.

158
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,650
The rest of the world's a little
tougher.

159
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,500
You know,
there's a lot of countries out there,

160
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:10,520
especially in Europe and there's no way
we can deal with the distribution in

161
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,970
each different countries.
So we've cut really good deals with,

162
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,860
with other record companies that have a
vision and a,

163
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:23,861
have a love for Metallica and understand
that this is powerful stuff and people

164
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,600
love it and we want to be part of the
family.

165
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,040
Um,
but having your own record press is a

166
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,190
pretty darn cool thing.
There was really inspired by Jack White,

167
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,810
uh,
who,

168
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,250
uh,
you know,

169
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,020
white stripes,
fame,

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,310
you know,
rec on tears.

171
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,650
He's done a lot of stuff,
but he,

172
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,220
he loves that stuff.
He's pressing his own stuff.

173
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,630
He's coming up with different ways of
doing vinyls and colors and hidden

174
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:53,470
tracks and cool stuff like that.
And it's,

175
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,930
it's just another way to get creative
in,

176
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,020
in your career is vinyl.
What's selling more than anything now

177
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,030
when it comes to actual physical hard
copies of things,

178
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,230
I don't know the numbers and they're
probably very all over the place,

179
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,720
but vinyl has never gone away.
And it's,

180
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,550
it's,
I dunno if it's coming back,

181
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,870
but it's more popular than it was.
I think there's just something tactile

182
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,850
about it.
There's something great that people are

183
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:26,260
finally understanding that you can look
at artwork,

184
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,960
you can feel it.
And then the,

185
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,500
the,
the ritualization of opening up the

186
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,710
player,
taking it out and blowing on it,

187
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,150
clean and it,
putting it down,

188
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,960
setting the needle down.
And it's,

189
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,130
that's something really cool.
I just,

190
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,180
I came down to La a few months ago and
hung out with some high school buddies.

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,351
It's like,
Hey,

192
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:51,020
what do you want to do?
I was listening to some songs and he

193
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,030
takes out the Kansas,
you know,

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
album puts it on.
And

195
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,120
I was like,
dude,

196
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:02,750
this sound

197
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,090
so great.
Wow.

198
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,960
And we were actually listening to music,
sitting down and listening to it.

199
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,210
My kids got into vinyl,
they got a,

200
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,900
you know,
like at urban outfitter you buy the

201
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,180
little,
the setup now and that's where they,

202
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,630
that's where you can get vinyl.
It's,

203
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,110
it's there,
there are some record stores out there,

204
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:26,111
but that's where they gravitate towards.
Got I'm this little player and uh,

205
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
they just picked out some album covers,
date,

206
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,390
even know who they were.
It's like this cow,

207
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,630
this cover looks cool,
this speaks to me.

208
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,480
I'm buying this.
I remember doing that kind of thing.

209
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,913
Cool.
Cover.

210
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,050
Yup.
That's how I discovered tons of bands.

211
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,830
So they go into the room and you know,
I leave him alone for a while and then

212
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,810
come back and I haven't come out.
It's like,

213
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,130
what's going on?
I look in there,

214
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,480
there,
you know,

215
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,320
the record players on the floor is
covers and stuff strewn out all over the

216
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:53,670
place and they're laying on the floor
listening to,

217
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,510
it's like,
that is what that was me,

218
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,920
you know?
Uh,

219
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,660
and my,
my daughter comes out,

220
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:00,291
she said,
dad,

221
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,680
you'll never guess what,
what their song

222
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,970
on the other side.
Like,

223
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,530
oh my God.
Yeah.

224
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,100
It's not a CD.
You know,

225
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,000
I was like,
she just covered some huge thing,

226
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,260
you know.
Wow.

227
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,630
Well that was one of the things that was
not,

228
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,280
what is this vinyl sales outperform
digital downloads for the first time.

229
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,180
Oh Wow.
Shows a significant shift in how people

230
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,310
are consuming music.
That's really interesting.

231
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,660
Stigma.
I tell you.

232
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,960
That's just cool.
Uh,

233
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,570
uh,
in general,

234
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,450
the more ways you can get music to
people,

235
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,520
the better.

236
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,510
Well,
I think the other thing that you were

237
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,110
saying,
it's,

238
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,330
it's like,
it's a whole presentation.

239
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,400
The album cover,
you open it up,

240
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,990
the inside,
the artwork,

241
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,590
all that represents your vision of what
you guys are trying to put out.

242
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,260
And that was one of the things that kind
of went away with digital.

243
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:51,050
Like all of a sudden there were no album
covers or the CD,

244
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,850
he was that big.
So you couldn't really,

245
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:53,491
there wasn't,
you know,

246
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:56,600
it's like a tiny little piece of art and
if you're downloading it,

247
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,460
you're not even getting that.
You're just,

248
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,350
you're just getting the music itself.
That's it.

249
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,910
Well,

250
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,743
Eh,
you,

251
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,763
you would get,
you know,

252
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,070
downloadable artwork,
but you're not really looking at the

253
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:09,430
artwork while you're listening to it on
your mobile device.

254
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:10,264
Right.
You know,

255
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,171
so,
you know,

256
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,730
the event of sitting down and,
and disappearing into the music,

257
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,710
you know,
being a real music listener,

258
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,700
not,
I mean,

259
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,080
while you're driving,
I get it.

260
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,480
It's,
it's keeping you from killing people on

261
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,390
the road,
but when you go home and you sit and you

262
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:28,630
just get lost in stuff,
even,

263
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:32,200
um,
like those cheap frigging headphones,

264
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,760
man,
the little ear buds,

265
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,100
my kids were listening to stuff on that.
It's like,

266
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,590
you guys haven't experienced music,
like,

267
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,330
good sound here.
Try these headphones on.

268
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,420
They're like,
whoa.

269
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,080
I hear stuff I didn't hear before.
And uh,

270
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,280
but just seeing my kids get excited
about going to a live concert,

271
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,480
you know,
they there and they absorb it in like

272
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,430
every sense.

273
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're not just having your ears hear
something and that will never be,

274
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,940
I dunno,
maybe the frigging goggles or some kind

275
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:14,080
of a audio visual stuff will reproduce
live shows,

276
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,140
but there's something about being next
to a sweaty fucker at a Gig and you

277
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,910
know,
them pushing you or uh,

278
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,430
you know,
seeing someone headbang wildly are

279
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:28,780
getting thrown over the top of you and
there's just so much smells,

280
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,300
things like that.
It just can't be recreated.

281
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,340
So live music.
My daughter,

282
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,520
just like,
I can't believe that guy just pressed a

283
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:41,020
button on his computer and he's singing
over his own music that's not

284
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,310
performing.
You know,

285
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,970
she discovered that on her own.
Hey,

286
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:49,270
these guys are actually playing their
instruments and they fucked up.

287
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,670
They fucked up a song.
It was so cool.

288
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,240
You know,
I saw something that I wouldn't have,

289
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,830
you know,
really cool like that.

290
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,480
Yeah.
The lip sinking thing,

291
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,550
man,
that when you go to see a concert and

292
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:02,110
you find out that people are lip
sanking,

293
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,580
that's so disturbing.
It's just what,

294
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,720
what have you done?
This is,

295
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,090
what is the point of this that is
disappointing.

296
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,910
What does live performance?
Live performance is supposed to be your

297
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,150
experiences thing actually happening.
You're watching this person expressed

298
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,640
themselves,
then they're not,

299
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,540
they're not pretending.
You're not supposed to be pretending.

300
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,560
Right.
Are you pretending you're you your money

301
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,000
back?
Cause you're not.

302
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,500
That's not,
that's not,

303
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,360
that's pretending.
That's not singing.

304
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,480
I've gone to see plenty of shows with my
kids and you can tell it's like,

305
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,460
all right,
it's the Mike's way over here and

306
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,500
they're still sing in.
And it's like,

307
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,150
well they have to have the backing
tracks cut.

308
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,130
They're,
they're dancing and they're out of

309
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:45,671
breath.
Like,

310
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:49,030
well fucking stop dancing and this song,
I mean,

311
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,160
are you a dancer or you're a musician or
a singer or whatever.

312
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,700
Can Cardio,
start running hills?

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,810
It can be done.
I go to Vail and run up the 14 are

314
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,270
exactly it.
It can be done,

315
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,040
but I've seen shows where there's that
going on and then he'll get real,

316
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,420
you know,
like sit down on a couch,

317
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:11,830
plug it in acoustic and,
and sing out of key and like really try

318
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,560
and struggle with the song or sing it.
You know,

319
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,690
it's like,
that's natural.

320
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,230
That feels good.
Who would not gravitate towards that

321
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,170
than listening to the album?
I got to listen to yell at my home.

322
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,090
Yeah.
That's why it's cool to just see an

323
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,550
acoustic set sometimes from people you
know,

324
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,240
just like it's as minimal as possible.
You're breaking it down to the bare

325
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,700
bones,
just a guitar and two people singing or

326
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,534
something,
you know?

327
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,460
Yeah.
That is pretty intimidating.

328
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,130
I tell you,
when we do like that Neil young benefit

329
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:39,881
where it's,
you know,

330
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:43,990
acoustic only,
and if you're your frigging neck naked

331
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:44,740
up there,
dude,

332
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,210
you know?
And every note is like,

333
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,590
you know,
and every fuck up on the vocal,

334
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,640
it's,
it's great.

335
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,260
I mean,
it's like when,

336
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,011
uh,
you know,

337
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:58,190
you go or you're going to be on a TV
thing and they put makeup on you.

338
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,570
It's like,
why are you doing that?

339
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,740
You know?
Exactly.

340
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,070
Uh,
so when people see me in person,

341
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,331
they think,
damn,

342
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:08,010
you're one ugly fuck.
It's like,

343
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,863
no,

344
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,180
I want to be as ugly as possible to
everyone.

345
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,073
So when they see me

346
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,083
go,
hey,

347
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,230
it's you,
you know?

348
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,580
Exactly.
Exactly.

349
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,001
Right.
Yeah.

350
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,040
You're not airbrushed.
Yeah.

351
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,740
You see a photoshop yourself and it's
like,

352
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,930
you know,
they smoothed out all your lines and

353
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,460
you're like,
what the fuck are you doing?

354
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,460
Sometimes

355
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,610
sometimes you got to do it or like,
you know,

356
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,360
if you're in a band like I am and the
three guys get the stuff put on and then

357
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:33,194
I show up,

358
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,920
dude,
oh my God,

359
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,980
you're a shiny.
Exactly.

360
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,360
It's like people gotta go,
bye.

361
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,220
Fuck this band I do sweating.
Yeah,

362
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,860
right,
right.

363
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,190
When it comes to the napster thing and
with what happened with Lars,

364
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:50,950
I feel like there's two different
things.

365
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,230
There's something,
there's what's really happening and this

366
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:57,140
is how people look at it and what's
really happening was like all of a

367
00:15:57,141 --> 00:16:00,130
sudden this door got opened up or this
Pandora's box got open.

368
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,590
Right,
and you guys were looking at it going,

369
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:03,550
well,
this is a,

370
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,170
we're going to lose our record sales.
Like,

371
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,560
do you understand that?
Like people have been consuming music in

372
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,140
a certain way.
You've been paying for music and that

373
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,310
paying for music is supported.
All these people that are a part of this

374
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:19,030
industry that makes albums.
There's this gigantic thing behind it.

375
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,450
This is all going to go away because you
just put a hole in the bottom of it and

376
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:23,980
all the money's going to get dropped
out.

377
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,500
But then the way it looks is Luca,
this rich motherfucker,

378
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,341
you know,
he doesn't,

379
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,170
he doesn't appreciate his fans.
Hey Man,

380
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,260
I can't afford your album right now.
Is it okay if I just download it for

381
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,380
free?
And a lot of people thought,

382
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:39,214
well,
hey,

383
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,170
people who can afford it will still be
downloading it and then they'll buy it

384
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,930
when they can.
But that wasn't really the case was it?

385
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,290
Nah,
I don't know.

386
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,273
I,
you know,

387
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,960
I'm all for convenience in the
technology moving forward.

388
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,020
Getting music out to people is the
important part,

389
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,470
but just make sure the artist gets what
they deserve from it because without

390
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:06,900
that,
it's going to become a hobby.

391
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,250
No one wants,
you know,

392
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,260
I don't want to see the paramedics show
up at my house and it's like a hobby for

393
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:14,094
him.
Hey,

394
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,880
you know,
I'm not really getting paid for what I

395
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,200
think I should get paid for my creation,
but I guess I'll save your life.

396
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,280
You know,
maybe,

397
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,960
uh,
people didn't relate that to their,

398
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,870
their career or something,
uh,

399
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,903
equivalent.

400
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,550
Well,
I think because the money wasn't

401
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,900
equivalent,
they looked at you guys like,

402
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,820
you guys are already so rich.
What do you give a shit?

403
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,870
There's no way you're going to be broke.
You guys made millions and millions and

404
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,860
millions of dollars a tour all over the
world.

405
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,670
And it became,
the touring thing was way artists made

406
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,504
money then.
Right?

407
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,090
Touring and merchandise and that's now
record companies are stressed.

408
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,350
Structuring their deals,
you know,

409
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,240
hey,
we get a piece of it.

410
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,560
Merch and touring.
See that's bizarre though.

411
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,370
The record companies getting a piece of
your touring to me is very strange and

412
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:05,050
I've seen not just a piece,
but an exorbitant amount and that

413
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,520
disturbs me.
Well that's the only way they can

414
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:07,190
survive.
No,

415
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,120
they shouldn't be around them because
then you become a parasite because you

416
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,680
don't deserve it.
I mean,

417
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:16,090
especially now where bands can literally
become gigantic because at Youtube we

418
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:18,250
didn't,
Justin bieber become huge just entirely

419
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,710
because of youtube.
Jamie knows,

420
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,490
look at him,
it's a fucking Justin Bieber fan.

421
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,530
He hides it.
Hey,

422
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:26,830
me too.
First I heard him saying,

423
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,450
I thought it was a girl.
I didn't even know it was a,

424
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,703
I didn't know.

425
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,910
Well,
I'll tell you the,

426
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,200
the whole,
uh,

427
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,030
you know,
would you,

428
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,750
would you go up to the artist and take
that out of his pocket?

429
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,760
You know,
would you go into a record store and

430
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:44,480
just lift that,
steal it right out the door with it,

431
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,510
you know,
what'd you do that with?

432
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,321
You know,
okay,

433
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,760
there's,
you know,

434
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,980
there's,
there's big corporations that are rich

435
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,830
and would you go walk in and just steal
their stuff?

436
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,720
I mean,
there's software companies that are

437
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,970
massive.
Would you go in there and just rip their

438
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,360
stuff?
I don't get that mentality.

439
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,390
I don't call me old school,
but you need to earn what you get and if

440
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,630
it gets stolen from you,
it doesn't make any sense.

441
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,620
It's hard to fathom.
And what it seems like to me,

442
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,450
and I,
I could be talking about my ass,

443
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:22,451
but the record companies dropped the
ball and the new record companies became

444
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,120
itunes control at all.

445
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,810
Here's how much we're charging for your
music and here's how much you're going

446
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:31,400
to get.
Everyone's even,

447
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,470
it's like some communist approach,
you know,

448
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,170
and I,
I don't understand.

449
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,870
I don't understand that.
If we're an artist and we make a lot of

450
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:40,130
money,
that's up to us.

451
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,510
If we give all our money away to charity
or we throw it back into a movie,

452
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,430
that bombs,
which happened,

453
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,500
um,
that's our choice.

454
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,860
We're the fucking artist.
We get to do what we want.

455
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,790
It's our party.
You're invited and we can destroy this

456
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,280
thing if we want.
I don't want you to destroy it.

457
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,870
Yeah.
The itunes distribution models a very

458
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,060
bizarre one.
It's very strange how they've,

459
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,600
they don't know what they're doing.
No one knows what they're doing.

460
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,870
And you know,
there was a system that worked and I'm

461
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:11,120
up for bucking the system and making it
better,

462
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,340
but it didn't,
it didn't get better.

463
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,870
It's like the,
like you said,

464
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:16,970
the cat got out of the bag and you can't
put it back in,

465
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:17,870
man.
You just can't.

466
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,420
Um,
so what do you do?

467
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,400
Well,
you got spotify or you got something

468
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:25,370
else where streaming's going to help get
the artists their money.

469
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,350
And it's,
it's,

470
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,090
um,
you know,

471
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:32,210
companies like that are losing money a
lot.

472
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,820
And spotify,
I don't,

473
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,070
I don't,
I don't know the exact workings and I'm

474
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:41,270
not going to speak for them at all,
but it's hasn't been figured out yet,

475
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,000
is what I'm saying.
It hasn't been figured out how to make a

476
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,210
music model work.
And there's no one way,

477
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,110
maybe there will never be one way again,
and that's fine,

478
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,600
but it's still unbalanced.

479
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,340
Okay.
[inaudible].
