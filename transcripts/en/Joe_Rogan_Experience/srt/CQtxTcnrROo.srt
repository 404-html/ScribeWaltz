1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,610
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,860
Joe Rogan podcast.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,450
Joshua,
thanks for being here,

4
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,200
man.
I appreciate it.

5
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,430
I really enjoy your show.
Oh,

6
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,100
thank you.
You're,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,860
you're huff post show.
I've seen it many,

8
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:26,861
many times and we were just discussing 
the excellent recent one that you did 

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,780
with Mark Marin,
which I really loved,

10
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,730
but I had him on Friday.
I came to know you because of the,

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,210
the whole,
uh,

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,940
how should we say this canceled core 
Baer report thing.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,270
This,
this ill advised a jump at racism or the

14
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:45,950
idea of racism.
Yeah.

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,610
Someone that's comedy central tweeted 
something that Kobe had said out of 

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:51,710
context,
out of context.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,290
And it was taken up as being a racist 
quip by an Internet activist.

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,080
And I had not really,
I wasn't really familiar with her.

19
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:05,081
I'd never heard of or anything.
And I had her on huff post live briefly 

20
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,960
and she,
she didn't like the fact that I was a 

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,781
white man,
that I got myself into all kinds of 

22
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:10,781
trouble.

23
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:10,910
I'll just explain exploded into one of 
those twitter storms.

24
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:15,911
I mean,
I think that was partly the 

25
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:15,911
precipitating event that and then 
actually forced cold beer to address it.

26
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:20,300
He did a whole segment on his show about
her and about the whole twitter storm on

27
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:25,301
Monday,
but it really kind of got traction when 

28
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,881
I had her on huff post live on.
I think it was the Friday morning and 

29
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:27,881
um,
yeah,

30
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:32,500
we shouldn't go into,
I should say what the joke was so that 

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,760
people know because it was,
it was really unbelievably ridiculous.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,120
It was unfortunate because if she had 
seen the actual joke in context,

33
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,740
it would not have been offensive.
Oh,

34
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:47,741
I don't agree with that really.
I think she just takes umbrage at 

35
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:47,741
things,
but figure biggest she likes to.

36
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:52,031
I think there was a,
there was a type of twitter reaction 

37
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:52,031
that is just a project predictable knee 
jerk.

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,310
It's a choice to take things out of 
context.

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,870
I agree with that,
but I think that it would've been almost

40
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,540
impossible if she'd actually seen the 
full clip.

41
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,780
Like she would have had to be on the 
starting line wanting to launch,

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,190
but go,
fuck,

43
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,260
I can't go after them.
This is the,

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
what the context was that he's willing 
to show the Asian community how much I 

45
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:17,771
care by introducing the Ching Chong Ding
Dong Foundation for sensitivity to 

46
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,800
orientals or whatever,
and it was meant to be a,

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,510
it was a satire of the Washington 
redskins original Americans Foundation.

48
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,540
So they come up with this original 
Americans Foundation.

49
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,310
So Dan Snyder was trying to,
it was trying to say,

50
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:33,490
instead of changing the name of the 
redskins a,

51
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,410
I'm going to give money to like this 
African American charity.

52
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:36,860
I mean,
sorry,

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,920
native American charity and call bear 
satirized the redskins by saying because

54
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,920
he had been accused of doing some anti 
Asian things in the past like bits where

55
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,140
he just kind of impersonal.
It's an Asian or something.

56
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:48,950
So he was like,
well,

57
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:49,690
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.

58
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,790
Uh,
make that right by setting up this Chin 

59
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,790
Chung Ding Dong charity for orientals or
whatever.

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,300
Right.
That was the gag rose.

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,100
The Gag.
Well,

62
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:57,710
it's,
it's,

63
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,010
his thing is character.

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,590
I mean,
core Cole bear is a,

65
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,720
it's like an archie bunker of course.
I mean,

66
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,640
he's,
he's not a real guy.

67
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,940
This is a role that he plays a 
ridiculous,

68
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,230
ignorant Republican and that that is,
that's,

69
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,450
that's the satire,
and to miss that and to do this cancel 

70
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,690
core bear thing.
Colbert,

71
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,980
same as name,
wrong every time,

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,170
but I never say it.
I watch it.

73
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,110
I don't say his name,
but to do that it just,

74
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:31,111
it,
it highlights in the support that he 

75
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,211
got,
but the social justice warriors or the 

76
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:33,910
support that she got rather than this by
the social justice warriors on this was.

77
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,530
It was so maddening.

78
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,520
People who should know better joe,
they shouldn't fight.

79
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,950
I had people,
I had twitter hate campaigns coming at 

80
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,461
me from left right and center from like 
from black comics who I had known like 

81
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:51,411
who should know better because they're 
comics that it's baffling to me when 

82
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:57,141
people engage with one another purely on
the basis of their identity and not on 

83
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,150
the basis of the actual intellectual 
point at hand,

84
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:02,460
like weird does set high go too far or 
whatever.

85
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,670
Like I was just roundly prevented from 
having any opinion about what satire is 

86
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,900
on the basis of the fact that I'm a 
white man.

87
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,630
Yeah,
you got to check your privilege son.

88
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,050
Check your privilege.
Did you check it?

89
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,910
I didn't check it.
Check it happen.

90
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,690
I need to check my privilege APP.
I never know what I would sell that is 

91
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,630
to create an app where you can just 
click on it and gives you a score from 

92
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:26,640
one to 10 about what your privileges.
Well,

93
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,660
it's an interesting thing

94
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,660
because it it.
It immediately allow someone to 

95
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,611
marginalize your opinion by virtue of 
the fact that you are European or in 

96
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:39,171
your case Australian or whatever your 
whatever your roots are like you can 

97
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,260
instantly discount

98
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,280
any credible point that you might have 
had.

99
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,140
Just to clarify,
for people who haven't seen the way that

100
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,110
the interview with this Hashtag activist
twitter person went,

101
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,160
I was basically she was buying.
She basically literally said that I.

102
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,400
my opinion is completely worthless 
because I as a white man,

103
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,050
I would not be expected to understand 
the lived experience of women of color.

104
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,960
Now she's a 23 year old Korean American 
middle class.

105
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,490
It was a lot,
so I don't know what,

106
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,480
but what's incredible to me,
the struggle is real.

107
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,400
Josh,
what's incredible to me is that,

108
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,010
you know,
when you meet somebody and you just get 

109
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,010
a real sense of like,
wow,

110
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,940
this person is interesting.
They're original or authentic,

111
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:24,210
like this is,
this person is a,

112
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,470
is a snowflake.
I want to,

113
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,810
you know,
they're a fingerprint.

114
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:31,610
They're like something unique.
That's what we should all be hoping for.

115
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:36,611
Right,
and we should all be hoping to engage 

116
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,351
with one another on,
on levels that enable us to bring that 

117
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,340
out in each other.
She was the exact opposite of that.

118
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,400
Like it was basically an identity 
talking to another identity.

119
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:46,370
It was a generic.
It was a label talking to a label.

120
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,520
Yeah.
There's an issue with this.

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,680
This need to correct people that to 
define yourself by correcting people 

122
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,140
that I think people are.
They're looking for people to step out 

123
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,861
of line so they can check them and 
instead of looking at this subtle 

124
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:09,510
nuanced life that we live where there's,
there's,

125
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,540
there's so many different variables when
it comes to human interaction and 

126
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:14,590
communication.
There's so much when you.

127
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,900
You're throwing in satire as well,
and it's a satire television show.

128
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,110
The fact that this is an all put through
some sort of a observational filter 

129
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,460
before you immediately knee jerk react 
and and,

130
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,470
and attack.
It just shows that there's a real issue 

131
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,070
with the ability to communicate.
The ability to communicate is a 

132
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,070
wonderful thing.
The fact that we all have it,

133
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,700
that you know,
you can do your show.

134
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,230
I can do my show,
we can all tweet,

135
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:41,231
anybody can tweet,
anybody can go crazy and just write 

136
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:41,231
whatever they want on their blog.

137
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:42,440
It's great.
It a lot of ways,

138
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,650
but it's also ridiculous because people 
who have not considered that they do 

139
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,990
possess the English language,
they have the ability to communicate,

140
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,670
but what they're essentially doing is 
just piecing together what they think is

141
00:06:55,671 --> 00:07:00,671
like an argument based on these 
predetermined patterns that they've 

142
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,200
picked up.
Exactly.

143
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,300
You know,
as you as a white male wouldn't 

144
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,300
understand a woman of color.
What fucking color you.

145
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,360
Well,
like what,

146
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,030
what,
how your white.

147
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,470
I mean you're,
you're Asian,

148
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,410
but I mean when you're talking about the
color of your skin,

149
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,600
you can't say color.
You just can't.

150
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,210
You might want to say ethnicity.
You might want to say,

151
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:17,800
you know,
uh,

152
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,980
whatever,
uh,

153
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,270
background,

154
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,950
let me clarify that there is.
I completely concede that there is a 

155
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,500
lived experience of being a certain 
being a minority ethnicity,

156
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,710
especially in America or in Australia,
new countries that is different from 

157
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,650
being a white man and I'm rushed.
I absolutely concede that.

158
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,680
The thing is why can't we talk about the
actual details of the experience without

159
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,310
assuming that there's a homogeneity 
between that experience as well.

160
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,650
Like not every Asian experience in 
America is the same.

161
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,250
They have certain commonalities in that 
they're subject to racism in a way that 

162
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,820
you and I aren't,
but they are so wildly different.

163
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,880
Let's talk about the details of the 
experience and what's acceptable and how

164
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,881
we,
how we want to converse with one 

165
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,531
another.
Let's not assume that because a person 

166
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:08,750
has a particular set bunch of labels 
attached to them,

167
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,860
gay,
straight,

168
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,360
Asian,
white man,

169
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,140
woman,
whatever,

170
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:17,141
that that immediately disqualifies them 
from having a conversation about these 

171
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,141
things.
Yeah,

172
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,710
absolutely.
And also

173
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,810
this idea of check your privilege.
What you're doing is just discounting 

174
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,770
someone's opinion immediately.
You're,

175
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,180
you're using it as a tool and it's a 
lazy tool.

176
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,480
It's a lazy tool to look.
There's some people that you want to 

177
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,480
just be able to say,
check your privilege.

178
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,951
You.
You basically want to say shut the fuck 

179
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:37,361
up because you don't have the time to go
through all the things that are wrong 

180
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:40,451
with their arguments,
but there are other people like 

181
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:40,451
yourself.
You're a very complex dude.

182
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:43,070
You talk very well.
You're very well spoken,

183
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:45,200
you're very measured and the things that
you say,

184
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,490
I've watched your show many,
many times.

185
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,730
You're not a knee jerk reactionary guy.
You're not an asshole.

186
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,850
So for someone to say that to you,
it just shows that this is something 

187
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,470
that just gets used.
It just gets thrown out there like,

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,290
here's a weapon that I have.
We're in the middle of a conversation.

189
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,820
Instead of having this dialogue where 
we're considering each other's points of

190
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,950
view and different lives that we've led,
he just boom,

191
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,590
throw the snow,
smoke bomb on the ground,

192
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,340
check your privilege.

193
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,110
Well,
it's also,

194
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,730
it's the easiest way to lose

195
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,880
good friends too,
like privileged checker APP.

196
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,590
It exists.
It exists.

197
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,230
That's the need to check it.
That's great.

198
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,780
I'm going to download it.
I'll download it and check my privilege.

199
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,520
It's also the,
it's the clearest way to,

200
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,570
to lose allies in the fight against 
racism as well for these self appointed 

201
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:35,450
kind of,
um,

202
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,900
people who,
who do these kinds of twitter campaigns 

203
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,901
and online stuff.
And the WHO's who the check your 

204
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:43,901
privilege brigade,
you know,

205
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:47,290
I am the most obvious ally for 
antiracist.

206
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,940
So I'm like the least racist guy.
I should be.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I should be,
it should be a no brainer for me to 

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
release racist non,
the less racist guy,

209
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,260
the second least racist guy won the race
and it's made me what I have to keep 

210
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:06,191
reminding myself is this the self 
appointed spokespeople who uh,

211
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,230
you know,
for race like this person then not the 

212
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,420
people who I need to be defending when 
I'm,

213
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,310
when I'm trying to defend minorities.

214
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,570
These are,
they are,

215
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,810
they are doing active harm to the cause.
Like the poor black working mom doesn't 

216
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:27,830
have time to get angry on twitter.
Like I should be defending her.

217
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,170
Not a 23 year old Korean American Middle
Classico who's making me,

218
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,800
who's basically alienating me and all 
the likeminded people from the 

219
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,350
legitimate worthwhile pursuit of 
fighting racism because it makes me feel

220
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,070
like,
well,

221
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,740
if I'm,
if I'm going to be rejected out of hand,

222
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,810
regardless of what I do,
simply on the basis of the fact that I'm

223
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,740
a white man.
Fuck you.

224
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,670
All right,
cool.

225
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,540
You've just lost an ally.

226
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,380
Yeah,
that is true.

227
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,790
I mean that is a very good point.
Um,

228
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,510
and another good point is when you're 
23,

229
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,700
fuck look,
she's probably smarter than me.

230
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,100
When I was 23,
I was retarded when I was 23.

231
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:06,660
I was really fucking dumb and that's 
just something I'm willing to concede.

232
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,690
And if,
if you had a video of me explaining my 

233
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,900
position on anything at 23,
at 47,

234
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,390
I would have to go,
fuck,

235
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm so sorry.
I don't know.

236
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,850
I just didn't know anything

237
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,500
and stupid.
I have some.

238
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,750
I have a certain level of empathy for 
that.

239
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,190
I mean,
I don't know that girl.

240
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:25,420
So this really isn't,
for me,

241
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:30,421
that whole affair was much less about 
her than about the easy way in which 

242
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,470
people jump onto jingoistic bandwagons 
about things

243
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,650
and also that they demand cancellation.
They demand people getting fired

244
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,610
censorious.
So it's so dictatorial.

245
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:46,611
It's so.
It's so antithetical to everything that 

246
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:47,970
we should value about the kind of the 
great rumbling dialogue of debate.

247
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,450
You know,
the,

248
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,590
the,
the first amendment.

249
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,250
One of the great things about this 
country is a whole bunch of crazy people

250
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,190
shouting at each other

251
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,410
and you know,
hopefully the best idea wins in the end.

252
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,510
You don't shut people down without a 
doubt.

253
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,020
And I think a lot of these people,
they respond.

254
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,070
I think a lot of people were very 
sympathetic to someone who's been 

255
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,950
bullied and they look at marginalized 
people,

256
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,630
whether it's a certain races or genders 
or sexual orientation,

257
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:18,631
and they,
they immediately stand up for those 

258
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:18,631
people because they think those people 
had been bullied and marginalized.

259
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:23,370
But in doing so,
they often resort to the very same 

260
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,450
tactics that are often used against 
these people that are marginalized.

261
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:30,451
They become bullies and they rally the 
troops and that's why this term social 

262
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,370
justice warrior is so apt because 
they're attacking.

263
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,400
This is like this aggressive campaign.
It's not a campaign of psychedelic love 

264
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,890
where they say like,
you,

265
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,050
your,
your perspective is wrong man.

266
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,850
We have to look at this from a different
way.

267
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,590
And like,
you know,

268
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
there's no,
there's no sympathy.

269
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,880
This is like a very aggressive sort of 
movement and you know,

270
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,970
you could say that I think it's possible
to make the argument that there's a 

271
00:12:55,091 --> 00:13:00,091
necessity to some of that because I 
think that the aggression against people

272
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,230
that are,
have been marginalized,

273
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:07,060
the aggression against certain races and
sexual orientations and certain genders,

274
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:11,560
and you could say that it's necessary to
have something equally aggressive in the

275
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,440
opposite direction to sort of achieve 
some type of balance.

276
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,100
I could see that but,
but make sure that what you're targeting

277
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,890
is the actual offense.
Like don't just.

278
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,390
Yes,
that's the thing.

279
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:27,391
I mean if we want to have an actual 
conversation about the boundaries of 

280
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:27,410
satire and let's have that conversation,
right.

281
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,610
It's not canceled core bear and,
and you know,

282
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,680
that I can't have.
Yeah,

283
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,650
you're really having trouble with that.

284
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,670
And I met.
I'm an idiot.

285
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,730
You next time you want to say Kobe just 
in of um,

286
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,660
you know,
it's,

287
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,280
it's so stupid and complicated and it,
what also frustrates me is the fact that

288
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,410
if someone transgressed as a certain 
boundary,

289
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,180
you,
there are certain words that you can say

290
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,450
that immediately give the other person 
the right to disqualify everything 

291
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,120
you're talking about.
There are,

292
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,580
there are,
there are ways.

293
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,600
Like,
I'll give you an example.

294
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,000
Uh,
I'm,

295
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,080
I'm,
I'm constantly dealing with the 

296
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,551
immigration department.
Obviously you can probably tell by my 

297
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:08,551
accent that I wasn't born here.
Uh,

298
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,600
and as far as bureaucracy is go,
I mean it's like,

299
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,870
it's as if the DMV had control of your 
entire existence.

300
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,890
It is just nightmarish.
It's like pulling fingernails just to 

301
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,900
get to do the most basic stuff.
Like what kind of stuff like,

302
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,140
oh,
it's just really renewing your visa 

303
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,140
visa.

304
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Um,
yeah.

305
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,711
I mean,
when you are not American and you're 

306
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:28,711
here and you have to have the right to 
work here,

307
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:32,160
there are certain hoops that you have to
jump through and that the regulations 

308
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,040
are so arcane and so it's so difficult 
to comply with and you know,

309
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:41,041
you fill in a form in triplicate and 
then it goes through a bazillion 

310
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:41,041
different things.
Then it comes back as a different,

311
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:45,840
one line was wrong.
So then you have to go in and you have 

312
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,601
to wait for ages to get a ticket to say 
somebody and then you wait for another 

313
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:48,880
three hours and then they tell you that 
you're at the wrong booth.

314
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,500
So you have to go back.
And I mean it's just,

315
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,130
you know,
dealing with bureaucracy is like,

316
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,160
it's just a horrible thing to deal with.
Um,

317
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,800
but I have no recourse against any of 
that because that's just the power of 

318
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,810
the state and if,
if I want,

319
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,980
want to be able to be here than I have 
to have to cop that.

320
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,500
But last time I came into the country I 
was at wit's end.

321
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:12,501
The battle with stuff.
And the immigration officer at the 

322
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:12,501
airport,
uh,

323
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,480
made a joke.
He said,

324
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,340
I live on A.
Actually,

325
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,500
I can't really tell the story without 
giving away my address,

326
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,540
but that's where I just don't come and 
don't hunt me down on people.

327
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,140
I live on a strong do it.
That won't give you the.

328
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,710
I look at the fucking show listening to 
St Huff Post live man.

329
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,620
Alright.
Alright.

330
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,170
Alright,
I'll beat around the bush,

331
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,220
please do.
Um,

332
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:34,730
I live on it

333
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,200
on a street that has the name of a fruit
that is named after a fruit.

334
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,940
Okay.
Uh,

335
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,270
and he and this,
this guy,

336
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,230
these immigration,
he was like,

337
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,250
oh,
I guess I guess you got a lot of fruits 

338
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,250
there,
Huh?

339
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,250
Oh No.
Right.

340
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,630
So okay.
Stupid like kind of anti gay quip or 

341
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,421
something.
Obviously I don't come across as Super 

342
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,670
Gay.
So he obviously didn't know that I was 

343
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:56,670
gay and he was like,
okay,

344
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,871
that's fine.
I didn't find that particularly 

345
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,161
offensive.
I came out and as I was standing at the 

346
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:02,161
baggage claim,
I was like,

347
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:02,830
oh,
all the indignities that the immigration

348
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,710
department has put me through,
which is so much worse than that.

349
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,430
If I wanted to like get this guy 
sanctioned,

350
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,640
I could complain about that and that 
little thing which was completely 

351
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,990
harmless and stupid would be the one 
thing that they would,

352
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,450
that he would actually get censored for.
Whereas all the other bullshit that I've

353
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:24,451
been put through because it doesn't fit 
into the box of having been 

354
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,510
discriminatory like people can get away 
with,

355
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:26,650
you know,
so if you,

356
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,430
if you make a joke that can be perceived
as being racist,

357
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,700
homophobic,
anything like that,

358
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,430
all of a sudden it's the worst fucking 
thing in the world.

359
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,550
But you can do anything else and you 
don't kind of trip the trip wire.

360
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,870
No,
you're not supposed to make any jokes 

361
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,260
when you're in those situations.
Especially not job.

362
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,620
I'm not,
but he can kenny though if you 

363
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:48,620
complained.
I don't think he can,

364
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,610
but why?
Yeah.

365
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,010
But it,
it frustrates me that that is such a bad

366
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,330
thing.
I don't know.

367
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,450
Like when did we all get together and 
decide that some stupid guy,

368
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,470
he's probably,
you know,

369
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,730
he,
he,

370
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,560
he grew up in a neighborhood where you 
make a joke about fruits.

371
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:05,340
It's not like,
I mean,

372
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:06,900
yes,
it's a stupid thing to do,

373
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,600
we shouldn't do it.
But why is that the worst thing that has

374
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,990
been,
that has been for foisted upon me by the

375
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,800
Immigration Department in the past three
years.

376
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,170
Well,
and what if you were both gay and you 

377
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,460
were making jokes about straight people 
like breeders,

378
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,590
you know,
or he thought you were gay and it turned

379
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:28,591
out you were straight and you know,
he assumed that he could make a joke 

380
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:29,410
about heterosexual people and then you 
like,

381
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,290
this guy's a fucking asshole.
He thought I was heterosexual.

382
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,470
I think everyone just has to take a 
chill pill as saying Australia.

383
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,480
Just say that.
Here we have,

384
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,610
we invented it and we sent it over 
there.

385
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,460
You recycled it back here.
It's pretty new for you.

386
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,490
I'm sure.
We kind of abandoned that in the 

387
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:47,490
eighties and we abandoned that once 
we've invented cars.

388
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,310
I was saying you invented cars in the.
We did 18.

389
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,340
Eighties.
All right.

390
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,190
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure it was pretty funny.

391
00:17:56,191 --> 00:18:01,191
I still don't know minute which 
vernacular is Australia in which been 

392
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:01,410
accurate roads of American and because 
you don't like,

393
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,690
I'll often say things and people like 
and I have no idea.

394
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,950
What did I say that a day.
Oh,

395
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,810
that's right.
Uh,

396
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,460
we will,
we will be able to leave work early.

397
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:08,970
And I was like,
oh,

398
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,500
we get an early mark.
Everyone was like,

399
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,080
what an early mark.
Oh Wow.

400
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,610
I've never heard of that.
But I like,

401
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I've,
I've basically been in the states for 

402
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,620
like 10 years and I still,
because you don't notice what you're not

403
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,840
hearing.
Right,

404
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,910
right.
You don't notice that people aren't 

405
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:24,910
saying early.
Mark.

406
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:24,910
My English friends always say taking the
piss.

407
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,050
Yeah,
sure.

408
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:25,930
You're taking the piss.
Yeah.

409
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,980
Like what the fuck that means that you 
fucking with somebody.

410
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,650
Like if you say are you fucking with 
them?

411
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,690
You make making a joke.
Yeah.

412
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,950
Yeah.
I think we just have to take a chill 

413
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,451
pill and just let ourselves joke about 
like when Greg Fitz was on,

414
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,840
he made some joke that was could have 
been construed as being homophobic or 

415
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:44,840
something.

416
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:44,840
He was.
Oh,

417
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,990
that's right.
It's saying I'm the first guy who asks 

418
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,200
another guy out,
get to fuck him,

419
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,620
and then he was like,
oh,

420
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:54,210
that's terrible.
I shouldn't have said that.

421
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,010
And I was like,
I was screaming into my podcast.

422
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:56,580
Go,
no,

423
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,750
that's fine.
That is a.

424
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,940
That is a joke,
right?

425
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,900
It's obviously a joke.
It's obviously a.

426
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,030
it's kind of a parody of the sort of 
stupid thing that a straight person who 

427
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,990
doesn't know.
People would say like,

428
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,260
yeah,
well people are people worried even 

429
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,901
about a joke that is not mean like a 
joke about like a Joe.

430
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,590
You can make a joke about black guys 
having big dicks and someone could say 

431
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,431
that's racist like,
but isn't it a good thing to have a big 

432
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:32,850
like it's racist in a positive way.
Even racist in a pot and it's what we 

433
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,150
were talking about earlier.

434
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,210
People are just at the starting block 
looking to get upset,

435
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,700
but Sarah Silverman has a bit about 
that.

436
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,870
She was on the.
Yeah,

437
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,390
I think she was on Conan years ago and 
she was like,

438
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,490
um,
is it racist to say like,

439
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,960
I love chinks and she had the bitch he 
had wanted to do.

440
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,520
She nixed it was she wanted to be like,
I love the n word.

441
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,670
I love like,
and she would have actually said it on 

442
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:58,670
the air.
So yeah,

443
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:58,670
Nigga.
Oh,

444
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,030
can't believe you said it.
Yeah,

445
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,780
you can get in trouble just for that.
I know.

446
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,140
Then I hate saying the n word.
I think it's so stupid and facile,

447
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,240
but it's great if you're black and you 
can just call your friends at.

448
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,270
Well I listen,
I,

449
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I do have some empathy for minorities 
being able to reclaim terminology and I 

450
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,150
do think that a black person that has 
the right to say it,

451
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,550
like we've screwed it for 400 years.

452
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,740
The least we can do is let you say the 
word that we can't say.

453
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,970
Well,
it wasn't we,

454
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,850
but I agree with you mean you say we,
but I mean really,

455
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,740
I had nothing to do with it.
You had nothing to do with it.

456
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,660
I'm pretty sure Jamie's never owned any 
slaves.

457
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,590
Yeah.
But we still have the benefit.

458
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,100
We benefit from an institutional system 
that had,

459
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,760
that took advantage of that.
So check your white privilege,

460
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,840
right?
Josh steps.

461
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,550
Do we have the APP yet?
Can I get a check?

462
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,970
They come around,
uh,

463
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,340
for,
for,

464
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,110
for,
as far as,

465
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,340
yeah.
Who's at 10?

466
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,420
Like Dick Cheney?

467
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

468
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,430
I'm Sean Hannity,
Rockefeller's,

469
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,020
Sean Hannity,
you know,

470
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,080
those guys were there just like they 
complete this so privileged that they 

471
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,120
don't even,
they're not even aware of how privileged

472
00:20:59,121 --> 00:20:59,260
they are.

473
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,810
I would love to get Sean Hannity fucked 
up on mushrooms.

474
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,830
What would come out?
Crying tears.

475
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,690
A lot of tears.
Lot of sadness.

476
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,250
A lot of reality.

477
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,170
Yeah.
More.

478
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Or would he just dessert?
Would he just peel away like an 

479
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,730
invisible onion and there's nothing 
underneath the shell.

480
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,130
Most likely.
I mean,

481
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:21,790
essentially he's cold bear in a real 
life for them.

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,870
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

483
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,190
That's what he is.
I said it right.

484
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,760
Yeah,
that's good.

485
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,860
Good.
Good boy.

486
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,870
Thank you.
Um,

487
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,180
he's a parody.
It's a parody without knowing that he's 

488
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,970
a parody and it's a lot of the way bill 
o'reilly is.

489
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,750
It's like they play to these people with
nine volt brains.

490
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,050
They have these people that live in is 
very small box of ideology and this box 

491
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,320
only contains a few support our troops 
and Falcon the need to keep my guns and 

492
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,560
gays are trying to fucking marry and 
that's going to ruin the and Obama's a 

493
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,800
fucking Muslim.
It's like this box these people live in 

494
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,960
and if you can fit into that box 
project,

495
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,850
that frequency,
you can make a lot of money.

496
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,280
It's the same as what we're talking 
about,

497
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,690
about the labels,
you know,

498
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,810
they basically,
they live in a world of labels and 

499
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:11,810
order.
Yeah.

500
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:11,910
Um,
and you know,

501
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,590
people,
especially Sean Hannity,

502
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:18,591
I think Bill O'reilly is a smarter Guy 
Than Shawn Hannity and sometimes 

503
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:21,771
diverges from the orthodoxy,
but Hannity is literally a puppet for a 

504
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:26,150
grab bag of,
of pre packaged ideas that come from 

505
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:26,940
Roger ailes.
And that's it.

506
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,780
He's a spokes means just a spokesperson.
There's no independent thinking going on

507
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:35,781
there and profits from that and I mean,
I think that happens on the other side 

508
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:36,690
as well.
Going back to the whole canceled Kobe.

509
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:41,691
I think the people who are,
who are doing that are also just 

510
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:43,080
plucking out of a preset,
um,

511
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,140
you know,
it's a jigsaw puzzle box when they've 

512
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,780
got all the little pieces of things that
they believe and they're not open to 

513
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,510
listening to other people or considering
new ideas.

514
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,500
What is this something that's Suey Park 
tweeted during that time

515
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,630
period.
Racism and whiteness go together.

516
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:01,530
Only white people can be racist.
I mean,

517
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,120
that's just a product that is so 
awesome.

518
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:11,121
What is the question?
You're assuming that whites are more 

519
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,941
racist than others and that racism by 
whites is worse than racism by first 

520
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,130
versus whites.
Dumb question.

521
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:20,310
Racism and whiteness go together.
Only white people can be racist.

522
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,840
That is awesome.

523
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
I,
it just depends on you.

524
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,980
Then she's just not using the term 
racist.

525
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,120
She's in the bears,
which he is.

526
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,460
Yeah,
she's at Cole bear on the other side.

527
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,790
She's Sean Hannity,
you mean?

528
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,590
Well,
both.

529
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,030
She's a female parody.
Yeah.

530
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Kobe.
The character without willing to do 

531
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,700
willing fully doing it.
Yeah.

532
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,110
Without consciously doing it.
She's doing that.

533
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,730
Yeah.
That's what that was saying,

534
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,160
that only white people can be racist.

535
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,230
Jesus Christ.
That's so crazy.

536
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,760
Did you.
I mean any.

537
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,810
Anybody that has seen the.
The riots in La when they pulled white 

538
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,730
people out of cars and hit him in the 
head with bricks,

539
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,790
I'm pretty sure that's kind of racist 
about what they did to the Korean 

540
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,190
community and so fucking Korean.
Exactly.

541
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,480
Absolutely.
No racism.

542
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,030
Exactly.
I mean just a child.

543
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,420
It's a child with ideas that don't 
really vet out under scrutiny.

544
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,800
What offends me more frankly about that 
particular tweet than the house been how

545
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,810
stupid it is.
Just the mangling of the English 

546
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,120
language in abusing the word racism.
So much like I'm an English major.

547
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,750
She's just not using the word racism in 
the meaning of the word.

548
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,170
If racism means that you judge people on
the basis of their rights rather than on

549
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,970
the basis of their individual 
attributes,

550
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,050
then of course just definitionally 
anyone can be racist,

551
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,920
have any rights.

552
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,000
Of course,
not only that,

553
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,150
there's many people inside of a race 
that are racist towards others that vary

554
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,690
in that race.
There are many black people that are 

555
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,030
racist against darker black people.
Right.

556
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,250
That is a fact.
That's a fact.

557
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Often discussed in the African American 
community and it happens in Asian 

558
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280
communities.
That happens in India a lot.

559
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,760
There are,
you know,

560
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,880
there are seven eleven's in India that 
have full of face creams that make your 

561
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,730
skin water.
Yes,

562
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,430
absolutely.
Well,

563
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,000
in the Philippines Gludethyon,
which is a,

564
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,100
an amino acid or an antioxidant,
rather.

565
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,720
They inject glutathione and they,
they,

566
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:10,160
they use it as a way of bleaching the 
skin.

567
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:14,540
It's like a very common practice.
It's bizarre and it's roots are not just

568
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,040
in,
it's not a cosmetic thing.

569
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:21,041
It's a race thing because look,
there's a lot of white people that are 

570
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:21,290
fucking tanning themselves,
so they look like orange,

571
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:21,960
you know?

572
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,240
I mean,
what is that?

573
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,380
That's an aesthetic,
right?

574
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:26,470
They're trying to look different.
These people are there.

575
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,530
They're trying to be wider.
Yeah.

576
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,470
It's,
it's a really creepy thing.

577
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,980
Yeah.
And if you want to end up with a world,

578
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:38,981
I mean,
something that I'm passionate about 

579
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:39,650
working towards and I hope will 
eventually happen is a world in which we

580
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:44,651
have basically ignored rice to the 
greatest possible extent where we are 

581
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:47,780
all just treating each other as 
individual human beings.

582
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,550
Trying to find what's special about one 
another,

583
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,940
giving people,
giving each other the benefit of the 

584
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:54,940
doubt and not teaming up against each 
other.

585
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,830
How do you best foster that?
How do you best bring about that?

586
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:02,831
You don't do it,
I don't think by hunkering down into 

587
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:06,191
your tribe and throwing pot shots at 
other people because of their race or 

588
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:06,191
agenda.
I mean,

589
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:06,860
give me a break.

590
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah,
I agree.

591
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,190
I think it's actually happening now and 
I think that what we're seeing in this 

592
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,320
cancel Colbert thing and what we're 
seeing with these social justice 

593
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,810
warriors,
although I think it's ill advised,

594
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,030
I think what it is is the adolescent 
stage of this growth,

595
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,030
this social growth that we're undergoing
right now,

596
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,180
and I think that we're in this process 
of understanding each other that is 

597
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,780
unprecedented as process of exchanging 
information that is unprecedented.

598
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,300
And I think that the negative aspects of
it is that,

599
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:35,870
yeah,
you know,

600
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,980
you have to deal with some people that 
do have limited patterns of thinking and

601
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,050
they'll just,
you know,

602
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,270
Hashtag cancel Colbert and Suny Park's

603
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,290
my hero and you get all that kind of 
shit.

604
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,700
But I think this is a long process of 
hundreds of years.

605
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,360
But in this process,
and this,

606
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,160
this,
the time that I've been alive,

607
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:00,210
I was born in 1967,
so between 67 and 2014,

608
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:05,190
where we're at right now has been in 
epic change in culture.

609
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,930
I mean,
unbelievable.

610
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,390
When I was a child.
Um,

611
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,470
I,
I was born in New Jersey and I moved to 

612
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,491
San Francisco when I was seven and I 
grew up around a lot of different 

613
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:17,070
people,
so I didn't,

614
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,130
I did.
There's a lot of things that I didn't 

615
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,290
understand about like racism and 
homophobia.

616
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,750
I,
when I moved to Florida,

617
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,680
I was 11 years old when I moved to 
Florida and um,

618
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,240
my um,
my neighbor,

619
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,680
this kid that I used to hang out with 
his,

620
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,920
his dad was getting super angry that 
black people or that gay people rather 

621
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,480
we're allowed to get married and he 
through this fucking newspaper down 

622
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,480
because you can't fucking believe this 
shit.

623
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,030
They're trying to get married.
And I remember it was 11,

624
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,660
a fucking silly bitch.
This guy is like,

625
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:48,150
what do you give a fuck?
My neighbors were gay in San Francisco.

626
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,190
I grew up next to gay people.
They were always there.

627
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,320
I did.
I totally didn't understand it.

628
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,740
And between that and today it is very 
rare that you come across someone who 

629
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,870
actually gets angry in any urban 
environment.

630
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Yep.
The gay people were going to get 

631
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:05,900
married.
It's pretty much accepted like hook me.

632
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:05,900
There's the,
the.

633
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,300
There was always this economic argument 
about fucking insurance and some,

634
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,520
but I always felt like those were 
bullshit arguments because how is that 

635
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,571
affecting.
You don't really raising your insurance 

636
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:17,571
rates

637
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,140
and understand all that stuff.
It's like when jared did you,

638
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,470
did you notice my interview with Jeremy 
on it by any chance last year?

639
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,480
It blew up momentarily when he said that
for a minute.

640
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,230
What's his word?
And he basically said if you have gay 

641
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,621
marriage than a father could marry his 
son to avoid death taxes because if you 

642
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:41,081
want it to pass on his estate,
then then you could marry your son and 

643
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:45,350
then you'd be transferring the property 
to your spouse instead of to a kid.

644
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,190
I guess you could.
This is Jeremy Irons and actor,

645
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,410
the actor Academy Academy Award winning 
actor,

646
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,290
but it was probably just pointing 
something out.

647
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,200
That's right.
That's right.

648
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,990
And then the British,
because he's very,

649
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:59,960
very famous in the UK.
The British press picked this up and you

650
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:04,961
know,
how crazy the British tabloids can be 

651
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:04,961
and it was like a huge,
huge firestorm over there.

652
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:05,150
Um,
and I felt bad.

653
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:10,151
I felt sorry for him because it was a,
you know what it's like when you do a 

654
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:10,151
long interview and you just say 
something,

655
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:10,820
you know,
it was a 33 minute interview and he's,

656
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:13,430
he,
he mused on that in like the 31st minute

657
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:18,431
of the interview and if you know,
you just chatting on a couch feels 

658
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:21,731
casual.
He just thinks he's rising a kind of 

659
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:23,471
thought experiment and then the British 
press will go crazy about Jeremy Irons 

660
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,550
speaks out against gay marriage in a 
slightly unfair way,

661
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,720
but that's the kind of like stupid us 
thought experiment that obviously.

662
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,540
So if that ever happened then you would 
just change the law about incest,

663
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,300
right?
Right.

664
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,820
It's a nonissue.

665
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,710
Is it legal to marry your son?
No,

666
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,830
not even legal.
No.

667
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,060
No,
I don't think so,

668
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,270
but maybe it is.
I don't know.

669
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,360
It's hard to imagine whether or not they
would ever actually bothered to write 

670
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,970
that law because what if a son,
I mean,

671
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,280
let's throw this out there.
It's even more offensive would.

672
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:59,281
If a son and a father,
they're both consenting adults and they 

673
00:29:59,281 --> 00:29:59,281
decide they love each other.
No one have sex all the time.

674
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,890
Who's to say that that's bad?
If they like it,

675
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,220
they both like it.
If the sun's 30 and the father is 50 and

676
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:06,940
they said,
Look Dad,

677
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:08,110
I think you fucking hot.
Let's.

678
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,460
If they both agree.
I mean if you're not talking about 

679
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,161
children you're talking about and 
there's no history of sex between them 

680
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,940
whatsoever.
There's no slow indoctrination by the 

681
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:20,960
dad.
Look,

682
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,710
I basically think that we should have 
the largest amount of freedom.

683
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,680
Yes.
It's consistent with a society that in a

684
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:31,681
culture that function,
so I wouldn't say that that should be 

685
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,871
against the law,
but it's hard to disentangle that from 

686
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:34,120
the power differential there is between 
a father and a son.

687
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,030
It's to imagine dirty.
My Dad.

688
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,140
No,
no fucking power over me when I was 30.

689
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,380
Yeah.
I think that certain point in time,

690
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,810
I mean 40 and 60,
you know,

691
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,250
you're really older men and if it was 
like 120 140,

692
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,790
then now we're talking.
But that's hard to fuck a hundred 20 

693
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:52,930
year old man they break.
Yeah.

694
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,280
You know,
I just don't.

695
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,370
I just don't think there's anything 
wrong with two people that consent to do

696
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,160
what they both enjoyed doing.
And I know this is a weird example,

697
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,090
but I think that as long as they both 
enjoy it,

698
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,280
like why do we care?
And we care because of the confines of 

699
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,280
culture.

700
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,270
It's one of the interesting things about
animals.

701
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,900
Bonobo monkeys will have sex with 
everybody except the mother will not 

702
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,510
have sex with,
with the sun.

703
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,390
That's interesting.
The father has sex with the sons,

704
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,480
the father of sex of the daughters.
The brothers and sisters have sex.

705
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,850
Brothers have sex with each other.
Everybody has sex with everybody.

706
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:31,240
Everyone's gay.
They're all bisexual except the mothers.

707
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,200
I get out of here,
bitch.

708
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,150
No Dick from you.
Interesting.

709
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Yeah.
That's the only the only boundary that 

710
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,300
they will not cross,
which is fascinating.

711
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,600
I should emphasize that if people are 
watching this and I look horribly 

712
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:43,830
claiming it's because I'm sick.
You don't look clammy,

713
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,770
you look fine to do by.
Um.

714
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,230
Yeah.
And I appreciate you getting in here and

715
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:51,100
doing this.
I really do.

716
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,660
No problem.
I,

717
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm allowed to pollute you.
I didn't want to pollute anyone else in 

718
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:57,900
the house was fine.

719
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,530
I take antibiotics.
You'll be okay.

720
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,440
And there's only two of you in here.
I didn't want to never get sick.

721
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,910
The kids,
a fucking soldier really?

722
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,150
He'll be fine.
Good for him.

723
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,410
Um,
but again,

724
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:10,450
it's sort of the same thing that Jeremy 
Irons thing.

725
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,040
It's this desire to be offended or this 
green light to be offended.

726
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,230
You see the green light go hit the gas.
We got one.

727
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,320
We got an opening time to be pissed.
I do think that this is a part of a 

728
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,851
process.
I think this is a part of a process of 

729
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:31,300
along with the erosion of privacy,
along with the,

730
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,390
the symbiotic connection that we have to
technology which is connecting us and 

731
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,250
some sort of very strange way and this 
erosion of privacy,

732
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,130
symbiotic nature.

733
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,280
Of the,
the technological world that we live in,

734
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:48,430
and then on top of that,
all these opinions that are coming in 

735
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,910
like this distribution method of twitter
and social media and facebook.

736
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:55,150
You could just,
you could make a facebook post that 

737
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,550
resonates and within a couple days 
fucking millions of people can see it.

738
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,630
Hey,
alex from target.

739
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,190
Who's Alex from target.
Oh,

740
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,840
you've been up in the woods.
I have.

741
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,170
There's been a viral meme last week.
What happened?

742
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,050
I want to talk about,
you know,

743
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,080
Canada holidays.
Well,

744
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,660
um,
uh,

745
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,480
there was this photo of this,
of this 15 year old checkout guy at 

746
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,861
target who was cute and a girl tweeted 
it and twitter blew up with just 

747
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,910
retweets of this picture of this kid who
suddenly begun.

748
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,180
He went from 144 twitter followers to 
600,000

749
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,940
twitter followers in like 24 hours.
Holy Shit.

750
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,950
Just because teenage girls thought he 
was adorable.

751
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,860
He ended up on Ellen.
Oh my God.

752
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,210
Yeah.
Alex from twitter.

753
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,030
Hashtag Alex from twitter.
Blew up the world,

754
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,370
blew up,
blew up the incident.

755
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,260
He is a little cutie pie.
Let's look at Alan.

756
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,510
Good for her.
She's the best.

757
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,100
She's awesome at that.
Um,

758
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:51,101
so yeah,
I mean when you're talking about how 

759
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:52,691
things can just spiral out of control,
this connectedness is insane.

760
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:57,731
The spontaneity I'm a little bit worried
about whether it's getting too crazy.

761
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:03,671
Like,
I mean it reminds me like Nuremberg or 

762
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:06,881
something.
It's like what happens if you get a 

763
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:07,100
bunch of crazy bigots?
What,

764
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,500
what happens if you multiply the thing 
that happened with,

765
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,500
to me with cancel callback by a million 
times.

766
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Like he could just overwhelm your 
consciousness,

767
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,690
can overwhelm your life.
You can,

768
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:24,170
but,
but your life is going to be different.

769
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,610
I mean,
it's changed Alex's life,

770
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:26,180
that's for sure.

771
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,230
For sure.
Damn sure.

772
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,780
Do you know what that kid's father must 
be like all day,

773
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:34,781
but he's had winning propositions.
I'm sure it's probably just the amount 

774
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:39,961
of sheer photos of vaginas sent his way.
His iphone going to need one of these 

775
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:44,300
big 128 gigs and so,
oh Labia.

776
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Although I just is just getting bombed.
Or imagine if he becomes like a famous 

777
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:53,210
person,
like he gets a reality show or something

778
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:54,620
like that.
And why not?

779
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:56,720
I mean if honey booboo can get one,
how about,

780
00:34:56,721 --> 00:35:01,010
you know Alex from target when you're 
talking about the Bonobos as well,

781
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:06,011
like that's a whole other element of 
human sexuality that you can open up in 

782
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:10,481
terms of terms of overcoming labels and 
overcoming the way that we think about 

783
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:11,780
each other and the boxes that society 
wants to sort of fill us in.

784
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:17,110
There been a lot of societies where 
people were a lot more bisexual than 

785
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,720
they are in this society right now.

786
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,870
Almost all of them in ancient Rome and 
Paris in the 19th century and a lot of 

787
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Polynesian islands and things like that.
So in the great kind of sweep of trying 

788
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:35,261
to become a culture that's more 
accepting of individuals and 

789
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:39,521
individuality.
That's something that I hope happens 

790
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:43,371
that you,
that we do where we are less sort of 

791
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,261
judgmental about the way that we think 
about each other's sexuality.

792
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:50,361
And I think that sometimes the gay.
I'm kind of going off on a bit of a 

793
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:50,490
tangent here,
but just while it occurs to me sometimes

794
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,920
the gay community or the gay lobby,
the extremely,

795
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,360
you know,
pro gay lobby can do a disservice to the

796
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,820
sort of mission of sexual fulfillment by
requiring you to pick a team by 

797
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,550
requiring you to buy,
but making it seem like gayness has a 

798
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,321
certain politics and has a certain 
fashion style and has a certain way of 

799
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:13,670
speaking and way of behaving and that 
you have to defend that and,

800
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,770
and fight for it.
Why can't you just Shag who you want and

801
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:17,200
love anymore,

802
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,960
you know,
by picking a team.

803
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:22,080
Is that an issue in the gay community?
Like if someone is gay,

804
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,880
then they decided to be straight for a 
little while.

805
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,550
They get criticism.
Yeah.

806
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,720
That's funny.
Well,

807
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:31,510
I mean imagine if.
Yeah,

808
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,260
that's like the opposite of what they 
should be promoting.

809
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:39,261
I mean,
the whole idea about the ability to be 

810
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:39,720
gay was like,
leave me alone.

811
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,550
Let me do what I want to.
If I'm not,

812
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,950
you know,
if I'm not hurting anybody,

813
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,440
if it's consensual,
if this is what we both enjoy doing,

814
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,470
why do you care?
Why do you care?

815
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,790
Because you have to care.
Because this is,

816
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,790
this is a fight that we have to fight,
you know,

817
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,180
can,
can a person also like this.

818
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,940
If you're a meat eater,
can you have a salad?

819
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,650
I mean,
if you're a vegetarian,

820
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,790
you're right,
you don't eat meat.

821
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,430
But if you're a person who eats meat,
can you have a fucking salad?

822
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,070
If I see you eating a salad like we do 
with that salad,

823
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:08,430
pussy

824
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,750
and like,
then that's great.

825
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,810
But it's also not like a.
If something,

826
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:20,811
if like a tiny flick of animal blood has
like been on one of the pieces that one 

827
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,820
of the billions of pieces of lettuce 
that you ate,

828
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:26,130
like that's not a sin.
You know what I mean?

829
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:27,130
Like their,
uh,

830
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,160
their uh,
their,

831
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,600
uh,
now at some whole foods different,

832
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,270
um,
uh,

833
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:37,310
what do you call them?
Bread cutting machines for the organic 

834
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,681
bread and the nonorganic bread because 
people are so crazy about their organic 

835
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:42,921
bread that they don't want to crumb of 
non organic bread to touch the organic 

836
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,310
bread.
That is a religion.

837
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,200
Just cry,
cry.

838
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,740
They don't understand what organic even 
means and then when you're having bread,

839
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:51,840
okay,
this is the reality of food.

840
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,870
If you are having bread,
it is changed from the wheat that used 

841
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,210
to exist in the early 19 hundreds from 
the early 19 hundreds to today.

842
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:05,211
The wheat that you have has been 
modified and genetically modified.

843
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,670
It's not genetically modified in a 
laboratory where they're splicing genes,

844
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,890
but it is the sense of natural 
selection.

845
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,920
They've they've.
They've selected on natural manmade 

846
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,910
splicing plants together with scalpels 
and shit.

847
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,180
What they've done is creating.
They've created a heartier plant that 

848
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,440
can survive better,
has better yields,

849
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,810
and it's.
I mean,

850
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,820
what is organic?
It just means it doesn't have 

851
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:31,820
pesticides.
That's right.

852
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:31,820
I think that's the main thing they care 
about when you're slicing and you're not

853
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,070
getting in front on pesticide stupid 
because it becomes a kind of a spiritual

854
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,180
thing almost.
It's like a,

855
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,460
it's like you have to pray to the gods 
of the organic.

856
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,510
God's.
Yeah.

857
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,440
Well the vegetarian option,
you know the whole thing.

858
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,560
My favorite is the vegans who have cats.
Yeah,

859
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,840
because guess what?
Fuck face.

860
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,830
You're not a Vegan.
If you're fucking buyin murdered animals

861
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,090
that are stuffed into cans for little 
tabby and you see all these people,

862
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,370
they have their cats and they don't 
believe in animal cruelty,

863
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,070
but yet the fucking cats.
Those cats are cool as shit.

864
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,450
I have this,
I have two cats,

865
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:07,240
but I have one cat.
She's this big fluff ball.

866
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,100
She's 18 years old.
I've had it forever.

867
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,850
She's a sweetheart.
She Meat Company come near me.

868
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:12,990
I was at Yale.
You pick her up.

869
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,950
She starts purring immediately.
She's the best cat.

870
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,400
She's a fucking murderer.
If I leave her outside in the courtyard 

871
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,360
and a bird is stupid enough to come near
her,

872
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,600
she will snatch that fucker.

873
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,600
I have a sky,
snap it's neck and bring it in and drop 

874
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:28,600
it at my feet.
Yeah,

875
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:28,600
and she thinks it's fun.
I mean,

876
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,490
she's not hungry.
She's not starving to death.

877
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,000
She does that shift for a goof.
She's a fucking bowl of food.

878
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,940
They're full all the time.
She wants.

879
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,330
She can eat.
She's a fucking murderer and that's what

880
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,340
you have.
If you are a Vegan with a cat,

881
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:45,070
you are harboring murderers and if 
you're not,

882
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,490
if you're not,
if you're one of those crazy fucks that 

883
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,070
tries to feed your cat some sort of 
vegetable based food,

884
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,200
you're killing your fucking cat.
Okay?

885
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:58,201
That cat's going to have organ failure.
They're going to go blind is also too 

886
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,340
crazy shit that happens to cats when you
try to feed them vegetables.

887
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,280
There's this weird sense in which the 
kind of Vegan movement,

888
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:08,281
and I have to say I have a fair bit of 
sympathy for them because I do think 

889
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:08,281
that the way that we.

890
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,440
What we've done to industrialize 
agriculture is a travesty.

891
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,530
Horrible,
so we will look back in 100 years that 

892
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,050
the way that we simply treat animals 
purely on the basis of,

893
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,140
of minimizing the cost,
the number of pennies that we have to 

894
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,180
say Scott's down of their flesh and we 
will.

895
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,710
I think we will regard that as almost 
being like a slight,

896
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,020
a form of slavery.
I think it will be so morally abhorrent,

897
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:33,270
but the response to that,
my response to that is similar to your 

898
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,691
response to that which is alright,
let's try to feel more like we're part 

899
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:40,171
of an ecosystem in which we actually a 
more related to the food that we're 

900
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,251
eating into the animals whose lives were
taking and let's have some comic 

901
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:44,560
responsibility for that rather than just
buying,

902
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,990
you know,
chicken breast in Styrofoam and trying 

903
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:49,990
not to think about the chicken that it 
actually came from.

904
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,030
I don't think the correct response is 
the Vegan response,

905
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:57,031
which is to sort of imagine that 
humankind is distinct and disjointed and

906
00:40:57,101 --> 00:41:00,250
detached from the rest of the ecosystem 
and the like.

907
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,240
The what the cat does to the bird is 
fine because that's natural.

908
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,630
But for us to eat meat is not natural 
because what we're morally conscious 

909
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,800
creatures who aren't part of the 
ecosystem.

910
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:14,710
We are out of the ecosystem.
Like you can have a problem with the way

911
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:19,711
that certain types of food are raised,
but I don't think it's kind of morally 

912
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:24,400
consistent to think that we,
we,

913
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,990
that it's wrong for us to partake in the
same kind of cycle of life,

914
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,120
that the rest of that all other species 
do.

915
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,560
The idea is that we are

916
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,240
the highest form of animal on this 
planet because unlike dolphins,

917
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:42,410
we can actually alter our environment 
and I think dolphins are probably in the

918
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:45,290
same range as far as intelligence goes.
If human beings,

919
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,710
they have incredible minds,
they have dialects,

920
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:51,530
they have the ability to communicate,
they formed bonds and packs.

921
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,531
They play with people and also they 
don't show any violence whatsoever 

922
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:59,981
towards human beings,
but human being show violence towards 

923
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:02,111
dolphins.
So there's a lot of like really super 

924
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,430
positive characteristics about wild 
dolphins that quite quite fascinating.

925
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,590
More so than even monkeys or chimps.
Chimps don't eat babies.

926
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,240
Chimps will steal human babies and eat 
them.

927
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,430
They'll rip your face off their fucking 
horrible monsters.

928
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,690
That's our closest relatives,
so it could be argued that in some way,

929
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:16,790
even though dolphins can alter their 
environment,

930
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,060
they have a,
a very commensurate level of 

931
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,641
intelligence that human beings have,
but we consider ourselves the highest 

932
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,090
because we can alter our environment 
because we have opposable thumbs and the

933
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:26,510
whole deal.

934
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,510
Um,
but if,

935
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:34,490
if you are the highest form,
you should set the highest standards.

936
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,550
Our understanding and our ability to 
communicate these ideas lead us to this 

937
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,220
thing where we say,
okay,

938
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,480
we are causing animal suffering and 
cruelty that is unnecessary and I want 

939
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,780
to leave the smallest footprint 
possible.

940
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,520
I want to grow my own vegetables,
eating them.

941
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:50,410
And that's it.
Yeah,

942
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,550
sure.
But they also won't even eat eggs,

943
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,230
which is ridiculous.
I have chickens,

944
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:59,231
I have 24 chickens.
They lay eggs every day and they don't 

945
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:01,991
care if you take them.
Chickens never become a chicken because 

946
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:05,171
there's no rooster,
so they just lay an egg and you can eat 

947
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:07,211
that egg and it's super healthy.
Would they have a problem with eating 

948
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:07,211
human eggs?
I don't know.

949
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:11,860
I have a joke about that,
about if your wife was in the period 

950
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:11,860
every,
every month,

951
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,590
once a year or once a month,
rather,

952
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,030
they had an egg,
dropped an egg,

953
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:20,710
which,
what would you do if it can't become a 

954
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:20,710
person?

955
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:20,710
We just let it go to waste.
You ate it,

956
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,590
throw it in the backyard.
Let it fucking go.

957
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,110
Finalize your food.
That's the other thing.

958
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:29,111
Like why do it,
why are we so speciesist about what 

959
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:29,111
species where we.
I mean I've,

960
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:30,770
I have,
I've eaten dog in Vietnam.

961
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,130
And did you eat dog?
Yeah,

962
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,410
I mean,
what was that like?

963
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,360
Not Great.
That weird you out?

964
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,730
Um,
I kind of felt like,

965
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:42,731
again,
I almost felt like it was a moral 

966
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:44,621
responsibility to do so because I eat 
pigs which are at least as intelligent 

967
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:45,110
as jugs and show as much empathy as 
Doug's.

968
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,540
So why?
Where is it morally consistent for me to

969
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,970
be okayed and bacon and not.
Okay.

970
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,410
Eating dog.
That's just bias.

971
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,520
My friend.
Ada Coyote.

972
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,870
Cool.
Yeah.

973
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,970
It was for a mediator.
My friend Steve Rinella,

974
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,370
because he was tired of people asking 
them.

975
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:03,371
He's a,
it's a hunting show and he's very 

976
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:03,920
unusual for hunter,
very educated,

977
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,750
very well read,
and very articulate,

978
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,650
and he was tired of people asking him,
have you ever eaten a coyote?

979
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,810
So fucking shot a coyote and ate it.
It cooked,

980
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,020
cooked it on the show.
That's great.

981
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,120
Yeah,
and you know it wasn't bad.

982
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,840
I guess mates mate.
I don't know about that.

983
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,030
It varies.
I mean certainly varies.

984
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,490
There's a big difference between some 
forms of meat.

985
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,580
I mean,
I don't mean to say that all that.

986
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,900
However you rise,
mate,

987
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,980
it's all the same thing,
but I think a wild

988
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,670
species of wild species,
it's going to have flesh that is edible.

989
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,090
Most likely edible.
I've never heard of anybody eating a 

990
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:41,800
wolf except for that movie.
The gray thing on that,

991
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,820
but it tastes like shit.
Apparently there's certain animals to 

992
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,081
just tastes really bad.
Like a friend just got back from Africa 

993
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:52,380
and he said the one thing that the local
villagers will not eat.

994
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,000
His hyena.
Oh yeah,

995
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,760
they'll even eat lion.
I can imagine that they'll eat lion.

996
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:00,510
Apparently Mountain Lion is delicious.
Yeah.

997
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:05,511
I've talked to all these hunters that 
say that mountain lion and there's all 

998
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:05,511
these mountain lion rest.
I googled it.

999
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:07,050
There's mountain lion recipes online.
Yeah.

1000
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,360
They say it tastes like pork.
Well,

1001
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,820
yeah.
I mean why you say kangaroo a lot.

1002
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:16,821
Back in Australia,
that's an increasingly popular 

1003
00:45:16,821 --> 00:45:16,821
maintenance.
Australia is a real great.

1004
00:45:16,821 --> 00:45:17,190
Like Venice.
It's very gamey and lean.

1005
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,690
Really delicious.

1006
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,750
They are.
I didn't know how fucking muscular 

1007
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,750
Kangaroos.
Jesus Christ.

1008
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,090
You ever seen the video of the kangaroo 
choking the other kangaroo unconscious?

1009
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,550
No.
Oh my God.

1010
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,830
I probably opposed to see this as.
As an Australian.

1011
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,150
Yes.
It's fairly recent.

1012
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,540
These two kangaroos are involved in a 
fight and this one kangaroo gets this 

1013
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,261
other kangaroo and a fucking choke hold 
with his arms and clamps down on the 

1014
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:46,311
Kangaroos neck and literally gets into a
Jujitsu position and puts this fucking 

1015
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:48,720
kangaroo and the kangaroo just 
collapses.

1016
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,730
Meet good.
Chokes the blood out of it has to have 

1017
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,780
some sort of a thought process behind 
doing that.

1018
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:56,550
Yeah,
sure.

1019
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,720
I mean,
they're an interesting.

1020
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,640
It's such an interesting species in 
Australia and flowing.

1021
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:05,810
The reason why Australia has all these 
weird animals is because it broke off 

1022
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,960
from the rest of the continents in the 
company before,

1023
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:07,740
only the other students.

1024
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,320
That was our logo one hundreds of 
millions of years,

1025
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,200
so there's a parallel evolution 
essentially,

1026
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:18,201
and if you look at the face of a 
kangaroo and you look at the face of a 

1027
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:18,201
deer,
very similar,

1028
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,480
very similar.
They occupy basically the same 

1029
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,730
ecological niche,
but because Australia was a here at his 

1030
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:25,730
video will say,
well,

1031
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,800
check the.
Because Australia broke off so early.

1032
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:31,000
They would just get these random like 
this.

1033
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,440
The beauty of I love evolution.
I think it's just so interesting because

1034
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:39,441
I guess they've got longer distances to 
cross in Australia and they did 

1035
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:39,441
elsewhere and it's dry and arid.
For some reason.

1036
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:40,580
They just stopped bouncing it basically 
bouncing,

1037
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:43,050
dear wow.
And on two legs.

1038
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,180
The other weird that.
Well there's a.

1039
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,300
there's an animal called the diker,
which is a type of antelope that lives 

1040
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,801
in the Congo that can actually swim 
underwater as much as a hundred yards 

1041
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,890
and eat fish.
It's a fucking carnivorous antelope.

1042
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:02,610
They've all evolved,
apparently with the Congo used to be was

1043
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,320
grasslands and as the climate changed,
it became a rain forest and as it became

1044
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:12,321
a rain forest,
a lot of these animals that are 

1045
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:13,380
traditionally grassland animals became 
trapped like rhinos.

1046
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,410
There's rhinos that are trapped in the 
rain forest of the Congo and all these 

1047
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,050
antelope and deer that are running 
through these swamps and the swampy like

1048
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,090
forest thick,
thick,

1049
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:29,091
thick wooded areas and this one animal 
figured out a way to get smaller

1050
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,280
and actually swim under one.
Are these short little legs good for 

1051
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,280
him.
Fucking crazy though,

1052
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,450
and this all happened over a period of 
like 2000 years.

1053
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:39,360
It wasn't like a long time.
Yes.

1054
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,350
The very short amount of time.
It is true.

1055
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,710
Yeah.
It's a fascinating thing about the 

1056
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,710
Congo.
Wow.

1057
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,840
Yeah.
This area where these natural selection,

1058
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:50,800
it's got to be some other force at work.
No natural selection

1059
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,730
full of jeans that quickly and just a 
couple of thousand years,

1060
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:54,480
but maybe you.

1061
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,640
I'm talking about school,
obviously I'm not a geneticist,

1062
00:47:56,641 --> 00:48:01,641
but I think there's been some evidence 
of extreme changes in evolution over a 

1063
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:03,360
very short period of time.
Like for instance,

1064
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:07,800
people that live in Hewitt,
people that live in the extreme northern

1065
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:12,801
areas,
they've developed this ability to not 

1066
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:15,621
get frostbite and to also keep their 
hands warm and extreme cold conditions 

1067
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,980
and they believe that this has happened 
between a 10,000

1068
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,160
plus years ago when the ice bridge 
between the,

1069
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:28,161
uh,
the bering strait between the Asian 

1070
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:28,800
continent and the North American 
continent existed,

1071
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,130
but they could travel back and forth.
And the people that still live there,

1072
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,390
they have literally changed.
They've changed to absorb.

1073
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,670
Look,
I guess if someone,

1074
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:39,170
you know,
you can imagine that if someone,

1075
00:48:39,171 --> 00:48:42,800
if a kid is born with a propensity to 
not get frostbite in his fingers,

1076
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:47,330
then he's more likely to survive,
to procreate than someone who doesn't.

1077
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:49,610
And that can shake itself out over the 
course of general.

1078
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,860
There's certainly that.
There's certainly that,

1079
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:55,010
but I think there's also,
there's something I believe,

1080
00:48:55,011 --> 00:49:00,011
and this is just me talking,
there's something that I believe about 

1081
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:01,160
life where it finds a way life finds a 
way just like these,

1082
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,220
when they first discovered that there's 
life at the bottom of the ocean and 

1083
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:06,680
these crazy volcanic dream of files and 
it's like,

1084
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:11,681
what the fuck is that?
Some of these tiny little animals that 

1085
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:14,300
just aren't incredibly hot volcanic 
vents in temperature.

1086
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1087
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,590
So that's why when they look at like the
Moon Europa,

1088
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,260
one of Jupiter's moons and it's covered 
in ice,

1089
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:23,960
but there's water underneath it.
Like what the fuck is going on in her?

1090
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,190
That's so exciting.
Yeah.

1091
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:30,191
I mean,
there might be some lifeforms that 

1092
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:30,191
reminds,
reminds

1093
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:32,230
me when you said something,
you said something a moment ago about 

1094
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,230
the moral,
uh,

1095
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,830
about morality and dod.
That's right.

1096
00:49:33,831 --> 00:49:38,831
Dolphins and stuff.
I was interviewing Neil degrasse Tyson 

1097
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:40,580
about extraterrestrial life and I was 
saying like one,

1098
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,820
there is a fear that maybe as 
civilizations become as intelligent as 

1099
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,721
we are,
that they kind of extinguish themselves 

1100
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:52,811
once they,
once they get the capacity to destroy 

1101
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:52,811
themselves,
that within a few centuries or millennia

1102
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:55,640
they sort of do and that that's why the 
universe doesn't seem to be teeming with

1103
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:58,160
life and he was like,
you know what?

1104
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:02,600
I think that if,
if you evolve to a position where you're

1105
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:07,601
able to destroy yourself,
then there's another type and those 

1106
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:10,120
basically saying like if what if 
extraterrestrial civilizations did come 

1107
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,970
and visit us,
you know,

1108
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:16,150
Stephen Hawking says that would be the 
worst possible scenario there where 

1109
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,600
there are no instances of advanced 
civilizations meeting less civilized 

1110
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,330
civilizations and it going well for the 
less developed civilization.

1111
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:23,750
Right?
I mean,

1112
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:28,751
just look at what happens on our planet.
Why would that if an extraterrestrial 

1113
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,740
civilization came and visited us,
would they just exterminate us or use us

1114
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:35,741
as their slaves and Neil degrasse Tyson 
and saying if they had gotten so 

1115
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:40,060
advanced that they were capable of 
traveling across the cosmos then and 

1116
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:43,150
they hadn't destroyed themselves,
then you would like to think that they'd

1117
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,070
been a moral evolution as well as just a
natural physical,

1118
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,690
biological evolution and that they would
not do that because otherwise they would

1119
00:50:50,691 --> 00:50:51,920
have killed themselves before they got 
here.

1120
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:57,050
Right,
but the counter that would be obviously 

1121
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,601
that if they did develop this and they 
came over here and they realize how 

1122
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:03,830
fucking scary we are with nuclear 
weapons and sucking every fish out of 

1123
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,350
the ocean and polluting every fucking 
place we get a chance to set up shop.

1124
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,890
Wouldn't they see us as a threat to the 
entire ecosystem of the planet if we 

1125
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:17,901
were just leaving nuclear waste as we've
done in holes in the ground in Nevada 

1126
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:21,830
and polluting Fukushima to the point 
where they're trying to figure out how 

1127
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:25,701
to dig a hole and freeze the outside of 
the hole so they could fill the hole up 

1128
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:29,541
with nuclear waste that will be toxic 
for longer than there have been humans 

1129
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,280
in this particular shape that we find 
ourselves in now.

1130
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,010
I mean,
if you go back to 200,000

1131
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:40,011
years ago,
you're dealing with essentially a 

1132
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:40,011
different kind of human,
right?

1133
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:41,290
I mean if you go to Australia,
I mean,

1134
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:46,310
what does that like a million years ago 
and then whatever the lower hominids 

1135
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,460
were before that,
you get to take 200,000

1136
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:49,440
years ago.
That's kind of like a monkey person.

1137
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1138
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,340
Basically.
And that's what we're talking about with

1139
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:54,900
this fucking toxic waste.
Yeah.

1140
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,710
We're talking like hundreds of thousands
of years of toxicity.

1141
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,870
It's horrifyingly are responsible.
I cannot believe.

1142
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:01,590
I mean.
Right.

1143
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:03,300
And if you were an alien,
yes,

1144
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:08,301
you would look at that.
Look at these crazy pink monkeys with 

1145
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:08,460
their fucking bang sticks and their 
nuclear waste.

1146
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:12,450
You guys are assholes that you would 
just look at the history of how we treat

1147
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:14,520
other species on this planet and how we 
treat each other.

1148
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,480
This is a very undeveloped,
like this is the.

1149
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:23,400
This is as undeveloped as you can be and
still be civilized.

1150
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,590
I use that term is sort of in quotation 
marks,

1151
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,740
civilizing comparison to chimps that eat
your face off.

1152
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,760
Yeah.
Well I just made civilized in that you 

1153
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,430
can build spacecraft and conk up 
arithmetic and stuff.

1154
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:40,490
Yeah,
and send video through the sky and into 

1155
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:40,490
someone else's phone.
It's all.

1156
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:45,220
I mean,
we're obviously super fucking advanced 

1157
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,220
for what we know of in the past.
Yes,

1158
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,881
we're good toolmakers,
but we're about as undeveloped like 

1159
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,210
morally and intellectually as you could 
be and still be a toolmaker this good,

1160
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,360
but is it possible that that is a part 
of why we develop things in the first 

1161
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,071
place,
that we're trying to do battle with our 

1162
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:01,071
instincts and that we're trying to in 
our,

1163
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:05,840
in our desire to innovate and our desire
to create new technology and expand our 

1164
00:53:08,011 --> 00:53:13,011
capabilities that we're also doing this 
to sort of combat what we really are 

1165
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:17,991
primarily this,
this deep urge that we have to fuck and 

1166
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:22,350
to kill and to feed ourselves and to 
sleep and all these biological urges.

1167
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,150
We're trying to fight against that and 
try to.

1168
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,360
That's the of civilization.
When you look at every space movie that 

1169
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,180
talks about like the future and the 
future,

1170
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:35,181
everyone is super calm.
They're all like reading minds or 

1171
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:38,391
they're doing things with their hands 
and no one's physical because no one 

1172
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:39,570
doing crossfit in the future.
You know what I mean?

1173
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,190
If you look at this fucking movies about
the future,

1174
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:49,191
no one said yoked.
There's no dudes that are fuck who's 

1175
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:49,191
pushing?
Come on,

1176
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:50,760
10 more pushups.
There's none of that in the future.

1177
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,820
The future is not a physical thing.
The future is we've evolved past the 

1178
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,451
physical.
We're communicating with our minds were 

1179
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:00,000
levitating things.
We're not using kinetic energy,

1180
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,080
we're not using muscle and

1181
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,550
bone and blood and maybe that will be 
true.

1182
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:09,551
I mean,
the other thing that fascinates me is 

1183
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:09,551
what's going to happen with artificial 
intelligence and you know,

1184
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:13,650
there are guys like Ray Kurzweil who 
thinks that within the lifetimes we're 

1185
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,860
gonna be able to upload our intelligence
into computers.

1186
00:54:14,861 --> 00:54:17,450
And I was actually speaking to an.
I was interviewing,

1187
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:19,630
I do another podcast called point of 
inquiry,

1188
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:24,631
which is for the center for inquiry.
It's that it's a nonprofit that spreads 

1189
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:24,790
science and reason and secularism.
Atheism.

1190
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,720
And I was speaking to one of these guys 
who works in the field of 

1191
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,580
extraterrestrial life,
like what he,

1192
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,610
he literally gets paid to,
to plan for what we will have to do if 

1193
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,420
we discover civilizations in other parts
of the galaxy.

1194
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:45,870
And um,
I just lost my train of thought about 

1195
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:45,870
how I got onto that.
But,

1196
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,500
um,
eh.

1197
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,150
Oh,
that's right.

1198
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,990
So I was like,
why haven't we found an extraterrestrial

1199
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:53,800
civilization?
Yet?

1200
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,550
He was like,
well,

1201
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:59,551
maybe the reality is that biological 
intelligence as biological civilizations

1202
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:05,010
quickly find a way to turn themselves 
artificial and we're looking for the 

1203
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,311
wrong thing we're looking for.
We're looking for biological 

1204
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:10,591
civilizations,
but it may well be the case that within 

1205
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,421
a few centuries we will all be in.
We will all be intelligences living 

1206
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:16,141
inside of kind of computers and the the 
need for biological human beings will 

1207
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:16,270
have passed.

1208
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,100
I think that's very possible.
Not only that,

1209
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:24,130
if we do develop something that is 
artificial that is far better than what 

1210
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,421
we are,
the argument of why we keep the 

1211
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:30,330
biological life alive,
kind of a road map.

1212
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,480
What?
Why do we need to shit and piss and eat 

1213
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:35,480
and what?
Why do we need to do that?

1214
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,120
I mean,
we only need to do that because that's 

1215
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,041
the best option.
But if we come up with something in a 

1216
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:45,371
laboratory,
if they slowly they've combined spider 

1217
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:49,631
silk and human cells and created an 
artificial skin that is bulletproof.

1218
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,240
I mean,
this is all proof of concept right now,

1219
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,840
but they believe they will be able to 
develop artificial human skin.

1220
00:55:56,841 --> 00:55:57,190
That's fucking,

1221
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,520
I want to be bulletproof.
Make it happen.

1222
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,760
Yeah.
But then people would be shooting 

1223
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,040
everybody and fuck you worry about it.
They're already a sort of,

1224
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,950
um,
I'm agnostic as to whether or not,

1225
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,110
I mean it's,
it's a big philosophical question rather

1226
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:15,111
than a scientific question as to whether
or not a computer could feel the way 

1227
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:16,950
that I do,
whether I like this.

1228
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:18,670
This is taking for granted this,
this,

1229
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:22,340
this assumption that Ray Kurzweil style,
singularity assumption takes,

1230
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:27,490
takes for granted a fundamental premise 
that I have trouble taking for granted,

1231
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:32,800
which is that if you added up all of the
data that's in my head right now and you

1232
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:37,801
put that into a computer,
it would have to be obviously a much 

1233
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:37,801
more sophisticated computer than 
anything we have right now,

1234
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:42,391
but assuming that you could,
that that computer essentially would be 

1235
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:42,760
me.
It would feel like me.

1236
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,570
I would be in the computer.
Now that's a.

1237
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,250
that's a question for philosophy of 
mind.

1238
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,280
That's not a question for science 
because what we really don't know is 

1239
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,180
what it is.
What under under goods.

1240
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,770
My experience of being myself.

1241
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,400
I also think there's an issue with why's
it so important to be you?

1242
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:06,810
Why is it so important to be a person 
but you do like you but you like you 

1243
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:10,571
because it's the only thing you have 
ever known and this is the highest form 

1244
00:57:10,571 --> 00:57:13,721
of life that we know currently,
but if you think about how many people 

1245
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,590
are fucking depressed and saddled down 
with emotions and relationships and just

1246
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:20,591
the stuff we're talking about today 
involving racism and homophobia and all 

1247
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:24,551
these issues and social justice warriors
and fucking Uber Conservative shitheads 

1248
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:29,050
and if you look at all of this stuff 
that we have to deal with just because 

1249
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,480
of the fact that we're biological 
lifeforms,

1250
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,780
existing and cultures and all these 
different emotions that we have to 

1251
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,230
struggle with on daily basis.
If we could figure out a way to just 

1252
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,250
shut that off with a switch and be the 
enlightened robot.

1253
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:45,251
Things who are far better don't get 
disease and figure out a way to 

1254
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:50,351
experience pleasure and it's in a level 
that is just unprecedented body.

1255
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,920
Last week I have

1256
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,360
being,
to me the part of the messiness of being

1257
00:57:54,361 --> 00:57:58,710
human being is the complexity part of,
part of the beauty of creativity,

1258
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,810
uh,
for me is being fucked up a bit like 

1259
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:03,810
the,
you know,

1260
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:04,620
perfection would be a boring state

1261
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,400
if you could create wormholes and travel
to distant galaxies and all sorts of 

1262
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,600
forms with zero emotion and just pure 
love because it's been created and 

1263
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,130
silicone fucking plates and you could 
fly through the galaxy with no worry 

1264
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,450
about not being able to breathe.
Okay.

1265
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,160
My,
I believe in my personal experience that

1266
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:25,930
without the troughs,
the peaks and meaningless,

1267
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,200
I believe that we should have stayed 
single celled organisms because all this

1268
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:31,600
fucking splitting.
It's just been super complicated.

1269
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,270
If we were single celled organisms,
we have no racism,

1270
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:39,271
we'd have no murder.
Single celled organisms don't have gun 

1271
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:39,271
rights.
They,

1272
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:39,271
they,
they don't fucking,

1273
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:42,040
they don't eat anything.
So fucking boring job that boy,

1274
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:47,041
are we in comparison to these artificial
life forms that can travel to different 

1275
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:47,041
galaxies.

1276
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:51,630
I mean,
part of the beauty of Shakespeare and 

1277
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,890
colleridge and shelly and like the great
art that we've ever produced is the,

1278
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,240
is the fact that it touches something 
inside of us that is,

1279
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,230
that can be contrasted against the 
fucked up nurse of the rest of our,

1280
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,440
of the human condition.
I think the human condition is an 

1281
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,991
interesting thing with preserving maybe,
or I like the West speaking as if we 

1282
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:14,791
have the option not to.
Like we will just kind of figuring out 

1283
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:14,791
whether or not we should flip the switch
on this.

1284
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,060
It's,
we're still a long way from that switch.

1285
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,290
Well

1286
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,090
think go back to when we were,
uh,

1287
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,110
you know,
200,000

1288
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:20,640
years ago when we were the weird monkey 
people,

1289
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,040
if someone along and said,
hey,

1290
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,200
I know we haven't figured out language 
yet,

1291
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:26,960
but I'm gonna I'm just explained to you 
the idea of twitter,

1292
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,530
you know,
fucking a monkey.

1293
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:30,080
You'd be like,
no,

1294
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:30,310
no,
no.

1295
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,360
Listen man,
I've got to find food in my area.

1296
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:37,361
There's a beauty to starving is a,
there's a meter running from leopards 

1297
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:39,560
and climbing up trees to avoid 
predators.

1298
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:44,561
I mean,
this is a beautiful thing to have a 

1299
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:44,561
seven year lifespan if you're fucking 
lucky.

1300
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:49,440
I mean,
I guess it depends what we're talking 

1301
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,001
about,
about the fucked up most of the human 

1302
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:51,001
condition.
I would agree with you that if you could

1303
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:53,080
get rid of mental illness,
if you could get rid of unnecessary,

1304
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:58,530
a self doubt and self criticism,
then that would probably be a positive 

1305
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:02,191
thing,
but that wouldn't be left with purely 

1306
01:00:02,191 --> 01:00:02,191
positive emotions that I don't think 
he'd want to be.

1307
01:00:02,191 --> 01:00:03,940
Who wants to be on an ecstasy trip their
entire life?

1308
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,830
Me,
I'll take it.

1309
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,320
I'm not saying that it would be that 
even.

1310
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,150
I'm just saying that we,
we,

1311
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:15,300
we live as if this idea of emotional 
struggle is a necessity to happiness and

1312
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:20,971
that happiness isn't a necessity to a 
meaningful life and what is a meaningful

1313
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:22,810
life if it is all just temporary.
You know,

1314
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:27,811
life is finite and there's no.
There's no arguing that right now at 

1315
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:27,811
least.
Well,

1316
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:32,480
what is meaning?
What are all these things other than 

1317
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,310
these,
these quantities that we attach to our 

1318
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:35,560
life,
you know,

1319
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,620
I'm more happy now.
I'm less happy when I do this.

1320
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,800
I'm more fulfilled when I do that.
I mean all these things are a part of 

1321
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,691
the biological reality that we live in 
and we equate the significance of our 

1322
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:53,950
existence to these biological reality,
but at the end of the day,

1323
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,400
we're just fucking and breeding and 
continuing to make new TV sets.

1324
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,960
I mean,
at the end of the day,

1325
01:00:58,961 --> 01:01:01,000
when you look at the human race as a 
whole,

1326
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:06,001
this gigantic super organism that 
continues to make smaller cell phones 

1327
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:06,640
and fucking faster cars.
What?

1328
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:10,900
What exactly is the significance?
What exactly is the meaning?

1329
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:16,140
If ultimately what we're doing is 
polluting the ocean and pulling out all 

1330
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,610
the fish and damaging the atmosphere and
changing the fucking the Gulf stream and

1331
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:23,611
all those nutty shit that we're a part 
of as a byproduct of all these emotions 

1332
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:25,270
and desire from materialism and all 
these different things.

1333
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:30,810
If we can avoid all that,
if we could live as solar powered 

1334
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,560
creatures that are made a carbon fiber.
Sure,

1335
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,380
sure it was,
you know,

1336
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:39,370
we say no because we are this,
but we can't stay this.

1337
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,590
We're not going to have 10 million years
go by and we come back to 2014.

1338
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:46,330
We look how fucking goofy this argument 
is.

1339
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,390
These dumb motherfuckers wanted to stay 
people.

1340
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:49,660
No,

1341
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,190
I,
I,

1342
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,090
I take your point and I,
but I think that,

1343
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:57,410
uh,
I think the kernel of insight there 

1344
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:57,530
that's,
that's precious is the,

1345
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:03,250
is the fact that we've essentially got 
it ass backwards about how you find 

1346
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:03,250
meaning and happiness,
right?

1347
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,600
I don't think we necessarily.
I think even as biological human beings,

1348
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:10,601
we can still do a hell of a lot better 
job than we currently do about 

1349
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,901
contextualizing what happiness is like.
It always frustrates me when people 

1350
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:18,521
whine about not being happy.
Happiness for me is a byproduct have 

1351
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:23,100
made doing things that I'm good at and 
that contribute in some way.

1352
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:23,610
Right?
Like,

1353
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,640
don't sit around like chasing.
The more you chase happiness,

1354
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:31,641
it's like squeezing the soap in your 
hand too hard and it just slips right 

1355
01:02:31,641 --> 01:02:34,221
out.
The more you specifically try to focus 

1356
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:34,221
on chasing happiness,
the less happy you are.

1357
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:37,740
Just get on with your life and do stuff 
that's good and happiness will just be a

1358
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:38,580
byproduct of that.

1359
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:43,620
That's a very good point as a person and
I think another thing that makes you 

1360
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,501
happy is to be around happy people and 
to give each other things like as far as

1361
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:52,111
like friendship and love and 
companionship and and laughter and like 

1362
01:02:52,451 --> 01:02:57,451
you,
you give and you know you experienced 

1363
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:59,210
from each other and you know you bond 
together by yourself sucks.

1364
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,900
You know by yourself is okay in small 
doses,

1365
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:05,950
but find some of the most miserable,
angry people and you find a lot of times

1366
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:07,250
those people have no love in their 
lives.

1367
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,830
Yeah,
that's the big issue.

1368
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:13,090
Sean Hannity fucking shot love,
but it's all from retards.

1369
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,400
He's got those nine volt batteries out 
there.

1370
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:19,330
We're going to close up our borders.
Sean,

1371
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:25,250
once they invent jetpacks,
all those borders are going to be 

1372
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,421
fucking meaningless.
People just gonna be flying through the 

1373
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:27,421
air and you're gonna have to scoop 
Mexicans out of the sky with nets.

1374
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:31,921
Is nobody going to be able to stop them 
and then we're going to have to just 

1375
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:31,921
assimilate and deal with the fact that 
we,

1376
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:36,691
you know,
we're all sharing this planet together 

1377
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:36,691
and this idea of borders is fucking 
preposterous.

1378
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:41,400
This idea that you were born in that 
patch of dirt so you don't have 

1379
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,500
healthcare,
but I'm born on this patch of dirt so I 

1380
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,490
got fucking gun rights flow can freedom 
and American Eagle tattooed on my back.

1381
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:51,330
Everyone's going to get a shit ton more 
rich though before we can get rid of 

1382
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:51,330
borders.
Do you think so?

1383
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:51,870
Yeah.
Because otherwise,

1384
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,490
I mean,
I'm not saying that that's a good thing.

1385
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:56,310
I'm just saying that that's a fact.
A fact on the ground.

1386
01:03:56,770 --> 01:04:01,770
If,
if every Indian and Chinese person who 

1387
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,880
was able to move to the United States,
then a large proportion of them would.

1388
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:07,881
And then you kind of get you free 
healthcare because you afraid you can 

1389
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:07,881
afford you a free healthcare.
Not that America has free healthcare,

1390
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:09,540
but you know,
you couldn't,

1391
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:14,541
you can't have.
There's an old saying that you can 

1392
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:14,541
either have a welfare state or you can 
have open borders,

1393
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:14,850
be kind of both,

1394
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,080
or you can have utopia when we all 
become carbon based life forms that are 

1395
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,080
made out of

1396
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,850
lot of libertarians would say,
just get rid of the welfare state and 

1397
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:24,850
get rid of the borders and let every man
sort of fend for himself.

1398
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:28,180
But I'm a big believer that the,
one of the great humanizing,

1399
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:33,450
socializing forces of the 20th century 
was the development of the welfare 

1400
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:37,051
state.
That the new deal and the idea that we 

1401
01:04:37,051 --> 01:04:37,360
have a sort of societal obligation to 
take care of one another.

1402
01:04:37,361 --> 01:04:39,130
I think it works well in a lot of 
countries,

1403
01:04:39,131 --> 01:04:44,131
especially in Scandinavian countries 
with willow and Denmark and works well 

1404
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:44,131
in Australia and New Zealand.
Um,

1405
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,840
and open borders will put an end to 
that.

1406
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:52,220
Well,
I think there's a good thing that the 

1407
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,951
welfare state does if it's attached to 
strong ideas and a strong philosophy of 

1408
01:04:56,671 --> 01:05:01,671
self improvement.
The problem with the welfare state is 

1409
01:05:01,671 --> 01:05:04,491
that Unsung folks with given some 
backgrounds and given some behavior 

1410
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:06,840
patterns that people have fallen into 
that it can lead to complacency.

1411
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:12,220
Yeah.
Let me just clarify what I mean by 

1412
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:12,220
welfare state.
That might be a slightly American term.

1413
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:12,220
Uh,
I,

1414
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,180
I just mean providing unified universal 
healthcare for everyone,

1415
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,130
providing free tertiary education or 
discounted education and not burning

1416
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,670
people with student loans,
uh,

1417
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,410
taking care of old people to do 
globally.

1418
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,370
Um,
certainly healthcare is expensive.

1419
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:32,020
Expensive in this country already spends
like 14 or 17 percent of.

1420
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:37,021
It's an entire GDP on healthcare.
What we would only need to double that 

1421
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:40,980
or triple that to bankrupt it.
And you would certainly do more than 

1422
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:40,980
triple that.
You're doing 100 fold if you will.

1423
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,641
You can do it 20 fold if you expanded it
to the world because the United States 

1424
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,210
is wildly one 20th of the world's 
population.

1425
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:51,270
Right.
But if you take out the amount of money 

1426
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,270
that we spend on military,
the amount of money we sent it.

1427
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:55,210
I mean,
if the whole world was assimilated and 

1428
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,210
that sort of sense would still not still
not close.

1429
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,900
No.
I mean,

1430
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:57,150
mark,
you know,

1431
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,410
we spend like a sixth of the GDP on 
healthcare.

1432
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,270
That's insane.
It's so insane.

1433
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:01,810
And,
and,

1434
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:04,150
and we get outcomes in this country that
are inferior to,

1435
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,600
to other countries that have socialized 
what we spend on military.

1436
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,600
I don't know how we should look that up 
because if we could spend.

1437
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:11,260
Oh,
I'm,

1438
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,610
you know,
obviously,

1439
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,320
you know,
that's the argument.

1440
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:18,160
We don't need war.
We need doctors and gun food.

1441
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,120
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

1442
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:22,810
we spend way too much on the military 
way more than we need to.

1443
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:24,670
I mean,
America spends more than the next.

1444
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,710
What is it,
nine or 10 nations combined.

1445
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:29,720
Those nations are friendly nations.
So who are you?

1446
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:35,100
Well,
apart from depending on pay to find 

1447
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:35,100
China,
but you know what,

1448
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:35,740
uh,
what is this for?

1449
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,560
It's a jobs if fucking jobs programs to 
keep everybody down.

1450
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,510
Flex,
flex on motherfuckers,

1451
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,220
make sure nobody gets crazy.
We have,

1452
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,950
that's why we have military bases and 
over a hundred different countries.

1453
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:49,970
I mean,
the real expense though is when I say 

1454
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,390
it's a job program,
literally every the lowliest have made 

1455
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,351
sure that every state of America 
essentially has a vested interest in 

1456
01:06:55,351 --> 01:06:59,611
keeping their Faq,
their munitions factory going like one 

1457
01:06:59,611 --> 01:07:03,481
state.
It'll be they build nuclear submarines 

1458
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:03,481
and another state.
It'll be this instead of.

1459
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:08,160
Instead of having it concentrated,
they very explicitly made a political 

1460
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,190
case to make sure that all political 
constituencies across the country have a

1461
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,930
local vested interest in maintaining 
their mill,

1462
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:16,060
their little piece of the military 
industrial complex,

1463
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:21,061
which means we're producing know fighter
jets that the Pentagon says they don't 

1464
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:22,480
want.
They don't need simply because the local

1465
01:07:22,481 --> 01:07:23,590
representative will say,
well,

1466
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:24,660
we're not going to cancel.
Listen,

1467
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,260
you know,
lose certain jobs in my district.

1468
01:07:26,261 --> 01:07:26,620
Okay,
well,

1469
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:31,621
if it's a jobs program,
just let's admit that it's a jobs 

1470
01:07:31,621 --> 01:07:31,621
program and just say,
okay,

1471
01:07:31,621 --> 01:07:31,621
that's.

1472
01:07:31,621 --> 01:07:35,970
That is the way that we've chosen to 
deliver welfare in this country by 

1473
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:35,970
giving people jobs in the,
in the military that,

1474
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,150
that,
that we don't need them to do.

1475
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,790
So in that case,
what we really need to do is declare war

1476
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:42,130
on poverty.
If we declare war on poverty,

1477
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:44,500
then we'll make money out of eliminating
poverty.

1478
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:49,501
The same way we have the war on drugs.
The war on drugs is essentially a war 

1479
01:07:49,501 --> 01:07:50,750
against.
I mean it's,

1480
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,020
it's a job factory the same way.
I mean it's a,

1481
01:07:53,021 --> 01:07:58,021
it's a,
it's a job hustle the same way military 

1482
01:07:58,021 --> 01:07:58,021
is,
I mean the military.

1483
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:02,371
There's certain places where the 
military is a viable option for people 

1484
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:04,000
that are in poor neighborhoods that need
some form of income.

1485
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,010
Yeah,
that's right.

1486
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,660
It's right.
It's a constant and oftentimes,

1487
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:08,980
I mean if you're,
if you're poor,

1488
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:10,510
especially if you're a minority then.

1489
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:13,510
And so you kind of have the same 
opportunities that other people do.

1490
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,320
Yeah.
The military is a great option.

1491
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,570
And another option would be to become a 
drug dealer.

1492
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,670
So the military is a good option.
Yeah.

1493
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,410
Yeah.
What the fuck?

1494
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,750
Right.
I have to fix this josh steps.

1495
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:25,280
That's why I'm here.
Joe.

1496
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:27,050
I don't think we're doing a goddamn 
thing.

1497
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:28,860
You and I think we're on.
We're on the way,

1498
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,020
I think.
I think we've got it.

1499
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:33,350
I think we've fixed about 30 percent of 
the world's problems so far today.

1500
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,270
I really don't think that this pace.
I think we'll,

1501
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,940
I think we'll get it done a couple of 
years of this conversation.

1502
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:40,970
How often are you in La,
man?

1503
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:42,400
We only have about 10 minutes left.
Okay,

1504
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,990
got it.
We got to do this again.

1505
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:46,350
Um,
yeah.

1506
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,750
I'm,
uh,

1507
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:47,700
I'm here.
I'm in,

1508
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,740
I'm in and out sometimes.

1509
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,590
I also want to plug a minute,
my new venture,

1510
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:54,020
which is I'm doing alive,
someone launching a live show in.

1511
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:59,021
I'm in New York in front of a live 
studio audience and we're going to 

1512
01:08:59,021 --> 01:09:01,601
podcast that.
So I want people to like send an email 

1513
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:04,511
to the show and get on our mailing list 
so that you can get free tickets and 

1514
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:04,511
swag and all that sort of stuff.
Uh,

1515
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:08,240
it's called we the people and it's like 
a panel show me like hosting with,

1516
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:08,550
uh,
with,

1517
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,750
for guests and we talk about the news 
and the audience votes on whose opinion 

1518
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,150
they liked the best.
That's great.

1519
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:15,080
Uh,
as we will be really fun.

1520
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:18,320
So go to send an email to info at we the
people pod.

1521
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,370
You're going to pick the audience or you
just gotTa let Sean Hannity fans come in

1522
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:25,550
showing that any fans fucking drooling 
and slipping all over the floor,

1523
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,200
you're going to let them in.

1524
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,510
Welcome.
Welcome everybody including defense.

1525
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,380
What about Sean Hannity?
Would you have them on the show?

1526
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,720
No,
no worries.

1527
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,170
Of course.
I would realize that'd be.

1528
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:41,171
Wouldn't it be fascinating?
Wouldn't be facing as long as you had a 

1529
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:43,721
lot of time.
Really get deep with them and break it 

1530
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:47,441
down because a guy like that can keep up
the fucking hustle and shuffle for like 

1531
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:47,441
20,
30 minutes.

1532
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:48,650
It would either be interesting or it 
wouldn't be interesting at all.

1533
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,680
You know?
It was like I was talking to mark Marin 

1534
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,840
in that interview on Friday about 
whether or not he'd want to interview a 

1535
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,180
rush limbaugh on his show.
And he was like,

1536
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,800
not really.
He was like,

1537
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,710
I didn't think I'd ever get through the 
the charade.

1538
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:05,950
I've never really had a nice little bug 
or oxycontins on murder for you.

1539
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,470
Come on son.
Let's shake it.

1540
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:09,770
Shake it.

1541
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:10,940
Shake it,
listen to this.

1542
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:15,970
Wouldn't it be amazing if you could get 
one of those guys on drugs and just take

1543
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:21,620
them down the rabbit hole and really get
like you do Iowaska.

1544
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:23,900
Wouldn't rush limbal see what happens.
Oh,

1545
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,580
a lot of crying.
Lot of screaming.

1546
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,860
Fucking being pulled apart by a lot of 
vomiting,

1547
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:32,861
a lot of shooting just to load.
There'd be a lot of lot of bodily 

1548
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:32,861
fluids.
It wouldn't be pretty.

1549
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:36,761
I take it back.
I don't want that thought experiment 

1550
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:36,761
would be willing to be around him 
shooting his.

1551
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:41,650
I could see all the other stuff.
I mean I just think of a lot of these 

1552
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:44,711
people that have been incredibly 
supportive of war and the military 

1553
01:10:44,711 --> 01:10:45,410
industrial complex.
Just seeing the repercussions,

1554
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,810
the possible repercussions of that 
support in,

1555
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:52,370
in some sort of manifested in some sort 
of a spiritual form that would be very,

1556
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:53,150
very terrifying.

1557
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,420
Advocate presence to the impact of.
Of what their part of.

1558
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:02,270
I don't know.
I mean the drugs that that guy is into 

1559
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:02,300
the disassociative drugs.
I mean,

1560
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:07,360
someone who's into like the oxys and 
someone who's into like something just 

1561
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,400
like the narcotics that Zonk you out,
but even not even a hannity like,

1562
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:10,900
uh,
you know,

1563
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,610
I saw one thing that I'm pretty 
passionate is,

1564
01:11:13,611 --> 01:11:18,611
is the,
is the push to get rid of nuclear 

1565
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:18,611
weapons,
right?

1566
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:21,740
This is a perfectly achievable thing.
It's something that Ronald Reagan was 

1567
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,411
passionate about as well,
so it's not a right wing or left wing 

1568
01:11:24,411 --> 01:11:26,901
thing.
It's just a recognition that if we have 

1569
01:11:26,901 --> 01:11:28,290
thousands and thousands and thousands of
nukes in the world at some point,

1570
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,380
eventually we're gonna use them.
Someone's going to get them.

1571
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,700
Someone's,
you know,

1572
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:37,990
we can't as they say in,
in the nuclear security guy and you can 

1573
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:37,990
be right.

1574
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,020
90 nine point nine,
nine,

1575
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:40,500
nine,
nine,

1576
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:41,010
nine,
nine,

1577
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:46,011
nine percent of the time.
And that instilled destroy the world 

1578
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:49,270
when you've got thousands of nukes and 
social on Hannity saying like railing 

1579
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:53,750
against this and saying you the white 
stop nuclear weapons is to have more 

1580
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,020
nuclear weapons in the United States so 
that bad guys won't use them.

1581
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,200
And I'm like,
what are you even like?

1582
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,890
Are you even close to being present to 
the impact of what you're saying,

1583
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:06,610
like it's so fucking wildly out of touch
with any grand,

1584
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:11,611
a big attempt to to think beyond just 
the momentary immediate talking point in

1585
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:15,660
the most obvious reflexive knee jerk 
bullshit,

1586
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:19,650
like step back for a second and look at 
where you are in the world.

1587
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:24,830
Well,
it's also not supported by the history 

1588
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:24,830
of suicide bombings,
right?

1589
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:27,630
The history of suicide bombings in this 
world is pretty fucking extensive.

1590
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,660
There's a lot of people that have taken 
their own life and a bunch of other 

1591
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,320
people's lives with them because they 
thought they were doing it for some holy

1592
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:39,321
purpose or some martyrdom or whatever.
Someone can do that with a nuclear 

1593
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:41,820
weapon and that is a reality of nuclear 
weapons.

1594
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,500
Absolutely.
The real question though is,

1595
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:48,650
is it too late?
Is can you take the salt out of the 

1596
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:51,411
ocean?
Is it possible to extract all the 

1597
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:51,480
nuclear weapons and figure out a way to 
make some sort of a deal?

1598
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,220
At the moment,
it does seem to be.

1599
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:55,500
I mean,
well with the exception of North Korea,

1600
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:57,930
you could do.
You could do a deal,

1601
01:12:57,931 --> 01:12:59,130
I mean,
I think,

1602
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,710
I think everyone could get on board and 
look if you want to have one,

1603
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,260
if you want to keep one nuclear weapon,
then then do it.

1604
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:06,110
That is,
what is this going up?

1605
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:10,940
Defense Budgets from 2012 of all the 
different countries and then the US.

1606
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,190
Yeah.
So you've got a bit.

1607
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:12,960
You've got one,
two,

1608
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:13,650
three,
four,

1609
01:13:13,651 --> 01:13:14,310
five,
six,

1610
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:14,910
seven,
eight,

1611
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,180
nine at the.
So that's the next 10 countries and it's

1612
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:21,670
less than the US.
Six hundred and 82 billion.

1613
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:27,280
And so looking at those countries,
the only country there that say that's a

1614
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,780
of a rival really is Russia.
China is a,

1615
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,300
I'm not worried about China and I think 
we'll uh,

1616
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:38,340
we'll,
I think we'll have a peaceful 

1617
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:38,340
coexistence with them.
And then the UK,

1618
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:38,340
Japan,
France,

1619
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,150
Saudi Arabia,
I mean this shit holes,

1620
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:44,151
but uh,
they're not going to use a tiny amount 

1621
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:45,030
so small in comparison.
It's hilarious ball.

1622
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:49,410
That's a shit textile with go.
Yeah.

1623
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,010
It's,
um,

1624
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:56,140
it's,
it's a weird situation when you think 

1625
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,690
about a thousand years from now,
will we still have this whole,

1626
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:03,350
this whole mutually assured destruction 
thing hanging over our heads a thousand 

1627
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,190
years from now.
I can't see it.

1628
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,030
Will we have figured out a way past 
this?

1629
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,470
I think we have to.
Well,

1630
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:11,140
isn't it all about the emotions and the 
greed and all the stuff that comes along

1631
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,100
being a biological life

1632
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:17,100
form,
isn't it all about all the stuff that 

1633
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,621
comes from being this troubled monkey 
that's trying to assimilate with cell 

1634
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,010
phones?
And she asked him

1635
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,270
ability to triumph over that.
I mean,

1636
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:28,280
one of the most touching things this,
this past weekend was the 25th 

1637
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,280
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin 
Wall.

1638
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:33,590
You don't want the great triumphs of,
of human civilization is the fact that 

1639
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,190
the 20th century,
as nasty as it was,

1640
01:14:35,191 --> 01:14:40,191
as brutal as it was,
it didn't end in mutually assured 

1641
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:40,191
destruction.
These,

1642
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:41,240
these monkeys managed to rise above 
their,

1643
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,370
their worst selves and come to their 
better nature.

1644
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:49,430
And on several occasions came really,
really close to destroying themselves 

1645
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,540
like the Cuban missile crisis.
And didn't good for us.

1646
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,420
Good for its pilot complexity.
Pat Yourself on your back.

1647
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:55,800
Humankind.
Yeah.

1648
01:14:55,801 --> 01:15:00,801
Well we figured out when we watched 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki that this could 

1649
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:04,791
be a fucking mess globally and somehow 
or another we managed to stumble to 2014

1650
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,150
and kill a lot of fucking people,
but not with nuclear weapons.

1651
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:09,900
That's right.
You know,

1652
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:14,901
there was a single nuclear weapon.
I think it's the tightened to which we 

1653
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:16,230
have loads of either hundreds or 
thousands,

1654
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:20,100
which has the explosive power,
more explosive power,

1655
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,520
much more explosive power.
Then every single bomb dropped in World 

1656
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,750
War II by all parties,
including Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1657
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,160
Whoa.
That's on renamed my deck.

1658
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:32,750
Tightened to

1659
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:38,650
rename.
Know that they had all these other names

1660
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:43,450
called Titan one a column.
And what is it?

1661
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,740
Enola Gay.
The plane.

1662
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:48,280
I think that

1663
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:52,080
it's nice to see that we haven't done 
that.

1664
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:57,170
It's nice to see that we haven't blowing
each other up since 1945 or whatever it 

1665
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:57,170
was.
What was it?

1666
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:59,160
40th five when we dropped the bombs.
It's nice to see that.

1667
01:15:59,161 --> 01:16:04,161
We have not done that since then,
but it's such a small amount of time in 

1668
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:04,500
perspective.

1669
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,120
That's why we have to get rid of him,
I think.

1670
01:16:06,121 --> 01:16:11,121
I think we've.
We've stumbled onto something that is 

1671
01:16:11,121 --> 01:16:14,690
far more advanced technologically than 
our emotional capability has to handle.

1672
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,650
It's like it's like you've been given.
You've given a monkey the,

1673
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,480
you know the keys to a car,
you just gotTa.

1674
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,770
You just gotTa take the keys back.

1675
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:28,030
Well,
it's also the people that have this are 

1676
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,371
not the people that built it and created
it and engineered it and understand it,

1677
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:35,830
and so the discipline involved in doing 
all those things in the accomplishment 

1678
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:39,371
of creating it.
The people that did create it were 

1679
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:40,280
absolutely horrified at it being used.
The oppenheimer quote,

1680
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,430
I don't know if you've ever seen it,
but it's fucking terrifying.

1681
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,360
We can end on this.
We like Oppenheimer quoting the Bhagavad

1682
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:49,610
Gita and seen that.
I haven't seen it.

1683
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:53,180
I've read the quote.
It's fucking amazing because you see the

1684
01:16:53,181 --> 01:16:57,220
pain in this guys face like the als is 
the face of death or whatever that is.

1685
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:02,250
I am because I am damn death destroyer 
of worlds and he,

1686
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,410
he.
Well,

1687
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,270
we'll play it and we'll,
we'll end on this.

1688
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:08,840
Please tell people how they get ahold of
your show and how they get ahold of you.

1689
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,160
So huff,
post live,

1690
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,290
you can just go to www dot huff post 
live.

1691
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:15,470
We ere seven or eight hours of original 
content every single day.

1692
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:20,740
You could probably see stuff posted in 
terms of clips all over the Huffington 

1693
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:23,660
post or you can also go to having a 
post.com/live

1694
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,110
and the.
So that's my main gig and then this,

1695
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:32,140
but subscribed to this live show and 
you'll get lots of cool swag and stuff 

1696
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:36,131
because I'm going to podcast it and that
is info at we the pod.

1697
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:39,200
We got another hour.com.
My fucking clock.

1698
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:41,460
Oh,
we're good.

1699
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:43,140
Oh,
let's play the Bhagavad Gita thing too,

1700
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:43,650
right?
Cool.

1701
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,560
I was like,
how did that go by two and a half hours.

1702
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:48,180
Go by so quick.
It was one and a half hours.

1703
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:50,670
Okay.
I'm fucking stupid.

1704
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,400
I can't say cold bear and I don't know 
about time.

1705
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:58,401
Change is.
I have this little clock here and 

1706
01:17:58,401 --> 01:17:58,401
daylight savings.
It's an old school,

1707
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:02,610
Clark Davidson,
so let's play this Bhagavad Gita thing 

1708
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:05,450
because it is good.
I'm glad we do this because I love 

1709
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:05,450
talking to you,
man.

1710
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:05,450
Alright,
five,

1711
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,690
four,
three,

1712
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,670
two,
one

1713
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,450
in the dead.
Silence of the morning at five,

1714
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,230
29,
45 mountain war time.

1715
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:29,720
The Wester was bathed in an intense 
flash of light that man had only seen 

1716
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:31,890
from the stars.

1717
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,150
Just cut the fucking oppenheimer.
Man.

1718
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:41,660
You know this drama bullshit.
There it is.

1719
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,770
Okay.
Here it goes.

1720
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:46,290
The world would not be the same.

1721
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:48,900
Look at his face,
man.

1722
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:53,880
Kill people.
Shoot.

1723
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,340
People cried.
Both people were silent.

1724
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:04,690
I remembered the line from the Hindu 
scripture,

1725
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:09,700
the Bhagavad Gita.
No,

1726
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:17,720
trying to persuade the prince that he 
should do his duty to impress him.

1727
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:26,440
Takes on multi armed form,
says,

1728
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,060
now I am become death.
The destroyer of worlds.

1729
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:36,430
I suppose we all put that on way or 
another.

1730
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,500
Oh my God.
Chills up my fucking.

1731
01:19:40,501 --> 01:19:40,600
That's

1732
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:45,690
fine.
When you see his face and you realize 

1733
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:48,381
that this is a scientist that 
essentially was given the task of 

1734
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:52,260
creating this incredibly destructive 
device and if he didn't,

1735
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:57,290
if they didn't,
then the enemy would have and they saw 

1736
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,471
what was going on with Nazi Germany,
the Third Reich was taking over Europe 

1737
01:20:00,471 --> 01:20:02,880
and killing everybody and what was going
on in the Holocaust,

1738
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,670
and they just realized that we're in 
this unwinnable situation,

1739
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:07,930
someone to do something.

1740
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,990
It's completely bombed,
completely understandable.

1741
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:13,990
The scientists like to blame the 
scientists for doing it,

1742
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:15,820
and they were,
as you can see,

1743
01:20:15,821 --> 01:20:17,740
morally conflicted about it.
Richard Fineman,

1744
01:20:17,741 --> 01:20:19,720
one of the greatest physicists of the 
20th century,

1745
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:24,750
worked on it and then campaign for the 
rest of his life for denuclearization 

1746
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,860
and he died of cancer because he kept 
going to these nuclear testing zones and

1747
01:20:26,861 --> 01:20:29,170
dumb and protesting.
That's how firemen died.

1748
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:29,860
Oh No,
hang on.

1749
01:20:29,861 --> 01:20:34,861
That was Carl Sagan.
Sagan died from cancer because of his 

1750
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:39,080
anti nuclear protests,
but fireman was also very conflicted 

1751
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:39,080
about his role in in,
in all of that.

1752
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,570
It's tricky.
I mean,

1753
01:20:40,571 --> 01:20:43,030
you had to do it at the time,
but in hindsight,

1754
01:20:43,031 --> 01:20:43,730
just imagine,
I mean,

1755
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:47,590
think of a world where there is no nukes
and it's just another like the idea of a

1756
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:52,591
single bomb wiping out an entire city.
You used to have to fly sorties over 

1757
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,110
Dresden,
24 slash seven,

1758
01:20:56,111 --> 01:20:58,680
just raining bombs on something just to,
you know,

1759
01:20:58,690 --> 01:20:59,200
to destroy.

1760
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:04,210
So you may one bomb killing thousands,
hundreds of thousands of people 

1761
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,240
potentially nowadays.
Millions of people from one bomb one 

1762
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:09,340
moment,
one instant,

1763
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:10,690
and we got up to,
you know,

1764
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,220
when we're in the height of the Cold 
War,

1765
01:21:12,221 --> 01:21:17,221
we were producing hundreds of these,
I think was hundreds a day at the peak.

1766
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:18,250
What was it?
No,

1767
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:20,230
it was no,
we were producing more than one an hour.

1768
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:21,540
It was like,
yeah,

1769
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:26,550
we will produce.
Will produce what we ended up with over 

1770
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:26,550
10.
No,

1771
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:30,560
again,
remember it's like in the tens of 

1772
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:30,730
thousands of nukes that we had 
stockpiled.

1773
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:32,710
We've now brought that considerably 
down,

1774
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:37,120
but we still have thousands,
thousands of nukes for everyone.

1775
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:42,210
Many times over.
We could kill everyone on earth many 

1776
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:42,210
times over.

1777
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:42,650
Totally.
We could kill not only every one,

1778
01:21:42,651 --> 01:21:46,070
but like everything we could blanket the
planet.

1779
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:51,500
Well,
when you look back at history and the 

1780
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,920
horrible things that human beings have 
done to each other without bombs,

1781
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,030
I mean if you look at the amount of like
the Mongols regularly killed.

1782
01:21:57,031 --> 01:22:00,030
I mean the estimation is between 20 and 
$50.

1783
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:03,600
Million people during Genghis Khan's 
life and they did that with horses,

1784
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,690
horseback and arrows and catapults and 
shit.

1785
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:09,420
And they killed cities with a million 
people.

1786
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:13,440
They wiped the entire city out.
They did that with no weapons other than

1787
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,960
standard shit.
Yeah.

1788
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,160
It was a lot more work.
Not more work,

1789
01:22:17,161 --> 01:22:21,990
but it's the idea behind it that's so 
terrifying that people can be so fucking

1790
01:22:21,991 --> 01:22:26,991
brutal.
And the idea that you give the same 

1791
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:28,320
animals,
this ability to do the same thing with a

1792
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:29,160
press of a button.

1793
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:34,210
Yeah.
It's the ease of it that is so kind of 

1794
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,090
bone chilling about nukes.
It's similar to people who,

1795
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,740
who are big guns,
guns,

1796
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:37,700
rights defenders will.
Uh,

1797
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:42,710
we're so lucky.
The Hutus and Tutsis had each other to 

1798
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:42,710
death with machetes.
They didn't need guns.

1799
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,030
No.
That's true,

1800
01:22:44,031 --> 01:22:49,031
but it's just you have to really care 
about it more to kill someone with a 

1801
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:49,031
machete than we've been by pulling a 
trigger.

1802
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:50,570
It's just a lot easier and that's,
that's true.

1803
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:55,571
If nukes you have really you,
you are able to achieve spontaneously 

1804
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:59,861
with almost no effort,
something that would otherwise take a 

1805
01:22:59,861 --> 01:22:59,861
tremendous amount of effort and 
forethought.

1806
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:04,140
What scares me the most about the gun 
debate is not the concept of whether or 

1807
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:08,851
not people should have checks whether or
not people should have access to 

1808
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:13,801
automatic weapons.
It's the ignoring of the psychotropic 

1809
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:18,390
drugs that people are on.
It's the ignoring of human,

1810
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,270
illegal.
One's legal.

1811
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:24,271
One's the ignoring of all the different 
instances of people either being on 

1812
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:27,310
antidepressants,
withdrawing from antidepressants,

1813
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:32,311
getting off their medication,
and having unbelievably erratic 

1814
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:32,311
behavior.
The,

1815
01:23:32,311 --> 01:23:36,720
if you ever looked at like the 
statistics for massive mass shootings 

1816
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,640
and how many of those people were on 
psychotropic drugs are coming off of 

1817
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:41,890
them or,
or withdrawing from them.

1818
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,090
It's almost all of them.

1819
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,160
Right?
But there's a,

1820
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:44,890
there's a,
um,

1821
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,610
there's an ambiguous causation chain 
there,

1822
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,850
right?
That's right.

1823
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,510
Is it the drugs or is it because they're
crazy and that's why they are taking the

1824
01:23:51,511 --> 01:23:51,870
drugs?

1825
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,940
It's a very good question and that's 
where,

1826
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:59,990
uh,
I deviate from a lot of guns rights 

1827
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:02,221
advocates.
I don't think that we should have some 

1828
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:04,171
sort of background checks or don't think
we should have stability checks or the 

1829
01:24:04,171 --> 01:24:08,551
very least.
How come you don't have to have a 

1830
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:10,771
license?
How come you have to take a test to 

1831
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:13,720
drive a fucking car?
Someone stands over you and looks at you

1832
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:18,721
and everybody knows.
It's that weird feeling of being in the 

1833
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:22,080
nervousness of being in the car with a 
driving instructor that's asking her a 

1834
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,821
tester that's asking you a few questions
and seeing if you stop perfectly at a 

1835
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:30,820
stop sign and whether or not you look 
both ways before you make a turn,

1836
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:34,690
but you could just go buy a gun and no 
one has to look at you.

1837
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,360
No one has to ask you if you know how to
fucking load that.

1838
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,150
Honestly done understanding the gun 
debate in this,

1839
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:41,360
in this country.
I don't.

1840
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:45,460
It does not even compute for me because,
uh,

1841
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:49,630
I don't understand why the gun lobbies 
against all of that sort of stuff.

1842
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:50,600
Like I don't have,
I'm not,

1843
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:53,230
I don't have a huge issue with people 
having firearms.

1844
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:57,550
I do basically think that that in dense 
urban areas,

1845
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,760
you should not be packing a gun unless 
you're like a unique one because you're 

1846
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,050
a celebrity or something.
Um,

1847
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:08,430
but I don't understand why the NRA 
thinks that background checks and 

1848
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:08,430
licensing and stuff.
Is,

1849
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:13,410
is a paranoid and they think that that's
a slippery slope and that that's going 

1850
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,190
to lead to guns being taken away in the 
future.

1851
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:18,040
Or is it actually those simple 
precautions that they,

1852
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:20,950
that they on principle objective,
I can't figure it out because it doesn't

1853
01:25:20,951 --> 01:25:23,200
make any sense to me.
If you could massively reduce the number

1854
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:28,201
of people who are being slaughtered in 
this country constantly every day,

1855
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:30,610
why wouldn't you?

1856
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,790
I think it's the slope thing.
I really do.

1857
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:35,220
I think it's a slippery slope argument.
I think that,

1858
01:25:35,221 --> 01:25:40,221
uh,
it's like we were talking about with a 

1859
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:40,221
social justice warriors,
you know,

1860
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:43,980
that there,
there's the extreme reaction towards 

1861
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:48,050
doing something that I believe is 
morally correct and,

1862
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:52,440
and fighting for objectified people are 
fighting for marginalized people.

1863
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:57,650
That this is in reaction to the racism 
or sexual exploitation and all the 

1864
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,010
different things that have occurred on 
the other side of the spectrum.

1865
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,490
And this is what in,
in,

1866
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:06,491
uh,
in sort of an analogous way they're to 

1867
01:26:06,491 --> 01:26:08,381
do with gun control.
What they're trying to do is fight off 

1868
01:26:08,381 --> 01:26:11,180
any form of possible gun control,
fight off any background checks,

1869
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:14,030
fight off any waiting periods,
holding periods,

1870
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:17,360
fight off magazine size restrictions or,

1871
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,110
and yet like,
like I was saying about,

1872
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:20,880
um,
about the,

1873
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:24,870
the Sui pox of the world,
the cancel Kobe is of the world.

1874
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,900
I'm losing potential allies in people 
like me.

1875
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:31,740
That just completely alienates me from 
the gun rights movement,

1876
01:26:31,741 --> 01:26:32,280
right?
Because if,

1877
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:34,050
if the,
if the conversation was around,

1878
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:39,410
should it be legal or illegal for a 
person who is saying who is provably 

1879
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:42,210
sane and who undergoes a test to make 
sure that they know how to,

1880
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:47,270
how to safely use a firearm and is 
responsible and can keep it locked up 

1881
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,270
at,
at home,

1882
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,590
should they be able to have a basic 
firearm,

1883
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:54,830
then you're not going to get a lot of 
dispute from almost anyone apart from 

1884
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:56,280
the most extreme people on the anti gun 
sight and there are very few people like

1885
01:26:56,281 --> 01:26:58,020
that.
So you alienate,

1886
01:26:58,021 --> 01:27:03,021
you lose an ally,
you lose a potential ally and someone 

1887
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:05,451
like me by being so rabidly against what
I regard as being simple precautions for

1888
01:27:07,231 --> 01:27:09,270
the responsible use of something that 
could kill people.

1889
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,670
I,
I agree with you,

1890
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:12,500
but I think that this is what we're 
dealing with.

1891
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:13,720
We're dealing with.
There are,

1892
01:27:13,721 --> 01:27:18,721
there are many groups that,
I mean there was a famous obama quote 

1893
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:20,450
where he was talking about how people 
are just resistant.

1894
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:21,580
They don't just,
you know,

1895
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:22,820
whatever.
Whatever it is,

1896
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:26,990
they don't want us to come and take 
their guns and these people were furious

1897
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:30,890
that Obama would think that he has the 
right to come and take their guns.

1898
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:35,891
Like who are you as a person to tell 
another person they cannot have this gun

1899
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:39,770
and there's a lot of people that fucking
love guns in this country.

1900
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:44,950
I have friends that are gun nuts.
My friend Justin is a fucking gun nut 

1901
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:49,690
everyday that dudes at the range 
shooting targets like a 900 yard 

1902
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,170
distance and fucking pinging metal and 
you know,

1903
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:56,240
it's like bang.
Think because you shooting that fucking 

1904
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:56,240
far away.

1905
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,740
Like you can actually hear it after the 
gunshot goes off.

1906
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:00,510
I think that's fun.
Good fat.

1907
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,580
He's got a hobby.
Okay.

1908
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,170
No one's known.
Taken his guns.

1909
01:28:03,171 --> 01:28:06,690
He,
it's there in the constitution amendment

1910
01:28:06,691 --> 01:28:07,790
to the constitution.
The.

1911
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:12,791
Whereas about things changing,
we'll think about the privacy 

1912
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:12,791
amendments.
I mean think about what's,

1913
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:14,420
what's happening right now with the NSA.
This is unconstitutional.

1914
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,250
What's happening that didn't do any good
anyway,

1915
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:19,280
what they're doing as far as like spying
on everyone cell phone,

1916
01:28:19,281 --> 01:28:24,281
being able to record.
Everyone's messaged as data center that 

1917
01:28:24,281 --> 01:28:25,970
did developing in Utah is going because 
the supreme court is stacked with a very

1918
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:28,160
tough types of people who gun nuts vote 
for.

1919
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:33,940
That's true,
but they're worried that the Thai could 

1920
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:33,940
shift with a president like Obama was 
somewhat.

1921
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,820
Yes.
If you had a rabidly left wings,

1922
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:41,860
if you had a supreme court that was 
eventually as rapidly lift wing as the 

1923
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:44,420
current supreme court is right wing,
then it's conceivable of course that you

1924
01:28:44,421 --> 01:28:49,421
could just rip up a portion of the 
constitution and ignore it and 

1925
01:28:49,421 --> 01:28:50,540
reinterpret it some way.
Worried

1926
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,420
about it.
I mean if you see this far fetched,

1927
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:57,490
it's so far down the road,
I would think it's so far fetched that 

1928
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:57,490
they'll be able to record.
When Alex Jones,

1929
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:58,850
who's a friend of mine who's arguably 
very crazy,

1930
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:01,740
but he used to tell me,
Joe Rogan,

1931
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:06,741
they're going to take every single phone
call that everyone makes cross the 

1932
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:06,840
country.
They're going to record it in a database

1933
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,420
and you're going to have everything 
you've ever said.

1934
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,910
If you ever get in trouble,
they pull you over for some reason.

1935
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:14,610
Some guy wants to fuck your wife,
wants to put you in jail.

1936
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:19,670
They're going to go to your [inaudible] 
database and pull something out and 

1937
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:20,430
taken out of context and lock you up in 
a cage and I would go to.

1938
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:25,431
This guy's so fucking out of his mind,
but then you look at what's going on 

1939
01:29:25,431 --> 01:29:28,791
today.
When this Edward snowden revelations 

1940
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:30,900
came out that literally they can go to 
your email,

1941
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,210
the employees.
It's not just metadata,

1942
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,850
all this horseshit that Obama said,
it's not true.

1943
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,120
The employees can go to your email and 
record and take anything they would 

1944
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:43,110
like.
That is unbelievable.

1945
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,420
It's an absolute outrage that this is 
the.

1946
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:50,470
This is the show in which I'm most 
furious at Obama along with like 

1947
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:53,420
hounding whistleblowers and leakers and 
prosecuting these,

1948
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,870
these people.
But I mean in terms of,

1949
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:57,430
you know,
Alex Jones being right on that.

1950
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,670
Y'All a stopped clock is right twice a 
day as well.

1951
01:30:00,671 --> 01:30:05,671
You know,
just because someone gets something 

1952
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:08,510
coming from Josh,
that doesn't mean that you can get to 

1953
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:11,110
the rest of charge.
That's a good.

1954
01:30:11,111 --> 01:30:12,240
Alex Jones.
Thank you very much.

1955
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:13,280
He's my friend.
Um,

1956
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:15,120
you know,
uh,

1957
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:17,530
I think there are,
if we have to,

1958
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:23,730
it's useful to sort of allocate our 
concern to the fields that most deserve 

1959
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:28,561
it.
And at the moment the big concern for 

1960
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:30,270
people who like freedom is.
No,

1961
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,470
I don't,
I just don't think that's a big concern.

1962
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:36,710
That's not my concern.
This is not going to happen.

1963
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:40,580
Take umbrage and issue with something 
you said earlier about someone living in

1964
01:30:40,581 --> 01:30:42,230
a city not being able to have a gun.
Why?

1965
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,040
Why not?
I mean,

1966
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:46,610
isn't that like one of the most.
If you live in densely populated area,

1967
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,280
the possibility of you being robbed is 
much higher.

1968
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:54,880
You know,
if you live in certain areas like 

1969
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,321
Detroit or Chicago where I think guns 
should be a way of resolving disputes 

1970
01:30:56,321 --> 01:30:57,410
between individuals even.
That's true.

1971
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,420
What about defending yourself?

1972
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,950
It'll take it.
Yeah.

1973
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Be able to use someone breaks into your 
house and they have a gun and they're 

1974
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,081
looking to kill your family.
You don't think you should be able to 

1975
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:09,081
defend yourself.

1976
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:09,081
Uh,
you should be able to defend yourself.

1977
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:13,740
The,
the flip side of that is that if 

1978
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:13,740
everyone is,
um,

1979
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:13,740
you end up with,

1980
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:15,380
with far more violent cities,
then if everyone.

1981
01:31:15,381 --> 01:31:16,850
Isn't it so true,
sir?

1982
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:21,050
Look at the statistics of the society is
a polite society.

1983
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:24,680
I have this assistant in,
in defense against this concept.

1984
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:29,090
Chicago has one of the strictest gun 
control laws in the country.

1985
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,510
Everyone has the highest level.
It's a good example.

1986
01:31:32,511 --> 01:31:37,511
That's why,
because it also has an extremely high 

1987
01:31:37,511 --> 01:31:39,971
level of gun violence because you're not
going to ever get the criminals to stop 

1988
01:31:39,971 --> 01:31:42,380
using guns because they're illegal 
because they're doing illegal shit.

1989
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:42,770
Anyway.

1990
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:47,830
One of the things which were I agree 
with with you on that is that there are 

1991
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:49,210
so many guns in the states already.
We're like,

1992
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:52,340
we're so.
We're so far the horse has bolted so far

1993
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:54,320
that that closing the gate now is kind 
of pointless.

1994
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:55,820
There are more guns in there.
Are People out there?

1995
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,800
Yes.
So my house are.

1996
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:05,190
I do think that that,
that's the explanation for why places 

1997
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:05,190
like Chicago is so violent because you 
see,

1998
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:06,730
I mean,
what is the point in putting in a gum,

1999
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,330
a strict gun law now everyone's already 
got guns.

2000
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:13,250
Well actually in defense of the reality 
of the Chicago situation is it has to do

2001
01:32:13,251 --> 01:32:15,200
with organized crime Chicago.
Um,

2002
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:19,850
it has to do with the war on drugs and 
it has to do with gangs being control of

2003
01:32:19,851 --> 01:32:22,100
drug dealing.
What happened in Chicago,

2004
01:32:22,101 --> 01:32:24,740
they,
they sort of destabilize the environment

2005
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,920
by locking up key gang members.
I have a friend in Chicago cop and he 

2006
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,361
explained the whole situation to me what
an unbelievable clusterfuck it became 

2007
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:35,120
when they locked up certain they,
they,

2008
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:40,210
they went on these rates,
locked up certain gang members and drug 

2009
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:42,170
leaders,
drug drug gang leaders.

2010
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:44,960
And when they did that,
a power struggle ensued.

2011
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:47,060
And then it's sort of like what's going 
on in Mexico.

2012
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,870
It's like once you,
once you have this power,

2013
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,090
this power struggle,
you have this vacuum.

2014
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:57,290
People try to fill the position and 
there's just unbelievable violence.

2015
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,870
I mean,
he was describing to me things that they

2016
01:32:59,871 --> 01:33:03,050
find on a daily basis,
the amount of murder that they,

2017
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,290
that they encounter in Chicago.
And it was,

2018
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:09,200
it's not just disheartening,
but I was like,

2019
01:33:09,201 --> 01:33:11,000
why do you stay last days?
Like,

2020
01:33:11,001 --> 01:33:11,860
Hey,
this is my job,

2021
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:12,860
is what I do.
Uh,

2022
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,030
you know,
I'm not happy about it,

2023
01:33:14,031 --> 01:33:14,880
but uh,
it's,

2024
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,070
uh,
I,

2025
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,780
I hope we can get a handle on it 
eventually.

2026
01:33:17,781 --> 01:33:22,781
But he,
but he was outlining all the different 

2027
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:22,781
issues with it.
He's like,

2028
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:23,000
this has nothing to do with gun control.
He goes,

2029
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,130
if you,
you change the laws,

2030
01:33:25,131 --> 01:33:27,410
you would have the exact same results.
This has to do with profit,

2031
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:29,510
nasty with drugs and that's due at the 
war on drugs.

2032
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,530
Yep.
It has to do with the fact that these 

2033
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:36,011
people can make insane amounts of money 
and then they have this insane 

2034
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:36,011
resources.
Exactly,

2035
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:36,890
exactly what we're seeing in Mexico.

2036
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:41,910
Mexico.
Mexico is one of the great tragedies of 

2037
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,540
the world at the moment.
Also,

2038
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:45,210
it also provides a good counter if you 
want to be more original next time,

2039
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:50,211
then use Mexico as the gun them because 
they actually have really strict gun 

2040
01:33:50,211 --> 01:33:50,760
laws to look at how a wash with gun 
violence there.

2041
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:52,710
So I take that.
I take that point.

2042
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:54,050
I take that critique.
I think in.

2043
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:59,150
I think in other societies I was a big.
I was a big fan of the fact that 

2044
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:00,780
Australia,
after it had its last mass massacre mass

2045
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:05,781
shooting in the late nineties,
a conservative prime minister took on 

2046
01:34:05,781 --> 01:34:05,940
the gun lobby and basically outlawed 
guns,

2047
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:10,941
did a gun buy back with the government,
paid to collect guns and there's a huge 

2048
01:34:10,941 --> 01:34:11,580
amount of misinformation on the web 
about the consequences of that.

2049
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:16,140
Buy a gun rights folks,
100 people and the whole continent.

2050
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,370
That's kind of my point is not going to 
work.

2051
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:21,450
It's kind of my point a.
and you didn't have this preexisting gun

2052
01:34:21,451 --> 01:34:23,550
culture,
real movies.

2053
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,270
That's right.
It's,

2054
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,400
you know,
a lot of Americans who don't,

2055
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:31,430
who haven't been to Australia,
kind of assume that Australia is real 

2056
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:33,801
rugged outdoors.
He kind of a wild outback Steva when 

2057
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:36,390
Crocodile Hunter Crocodile Dundee.
In reality,

2058
01:34:36,391 --> 01:34:38,800
we're a bunch of pussies where we all 
live on the coasts in,

2059
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:40,400
in several big cities,
you know,

2060
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:45,090
like three cities have almost half of 
the entire population of the country and

2061
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:50,130
we all sit around going sailing and 
drinking chardonnay and drinking and 

2062
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:50,130
sipping lattes.
So we didn't really need it.

2063
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:52,510
Guns I fucking love.
Sydney is one of the time.

2064
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,910
I've only been there.
This is the only place I've ever been in

2065
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:59,911
Australia,
but I'd fucking move there in a 

2066
01:34:59,911 --> 01:34:59,911
heartbeat is shit.
Hit the fan.

2067
01:34:59,911 --> 01:35:03,041
If somebody decided to blow up America 
or if yellowstone exploded and needed a 

2068
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,580
place to live,
I fucking moved to Sydney and a God damn

2069
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:05,030
heartbeat.

2070
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:10,090
Hard to think of another city that has 
just just in terms of the sheer day to 

2071
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:11,750
day standard of living as,
as nice as pleasant place to be.

2072
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,850
You know,
the sunshine,

2073
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:15,700
the hub of the food,
the friendly people,

2074
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,600
everything.
The Asian communities,

2075
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:18,920
the Middle Eastern communities.

2076
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:21,870
The problem is you guys drive on the 
wrong side of the road to switch over.

2077
01:35:21,871 --> 01:35:22,730
I'll move.
Well,

2078
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,070
Americans are like,
listen,

2079
01:35:26,071 --> 01:35:31,071
we invented the fucking car.
Why are you guys driving on the wrong 

2080
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:31,071
side of the Goddamn Road?
You know what that is?

2081
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:31,980
Yes.
I tell me,

2082
01:35:31,981 --> 01:35:36,981
remind me swords.
It's an ancient ancient thing from 

2083
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:40,080
England and that when you would pass on,
the horses were passing the road.

2084
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:43,350
If you were fighting in combat,
you would fight with your right hand.

2085
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:48,680
So most people are right handed.
That's the hand you would carry your 

2086
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:51,081
sword,
so you really want to be on the left 

2087
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:51,081
side,
so that way if someone was on your right

2088
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:51,081
side,
you can hack at them.

2089
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:53,730
If you are on the right side and 
someone's over on your left side and you

2090
01:35:53,731 --> 01:35:58,731
have a sword,
it's fucking very difficult to reach 

2091
01:35:58,731 --> 01:35:58,731
across the horse or you'd have to hack 
on

2092
01:35:58,731 --> 01:36:02,670
do with there being two horses on put to
pulling coaches.

2093
01:36:02,671 --> 01:36:03,600
I mean,
I think you're right,

2094
01:36:03,601 --> 01:36:08,601
but why?
But that doesn't explain why it was 

2095
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:10,251
different here in the states.
Why will people already using wholesome 

2096
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:12,150
cots on the righthand side here?
They also use a right handed

2097
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,870
because when we were.
By the time we got to America,

2098
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,180
by the time European travelers came to 
America,

2099
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,340
we were already like,
fuck England,

2100
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:24,550
fuck your up.
We're going to do shit our way over 

2101
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,161
here.
Let's just go on the other side of the 

2102
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:27,161
road and then we invented cars and so we
like,

2103
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:28,460
we don't have guns.
They're like,

2104
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:33,461
it doesn't matter.
I'd rather be further away from the 

2105
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:33,461
fucking guy shooting.
I'll fucking go on the right side.

2106
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:33,990
I read

2107
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:35,800
that.
In addition to that,

2108
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:40,980
there was.
They will wider roads here so you would 

2109
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,460
have two horses side by side or like for
horses or something.

2110
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:47,490
Pulling Lodge at cots than you than they
had back in England and that it had 

2111
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:49,450
something to do with being in the right 
position to whip the horses.

2112
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:51,880
So you didn't have to cross over your 
body to with the whip.

2113
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:54,180
[inaudible] could be.
Who knows?

2114
01:36:54,270 --> 01:36:55,980
I don't know.
I'm talking out of my ass clearly.

2115
01:36:55,981 --> 01:36:56,350
Yeah,
me too.

2116
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,410
But I would.
I talked to my friends in England.

2117
01:36:58,411 --> 01:37:01,260
They were explaining to me that it was 
actually literally went back to the time

2118
01:37:01,261 --> 01:37:06,261
of sword fighting,
that you would be on the lefthand side 

2119
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:06,261
that I just don't buy.
Why Americans would have changed because

2120
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:08,490
we're better when you're smarter.
We have guns,

2121
01:37:08,491 --> 01:37:10,410
we have jets,
we go to the moon.

2122
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,850
This is a lot,
lot better here.

2123
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:16,910
It's a lot better.
This is why people don't love me or 

2124
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:20,900
America.
Both.

2125
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:22,650
Yeah.
I don't mean it folks.

2126
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,720
Relax.
Everybody please.

2127
01:37:25,410 --> 01:37:30,410
There was a thing that.
It is interesting though,

2128
01:37:31,171 --> 01:37:31,700
isn't it?

2129
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:36,990
How different different cultures kind of
conceive of or different nationalities 

2130
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:36,990
conceive of themselves.

2131
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:41,430
More Koreans are very proud and uh,
the North Koreans particularly 

2132
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:44,470
nationalistic,
so much so that you know,

2133
01:37:44,471 --> 01:37:49,471
it's a crazy basket case of a 
dictatorship and it's the best example 

2134
01:37:49,471 --> 01:37:53,610
of the bullshit that America tries to 
shove down everyone's throats about 

2135
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:56,130
protecting people from bad people like 
Jesus Christ.

2136
01:37:56,131 --> 01:37:58,440
If we're really worried about protecting
people,

2137
01:37:58,441 --> 01:38:03,441
is that what really why we're in 
Afghanistan because we want to protect 

2138
01:38:03,441 --> 01:38:05,841
those folks.
Why the fuck have we not invaded North 

2139
01:38:05,841 --> 01:38:08,570
Korea chartwells to logistics about 
China nuclear weapons and the proximity 

2140
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:11,140
to South Korea who are allies and all 
this blah,

2141
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:16,270
blah blah,
but there's not even a discussion about 

2142
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:18,360
mitigating the situation.
There's zero discussion.

2143
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:18,780
No.
Why?

2144
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,300
No natural resources.
It's so fucking poor.

2145
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:22,260
They have to keep the lights off it.

2146
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:25,160
They're not even strategically important
in any way.

2147
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:30,220
Like the.
They're basically a vessel of China and 

2148
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:30,590
that didn't matter to us.
I just it

2149
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:32,310
back from Canada.
I was gone for a week.

2150
01:38:32,311 --> 01:38:34,530
I was offline essentially for a week.
Pretty much.

2151
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,790
Did fucking Dennis Rodman get Kenneth 
Bay released?

2152
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:43,990
He thinks he said he did.
He wrote a letter right after you got 

2153
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:46,841
back from one trip there.
And he's claiming that I have not seen 

2154
01:38:46,841 --> 01:38:48,740
that reported.
That was the uh.

2155
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:54,350
So he's reporting well,
he does have a relationship with Kim 

2156
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:54,350
Jong.
Ooh.

2157
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:56,330
What's that all about?
Dude loves basketball.

2158
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:57,670
It's fucking great thing.
No,

2159
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:59,870
I understand why he wants to be,
you know,

2160
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:00,920
hub.
And with Dennis,

2161
01:39:00,921 --> 01:39:01,820
what's enough?
Dentists?

2162
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,550
Dennis is broke as fuck.
I mean,

2163
01:39:04,551 --> 01:39:06,620
you think about what is not in it for 
dentists.

2164
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,270
What does Dennis have going on?
Man?

2165
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:10,960
It's not about.
I'm not baffled by like,

2166
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,780
uh,
why he does it.

2167
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:14,580
I'm baffled that he's so bought into 
that.

2168
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:17,400
He seemingly so bought into the 
propaganda of that regime.

2169
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:18,210
He's,
he keeps,

2170
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:23,470
he has this stupid moral equivalency.
This is something that also frustrates 

2171
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:23,700
me when people are like,
oh,

2172
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:25,290
because of the U.
S does bad stuff.

2173
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:30,291
That basically means that we're not in a
position to criticize anybody else 

2174
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:30,291
because you say that.
Yeah.

2175
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:30,291
He's like,
Hey,

2176
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:32,430
robin says he helped secure.
Kenneth pays really well.

2177
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,350
It's nice and Kenneth Bay got released.
He's like,

2178
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,430
I've heard him say,
look,

2179
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,840
Kim Jong Kim gentlemen,
you know,

2180
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:39,660
we here we're hear all this propaganda 
about what a bad guy he is.

2181
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:40,320
But Hey,
you know,

2182
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:43,910
Clinton Clinton screwed Lewinsky.
So you know,

2183
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:46,590
stuff happens.
Bad stuff happens here as well.

2184
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:50,070
That's like the dumbest fucking.
Not exactly parallel dude.

2185
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:51,300
I think that

2186
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:56,090
what he's probably doing is trying in 
some way to.

2187
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,370
If he goes over there on a regular 
basis,

2188
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:00,800
he has to play politics.
He has to,

2189
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,540
he has to say something positive about 
it.

2190
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:07,750
I mean he has to,
he says negative things is going to get 

2191
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:07,750
back to that.

2192
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:10,440
I just don't think.
He doesn't strike me as a very smart 

2193
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:10,440
guy.

2194
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:10,440
He's definitely not that.
I mean,

2195
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,000
do you ever see him on celebrity rehab 
with Dr.

2196
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:14,150
drew knew he was terrible.
It was awful.

2197
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:16,330
I mean,
he's not a bright guy and it's,

2198
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,390
you know,
he's,

2199
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:21,350
he's also in a weird situation where he 
doesn't have a whole lot of job options.

2200
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:26,530
I was at the k one k one is um,
it's one of the biggest kickboxing 

2201
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:32,200
organizations in the world and they had 
a big mixed martial arts event in Los 

2202
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:32,420
Angeles many,
many years ago was the,

2203
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,440
not many,
many,

2204
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:38,441
but it was the debut of Brock Lesnar in 
mixed martial arts and Dennis Rodman for

2205
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:43,990
whatever reason,
got hired by k one to be there and like 

2206
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:44,360
pump it up.
And like it was very strange.

2207
01:40:44,361 --> 01:40:46,510
It was very Japanese because Japanese,
they're there.

2208
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:49,280
They have their big fans of pageantry at
these events.

2209
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:51,920
And the events are often filled with 
like huge,

2210
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:57,090
like gigantic crowds and big,
big walkthroughs and big productions and

2211
01:40:57,461 --> 01:41:01,360
explosions and fire and like,
so Dennis Rodman is like standing at the

2212
01:41:01,361 --> 01:41:02,610
top of this things,
you know,

2213
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:07,650
and he gave the speech and it was just 
so dumb and awkward and he was saying 

2214
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:10,060
fuck the UFC k one is here and all these
different crazy shit.

2215
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:12,670
But my point is like he doesn't have a 
lot of money.

2216
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:15,460
Like he has to do things like this.
He doesn't have a lot of options.

2217
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:18,230
So then just don't talk about it.
I will stop or something.

2218
01:41:18,231 --> 01:41:23,231
It just frustrates me when,
when stupid people talk about shit that 

2219
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:23,390
unless that.
And it's usually,

2220
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:28,720
it's so fast,
it's so easy and fashionable also to be 

2221
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:28,720
like anti American and to be anti.
Yes,

2222
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,740
America's foreign policy is a basket 
case.

2223
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,170
America has done a lot of shitty stuff 
but you know,

2224
01:41:33,171 --> 01:41:36,230
you get this also with conversations 
around Islam and you know,

2225
01:41:36,231 --> 01:41:38,120
I know you've spoken to Sam Harris and 
stuff about this,

2226
01:41:38,121 --> 01:41:41,780
about the,
the oldest old things are not equal.

2227
01:41:41,781 --> 01:41:46,410
I just interviewed an Iraqi human rights
campaigner who,

2228
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:49,760
who has come to the US as refugee.
He's in his early twenties.

2229
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:52,460
He grew up under Saddam Hussein.
He,

2230
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:56,120
he grew up during the American 
occupation and he is.

2231
01:41:56,190 --> 01:42:01,190
He'll basically frustratedly saying,
stop saying that there isn't a problem 

2232
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:05,830
in Islam and stop saying that the US is,
is to blame for everything that's going 

2233
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:09,200
on in the region.
We have our own problems and by and when

2234
01:42:09,201 --> 01:42:12,010
leftwing people think that they're doing
the right thing by being old fashioned,

2235
01:42:12,011 --> 01:42:17,011
oblique kind of anti American.
You're not siding with the people who 

2236
01:42:17,011 --> 01:42:20,051
actually need help over there.
You're not siding with the secularists 

2237
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:20,450
over there and the and the people who 
care about human rights.

2238
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:23,700
There's also this weird thing,
and this goes back to the social justice

2239
01:42:23,701 --> 01:42:28,701
warrior thing,
where people are allowed to criticize 

2240
01:42:28,701 --> 01:42:31,650
Christianity openly,
but if you criticize Islam,

2241
01:42:31,651 --> 01:42:33,120
you become Islamophobic.

2242
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,790
Oh Shit.
That's such an overused term.

2243
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:41,850
It is.
Which is not to say that there aren't 

2244
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:41,850
Islamophobes like the preacher who 
wanted to burn the Koran.

2245
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:42,170
Well,
there's,

2246
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,080
there's,
there's people are phobic in many,

2247
01:42:45,081 --> 01:42:46,130
many ways.
You know,

2248
01:42:46,131 --> 01:42:47,840
there's Christian have hopes,
you know,

2249
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:51,680
you want to look at it that way.
I've had Christians on my podcast that I

2250
01:42:51,681 --> 01:42:56,681
deeply enjoy rupert sheldrake,
who's a scientist who's also a 

2251
01:42:56,681 --> 01:43:00,101
Christian,
but his version of Christianity is more 

2252
01:43:00,101 --> 01:43:02,060
of a philosophy and it's like 
psychedelically based.

2253
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:07,400
Then I mean it was very,
very interesting guy and openly 

2254
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:10,991
Christian and he derives or he.
He gets a lot of comfort from that and I

2255
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:17,600
know he does it in a very,
very intelligent and well thought out 

2256
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,551
way and it's.
It's an interesting point to discuss 

2257
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:25,451
with a guy like that,
but this Islamophobic thing like this 

2258
01:43:25,451 --> 01:43:29,861
idea that if you criticize like Sam 
Harris has been accused of it on a 

2259
01:43:29,861 --> 01:43:30,730
multiple times,
it's just Islamophobia.

2260
01:43:30,731 --> 01:43:33,080
His Islamophobic stance.
Listen,

2261
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:36,110
all religions are fucking terrible.
All of them.

2262
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:38,350
They're terrible.
They're terrible for I.

2263
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:43,600
ideologies are bad for thinking they are
bad because they lock you into a 

2264
01:43:44,421 --> 01:43:46,910
strategy or they lock you into a pattern
rather.

2265
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:52,060
And if you,
you aspire to be divine inside that 

2266
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,050
ideology,
especially in ancient one,

2267
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:57,530
it's extremely difficult to think 
outside the box.

2268
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:02,770
Well,
they are the oldest and most original 

2269
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:02,770
incarnation of what I was talking about 
at the beginning of the,

2270
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:05,510
of the show,
which is thinking in terms of labels and

2271
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:07,010
preset,
uh,

2272
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:12,040
you know,
things that you can just pull out of a 

2273
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,871
box and take with you rather than 
actually communicating or thinking 

2274
01:44:13,871 --> 01:44:14,300
originally or being authentic.
Right.

2275
01:44:14,301 --> 01:44:15,110
I mean,
you know,

2276
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:20,210
the,
the tribes that we belong to an hour be 

2277
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:22,750
they,
the pro gay tribe or the suit or the 

2278
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:25,440
cancel Kobe tribe or any of those things
are really just new small cultural 

2279
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,980
versions of the old biggest tribes which
are religion.

2280
01:44:27,981 --> 01:44:32,981
It's religion is just the easy preset 
way for people to inherit assumptions 

2281
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:38,411
about the meaning of life and the 
history of the world without having to 

2282
01:44:38,411 --> 01:44:38,420
do any intellectual lifting of their 
own.

2283
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,470
I also think it's,
when you look at religions,

2284
01:44:41,471 --> 01:44:46,471
I'm absolutely fascinated by religious 
and I find them amazing and one of the 

2285
01:44:46,471 --> 01:44:50,161
things that I find amazing about them 
just from a historical historical 

2286
01:44:50,161 --> 01:44:53,281
perspective of thinking about people 
that lived in a time where there were no

2287
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:55,030
answers.
I mean,

2288
01:44:55,031 --> 01:45:00,031
it is really truly amazing.
We started coming up with mouth noises 

2289
01:45:00,031 --> 01:45:03,931
to indicate where to go and what to do 
and what foods to eat and what's known 

2290
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:07,780
and what's yes,
and then slowly but surely after fucking

2291
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:12,220
eons of staring at the stars and seeing 
people die and experiencing loss,

2292
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:16,720
they tried to find meaning to it all and
they slowly but surely created these,

2293
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:22,050
these fables and these parables and 
these things that eventually were 

2294
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:24,310
written down and translated from 
language to language.

2295
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:29,580
I find it absolutely fascinating when 
you look at it from a historical 

2296
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:34,201
perspective of this,
this being this organism trying to 

2297
01:45:34,201 --> 01:45:38,011
understand its place in the cosmos and 
that's what I think is beautiful about 

2298
01:45:38,011 --> 01:45:38,770
religion.
I think from a historical perspective,

2299
01:45:38,771 --> 01:45:43,771
it's beautiful.
The problematic aspects of it when you 

2300
01:45:43,771 --> 01:45:46,420
try to apply it in 2014 with all the 
goddamn information that we know,

2301
01:45:46,421 --> 01:45:51,421
and I didn't mean to say God damn,
but I said it because it's appropriate 

2302
01:45:51,421 --> 01:45:54,330
accidentally.
The information that we have now that 

2303
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:55,370
refutes virtually everything.
That's right.

2304
01:45:55,510 --> 01:46:00,510
I mean he's.
Look what you say is very nice and 

2305
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:00,510
poetic about the historical origins of 
religion,

2306
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:02,140
but as soon as the enlightenment came 
along,

2307
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,000
as soon as the scientific method was 
developed,

2308
01:46:04,001 --> 01:46:09,001
as soon,
certainly by the time Charles Darwin 

2309
01:46:09,001 --> 01:46:12,090
provided an explanation with how 
naturalistic processes could give rise 

2310
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:15,931
to intelligent life,
you don't need those original myths 

2311
01:46:15,931 --> 01:46:16,750
anymore.
I mean we should long ago have been able

2312
01:46:16,751 --> 01:46:18,280
to dispense with them and the fact that 
we're,

2313
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:23,340
we're unable to talk openly and frankly 
about how concerned we are to be about 

2314
01:46:24,431 --> 01:46:27,550
people who take their religions 
literally is a problem.

2315
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,650
It's a huge problem.
And I also.

2316
01:46:29,651 --> 01:46:34,651
I also have a problem.
I agree with Sam Harris also in the 

2317
01:46:34,651 --> 01:46:34,651
point that you know,
moderate.

2318
01:46:34,651 --> 01:46:34,651
You say you,
you,

2319
01:46:34,651 --> 01:46:39,070
you,
you enjoy talking about Christianity 

2320
01:46:39,070 --> 01:46:40,180
with this Christian who you had on.
I do have a problem with people who give

2321
01:46:40,181 --> 01:46:45,181
cover essentially to religious 
extremists by presenting religion as if 

2322
01:46:45,181 --> 01:46:49,121
it can be my reasonable thing because to
the extent that moderate or moderate 

2323
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:54,801
Muslims are moderate is the extent to 
which they don't really follow the 

2324
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:54,801
letter of their faith.
Right?

2325
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:59,501
And then you have to reinterpret and 
kind of squint and peer at your holy 

2326
01:46:59,501 --> 01:47:03,381
book through a particular prism,
and then do a lot of juggling and 

2327
01:47:03,381 --> 01:47:06,891
reinterpreting in order to come out with
a conclusion that is kind of morally 

2328
01:47:06,891 --> 01:47:09,530
tenable in 2014 to secular people.
Yeah.

2329
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:13,020
That is extremely important point.
Right?

2330
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:18,200
And that's,
that's a big issue when it comes to the 

2331
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,850
leaving of the Islamic tradition.
If you leave,

2332
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:22,980
you're supposed to be killed the 
fastest.

2333
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:28,370
Yeah.
Apostasy in Islam is punishable by 

2334
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:28,620
death.
Homosexuality is punishable by death.

2335
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:33,820
Um,
I watched a fucking horrible video last 

2336
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:36,640
week,
absolutely horrible of a woman who was 

2337
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:36,640
accused of adultery and she was stoned 
to death.

2338
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:37,510
And this was,
uh,

2339
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:40,560
this was all carried out by these isis 
guys apparently.

2340
01:47:40,561 --> 01:47:41,360
Supposedly,
you know,

2341
01:47:41,361 --> 01:47:42,510
whether or not that's true.
I don't know.

2342
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:44,460
I just watched this video and it's being
translated.

2343
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:49,110
But this woman,
she tried to apologize to her father.

2344
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:51,630
Her father wouldn't even touch his hair.
Touch her hand.

2345
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,070
He wouldn't shake her hand.
He says,

2346
01:47:53,071 --> 01:47:55,110
you're not my daughter anymore.
And then he threw the first rock.

2347
01:47:55,111 --> 01:48:00,111
It was fucking horrible.
And that is all done under the guise of 

2348
01:48:00,111 --> 01:48:00,111
religion,
all of it.

2349
01:48:00,111 --> 01:48:04,340
And you constantly hear apologists like 
Reza Aslan is an obvious example saying,

2350
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:09,610
look,
this is a gross or Ben Affleck on Bill 

2351
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:09,610
Maher's show.
This is a gross Caribbean.

2352
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:10,820
Ben Affleck,
he's gonna fuck up Batman.

2353
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,390
I know that son of a bitch.
We need a jihad.

2354
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:17,420
I don't mean that.
Come on,

2355
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:18,170
you're a good guy.

2356
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:21,260
Uh,
the refrain is always,

2357
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:24,560
this is a generalization.
Most Muslims are good people and that is

2358
01:48:24,561 --> 01:48:26,450
absolutely true.
The vast,

2359
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,780
vast,
vast majority of Muslims are good people

2360
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,030
and just like you and me.
But the,

2361
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:37,720
the kind of the software that they're 
running on is problematic.

2362
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,720
And this rocky and human rights activist
I was talking to was saying,

2363
01:48:41,721 --> 01:48:46,721
look,
one thing that raises Aslan will always 

2364
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:46,721
say is like,
what about Indonesia?

2365
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:49,361
For example?
Indonesia is the most populous Muslim 

2366
01:48:49,361 --> 01:48:49,361
country in the world.
Apologists for Islam,

2367
01:48:49,361 --> 01:48:54,011
uh,
constantly pointing at it and saying 

2368
01:48:54,011 --> 01:48:54,011
it's,
it's fairly progressive.

2369
01:48:54,011 --> 01:48:54,340
It's had a female leader,
you know,

2370
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:55,700
it's democratic.
It's not.

2371
01:48:55,701 --> 01:48:57,170
This is not Saudi Arabia,
you know,

2372
01:48:57,190 --> 01:48:59,630
to to think that all of Islam is about 
not letting,

2373
01:48:59,631 --> 01:49:04,631
not letting women drive is a 
misrepresentation of the way that most 

2374
01:49:04,631 --> 01:49:08,231
Muslims live,
but you would hardly say that a country 

2375
01:49:08,231 --> 01:49:11,831
like Indonesia or even Jordan or any one
of the other sort of good Muslim 

2376
01:49:12,261 --> 01:49:17,261
countries is particularly progressive by
the standards that we should expect as 

2377
01:49:17,631 --> 01:49:22,631
liberals as smaller.
I don't mean in the political sense 

2378
01:49:22,631 --> 01:49:25,040
within the United States,
but as people who believe in freedom,

2379
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:27,820
yes,
that you know he.

2380
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,300
This is rocky was saying,
this is the.

2381
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:34,360
This is the bigotry of low expectations 
that if someone in the United States 

2382
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:37,670
were to say the things about women and 
gays that are routinely said,

2383
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:40,790
even in Indonesia and the most moderate 
Muslim countries,

2384
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:46,060
liberals would be absolutely outraged.
Why are we holding them to such a 

2385
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:46,100
different standard?
It's very good.

2386
01:49:46,101 --> 01:49:46,120
Very

2387
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:51,120
good point,
and I that one of the resist the 

2388
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,000
resistance.
One of the big points of resistance when

2389
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:57,030
people in these countries get upset at 
people criticizing religion is you're 

2390
01:49:57,030 --> 01:50:01,440
essentially criticizing their way of 
life and their culture and it's tied in 

2391
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,950
together and that this is almost an 
extra bowl from their,

2392
01:50:02,951 --> 01:50:04,870
their,
their daily existence that Islam,

2393
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:10,140
whether or not they believe in death for
adultery or homosexual or any of the 

2394
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:11,770
things that we find completely 
offensive.

2395
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:17,160
What you're saying by criticizing their 
religion is you're criticizing their 

2396
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:17,920
very way of life.
That's right,

2397
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:22,300
and that's what you're dealing with when
you're dealing with these fundamental,

2398
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:24,730
these fundamentalist societies

2399
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:29,320
and not even fundamental societies.
I mean I can understand that if,

2400
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:34,710
if all of your being and your culture 
and your family and your community are 

2401
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:36,490
woven up in a certain set of traditions,
even if that's just,

2402
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:37,830
you know,
a,

2403
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:42,910
a Catholic Catholicism because you grew 
up in a suburb of Boston and you know 

2404
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:45,010
that's the way you do things and then 
someone confronts you and says that that

2405
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:50,011
is just a tissue of fabrications and 
lies that have been handed down for 

2406
01:50:50,011 --> 01:50:53,430
generations and it's wholly worthless.
That's going to be an affront to to,

2407
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,910
you know,
I mean it's not because it's not an,

2408
01:50:55,070 --> 01:51:00,070
we're not intellectual beings.
We can't like unpack and disentangle the

2409
01:51:00,191 --> 01:51:05,191
sort of factual claims of our faith from
the lived experience of being a human 

2410
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:08,210
being who lives in a community and goes 
to church and has a nice posture and all

2411
01:51:08,211 --> 01:51:11,710
of that sort of stuff.
We have to find a way to do that though.

2412
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:15,980
Like we have to find a way to 
disentangle when people do identity from

2413
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:21,100
our,
from the intellectual claims of 

2414
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:21,100
religion.

2415
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:21,100
Yeah.
It's a lot of people do it very slowly.

2416
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,140
They do it over the course of their 
lives.

2417
01:51:22,141 --> 01:51:23,840
Like I have some friends that,
um,

2418
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:29,340
when I met them probably a decade ago,
they were pretty hardcore Mormons.

2419
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:33,180
They're really nice folks and they're 
friends with my wife first and then we'd

2420
01:51:33,190 --> 01:51:38,190
go to dinner with them and then we'd 
have these bizarre fucking 

2421
01:51:38,190 --> 01:51:38,470
conversations.
Like you don't believe in a higher power

2422
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,150
I go to.
It's not that I don't believe,

2423
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:45,151
I just don't see any evidence.
Like show me some evidence of a higher 

2424
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:45,151
power.
And then I'll say,

2425
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:45,151
well,
that makes a lot of sense,

2426
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:46,120
but it she's like,
well,

2427
01:51:46,121 --> 01:51:51,121
I wouldn't be able to live with.
I wouldn't be able to get up every day 

2428
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:51,121
if I didn't think that something's going
to happen after I die.

2429
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:53,830
I go,
don't you enjoy going out to dinner?

2430
01:51:53,831 --> 01:51:54,460
We're out at dinner.

2431
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,350
We had a nice dinner at a nice 
restaurant.

2432
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:59,500
We're having fun having a glass of wine.
You are enjoying this.

2433
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:04,800
Like why does this have to lead to some 
magic fairy land where people have 

2434
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,160
wings?
Why does that have to,

2435
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,380
why can't you just enjoy this life?
Well,

2436
01:52:08,381 --> 01:52:10,840
I don't know.
I don't know what happens when I die.

2437
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:15,870
I mean,
if I didn't know what happens when I 

2438
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:15,870
die,
I wouldn't be able to go on.

2439
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:15,870
I'm like,
well,

2440
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:16,660
that's pretty ridiculous.
That's pretty ridiculous.

2441
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:19,850
But for a lot of people it becomes,
um,

2442
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:24,820
scaffolding for your thoughts,
scaffolding for your emotions.

2443
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:28,480
Like you have this structure that allows
you to get by.

2444
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:33,490
It allows you to get through every day.
And if someone pulls that structure and 

2445
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:34,600
you're forced to sort of create a 
structure on your own,

2446
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,320
it's extremely problematic and these 
people that I'm friends with,

2447
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:43,530
they abandoned their church and they 
abandoned their church and now they're 

2448
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:48,100
in this very weird limbo place where 
it's fairly interesting because they're 

2449
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:48,100
very insightful.

2450
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:51,050
And the woman we had this weird 
conversation which she was talking about

2451
01:52:51,051 --> 01:52:56,051
how she feels like she's very open to 
being scammed because she's so trusting 

2452
01:52:56,051 --> 01:52:59,630
because she grew up in a fundamentalist 
mormon background and that she's just so

2453
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:04,250
open to suggestion because she was 
buying into horseshit her whole life and

2454
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:09,251
she,
she just didn't question and this 

2455
01:53:09,251 --> 01:53:09,590
becomes sort of a pattern of thinking 
and it's,

2456
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:14,560
it's hard for people to just all of a 
sudden reestablish their,

2457
01:53:14,561 --> 01:53:19,561
their ideology would establish their 
position and religion is an excellent 

2458
01:53:19,561 --> 01:53:21,310
scaffolding for sort of establishing 
your,

2459
01:53:21,311 --> 01:53:22,210
your place in the world.

2460
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:25,230
Yeah.
And it's very comforting to have a sense

2461
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:26,970
of authority of as well,
right?

2462
01:53:26,971 --> 01:53:28,790
I mean there's something like being,
having,

2463
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:30,330
having a loving.
Yes.

2464
01:53:30,331 --> 01:53:35,331
Having the creator of the universe like 
personally taken interest in your 

2465
01:53:35,331 --> 01:53:39,831
wellbeing must be an incredible sort of 
ego boost and Monday incredible security

2466
01:53:39,961 --> 01:53:40,590
blanket.
I mean,

2467
01:53:40,591 --> 01:53:45,591
there's a reason why religions strokes 
us in certain ways that 98 percent of 

2468
01:53:45,591 --> 01:53:45,591
the world is religious.
You know,

2469
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,160
it,
it,

2470
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:51,190
it provides,
it must provide some kind of sanctuary 

2471
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:51,190
that's hard to,
to,

2472
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:51,450
to shake off.

2473
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,840
I think it's an enlightenment bridge.
I think it's a,

2474
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:58,850
it's almost like a,
a construct that we've created to sort 

2475
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:01,501
of get our way out of the monkey body to
get our way through to some next stage 

2476
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:05,761
and as we're rejecting it now,
pretty much for the first time in human 

2477
01:54:05,761 --> 01:54:09,241
history,
it's culturally acceptable to reject it 

2478
01:54:09,241 --> 01:54:12,270
and it's almost more prevalent amongst 
youth than it is to accept it.

2479
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:15,830
If you talk to people in the,
you know,

2480
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:19,690
the early 19 hundreds about rejecting 
God and atheism,

2481
01:54:19,691 --> 01:54:24,160
but you would get a small percentage of 
highly educated people that would accept

2482
01:54:24,161 --> 01:54:29,161
that idea.
Whereas if you go to universities today 

2483
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:29,161
and you promote atheism,
you're gonna get a massive following.

2484
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:33,920
Yeah.
There's a massive amount of people that 

2485
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:33,920
are with you on this.
I'm,

2486
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,620
I'm not even following Shinsei following
a massive amount of people in agreement 

2487
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:36,660
with you on these concepts that they.
Yeah,

2488
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:41,670
we are dealing with a new era when new 
era of understanding and for a lot of 

2489
01:54:41,670 --> 01:54:42,880
people that's absolutely terrifying.

2490
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:48,120
Yeah.
It's less terrifying to me than the 

2491
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:50,550
possibility of people,
of people with religious delusions 

2492
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:50,550
getting access to weapons of mass 
destruction,

2493
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,780
which is why I keep fighting,
fighting the atheist fight.

2494
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:58,200
I think this is.
This has the potential to be absolutely 

2495
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:02,101
calamitous and whatever we can do to to 
minimize religious thinking and 

2496
01:55:02,101 --> 01:55:05,050
basically just hold people to account 
for what they claim to believe.

2497
01:55:05,051 --> 01:55:05,920
I mean if,
if,

2498
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:10,960
if you were interviewing someone for a 
job and you were considering hiring them

2499
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:16,050
and they started talking about how Elvis
is still alive and he communicates with 

2500
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:19,210
them through by leaving messages in 
their toast or something,

2501
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,780
I when you would just immediately 
disqualify that person from you,

2502
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:23,230
you would think,
this is a crazy person.

2503
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:28,260
It would be nice to me if you similarly 
judged people who claim that the creator

2504
01:55:29,711 --> 01:55:34,711
of the universe speaks to them on a 
daily basis and listening to what they 

2505
01:55:34,711 --> 01:55:37,651
say and listen to their prayers and,
and intervenes in worldly affairs to 

2506
01:55:37,651 --> 01:55:42,120
cause,
make natural disasters like destroy 

2507
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:42,120
their neighbor's house but not their 
house.

2508
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,630
I mean like for so many things on your 
mental arrogance.

2509
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:47,250
Like I saw her on the TV,
there was like a,

2510
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:52,300
you know,
a wildfire that went through an 

2511
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:52,490
Australian suburb and the lady standing 
there in front of her house,

2512
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:53,620
she's like,
ah,

2513
01:55:53,621 --> 01:55:55,890
you know,
God saved my house.

2514
01:55:55,891 --> 01:55:58,140
Like what?
God hated good neighbors so much.

2515
01:55:58,141 --> 01:56:03,141
He wanted to burn down their house.
That's a pretty fucked up thing for God 

2516
01:56:03,141 --> 01:56:05,901
to do.
Like just to judge people on these 

2517
01:56:05,901 --> 01:56:06,270
beliefs the same way we would judge them
if you,

2518
01:56:06,271 --> 01:56:10,020
if they weren't religious beliefs,
if they were equally silly but,

2519
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:13,810
but not protected by the fact that they,
they,

2520
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:15,150
they fold into a formal role.

2521
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:20,640
Well,
the legacy thought patterns or thought 

2522
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:20,640
patterns that existed before the 
Internet.

2523
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:24,440
And I think that the Internet is the new
religion in the sense that it's not a 

2524
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:24,440
religion,
but it's a,

2525
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,910
it's a way to establish cultures and 
communities.

2526
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:31,911
It's a way to exchange information.
It's a way to to live and think that 

2527
01:56:31,911 --> 01:56:33,000
never existed before when you were 
alone,

2528
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:38,001
when you were by yourself,
when you were in these small tribes and 

2529
01:56:38,001 --> 01:56:38,790
all you had with this stupid old book of
nonsense stories about,

2530
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:44,120
you know,
the original two people that existed in 

2531
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:46,761
fucking earth being created in seven 
days by an old man who lives in the 

2532
01:56:46,761 --> 01:56:48,840
clouds.
That was all you had saw your hat and we

2533
01:56:48,841 --> 01:56:50,300
have so much more now.
And the,

2534
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:55,320
the,
the landscape that you're surveying is 

2535
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,540
so much larger.
The landscape of information is just not

2536
01:56:57,541 --> 01:57:02,541
just,
it's almost inconceivably larger and 

2537
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:03,780
inconceivably larger than when I was a 
boy.

2538
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:04,870
I mean I,
I was,

2539
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:09,890
I went to Catholic school for only one 
year and I was very fortunate that I 

2540
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:14,331
didn't have very religious parents and 
they just sent me to Catholic school 

2541
01:57:14,331 --> 01:57:14,940
because it was a good option.
I mean everyone was sort of religion,

2542
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:16,530
religious,
but only casually,

2543
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:22,010
but it was so bad that I abandoned all 
my ideas of religion and I can really 

2544
01:57:22,501 --> 01:57:27,501
clearly remember this because it was an 
important part of my life because my 

2545
01:57:27,501 --> 01:57:31,461
parents had broken up when I was five 
years old and I was really insecure and 

2546
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:33,600
scared and I just.
My Dad wasn't around anymore.

2547
01:57:33,601 --> 01:57:36,510
I was with my mom and I was,
for whatever reason,

2548
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:41,070
I was seeking some sort of comfort in 
religion,

2549
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:43,290
what God says you should do this and God
says,

2550
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:44,850
I don't even know who the fuck I heard 
it from,

2551
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:50,370
but I went to one year of Catholic 
school and these people were so horrible

2552
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:53,700
that I abandoned everything.
I had given it all up by the time.

2553
01:57:53,701 --> 01:57:53,770
Okay.

2554
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:55,130
They're the,
they're the cancel,

2555
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:57,790
Colbert religion they could have.
Had you had.

2556
01:57:57,791 --> 01:57:59,440
You just been a little sweeter.

2557
01:57:59,590 --> 01:58:02,410
I so I understand it.
Even though I was only five years old,

2558
01:58:02,411 --> 01:58:03,690
I can remember it.
I mean,

2559
01:58:03,691 --> 01:58:07,840
I remember in vague sort of snapshots 
and some weird,

2560
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:13,500
weird images in our mind and we are 
concepts that I've sort of like held 

2561
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:13,500
onto.

2562
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,610
I've never experienced it.
I've never,

2563
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,130
I've never.
It's a,

2564
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:18,420
it's a,
an aspect of human,

2565
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:23,570
human kind and human civilization and 
human psychology that is totally opaque 

2566
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:24,620
and ineffable to me.
I'd done,

2567
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:28,350
I'd done it under.
I can't quite understand how.

2568
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:32,820
I'm almost one of the very,
very few people in the world who doesn't

2569
01:58:32,821 --> 01:58:37,821
have that Jane Breed,
I guess I've me to a computer.

2570
01:58:38,030 --> 01:58:39,410
Well you're one of the very few people 
in the world,

2571
01:58:39,411 --> 01:58:41,320
but I think the children that are 
growing up today,

2572
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,280
kids that are born

2573
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:47,280
in 2014,
there's going to be a less and less of 

2574
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:47,920
that it's going to be.
And also I should carve out here.

2575
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:50,800
There are certain civilized societies.
And again,

2576
01:58:50,801 --> 01:58:53,020
I use the word civilized advisedly,
not to,

2577
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:54,520
not to shit on,
you know,

2578
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:59,790
developing countries,
but there are educated rich countries 

2579
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:02,110
where the populations have basically 
gotten rid of religion altogether.

2580
01:59:02,111 --> 01:59:03,820
Really?
Cultures in Denmark.

2581
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:06,250
Um,
I mean Australia and New Zealand,

2582
01:59:06,251 --> 01:59:11,251
a pretty secular,
like paypal will normal nominally tick 

2583
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:11,251
Catholic on a,
on a box,

2584
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:16,081
but when you actually stopped to ask 
them whether or not they believe any of 

2585
01:59:16,081 --> 01:59:18,660
the tenants,
you've got 60 or 70 percent of the 

2586
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:19,150
population who never go to church and 
don't think of themselves as being,

2587
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,760
as being religious.
We'll look about gluggy Canada,

2588
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,890
less religious than America.
America is less religious than Mexico,

2589
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:32,100
right?
America is the most religious rich 

2590
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:34,351
country,
and that's all by the Reagan 

2591
01:59:34,351 --> 01:59:34,351
administration.

2592
01:59:34,351 --> 01:59:34,650
Those cocksuckers.
Why?

2593
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:36,920
Because they courted it.
They courted the,

2594
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:37,510
the,
the,

2595
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:43,020
the rat model of Christian religious 
people from the 19 eighties were courted

2596
01:59:43,271 --> 01:59:48,271
by the Reagan administration because 
they recognize them as being a source 

2597
01:59:48,271 --> 01:59:52,050
of.
If you could get those people on your 

2598
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:52,050
side,
you had a guaranteed base.

2599
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:53,260
That's where they get their political 
clout from.

2600
01:59:53,261 --> 01:59:55,030
But it goes back a long way in American 
history,

2601
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:58,210
the strain of puritanical evangelic 
event,

2602
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:00,640
evangelical protestantism,
uh,

2603
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:03,220
in Australia,
we have a saying that whenever there's a

2604
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:06,880
moral outrage and America and America 
gets it's tits in a tangle about,

2605
02:00:06,881 --> 02:00:08,920
you know,
Janet Jackson's Boob or something,

2606
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:13,930
we say,
thank God we were founded by criminals 

2607
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:13,930
and.
No,

2608
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:17,580
but it's true though.
I mean Australia has legalized 

2609
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:17,580
prostitution.
Yeah.

2610
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:18,850
Australia has a lot of things that 
America doesn't have in that sense.

2611
02:00:18,851 --> 02:00:20,090
And I think the,
the,

2612
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:25,290
the foundation,
the original echoes of ignorance that 

2613
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:25,290
started this whole thing off.

2614
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:30,210
They still reverberate in 2014 and I was
really ridiculous ideas about sex in 

2615
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:31,150
this country.
Oh God.

2616
02:00:31,151 --> 02:00:33,310
Don't even get me started.
It's crazy.

2617
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:34,380
I'm trying to get you started.
It is.

2618
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:39,810
That's why we're here.
The dysfunction that religion puts into 

2619
02:00:39,810 --> 02:00:42,040
people's sex lives,
I think is just.

2620
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:47,460
Well for a start,
it's criminal because it leads to so 

2621
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:47,740
much suffering,
especially in the gay community.

2622
02:00:47,741 --> 02:00:48,340
I mean,
you know,

2623
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:49,590
the,
the level of teens,

2624
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:54,780
teenage suicide among Quia kids in 
religious areas is shocking.

2625
02:00:55,151 --> 02:01:00,151
Is a national disgrace that we should be
doing a lot more about and we should be 

2626
02:01:00,151 --> 02:01:02,230
much more vocal about not tolerating,
you know,

2627
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:06,550
preachers preaching of hate,
the preaching of hate and also this idea

2628
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:09,340
that it's a choice.
That's maddening to me.

2629
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:12,060
What always makes me feel like I was 
reading a,

2630
02:01:12,210 --> 02:01:17,210
an opinion by Scalia about this and it 
almost sounded like these people are 

2631
02:01:17,210 --> 02:01:19,930
bisexual because if he believes it's a 
choice,

2632
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:23,740
he's implying that he could choose to 
blow a guy.

2633
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:25,630
Well,
he couldn't choose to blow a guy.

2634
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,920
Yeah.
Why not?

2635
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:28,380
He could.
I mean,

2636
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:30,130
if he's just like,
fuck man.

2637
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:33,640
Bowie apparently slept together.
If you want to believe.

2638
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,890
Yeah.
I'm fucking shocked at ex wife.

2639
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,690
Lot of crazy stuff was going on.
It was the seventies.

2640
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:40,040
I get they got nutty,
but I think it is a

2641
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,990
choice.
But here's my point.

2642
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:45,860
So what if you're a straight person that
you choose to do gay shit?

2643
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:46,970
What?
Who Cares?

2644
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:48,910
Why does anyone care?
And if you will,

2645
02:01:48,911 --> 02:01:51,320
why would anyone say that?
It must be a choice.

2646
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:55,910
How could you possibly know what someone
wants to or doesn't want to do,

2647
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:56,870
what they feel inside,

2648
02:01:57,100 --> 02:02:02,100
and even if it were a choice,
let's assume for the sake of argument 

2649
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:02,880
that everyone is like perfectly 
bisexual.

2650
02:02:02,881 --> 02:02:04,770
It's an absurd argument,
but this is kind of what they're saying,

2651
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:10,160
what they're implying.
If they're saying that it's totally a 

2652
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,100
choice,
then you don't give up your civil rights

2653
02:02:11,101 --> 02:02:14,130
just because you belong to the community
you belong to as a choice.

2654
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:16,230
Religion is a choice,
but it's still protected.

2655
02:02:16,231 --> 02:02:19,110
You still have the right to worship in 
whatever faith you want.

2656
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:24,320
The fact that I can choose to be a 
question or choose to be a Muslim 

2657
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,811
doesn't deprive me of my right to 
exercise the to the free exercise of 

2658
02:02:26,811 --> 02:02:27,270
religion.
Similarly,

2659
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:32,330
the my choice to be married to a man 
should not even if even if it is 

2660
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:36,411
completely a choice,
the way that I'm hardwired sexually and 

2661
02:02:36,411 --> 02:02:36,930
emotionally should not deprive me of my 
civil rights.

2662
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:42,050
Absolutely,
and that's one of the most offensive 

2663
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:44,001
ideas in when it comes to this country 
where there's an argument against same 

2664
02:02:44,001 --> 02:02:48,531
sex marriages and it's still a fucking 
hot point topic of debate in 2014.

2665
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:51,590
How many states are where our same sex 
marriage too?

2666
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:54,240
I think that's fucking crazy.
That is crazy.

2667
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:56,700
Vatican propose a dramatic shift in 
attitude towards gays.

2668
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,650
Same sex couple.
This new pope.

2669
02:02:58,651 --> 02:03:03,651
I'm not into the pope man,
but this new new pope is a fucking and 

2670
02:03:03,651 --> 02:03:06,030
interesting is a goodie.
He sits on a regular chair.

2671
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:08,400
He doesn't ride around the pope.
Tmobile.

2672
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:12,450
I mean they got rid of that evil fucker 
and they went a 180 degrees.

2673
02:03:12,451 --> 02:03:12,830
The other director.

2674
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:14,060
Yeah,
he's causing.

2675
02:03:14,061 --> 02:03:19,061
I mean he's a,
he's ruffling a lot of feathers in the 

2676
02:03:19,061 --> 02:03:21,731
conservative,
you know there are a lot of people 

2677
02:03:21,731 --> 02:03:23,051
behind the pope who are conservative 
cardinals who are not happy campers at 

2678
02:03:23,051 --> 02:03:24,260
all.
He represents a much more frankly,

2679
02:03:24,261 --> 02:03:27,290
Latin American strain of religion,
which is a much,

2680
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:30,260
much less crazy,
much more loving,

2681
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:33,470
kind of communal interpretation of 
Catholicism.

2682
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:36,140
So there's 18 different states.
You said 35.

2683
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,780
I think I'm right.
Can we google it?

2684
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:41,110
I think that.
I think that um,

2685
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:47,060
that's fucking incredible.
That's incredible that there's still 

2686
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:51,350
laws.
It might actually be the other way 

2687
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:51,350
round.
It might be 32.

2688
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:51,360
You can't get ready and I don't know.
We'll find out soon enough,

2689
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:56,390
but the fact that there's that many 
states where it's 32 states have legal 

2690
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:57,720
same sex marriage.
That's fucking crazy.

2691
02:03:57,860 --> 02:04:01,610
I mean frankly I'm given like,
it's like you were saying about the,

2692
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,670
the moral evolution of racism though,
like from when you were growing up,

2693
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:10,200
born in 1967,
that that half century there has just 

2694
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,870
been a massive,
massive period of advance.

2695
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:15,020
And it is true.
I mean you've got to give people time.

2696
02:04:15,021 --> 02:04:20,021
I do.
I am impressed that 32 states now you 

2697
02:04:20,021 --> 02:04:23,291
can get married,
same sex couples can get married and 

2698
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:24,941
because just 10 years ago,
let alone 20 years ago it was kind of 

2699
02:04:24,941 --> 02:04:24,941
inconceivable.

2700
02:04:24,941 --> 02:04:29,430
Well,
this is why I'm not impressed because 

2701
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:29,430
there's no logical reason other than

2702
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:30,430
religion,
but there never is.

2703
02:04:30,431 --> 02:04:32,580
It's never logical.
There's not a logical reason for racism.

2704
02:04:32,581 --> 02:04:34,080
There's not a logical reason for 
homophobia.

2705
02:04:34,081 --> 02:04:36,420
There's no logical reason to cancel a 
call back.

2706
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:37,110
I mean people

2707
02:04:37,390 --> 02:04:42,390
in a completely free society.
There should be no reason to restrict 

2708
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:45,541
people because you don't like it.
There should be no reason why anyone 

2709
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:49,441
should be able to say you can't get 
married to a man because I don't like 

2710
02:04:49,441 --> 02:04:49,441
it.

2711
02:04:49,441 --> 02:04:52,250
I hope that that sentiment is becoming,
and I think it is becoming more and more

2712
02:04:52,251 --> 02:04:55,940
prevalent across the board,
100 percent that the libertarian wing of

2713
02:04:55,941 --> 02:04:59,540
the Republican Party and the progressive
wing of the Democratic Party,

2714
02:04:59,810 --> 02:05:02,930
a kind of whole showing together.
They're kind of opposite extremes,

2715
02:05:02,931 --> 02:05:04,580
but they're actually quite close on this
stuff.

2716
02:05:04,610 --> 02:05:09,610
Also on NSA stuff and civil liberties.
Like I really wish we could galvanize a 

2717
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:14,830
community of likeminded people who have 
basically broadly socially libertarian 

2718
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:20,590
and kind of culturally sophisticated 
people to enact policies like this.

2719
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:23,780
And I think that.
I think that that group,

2720
02:05:23,781 --> 02:05:24,770
that core is growing.

2721
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:29,950
The trend is definitely moving in that 
direction and I think the only thing 

2722
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:32,411
that would stop it as some sort of 
cataclysmic disaster sends us back to 

2723
02:05:32,411 --> 02:05:35,030
this really difficult struggle and 
removes our access to information.

2724
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:38,140
Well actually I think what he always 
does,

2725
02:05:38,141 --> 02:05:40,870
it is like an attack.
If we get hit again in,

2726
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:41,560
you know,
in a,

2727
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:45,220
on a scale of nine slash 11 or heaven 
forbid worse,

2728
02:05:45,221 --> 02:05:50,221
which probably would be,
if it were another example of mega 

2729
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:50,221
terrorism,
um,

2730
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:53,380
then you will get people clinging to 
their religion more and gun,

2731
02:05:53,381 --> 02:05:55,840
going back and being less tolerant and 
being much,

2732
02:05:55,870 --> 02:06:00,870
much more okay with their civil 
liberties being infringed that we more 

2733
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:02,410
antagonistic.
That's the really corrosive effective.

2734
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,750
But don't you think things come in 
waves.

2735
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:09,780
I mean there are,
there are like a heightened 

2736
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:11,380
civilizations that fall apart and then 
they come back and go and forth and it's

2737
02:06:11,390 --> 02:06:16,390
like if you look at history,
we like to think of history as being 

2738
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:18,780
some straight linear path to 2014 with 
progress from day one to day.

2739
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,840
You know,
but it's not.

2740
02:06:19,841 --> 02:06:24,841
I mean,
there's ages of enlightenment and 

2741
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:25,660
there's is decreases and there's 
cataclysmic disasters,

2742
02:06:25,661 --> 02:06:29,200
natural disasters,
horrific things that happened that throw

2743
02:06:29,201 --> 02:06:30,190
people back.
I mean,

2744
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:35,350
there's people that argue that Iraq and 
especially Baghdad,

2745
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:38,650
I've never recovered from the Mongol 
invasion of the 12 hundreds.

2746
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:43,810
They killed everyone in the city,
turned the river red with blood and 

2747
02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:44,290
black with ink,
literally slaughtered all the scholars,

2748
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:45,920
threw away all the.
I mean,

2749
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:51,190
the one thing that people in this day 
and age don't realize is that Islam used

2750
02:06:51,791 --> 02:06:54,720
to be the center of Science of 
philosophy.

2751
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:57,720
I mean,
that was the original advanced course.

2752
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:58,120
Sure.
Yeah.

2753
02:06:58,630 --> 02:06:59,560
Yeah.
They were onto,

2754
02:06:59,561 --> 02:07:01,600
onto the enlightenment along time before
we were.

2755
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:06,630
That's the.
That's the odd thing about the way that 

2756
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:06,630
the tables have turned.
I mean,

2757
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:06,630
look at the.
Yeah,

2758
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:10,590
the library of Alexandria,
Alexandria burned down and we lost 

2759
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:13,480
massive resources of human civilization.
Yet as we say in Australia,

2760
02:07:13,481 --> 02:07:15,400
it's swings and roundabouts,
meaning,

2761
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:16,750
you know,
it comes and goes.

2762
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:21,850
Well,
I think we're looking at things on an 

2763
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:24,010
unbelievably large scale and we're 
looking at these little blips and these 

2764
02:07:24,010 --> 02:07:27,200
blips are very important to us because 
our lives are so short in perspective.

2765
02:07:27,530 --> 02:07:28,400
You know,
if you.

2766
02:07:28,401 --> 02:07:33,401
If you look at the concept of a human 
life being only 100 years at the very 

2767
02:07:33,401 --> 02:07:36,340
best and look at a 100 years in to the 
10,000

2768
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:38,770
years of human history.
It's a fucking blink of an eye

2769
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:43,850
and the 10,000
years of human history is a blink is a 

2770
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:45,360
blip in comparison to the age of the,
of the earth and the age of the earth is

2771
02:07:45,361 --> 02:07:47,580
a blip.
And on the age of the universe and

2772
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,760
talk to folks like.
There's a guy named Randall Carlson who 

2773
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:55,341
have had on the podcast who's an expert 
in Astro asteroidal impacts and he 

2774
02:07:55,341 --> 02:07:57,270
believes that the whole reason for this 
10,000

2775
02:07:57,271 --> 02:08:00,840
year like our idea of human civilization
being 10,000

2776
02:08:00,841 --> 02:08:05,841
years.
He thinks that goes back way further 

2777
02:08:05,841 --> 02:08:07,881
than that.
And he points to all these meteor 

2778
02:08:07,881 --> 02:08:07,881
impacts.
And especially in Asia and in Europe.

2779
02:08:07,881 --> 02:08:12,801
In a $12,000.
When they go to these core samples of 

2780
02:08:12,801 --> 02:08:12,801
the earth,
you go back to about 12,000

2781
02:08:12,801 --> 02:08:17,781
years ago,
there's all this evidence of what's 

2782
02:08:17,781 --> 02:08:18,060
called nuclear glass try thing.
It's called Triton night.

2783
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:21,570
That means that the earth was pelted by 
meteors,

2784
02:08:22,290 --> 02:08:25,260
human civilizations prior to that.
Most certainly he's.

2785
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:27,210
He's absolutely there any fossil 
evidence.

2786
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:32,270
There's evidence in far as far as 
construction that we're starting to 

2787
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:32,270
uncover now let go.
Beckley,

2788
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:37,340
Beckley,
Tapi is this massive stone structure 

2789
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:39,561
that existed back when they thought that
people were just hunters and gatherers 

2790
02:08:39,561 --> 02:08:42,500
and it's a recently on earth and to this
day they've only gotten about five 

2791
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:44,220
percent of it on earth,
but it's these massive stone columns,

2792
02:08:44,221 --> 02:08:46,880
19 feet high that are between 12 and 
14,000

2793
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:49,110
years old at a time where they didn't 
think anyone was

2794
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:54,090
building as scientifically minded guy on
on issues where I don't really know what

2795
02:08:54,091 --> 02:08:59,091
I'm talking about.
I usually just get gail to the majority 

2796
02:08:59,091 --> 02:09:01,241
of expert opinion and that's so far 
outside of what we most archeologists 

2797
02:09:01,241 --> 02:09:01,770
claim more.
Just go with them.

2798
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,780
No,
it's not anymore,

2799
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:02,970
right?

2800
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:04,300
Yeah.
Go back to the tap,

2801
02:09:04,301 --> 02:09:05,730
but you need to look at this because 
this is,

2802
02:09:05,850 --> 02:09:08,530
well 100 percent established science 
would.

2803
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:10,530
The reason why it's established is go 
beckley.

2804
02:09:10,531 --> 02:09:14,670
Tappy was somehow or another covered up 
on purpose,

2805
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:19,700
so they were most likely conquered by 
someone else and these structures were 

2806
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:21,360
covered.
So when they do these,

2807
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,940
uh,
these carbon samples of the soil,

2808
02:09:24,030 --> 02:09:28,290
it's uniform from the top to the bottom,
which means that somewhere around 12,000

2809
02:09:28,291 --> 02:09:33,291
years ago these things were covered up.
That means it could be far older than 

2810
02:09:33,291 --> 02:09:37,941
that because you're dealing with stone 
structures and meaning it could be 

2811
02:09:37,941 --> 02:09:37,941
13,000.
Who knows how old it could be,

2812
02:09:37,941 --> 02:09:38,010
but

2813
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:40,140
these are huge structures that were 
created.

2814
02:09:40,141 --> 02:09:41,370
Jamie,
pull it up if you get a chance.

2815
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:46,580
Also,
it depends on how you define 

2816
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:46,580
civilization,
right?

2817
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:46,580
I mean,
this is really advanced stuff.

2818
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:49,770
Look,
I don't mean to be old pc about this,

2819
02:09:49,771 --> 02:09:54,771
but the Australian aborigines,
they are 80 to 120,000

2820
02:09:54,811 --> 02:09:58,320
years old.
The oldest surviving civilization now,

2821
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,070
they don't build big,
you know,

2822
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:02,880
big structures.
But to survive for 100,000

2823
02:10:02,881 --> 02:10:07,710
years in a stable form,
to have language,

2824
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:10,140
to have a certain culture to,
you know,

2825
02:10:10,141 --> 02:10:15,141
to know how to,
how to use the land and to know how to 

2826
02:10:15,141 --> 02:10:15,930
hunt and to build tools and all that 
sort of stuff.

2827
02:10:16,290 --> 02:10:21,290
Like that's a,
that's a long time that makes our sort 

2828
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:21,290
of 5,000
years of,

2829
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:25,820
you know,
modern civilization look like just 

2830
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:27,420
nothing.
I think like sue was about 6,000

2831
02:10:27,421 --> 02:10:32,421
years ago.
That was what we considered to be the 

2832
02:10:32,421 --> 02:10:32,421
first written language and cuny 
cuneiform.

2833
02:10:32,421 --> 02:10:33,380
Yeah.
I'm sort of just counting it from the of

2834
02:10:33,381 --> 02:10:38,381
Judaism,
I suppose in the Iliad and the Odyssey 

2835
02:10:38,381 --> 02:10:38,381
and the Talmud.

2836
02:10:38,381 --> 02:10:38,381
This,
um,

2837
02:10:38,381 --> 02:10:42,360
go back.
The tappy discovery is just one of many 

2838
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:45,121
that they're slowly starting to uncover.
Because when you look at these 

2839
02:10:45,121 --> 02:10:45,890
structures,
a lot of them are there,

2840
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:48,040
they're covered up with dirt.
The Amazon,

2841
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:50,650
they're constantly finding these ancient
civilizations.

2842
02:10:50,651 --> 02:10:55,651
They have no explanation for the Amazon 
ancient structures that have actually 

2843
02:10:55,651 --> 02:10:56,220
become like hills and they find these 
hills and they go,

2844
02:10:56,240 --> 02:11:00,490
I think this might've been a building.
And then they start hacking through it.

2845
02:11:00,491 --> 02:11:03,150
And then they bring in a radar and they 
just,

2846
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:08,200
they,
they pound the earth with radar to try 

2847
02:11:08,200 --> 02:11:08,290
to understand what's underneath it and 
they find these builders

2848
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:13,310
things that amazing how quickly we can 
forget our history such that we don't 

2849
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:17,351
even know that.
Like I would have thought that there'd 

2850
02:11:17,351 --> 02:11:18,140
be a continuity of human experience and 
human record keeping in some way that we

2851
02:11:18,141 --> 02:11:23,141
would.
We would know that we wouldn't have to 

2852
02:11:23,141 --> 02:11:23,141
be making this stuff up.

2853
02:11:23,141 --> 02:11:26,210
Well,
that's what Randall Carlson comes in 

2854
02:11:26,210 --> 02:11:27,741
because Randall Carlson,
who's an expert in these asteroidal 

2855
02:11:27,741 --> 02:11:29,100
impacts,
says that human beings have had to reset

2856
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:34,430
that.
There's been several resets over the 

2857
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:34,430
course of many,
many millions of years,

2858
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:36,690
or in many hundreds of thousands of 
years of life.

2859
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:42,060
There's also a super volcano in 
Indonesia that they've attributed to be 

2860
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:46,220
one of the main reasons why all human 
beings come from one individual genetic 

2861
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:48,180
source.
They think that 75,000

2862
02:11:48,181 --> 02:11:49,440
years ago,
the Super Volcano,

2863
02:11:49,441 --> 02:11:54,441
that glue,
it's much larger than yellowstone and 

2864
02:11:54,441 --> 02:11:54,780
yellowstone blows.
We are all fucked.

2865
02:11:55,110 --> 02:12:00,110
Like it's going to kill almost everyone 
in this continent eventually and 

2866
02:12:00,110 --> 02:12:04,850
globally.
It's going to have a massive effect to 

2867
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:04,850
nuclear winter,
a massive climate change,

2868
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:05,280
and every six to 800,000
years,

2869
02:12:05,490 --> 02:12:08,370
this fucking goes off.
It's a called volcano.

2870
02:12:08,371 --> 02:12:11,940
That's,
I believe it's 600 kilometers wide,

2871
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,720
which is 300 miles and they only 
discovered this,

2872
02:12:15,721 --> 02:12:20,721
that this used to be a volcano in the 
beginning of the 20th century when they 

2873
02:12:20,721 --> 02:12:24,321
started using satellite imagery when 
they started looking at yellow stone 

2874
02:12:24,321 --> 02:12:24,500
from space and they were like,
um,

2875
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:29,550
it's kind of fucking cap that blew off 
and left a crater.

2876
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:30,400
Like,

2877
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:32,220
it's like we're just going about our 
lives,

2878
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:34,170
you know,
the best laid plans of mice and men.

2879
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:36,510
I mean,
it'll all go to hell at some point.

2880
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:39,310
Some point,
and this is at yellowstone,

2881
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:44,330
that's the Caldera fucking terrifying.
And they figured that out from space 

2882
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:48,240
where they looked at it and so that used
to be a mountain and that mountain 

2883
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:50,910
exploded and left behind this sort of 
crater looking.

2884
02:12:51,070 --> 02:12:55,150
It's amazing in terms of the continuity 
of civilizations and how we.

2885
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:57,300
And that,
that reset that.

2886
02:12:57,310 --> 02:13:02,310
I was reading a fascinating pace about.
There was a a commission to figure out 

2887
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:07,260
how to.
We were talking about radioactive waste 

2888
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:07,260
earlier on how long this lasts,
right?

2889
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:08,950
The radioactive waste from nuclear 
stockpiles.

2890
02:13:09,910 --> 02:13:14,320
How do you build signs for future 
civilization?

2891
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:17,810
To tell them not to touch the weights 
don't go.

2892
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:20,110
There is an act.
There is a fascinating.

2893
02:13:20,111 --> 02:13:25,111
I think it's in slate.
A fascinating article about the 

2894
02:13:25,111 --> 02:13:28,500
commission which was which had the 
commission which has been commissioned 

2895
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:31,860
to figure out.
Let's assume that there's a 

2896
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:34,470
civilizational reset,
which there probably will be right at 

2897
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:34,470
some point while this stuff is still 
bad,

2898
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:36,000
so these people aren't going to know our
language.

2899
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:39,420
They're not gonna understand that a 
skull and crossbones means this is bad.

2900
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:40,260
They're not going to.

2901
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:45,320
They may not even understand the concept
that we may lose the technology to 

2902
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:48,470
nuclear and understand what nuclear is.
They May.

2903
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:51,120
That happens.
Surprisingly often.

2904
02:13:51,121 --> 02:13:53,280
That happens.
We know it's already already.

2905
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:56,070
I'm losing where my photos are from hard
drives that are just three.

2906
02:13:56,071 --> 02:13:57,030
How drives it go,
right?

2907
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:02,270
You know,
multiply that by a million and suddenly 

2908
02:14:02,270 --> 02:14:05,300
they're designing like these,
these huge landscapes of like 

2909
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:07,200
interlocking sticks that are like,
you know,

2910
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:10,470
hundreds of feet high to try to imply 
that this is a bad,

2911
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:12,900
this is a bad thing and that you 
shouldn't dig it up.

2912
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:15,210
But I mean at the end of the day what 
the conclusion was,

2913
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:20,420
you probably just shouldn't put anything
there because people were always going 

2914
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:20,420
to be curious and you never going to 
convince them like,

2915
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,110
you know,
we go into the,

2916
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:24,630
we go into the tombs of the Pharaoh in,
you know,

2917
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:27,360
in Egypt because we just think that 
their beliefs about,

2918
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:28,050
about,
uh,

2919
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:29,100
you know,
the,

2920
02:14:29,101 --> 02:14:30,690
the bad that will come to us from going 
in.

2921
02:14:30,691 --> 02:14:35,691
There are silly fantasies.
What a future civilizations think that 

2922
02:14:35,691 --> 02:14:39,240
we're full of silly fantasies when we 
tell them not to go into nuclear waste.

2923
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:41,780
That's absolutely possible.
And I think we would need something like

2924
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:46,800
Georgia guidestones or like some giant 
Rosetta stone in several different 

2925
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:50,841
languages to sort of let them decode it.
And if we do have a civilizational 

2926
02:14:50,841 --> 02:14:53,550
reset,
like a barbaric type civilization is all

2927
02:14:53,551 --> 02:14:56,160
that's left and we literally like 
walking dead,

2928
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:58,800
running around,
scavenging for food and everyone forgets

2929
02:14:58,801 --> 02:15:00,810
how to count.
I mean fuck man,

2930
02:15:00,811 --> 02:15:05,811
people are.
A lot of people are going to die of 

2931
02:15:05,811 --> 02:15:07,041
cancer and if it's the only people that 
are left on earth are people that live 

2932
02:15:07,041 --> 02:15:07,041
in Nevada,
they might all die.

2933
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:11,610
I mean that's very possible.
If you're talking about 75,000

2934
02:15:11,611 --> 02:15:14,730
people,
which is low or 75,000

2935
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:19,731
years ago,
which they think a few thousand people 

2936
02:15:19,731 --> 02:15:19,731
were leftover.
That's right.

2937
02:15:19,731 --> 02:15:20,070
Isn't that amazing?
That's it.

2938
02:15:20,150 --> 02:15:21,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

2939
02:15:21,181 --> 02:15:21,930
This Indonesia.

2940
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:27,420
Okay.
And when we are all much more closely 

2941
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:27,970
related than you would ever assume from 
that bottle necking period,

2942
02:15:27,971 --> 02:15:32,971
where,
where humanity dwindled down to just a 

2943
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:32,971
few a few pipes.

2944
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:34,150
So where their thinking is 75,000
years ago,

2945
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:37,450
giant sums of people were wiped out.
And then 10 to 12,000

2946
02:15:37,451 --> 02:15:40,060
years ago again,
giant amounts of people were wiped out.

2947
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:42,310
And that's where civilization had it's 
reset.

2948
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:47,550
That's also the end of the ice age.
That's also the almost instantaneous 

2949
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:48,040
death of woolly mammoths,
Saber Tooth Tigers,

2950
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:53,220
and it's this moment,
this event that they're showing in 

2951
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,160
geological evidence.
It's indisputable.

2952
02:15:54,190 --> 02:15:58,240
There was absolutely some sort of huge 
meteorological event,

2953
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:03,360
some sort or media event asteroidal 
event where we were pelted were pelted 

2954
02:16:03,521 --> 02:16:07,870
with and it's not like it's unusual.
It's like something like 900,000

2955
02:16:07,871 --> 02:16:09,850
near Earth objects had been mapped out.

2956
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:10,860
Yeah,
we,

2957
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,260
this is actually a really easy thing to 
solve,

2958
02:16:13,261 --> 02:16:16,320
but we don't put the money into solving 
it yet.

2959
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:21,750
If you identify it far enough out,
it's a simple calculation to be able to 

2960
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:22,170
do the math and go,
oh well that one's going to hit us.

2961
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:27,380
And then you just got to send up a bunch
of nukes to nudge it off course if you 

2962
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:30,651
catch it early.
But if you don't catch it until it's 

2963
02:16:30,651 --> 02:16:30,651
almost here rude,

2964
02:16:30,651 --> 02:16:30,651
they don't think they think that 
anymore.

2965
02:16:30,651 --> 02:16:35,251
I don't think they think nukes.
I think the idea's to nudge it out of 

2966
02:16:35,251 --> 02:16:35,800
the way,
but with changing the,

2967
02:16:35,801 --> 02:16:37,430
um,
the um,

2968
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:38,140
what,
what is it called?

2969
02:16:38,141 --> 02:16:39,610
The aerodynamics of the,
uh,

2970
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:41,470
of the,
the asteroids idea.

2971
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:45,600
It's interesting putting a web on it 
somehow or another will affect how a.

2972
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:48,070
I mean,
I'm sure there are a bunch of things,

2973
02:16:48,071 --> 02:16:53,071
but it's difficult engineering thing to 
come up with a figure to figure out a 

2974
02:16:53,071 --> 02:16:56,851
way to nudge an asteroid.
I don't know if that's true and I also 

2975
02:16:56,851 --> 02:16:58,480
think there's also an issue with space 
because of the gravity of the sun.

2976
02:16:58,481 --> 02:17:03,481
There's a lot of things that come from 
behind the sun that we don't even see 

2977
02:17:03,481 --> 02:17:04,180
coming because the gravity of the sun 
altar space,

2978
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:07,870
it alters the way we view things,
but kind you factor that in.

2979
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:12,960
I mean we spent around the sun so we get
to see all four corners of the of the 

2980
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:16,351
universe as we go around,
but to this day constantly there's 

2981
02:17:16,351 --> 02:17:18,090
things that come very close to us that 
we don't see coming because we.

2982
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:20,680
Because Republicans cut funding to NASA 
and stuff like that.

2983
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:25,740
Well,
I would like to think that that's the 

2984
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:27,181
case,
but I think it might be slightly beyond 

2985
02:17:27,181 --> 02:17:28,380
our grasp right now.
To see all of them coming.

2986
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:31,840
Things that are coming from the North 
Pole and the South Pole.

2987
02:17:31,841 --> 02:17:34,660
They're coming from places where we're 
not really observing the sky,

2988
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:40,110
very vigilantly and you know,
a lot of what we find is actually 

2989
02:17:40,110 --> 02:17:43,051
discovered by amateur astronomers.
They find asteroids and they named them 

2990
02:17:43,051 --> 02:17:46,000
and measure them and then they send in 
their data and how many of those fuckers

2991
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:46,780
are out there.
I mean,

2992
02:17:46,781 --> 02:17:49,810
I don't know how many people are out 
there actively searching for asteroids.

2993
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:52,340
I don't think it's very many and I think
it's shocking.

2994
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:54,820
But you're talking about the policy 
concern,

2995
02:17:54,821 --> 02:17:59,821
which I agree with.
I'm talking about there are two 

2996
02:17:59,821 --> 02:17:59,821
concerns,
right?

2997
02:17:59,821 --> 02:17:59,821
One is,
would it be,

2998
02:17:59,821 --> 02:18:01,840
do we have the scientific and 
engineering know how to be able to nudge

2999
02:18:01,841 --> 02:18:06,841
a,
an asteroid out of the way if we catch 

3000
02:18:06,841 --> 02:18:06,841
it early enough.
And then the other question is,

3001
02:18:06,841 --> 02:18:08,720
are we bothering to look?
And it's the question that I'm,

3002
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,540
that I'm more concerned about.
I think we're getting close,

3003
02:18:10,541 --> 02:18:15,541
but I also think there's the issue of 
collisions when asteroids collide with 

3004
02:18:15,541 --> 02:18:19,561
each other and then send one hurling 
towards us that we didn't expect that 

3005
02:18:19,561 --> 02:18:20,340
can happen too.
We're fucked.

3006
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:22,330
Fuck.
We're all fucked.

3007
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:22,990
So,
uh,

3008
02:18:22,991 --> 02:18:24,310
we did another hour.
That's good.

3009
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:27,010
So I'm gonna go take a chill pill,
take a chill pill.

3010
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:30,370
Tell everybody one more time.
How do we get to your show Josh steps on

3011
02:18:30,371 --> 02:18:30,700
twitter.

3012
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:35,820
You can either go to buy.
Well actually my website stand on the 

3013
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:35,820
web,
so don't worry about that.

3014
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:36,910
It's just steps on twitter.
J O s h Z,

3015
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:41,990
z e PPS.
I always want to say it's dead because 

3016
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:41,990
that's what you're saying.
Um,

3017
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:42,940
but uh,
but shoot an email.

3018
02:18:42,970 --> 02:18:46,360
Just open your email address.
Please don't know.

3019
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:47,800
I want them to because they that can 
subscribe.

3020
02:18:47,801 --> 02:18:52,801
It's just info.
It's not my personal address info at we 

3021
02:18:52,801 --> 02:18:56,881
the people pod because we,
the people are going to be the night of 

3022
02:18:56,881 --> 02:18:56,881
the live show info.
That way the people pod.com.

3023
02:18:56,881 --> 02:18:59,830
And tell us what part of this 
conversation you liked the most and then

3024
02:18:59,831 --> 02:19:01,560
you'll get free stuff.
When I launched.

3025
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:05,200
I'm going to read that much on employee,
so I'll find something.

3026
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:07,180
Josh steps.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3027
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:08,770
Thank you sir.
This a beautiful conversation.

3028
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:10,720
I really enjoyed it.
I'd love to.

3029
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:11,770
When are you gonna?
Be In la again.

3030
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:13,360
I don't know.
Whenever you invite me back,

3031
02:19:13,361 --> 02:19:14,200
we'll work it out.
Great.

3032
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:15,040
Thank you.
