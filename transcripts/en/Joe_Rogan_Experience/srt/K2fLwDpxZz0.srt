Try My day,

3
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,490
Joe Rogan podcast by nine all day.

That's it.

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,310
It's up.

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,621
All right.

7
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:12,760
This is the first ever HD
version of this podcast.

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,691
Burned stand.

9
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:14,650
You are the guest.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,370
Wow.

11
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:15,641
Damn it.

12
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:20,641
You're the perfect guy for this first
ever first ever use stream HD version of

13
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,110
the podcast and a,

14
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,340
as it's gotten here,

15
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,760
I just got a a an email while I'm on.

16
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,640
Victor contains a email list and you know,

17
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:31,301
Victor Conte,

18
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,260
Depaul Co guy,

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,720
the guy who was suspended for getting
all those guys on some undetectable

20
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:42,130
steroids and now he's some sort of a
crusader against a performance enhancing

21
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:42,551
drugs.

22
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,080
And he just sent me this thing.

23
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,161
John Jones,

24
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:49,220
testosterone levels are suspect
and it's saying that he's probably,

25
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,730
he was probably on steroids coming off.

26
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,120
The biggest winner was UFC career.

27
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,080
A few would have expected Jon Jones
to have the worst week of his life.

28
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:56,291
Blah,

29
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:56,861
blah blah.

30
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:00,700
And drug test cocaine is the big one
that everybody's been talking about.

31
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,613
Uh,

32
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,640
but the thing about the
epic testosterone levels,

33
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,110
that's what they're saying.

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,420
The mean it.

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,470
Conte has a,

36
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,721
you know,

37
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:14,590
a bunch of numbers and ratios and
what's normal and what's not normal.

38
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:15,670
But apparently this is a,

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,190
this is an issue now to the
people are talking about.

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,531
Yeah.

41
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,640
You know it's interesting Kevin,

42
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:24,590
I oli was tweeting some stuff about that
yesterday and you know when you take a

43
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:25,051
look at,

44
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,970
at some of the things that are taking
place as well is there are some major

45
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,320
flaws in the collection.

46
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:34,130
Whoever was the sample collector and I
don't think the commission just wants to

47
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:37,670
out them whoever did that because
the first test was supposed to be for

48
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:40,730
performance enhancements and then
it was actually recreational.

49
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,620
It was never supposed to happen like that.

50
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:46,610
So then when they tested him two weeks
later after failing a recreational,

51
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,650
then they test them for
performance enhancing.

52
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,880
And I guess that's probably where
they got his testosterone ratio.

53
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,330
So you know when,

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
when they get back his
post fight drug test that,

55
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,831
I mean this,

56
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,060
this will be real interesting,

57
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:02,810
but when I talked to friends
of mine that I had at Usada,

58
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,760
I texted with them today and,

59
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,100
and you saw a is as good as it gets.

60
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,760
I mean these guys don't miss that
stands for the U S Anti Doping Agency.

61
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,001
Yeah.

62
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:11,751
The federally,

63
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,480
the Federal Government backed
organization that does the Olympics and,

64
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,430
and they told me strip,

65
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,731
they said,

66
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,001
look,

67
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:17,391
yeah there's,

68
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,220
there's definitely some indicators there,

69
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,091
but they're,

70
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:20,351
they,

71
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,450
they believe at right now it looks like
there's some flaws in the collection.

72
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:27,520
So who knows how this thing could
possibly hold up an arbitration and if,

73
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:31,220
if that collection process had
anything to do with the flood levels,

74
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,620
there's a lot of details
yet to be uncovered.

75
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,450
So when the collection levels what
it's supposed to be supposed to be,

76
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,201
one guy,

77
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,610
there's a chain of custody,

78
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:41,230
he administered the test,

79
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:45,400
takes the blood and like handcuffs
it to his fucking cha wrist,

80
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:45,701
right?

81
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:45,901
Like,

82
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,540
like one of those nuclear
bombs and like the,

83
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,780
the nuclear football thing.

84
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,030
And they take it and
it's supposed to be like,

85
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,290
this guy has it.

86
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,030
He signs off on and he sleeps with it.

87
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:59,050
He doesn't go anywhere with it until
it gets to that lab and then from there

88
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,840
it's they have a direct chain of custody.

89
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,800
Exactly right.

90
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,080
And the big key there,

91
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,320
there,

92
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,010
there's a few areas
where it can be flawed.

93
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:06,251
One,

94
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:06,940
the collector,

95
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,160
if the collectors not fully trained in,

96
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:09,431
in,

97
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,060
in,

98
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,893
you know where,

99
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,420
then the second part is
what lab do they send it to?

100
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:13,601
You know,

101
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:18,550
I did confirm today Nevada had that urine
sample sent to the wattle laboratory

102
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,420
in Salt Lake City,

103
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:19,960
which is a,

104
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,890
is is one of the best and one
of the two best in the country.

105
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:23,001
You know,

106
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,850
you get salt lake and then you have UCLA.

107
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,000
Those are the labs that can
detect all the high level stuff.

108
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,631
However,

109
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:33,160
it was still a urine sample and urine is
a lot less accurate than a blood test.

110
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:33,350
When you,

111
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,190
when you're talking about
looking at testosterone levels,

112
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:36,800
et cetera.

113
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,011
Yeah.

114
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:39,560
And water is the world anti-doping agent.

115
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,480
Exactly like that.

116
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,210
They're the ones who make the
regulations at the Nevada state athletic

117
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,220
commission and everybody
else follows when they say,

118
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:45,790
Hey,

119
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,050
what's your protocol?

120
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,900
Or what standards do you follow for
performance testing drugs or are banned

121
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:50,734
substances?

122
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:50,921
Well,

123
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,870
we followed the Wada Code and so you saw
it a uses that same laboratory as well.

124
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,003
Um,

125
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,491
you know,

126
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:57,721
but,

127
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,440
but the difference
there is the collectors,

128
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:00,530
the organization and,

129
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:00,691
and,

130
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,524
and they're,

131
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:01,931
you know,

132
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,470
they're,

133
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,740
they're the premier
organization in the world,

134
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,850
probably a,

135
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,260
and they do it worldwide.

136
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,230
For folks who don't know
what we're talking about,

137
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,281
Jon Jones,

138
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,020
who's The UFC light heavyweight champion,

139
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,730
number one pound for pound fighter,

140
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,410
pretty much consensus in the world.

141
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
One is biggest fight of his
career against Daniel Cormier,

142
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,890
but then tested positive
for cocaine metabolites,

143
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,480
which means that,

144
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:24,700
uh,

145
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,960
the,

146
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,090
the test is administered on December 4th,

147
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,300
which means some tea sometime between
two and four days before that he had done

148
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,014
cocaine.

149
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,680
Yeah,

150
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,300
it's,

151
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,750
do you hear that Wine Jamie?

152
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,110
It's the fan as it come
through the microphone.

153
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,190
I can't tell.

154
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,830
Okay.

155
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,011
Oh,

156
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,844
that's not good.

157
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,020
The fan for that.

158
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,040
Yeah.

159
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
Is it coming through your microphone then?

160
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,770
Shut your microphone off.

161
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,510
Yeah,

162
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,080
that's it.

163
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,913
Yeah.

164
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
You're going to have to turn
your microphone on and off.

165
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:55,931
What?

166
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,030
We're going to have to
put that thing somewhere.

167
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,420
No.

168
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,780
Yeah.

169
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,560
Well either way.

170
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,393
We're cool.

171
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:00,910
Um,

172
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,680
so for folks that don't follow the UFC,

173
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,820
this was a huge fight.

174
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,720
Probably one of the biggest
fights ever as far as skill level.

175
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,550
I think probably one of
the biggest fights ever.

176
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,000
Cause you got the number one pound for
pound fighter in the world and a guy who

177
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,800
many people thought could beat him.

178
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,490
Yup.

179
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:18,941
And,

180
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,270
uh,

181
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,610
John Wound up winning
the fight and winning,

182
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,320
um,

183
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
in pretty impressive fashion
because he beat him wrestling.

184
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,900
He took Daniel down first time
ever in Daniel Daniel Cormier,

185
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,950
he was an Olympic wrestler,

186
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,570
undefeated as a heavyweight.

187
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:35,050
Anissa light heavyweight was a
real threat and John beat them.

188
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,800
So now that the cocaine was one thing,

189
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:39,760
but then this,

190
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,760
the testosterone to
Epictetus testosterone ratio,

191
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,980
which seems to indicate that
something else going on,

192
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,570
that's a way bigger deal.

193
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,141
It is.

194
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,471
It is.

195
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:47,591
And,

196
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,011
and you know,

197
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,260
right now there's a ton of speculation.

198
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,010
Um,

199
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,281
if,

200
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:51,731
if the,

201
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,160
if the ratios were were bigger,

202
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,740
I think we'd hear a lot more
talk about it right now.

203
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,231
You know,

204
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,190
right now people say,

205
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,401
hey,

206
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,430
these could be indicators to
something masking steroids and,

207
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,180
and again,

208
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,230
this all just developed.

209
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,140
So I certainly don't think either one of
us had had a whole lot of time to dive

210
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,980
into the details.

211
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,380
So,

212
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,621
you know,

213
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:08,790
you,

214
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,440
you got to hope that this scenario
doesn't get any worse at this point.

215
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:12,711
You know,

216
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,580
you really don't.

217
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,180
I,

218
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,421
you know,

219
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,750
personally having trained at that
gym for a number of years now,

220
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:20,810
I haven't been down there in
years since even before I retired.

221
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,830
Um,

222
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,490
but there were never any rumors
about John doing stuff like that.

223
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,881
I mean,

224
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:28,040
from day one when he came into the gym,

225
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,020
he knew nothing and he still kicked
everybody's ass bad to the point where

226
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,190
people were just jealous,

227
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:34,820
uh,

228
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,840
to the point where people thought,

229
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,081
okay,

230
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:36,710
you know,

231
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,260
there's no way he wins this fight.

232
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,340
Now they finally match Migas
Guy who's going to beat him.

233
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,940
Then you watch him fight and he just
smokes guy mean we wondered how he was

234
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,240
going to do against Brandon Vera.

235
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,093
Do you remember that fight?

236
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,180
I mean he made it look like a
joke and he did it to everybody.

237
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,350
I mean all the way through,

238
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:51,861
you know,

239
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:54,530
on other than the Gustafson
fight and then obviously,

240
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:54,741
you know,

241
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,970
or even the Rashad Evans fight,

242
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,481
you know,

243
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,440
the Rashad Evans fight,

244
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:57,621
you know,

245
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:57,921
it was,

246
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,970
it was a dominant victory,

247
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,380
but it wasn't something where he just,

248
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,371
he ran through it.

249
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,810
So I personally never heard any
rumors in any inside the fight circle.

250
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,820
You generally hear a lot,

251
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,151
you know,

252
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:11,390
a lot of guys do a lot of talk
and when it comes to that stuff,

253
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,040
but uh,

254
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,150
you just never know,

255
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,690
you know?

256
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,370
Well that was one of the
reasons why you retired,

257
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:16,551
right?

258
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:16,761
You,

259
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,830
you were having a real issue with the,

260
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,410
the level of performance enhancing drugs.

261
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,620
Like the permeation of it.

262
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:22,780
Yeah,

263
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,081
yeah.

264
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:23,650
In the sport.

265
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,281
Absolutely.

266
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:24,461
You know,

267
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,350
you see it when you
train in these gyms and,

268
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:29,650
and so you'll see guys that you come in
and all of a sudden their physique looks

269
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:32,320
totally different and you
can feel the difference.

270
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,440
And so it's interesting because when you
mentioned that a bunch of people throw

271
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,151
out excuses,

272
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:37,511
et cetera,

273
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:37,751
et cetera.

274
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:37,871
Look,

275
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:41,350
I need to mention this until six months
after I retired and I was in a position

276
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:41,471
where,

277
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:41,651
hey,

278
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:41,891
you know what,

279
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:44,800
maybe I can influence the sport a little
bit here and try and steer in the right

280
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:45,191
direction.

281
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,810
But it's a major,

282
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,780
major advantage when someone
goes on that type of stuff.

283
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,190
And you know,

284
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:51,611
for me,

285
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:54,790
I had to fight at a different weight
class that I already thought was fishy

286
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,720
about that as well.

287
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:55,901
You know,

288
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:56,711
Vince Vandelay Silva,

289
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:56,831
hey,

290
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:58,730
you're going to fight it light heavy
instead a middleweight in the middle

291
00:07:58,731 --> 00:07:59,440
weight.

292
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,651
You know,

293
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:00,730
those things happen.

294
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,700
And I still signed to do the
fight even with my suspicions.

295
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,990
But if you're going to go at it clean and,

296
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:09,130
and you're going to lose the guys that
maybe you suspect we're doing something,

297
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,120
you know,

298
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,490
for me it came down to decision 0.1.

299
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,390
Am I willing to go back to a major camp
and train and leave my family behind for

300
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:17,224
weeks at a time?

301
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,183
No.

302
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,520
Am I willing to level the playing
field and take something like that,

303
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:22,810
compromise my integrity.

304
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,890
Um,

305
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,161
you know,

306
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:24,271
to,

307
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,600
to be better and get back
on an ascending climb my,

308
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,190
my career.

309
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:27,550
No.

310
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,360
Well then I'm out.

311
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,691
I'm out.

312
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,220
It wasn't worth the head
trauma at that point.

313
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,610
So the Vandelay Silva fight,

314
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,210
why was it light heavy weight
as he went on to find it?

315
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,213
He wanted it.

316
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,830
Well he's,

317
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,520
you know,

318
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,050
he's got issues of his own,

319
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:40,830
of course.

320
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,410
Vandelay Silva who was an all time great.

321
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,020
I mean an absolute pride,

322
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,770
a long time pride,

323
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,260
what they call a middleweight champion,

324
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,880
which was 203 pounds and pride,

325
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:54,960
which is light heavyweight in the
UFC and most likely juice to the,

326
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,101
I mean,

327
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:56,700
let's be,

328
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,720
let's be honest about it.

329
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,021
I mean,

330
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,780
everybody in pride was there.

331
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:02,460
There was a lot of people in
pride doing a lot of crazy shit.

332
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,360
Uh,

333
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,470
you know,

334
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,770
you talked to ensign anyway
in the ensign anyway,

335
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,431
said that they,

336
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:13,431
they literally had a clause
in the contract in pride
saying that they would not

337
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,810
test you for steroids.

338
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,730
Yeah.

339
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,091
And you know,

340
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:17,924
that's,

341
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,411
you know,

342
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:18,651
this,

343
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,750
this has been a subject that for me,

344
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:20,961
you know,

345
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,760
especially in the last year,

346
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,330
it's one of those subjects
where I get emotional and then,

347
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:26,541
you know,

348
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:26,700
my,

349
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,770
my initial instinct is to speak with
emotion and then regret what I say

350
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,090
afterwards when I calmed down.

351
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,500
And so I've really,

352
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,040
it showed an ugly side of me that
I'm not necessarily proud of.

353
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,160
And I've sat back and looked at more
perspective on the whole situation.

354
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:42,860
And not that I still don't condemn it,

355
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,290
but when you look at a guy's career,

356
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,360
I hate seeing guys like a Vandelay,

357
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,100
um,

358
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,670
like a Kung Lee go out with something
that happened towards the end of their

359
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:57,200
career that caused a black eye on it
and then have it ruin the entire body of

360
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,310
work that they perform.

361
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:03,260
Because right now the environment in
every professional sports pressures a lot

362
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:05,300
of guys to go towards that avenue.

363
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,670
I mean,

364
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,880
if,

365
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,390
if we're talking about what takes
place in mixed martial arts,

366
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,620
let's talk about the NFL.

367
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,540
If you lifted up that rock
and looked underneath it,

368
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,123
God bless you.

369
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,270
I mean needle you,

370
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:17,330
you have a couple of quarterbacks
and you'd have maybe a punter.

371
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,860
I even think those guys,

372
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,311
you know what I mean?

373
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:20,570
You had like a 47 year old guy,

374
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,580
I think kick a 53 yard or the other day.

375
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,803
Um,

376
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,501
you know,

377
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:24,631
I,

378
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,191
I mean,

379
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,980
so the environment is
there and I think if,

380
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:28,760
if,

381
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,270
if the sport in general goes towards
a comprehensive testing policy,

382
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,160
levels of playing field for everybody,

383
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,980
I think it makes a safer environment
longterm for the fighters.

384
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:37,611
And you know,

385
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:38,180
maybe,

386
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,470
maybe we'll get there in the next couple.

387
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:39,820
Yeah.

388
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,010
Well for fighters is a
gigantic issue of course,

389
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:46,060
because you're not talking about a
baseball where you can hit a ball better

390
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,470
basketball or anywhere,

391
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:47,810
you know,

392
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,750
you're running faster.

393
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,170
You're talking about a guy being able to
deliver more physical punishment to his

394
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,610
opponent and you know,

395
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,780
possibly score,

396
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,330
knock out that he wouldn't have been
able to score possibly lantus shot,

397
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:02,140
that he wouldn't have been able to
land had he not been essentially with

398
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,520
superhuman hormone levels.

399
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,630
And it's widely understood that,

400
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,640
especially in the early days of the UFC,

401
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:11,020
in the early days of pride,

402
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,790
there were a gigantic amount of guys who
are taking performance enhancing drugs.

403
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,900
I have a friend,

404
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,100
I will not name names.

405
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,760
Uh,

406
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,760
he fought for a Japanese organization
and they not only did they tell him to do

407
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:25,324
steroids,

408
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,300
they wanted him to fight
at a higher weight class.

409
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,460
They were going to help
him set everything up.

410
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,600
And you know,

411
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:35,140
they were even picking opponents
for him that he can beat.

412
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,121
And they were there.

413
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:36,341
You know,

414
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,670
they were setting the whole thing up.

415
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,390
But how like when you know about
that from the inside and you know,

416
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:43,150
like the organization telling
the guy to take steroids,

417
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,111
you know,

418
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:45,580
letting them know that it's okay,

419
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,990
we're not going to test you for that.

420
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,710
Uh,

421
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,380
that it had to be a major part of,

422
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,810
of MMA in the early.

423
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,810
Now those guys that came from those days,

424
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,140
now they have to adjust because
like you're looking at Vito,

425
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:02,680
like Vito who was on
testosterone replacement therapy,

426
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,161
you know,

427
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:08,161
had those incredible victories over Luke
Rockhold and Michael Bisping and you

428
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:08,651
know,

429
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,320
now those Dan Henderson
and now those fights,

430
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,090
not only they come into question like,

431
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:13,421
you've got to go,

432
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:13,930
man,

433
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,070
what does he have left?

434
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:19,150
Now that he's off that stuff and now he's
got to fight with natural testosterone

435
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,880
levels and he's going to fight
Chris Weidman for the title.

436
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,190
We know we're going to find out and
you're going to find out next month

437
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,180
the just passed his most recent,

438
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:26,361
I mean,

439
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,440
they've been tested them quite often.

440
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:30,350
The Egypt passes most recent
tests and absolutely right.

441
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,681
You know,

442
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:31,481
we're gonna find out and,

443
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:31,911
and you know,

444
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:33,440
the whole TRT ruling,

445
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:36,680
thank God it's gone because it
just clouded the issue I think.

446
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,090
And,

447
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,080
and gave at times a sport,

448
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:39,851
a black eye and,

449
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:40,611
and you know,

450
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:41,660
not only the sport,

451
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,310
but then it kind of screwed
over some fighters too.

452
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,470
If you're going to allow something
look than guys are going to do it,

453
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:45,621
you know,

454
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:46,760
they're going to find a way to do it.

455
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,840
Um,

456
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,581
but I think there's,

457
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:49,850
there's definitely been,

458
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,511
you know,

459
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:51,530
from what I've seen,

460
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,400
talking to camps,

461
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:53,151
talking to fires,

462
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm calling all these cards now.

463
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,870
There has definitely been a difference.

464
00:12:56,871 --> 00:13:01,871
The younger breed of fighters is very
anti performance handling drug a lot,

465
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,590
especially a lot of these wrestlers,

466
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:07,640
they're so used to being tested and this
is becoming like their NFL now coming

467
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:09,410
from amateur wrestling that,

468
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:10,460
that they're all for it.

469
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:13,850
And in a lot of that old breed
is really starting to go away.

470
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,380
And you know,

471
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:17,390
guys are starting to get
randomly tested out of the blue.

472
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,011
Yeah.

473
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:19,850
And that's important.

474
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:20,900
And randomly tested.

475
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,920
The UFC is doing these random tests where
they're doing the full Olympic blood

476
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:25,341
panel,

477
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:28,170
which is like $40,000
a fighter and you know,

478
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,780
they can only do so many of those.

479
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:31,490
And that's one of the
things that everybody knows.

480
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:32,324
So it's a bit of,

481
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,260
you know,

482
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,810
it's a bit of a game of musical chairs.

483
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:36,230
You know,

484
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,640
there's only a few chairs.

485
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,380
Everybody's moving around.

486
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:42,410
You're hoping that the music
doesn't stop and you're standing up.

487
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:42,850
Yep.

488
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,320
And I mean you're talking about over,

489
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,460
I think it's over 550 I think it
was five 85 we sit on UFC tonight,

490
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,210
fighters,

491
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,560
fighters on the roster.

492
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,080
And this is across the globe.

493
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,620
So if you want to start doing,

494
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,431
you know,

495
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,660
during their training camps,

496
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,960
random testing throughout the year
and all these different countries,

497
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,430
language barriers,

498
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,300
the labs,

499
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:01,581
all that.

500
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,010
I mean that is a monster.

501
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,710
And I'll tell you from private
meetings at Lorenzo Fertitta,

502
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,490
he is very determined to
find a way to make it work.

503
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,061
You know,

504
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:13,930
we've had some meetings and I think
it is in the hopper over time,

505
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,190
but right now it's just,

506
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,960
it's more piece mail where they can't
do it every single time here and there.

507
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:20,501
It's going to be,

508
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:20,711
hey,

509
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,950
on this card we're going to be able
to do three on this cargo to do for,

510
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,490
you know,

511
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,340
and they're going to contract out
and give the athletic commission the

512
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:27,731
Authority.

513
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,564
Here's the money.

514
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,360
You guys go partner with the
organization and take care of it.

515
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,321
Because you know,

516
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,460
as Dana said this week,

517
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,780
they don't want anything to do with that.

518
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,400
They've botched it in,

519
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
in areas already.

520
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:38,990
So they know they don't need to do it.

521
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,350
What's the [inaudible] yes,

522
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,050
yes.

523
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,540
Connolly is a fighter who was a,

524
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,374
um,

525
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,080
his entire career was,

526
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,710
you know,

527
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,420
he had like some really spectacular
victories over in strike force,

528
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,670
so great kicker.

529
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,360
And he had a real good
wrestling background to set
a very unusual style in that

530
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,860
he threw a lot of white wild taekwondo
style kicks but he was also really good

531
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,050
at stuffing takedowns and
could throw guys around.

532
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,100
Um,

533
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,970
came over to the UFC,

534
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:05,631
had some wins,

535
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,680
had some losses,

536
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,041
you know,

537
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:07,430
fought,

538
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,300
fought as hard out and then took his
last fight against Michael Bisping and

539
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,090
there was all these photographs of him
just looking different than he's ever

540
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:14,924
looked before.

541
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,710
Like we were talking about like this
radical change in his appearance.

542
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,920
He had this mad fucking six backwards.

543
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,580
You never saw that from him before.

544
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,571
And you know,

545
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,111
he said,

546
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:24,291
hey,

547
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,360
this is the first time I'm
healthy in a long time.

548
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm doing a lot of strength
and conditioning but it's
just super odd to see

549
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,430
someone in their late thirties,

550
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:31,911
forties,

551
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,690
40 years old,

552
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,523
40 years,

553
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,200
40 years old being built
like that out of nowhere.

554
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,981
It's very,

555
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:37,814
very odd.

556
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,331
And I mean,

557
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:41,570
unless someone goes on like a
fucking vision quest for like,

558
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,080
you know,

559
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,561
seven,

560
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:43,341
nine months,

561
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:43,701
whatever,

562
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,370
and just radical fucking strength
and conditioning training,

563
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,680
you don't see that much of a
difference in a person's body.

564
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,310
Yeah.

565
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,400
Usually while you're working on
skills and you're sparring and you,

566
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:52,611
you know,

567
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:54,950
you're doing drills and you're doing
all the shit that you need to do to win

568
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,470
fights.

569
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,250
Yeah.

570
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,611
When you're,

571
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:57,660
when you're training like that,

572
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:01,920
it is so hard to then go hit the weight
room and get that kind of muscle density

573
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:03,300
and put on that kind of mass.

574
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,160
And I mean that's where
it gets really difficult.

575
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:05,994
And uh,

576
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:06,571
you know,

577
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,730
and it gets clean the story
with [inaudible] whichever.

578
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:08,971
Yeah,

579
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:09,451
exactly.

580
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:09,751
Yes.

581
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,440
I mean he goes into fight and I
remember it was a Saturday morning,

582
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,460
I was in Tulsa,

583
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:14,881
Oklahoma.

584
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:18,060
I was calling the fights that morning
and I wake up and my body's like,

585
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:18,211
Hey,

586
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,030
the fight pass card is on with putting on,

587
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,350
literally just woke up
cause it was in China.

588
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,300
And so fight takes place.

589
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:25,260
Michael Bisbing wins.

590
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:25,861
And at the same time,

591
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,680
I remember I was reading an article where
busying was talking about the picture

592
00:16:28,681 --> 00:16:30,240
Kang took and you know,

593
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,550
busy Mike has always
been very vocal cities,

594
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,810
fought a bunch of TRT guys and he's
had some opportunity squandered in his

595
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:37,620
career.

596
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,750
And so then I pushed out the tweet where,

597
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:40,220
um,

598
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,460
it's a good start or didn't pay to cheat
for one's good start to the day and you

599
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:44,641
know,

600
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:44,881
it,

601
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,050
it's sent off,

602
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,890
you know,

603
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,680
a just a wildfire,

604
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,460
which all of a sudden I realized,

605
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,020
so yeah,

606
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:56,380
that was one of those emotional times
we're having the phone in my hand was to,

607
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,223
and you know what,

608
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm older and I'm wiser than that.

609
00:16:59,281 --> 00:16:59,461
And I,

610
00:16:59,461 --> 00:16:59,821
it was,

611
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:00,960
it was one of those times and then,

612
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:01,231
you know,

613
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:02,130
it was told to me,

614
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:02,964
hey,

615
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,950
it's best to keep your
mouth shut right now.

616
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,203
Um,

617
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:06,901
you know,

618
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:07,531
afterwards.

619
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:10,890
So it was certainly not a
situation that I was proud of.

620
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,761
Regardless,

621
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:15,450
I'm always going to be for proper testing,

622
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,470
clean sport,

623
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,740
etc. But it is not my job to go
around making accusations or whatever,

624
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:23,310
that there's bodies to do that.

625
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,480
But it is certainly something that that
does get me emotional and it triggers a

626
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:27,961
side of me.

627
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:31,170
I'm not so proud of us aside
that speaks before thinking,

628
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,531
you know?

629
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:34,290
And that's been a real
good lesson learned for me.

630
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:34,801
You know,

631
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:37,480
over the course this year being a,

632
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,610
an official sports broadcast or not a
fighter who does commentating on the side,

633
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,421
you know,

634
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:42,661
and,

635
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,320
and that's something where there comes
a certain amount of responsibility with

636
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:46,780
this.

637
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,120
We not broadcasting audio.

638
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:48,900
Is that what's going on?

639
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,733
There's this

640
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,351
slight issue.

641
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:53,280
It seems to be recording.

642
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:53,581
Fine.

643
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:54,361
I'm recording it here.

644
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:54,631
Fine.

645
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:55,350
What's the issue?

646
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,160
Not Hitting Ustream?

647
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,870
I don't know.

648
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,870
Why don't you reboot.

649
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,333
Okay.

650
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,390
Kill your Michael.

651
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,110
Okay.

652
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,920
Um,

653
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,191
yeah,

654
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:02,671
I mean that's,

655
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:03,600
that is a transition,

656
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:03,811
right?

657
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,280
I mean it's like,

658
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,480
it's also like you're
speaking from the heart,

659
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,040
but if you were in the gym,

660
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,410
if you walked in the gym and you were
talking to a bunch of guys in the gym,

661
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,610
that'd be a normal conversation.

662
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,270
Absolutely.

663
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,450
But you did it publicly.

664
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:14,340
And when you do it publicly,

665
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,050
you invite every fucking troll and all
these certainly dorks that just sit in

666
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:22,260
front of the computer waiting for
something like this to talk about.

667
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,220
Do you get angry at you?

668
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,190
And I don't,

669
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:24,521
you know,

670
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,500
I don't follow my own personal,

671
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:26,861
you know,

672
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:27,171
look,

673
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:32,020
if that is a conversation I should have
with him first before I ever go anywhere

674
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:32,351
else.

675
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:32,621
And you know,

676
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:34,720
I actually tried to contact
him a few days after and,

677
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:35,470
and you know,

678
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,550
he had just lost the fight.

679
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,061
He wasn't,

680
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:38,200
he wasn't ready to speak.

681
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,034
And so,

682
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,940
um,

683
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,151
you know,

684
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:40,380
it,

685
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,710
it's,

686
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,011
it's,

687
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:43,570
it's one of those situations
where where you live and learn,

688
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,111
you know,

689
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:46,240
and you'll learn the hard
way when you do something,

690
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,860
but at the same time,

691
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,993
uh,

692
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,853
you know,

693
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,230
it,

694
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,850
it's not one of those situations where
it's going to make me back down from,

695
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:57,400
from stating right from
wrong in this sport,

696
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,260
in standing up for what's right.

697
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,420
And you were saying that he was ready
to take the nine months suspension.

698
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
He was ready to take the
nine months suspension.

699
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:08,740
Then they changed it to 12 and then
they started having this a quarter.

700
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,040
Yeah.

701
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,781
According to,

702
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,601
to the UFC.

703
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,500
So there was something where,

704
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:11,711
you know,

705
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:14,170
his camp was ready to take the
nine month and then instead,

706
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:14,381
you know,

707
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:15,250
when it got up to 12,

708
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,070
that's where they fought it and ended
up beating it and then everything had to

709
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:18,750
be rescinded.

710
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:18,961
Well,

711
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:19,211
he,

712
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:23,280
they ended up beating it because the
way that the tests were handled was

713
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,061
incorrect.

714
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,760
The way that the tests were
administered was incorrect.

715
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,240
It was all done by someone that
the UFC had hired to do it,

716
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:31,680
but it wasn't done to the protocol.

717
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:31,971
Yeah.

718
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:32,570
The lab,

719
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,460
the lab couldn't know.

720
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,010
The lab was not capable of,

721
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:39,080
of actually testing accurately
for human growth hormone,

722
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:40,790
which is what they said he failed for.

723
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,020
So that's kind of a disaster
and it was an absolute disaster,

724
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,831
absolute disaster,

725
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:48,530
which is really why the
UFC has now abandoned,

726
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,131
you know,

727
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:50,400
trying to do this and,

728
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:50,960
and you know,

729
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,900
they've taken a step
backwards to evaluate.

730
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,240
It's really fascinating to
me because the sport is,

731
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,074
um,

732
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,290
it's the most intense and the most,

733
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,550
in my opinion,

734
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:06,551
the most dangerous sport in a sense
that you have so much on the line.

735
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,170
Like if you lose a,

736
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:10,040
an auto race,

737
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,720
auto races are dangerous
and you could crash,

738
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:12,471
you could die.

739
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,150
And there's no doubt about that.

740
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:15,350
It's a very dangerous game.

741
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,850
Football also very game.

742
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,950
But there's something about losing a
fight that is so much more personal.

743
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,780
There's so much more on the line.

744
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,450
It's so much different
than any other loss.

745
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,640
You lose a basketball game at fuck,

746
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,474
we lost,

747
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,090
you know,

748
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,891
let's have a beer.

749
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:32,300
Let's say you lose a fight,

750
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:32,660
man.

751
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,460
It's a fucking life changing event.

752
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,380
Tremendous,

753
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:35,951
tremendous.

754
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:36,161
There's,

755
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:36,611
well one,

756
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,140
there's no teammates to point to,

757
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:38,531
you know,

758
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,000
it's just you and the
other guy in the ring.

759
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,940
You sometimes you get guys who will use
the referees and excuse that judges an

760
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,610
excuse and you're on a 50% pay scale.

761
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,841
So when,

762
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:47,350
when,

763
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,280
when I would fight,

764
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:48,491
you know,

765
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:52,510
I would get $40,000 to show up
and fight and 40,000 more to win.

766
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,610
That's a tremendous difference.

767
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,250
That's a lot of months of
pay in the mortgage debt.

768
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,000
That's,

769
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,580
you know,

770
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,500
a big chunk that I can then put away for
the future and what I need to do as a

771
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,940
fighter for when I retire.

772
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,140
There's a lot of that.

773
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:06,370
So it becomes very personal.

774
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:09,490
Not to mention you're standing
your contract negotiations,

775
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:10,360
who you fight next,

776
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,740
how soon you fight next.

777
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,610
All these things go into a
play and depending on how
you lose for fighter loses

778
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,050
by a vicious knockout,

779
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,790
how much of that just
shortness his career?

780
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,710
So there's a lot on the line and in a
big part of that is the reason why people

781
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,000
are so intrigued by this sport.

782
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,040
That's why they want to
watch it because they know,

783
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:27,341
wow,

784
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:28,240
these guys,

785
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,620
they lay it on the line.

786
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,310
This,

787
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,110
this is different than any other sport.

788
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:36,760
Who are these people that are capable
of making that walk in doing that?

789
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,301
And that,

790
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:38,390
that really I think is,

791
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:41,710
is part of the reason why people are so,

792
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,440
uh,

793
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,750
it,

794
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,050
it eager to watch the sport and get
so interested in so involved in it.

795
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,760
That victory incentive that
doesn't exist in boxing does it?

796
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,310
You don't have,

797
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,150
they don't have a win loss thing and
Boston as far as like 50 to win 50,

798
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,720
you know,

799
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,400
50 to show 50 to win,

800
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,390
then that's not,

801
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,660
does that exist in boxing?

802
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,371
It May.

803
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:01,001
I've never seen,

804
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,350
it's usually a contracted amount.

805
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,730
It's a contract amount.

806
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,200
That's an issue,

807
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,130
isn't it?

808
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,701
I mean it's,

809
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,660
I think the UFC likes it
because it makes people,

810
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,260
it gives them an incentive to fight,

811
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,190
but God damn,

812
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,870
don't they already have
the incentive to fight.

813
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,591
You know,

814
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:14,700
it,

815
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,221
it's,

816
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:18,100
it's one of those things where when you
talk to Joe Silva about some of those

817
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:18,431
things,

818
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:18,541
he,

819
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,690
he has some,

820
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,830
some very strong ideologies on
it since he's been there so long,

821
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:24,111
you know,

822
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:24,221
at,

823
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:27,310
there's one point where they did finish
bonuses for anybody who finished on the

824
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,000
car.

825
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,800
He said that was a complete failure.

826
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,963
Um,

827
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,421
you know,

828
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:32,320
so it's interesting.

829
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,730
That would be a pretty cool,

830
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,181
you know,

831
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:35,380
to pull all the data,

832
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,330
put it into some kind of model and see,

833
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,081
you know.

834
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,130
But in my opinion,

835
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,300
it seems like to me it's,

836
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,540
it's financially more beneficial to win
long term than it is to take a whole lot

837
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:46,654
of risks.

838
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,201
Of course.

839
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:47,441
Yeah.

840
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,274
Without a doubt.

841
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,330
And it's also,

842
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,390
I mean you only have so many fights in
your career and if you're extending your

843
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,780
yourself and you're,

844
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:02,781
you're putting yourself in danger to try
to eek out a win and fighting in maybe

845
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:03,930
what you would call it,

846
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,450
a non technical way or
fighting in a reckless way,

847
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,470
you'll longtime,

848
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,580
you're gonna cost yourself money.

849
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,270
Absolutely.

850
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,651
Because you're,

851
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:13,990
you're going to take shots he wouldn't
take and you're going to put yourself

852
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,420
there.

853
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,880
It's a short term gamble that really is
only beneficial to the folks that are

854
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,110
watching it in the UFC.

855
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,561
Yeah.

856
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,610
And when you look at it,

857
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:21,970
you know,

858
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,271
from,

859
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:26,950
from spending the last year calling
fights and I've really gotten to know Joe

860
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,980
Silva,

861
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,250
Sean Shelby a lot better than
I did when I was a fighter.

862
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,920
I've seen them reward the guys,

863
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,071
you know,

864
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:37,120
there there was a missed miscommunication
or I think some guys just had it

865
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:37,540
wrong.

866
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:37,721
You know,

867
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:38,560
back when I fought were,

868
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:38,681
hey,

869
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,820
I got to go in there and brawl.

870
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,870
I've seen them reward guys very well
for going out there and fighting.

871
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:45,890
Very similar how Frankie
Edgar Foc Cub Swanson,

872
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,630
he didn't go out there
and trade with them.

873
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:48,231
He went out there,

874
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,610
he moved around duty to do,

875
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:52,040
shot the take down and dominated
the fight on the ground.

876
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,310
Then gets the finish the very last
few seconds of the fifth round and,

877
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,580
and they absolutely love
the fight like that.

878
00:23:58,581 --> 00:23:59,414
So I don't,

879
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,130
I think that fighters need to realize,

880
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:01,341
look,

881
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:04,430
go in there and get the fight
finished as fast as you can.

882
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,900
And when in most dominant fashion,

883
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,810
what I've seen where they get
frustrated with his word guys,

884
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,280
we'll ride certain positions out.

885
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,570
They get inside the guard,

886
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,580
make no attempt to pass to do more damage.

887
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,840
They get inside the clench.

888
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,450
They're happy to just hold them against
the cage for a while until the referee

889
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:18,284
separates them.

890
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,620
I think that's some of the things that
get them a little frustrated when,

891
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:24,260
when guys will win fights like that,

892
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,310
but then ask for major things after it's,

893
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:26,420
hey,

894
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,970
I want a better contract and went higher
profile matchups I want to be in the

895
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:29,481
main Carter.

896
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,314
I want to be the main event

897
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,740
and for,

898
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,850
for folks that are not
familiar with training camps,

899
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,300
there's one thing that has to be taken
into consideration when you watch a

900
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:39,541
fight.

901
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,460
When you see a guy may
be stalling like that,

902
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,290
that guy might've fought injured,

903
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,550
he might've fought sick,

904
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,120
he might have gotten injured during camp
and not being able to train correctly,

905
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:50,430
so he has to take advantage of what,

906
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,600
what little opportunities sometimes that
he can get to take a break because he

907
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:56,430
doesn't have the gas tank to go all out.

908
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,030
Absolutely.

909
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,230
You can't tell by looking at a guy.

910
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,721
No,

911
00:24:58,721 --> 00:24:59,554
you're on the wall.

912
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,300
When you're warmed up like that,

913
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,190
you're going to be able to
move through certain injuries,

914
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:06,520
but it doesn't mean you have as much pop
on your punch or your kick with that,

915
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,413
you know,

916
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,710
with that portion of your body.

917
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:08,861
You know,

918
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:09,760
it was funny because,

919
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,900
um,

920
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,733
I get it all the time,

921
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,281
man,

922
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:14,590
that fight with you and
Vandelay Silva was awesome,

923
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,550
but why did you,

924
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,260
why did you fight him
like that and you know,

925
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:18,094
I'll tell him,

926
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,491
you know,

927
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:19,061
honestly,

928
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:20,450
I flew to Japan and,

929
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,131
and I actually,

930
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:23,410
I tore a part of my hip
the second day there.

931
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:26,650
It was real stiff from the training
camp and I would overtrain bad,

932
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:26,801
you know,

933
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:27,010
it was,

934
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,300
it was a big problem for me.

935
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,710
I always thought the more I could do,

936
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:33,520
the better I'd be so I couldn't
lift my left knee to my chest.

937
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,691
And,

938
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:36,880
and it's funny cause Doctor d
who flies into all the events,

939
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,160
he had to come right to my hotel
room as soon as he got there.

940
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:39,431
And I said,

941
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:39,700
hey,

942
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,630
just give me a light cane,

943
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,590
completely allowable by the commission.

944
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,091
It's legal,

945
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:43,750
it will numb it,

946
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,583
be good to go,

947
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,460
couldn't get it,

948
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,930
and Tokyo and so,

949
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:47,351
all right,

950
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,060
well you don't have to
find a way around it.

951
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:49,571
And this happens.

952
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:50,321
All fighters who knows.

953
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,180
I mean Vandelay could have
easily showed up to that,

954
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:52,721
you know,

955
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:52,901
with,

956
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,550
with something torn in his body as well.

957
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,601
And so,

958
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:55,841
you know,

959
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:58,660
you go in there round one and Iraq
them if they are right and well,

960
00:25:58,661 --> 00:25:59,950
this guy's got a lot of miles on them.

961
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:02,770
One more shot and I'll finish this thing.

962
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,671
Oh Shit.

963
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:04,510
He just knocked me down,

964
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,261
you know?

965
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:05,920
And then it just,

966
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,860
it kind of started going
back and forth and uh,

967
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,311
you know,

968
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:10,031
it's one of those fights,

969
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:13,180
you almost blackout and you just
get lost in the violence and,

970
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,920
and knowing you're
putting on a great fight.

971
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,670
Um,

972
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,121
that even,

973
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:16,750
you know,

974
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,850
when I woke up and I started
to realize what happened,

975
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,320
which was when Jon Anik
starts interviewed me,

976
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:20,561
I was like,

977
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:21,160
God,

978
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,993
I lost,

979
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,271
you know,

980
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:23,440
it's one of those things where,

981
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,390
all right,

982
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,581
you know,

983
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:26,230
but at least I went out on my shield.

984
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,380
The fights that really haunt you are the
ones where you go home and you're like,

985
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,100
man,

986
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,240
I could've pushed a little harder.

987
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:31,931
I could have done this.

988
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:32,764
I could've done that.

989
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,980
That was a wild fucking fire.

990
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:36,100
You and Val van de la,

991
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:36,421
you know,

992
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:37,320
whatever you say,

993
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:39,660
whatever you want about
performance enhancing drugs.

994
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:43,470
And he did run a Wa Vandelay
suspended for life for who?

995
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,070
Don't know the

996
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,903
whole story.

997
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,260
He ran away from a random drug test.

998
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:52,200
They showed up at his gym and
literally ran out the door.

999
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,471
He was like,

1000
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:53,560
I got to go see it.

1001
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,890
And they suspended him for life,

1002
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,240
which is really unprecedented.

1003
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,080
And in my opinion it's kind of fucked
up because the guy is a legend.

1004
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,050
And one of my all time favorite fighters,

1005
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,180
if not my all time kills me to,

1006
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,180
to see,

1007
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,171
you know,

1008
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:07,521
look,

1009
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:08,580
he absolutely,

1010
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,010
people should be punished
for what they did wrong.

1011
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,900
But let's,

1012
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:14,220
and I've actually said
this in a couple of years,

1013
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,000
I don't know if they ever saw,

1014
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,571
but eight let's,

1015
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:18,480
let's not completely black
out the entire career.

1016
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,000
You know,

1017
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,280
there,

1018
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,250
there are hall of fame Worthy Martial
Artists who they screwed up like every

1019
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,180
other human being in there.

1020
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,541
Hey,

1021
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:27,840
call a spade a spade and make
them stand accountable for it.

1022
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,800
But at the end of the day they have
an entire body of work to look upon.

1023
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,060
But isn't it true though,

1024
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,790
I mean some of these guys that
are hall of fame type guys,

1025
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:39,900
Hall of fame caliber guys most likely
were cheating their entire careers.

1026
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:40,171
I mean,

1027
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:40,441
that's,

1028
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,190
there's a big percentage of guys
who you could point a finger at,

1029
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,080
especially guys that
are fighting in Japan.

1030
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,450
And if you talk to the
guys who fought in Japan,

1031
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,740
they will tell you that,

1032
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,460
yeah,

1033
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,450
this is what was going on.

1034
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,520
Mark Coleman told me,

1035
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,600
he went backstage and he saw
Vandelay oiling up his body.

1036
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,130
He saw him oil.

1037
00:27:59,131 --> 00:27:59,401
He's like,

1038
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:00,490
the fuck you doing man,

1039
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:01,324
you can't do that.

1040
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,240
They were oiling up so that
nobody can take it down.

1041
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,731
Circus.

1042
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:06,564
Back then,

1043
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,330
that organization was an absolute circus.

1044
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:10,620
And for people that are listening,

1045
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,190
it is light years different in the UFC.

1046
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,580
Oh yeah.

1047
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,060
Um,

1048
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,421
but yeah,

1049
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:15,651
that,

1050
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:16,920
that was an absolute circus.

1051
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,740
They let fighters fight like fights.

1052
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,730
It should have never taken place.

1053
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:23,700
Like how about Bob Sapp 375 pounds.

1054
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,690
Fought to Maura interests
like one 85 right.

1055
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,010
Any anything?

1056
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:29,371
I mean,

1057
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:33,900
literally if they could have put a
tiger in there with a human being,

1058
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,270
they knew they would have made
money off that and they wouldn't,

1059
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,890
they would have absolutely done that.

1060
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,380
If they could find a way to
not go to jail afterwards,

1061
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,243
they would have done it.

1062
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:41,790
You know,

1063
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,100
they put together some
fucking ridiculous shows.

1064
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,770
What about Hong Man Choi versus fader?

1065
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,611
Remember that?

1066
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,180
I mean,

1067
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,550
hung Troy was like seven feet tall.

1068
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,250
He weighed 300 who knows
what the fuck pounds.

1069
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,540
He was a legitimate giant.

1070
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,830
He absolutely w with,

1071
00:28:55,831 --> 00:28:59,160
with less athleticism and his body
than my five year old daughter.

1072
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,581
Yeah.

1073
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:00,810
Well the poor guy was like,

1074
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,230
oh,

1075
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,870
he's bones probably weighed
as much as this fucking table.

1076
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,231
I mean,

1077
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,040
he was just,

1078
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,791
he was a mess.

1079
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:06,031
I mean,

1080
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:08,790
physically he had fucking
tumor in his pituitary gland.

1081
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,291
I mean,

1082
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:09,370
he,

1083
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,560
that's why the same as
big foot Silva Silva,

1084
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,830
who's still fights for the UFC,

1085
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
still an elite fighter.

1086
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,470
I mean that poor fucking guy.

1087
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,011
I mean,

1088
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:21,480
he's a guy who legitimately
needs testosterone replacement
therapy and he can't

1089
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:22,650
have it and he's got to have a,

1090
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,820
some operation on his head now and
now he's gonna Fight Frank Mir.

1091
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:27,100
Right.

1092
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,560
Cause he's got Frank Mir coming up.

1093
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,401
Look,

1094
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,090
God bless him.

1095
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,271
I mean,

1096
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,530
the guy's still in there throwing,

1097
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:32,281
but he's,

1098
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,380
he's a guy who legitimately needs it.

1099
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,340
Fucking Nogueira.

1100
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,571
We've,

1101
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,400
we played it a couple of weeks ago.

1102
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,160
We did a fight companion and watched
Nogueira versus Bob Sab own fucking

1103
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:45,370
Nogueira got pile drive quite 375 pound.

1104
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:50,080
Bob Sat picked him up and dropped him
and Noguera's weight on Noguera's head.

1105
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,060
It was the fucking most horrendous thing
to ever watch someone do to someone.

1106
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,430
You're like,

1107
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,390
Oh God.

1108
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,180
And me and mom knew Gurwin
went on to win that fight,

1109
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,740
which shows you how tough
deck guy was back then.

1110
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,900
Then that dude is,

1111
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:06,580
I saw him in Rio just a few weeks
ago and it was so cool to seek his,

1112
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:06,761
you know,

1113
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,710
everyone was just sitting at this,

1114
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:08,800
this little bar,

1115
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,110
and it was right next to
the restaurant in the hotel.

1116
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,920
And when he came walking downstairs
is humble as can humanly be.

1117
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,120
He comes down,

1118
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,350
everybody stood up,

1119
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,670
not just presents,

1120
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:23,440
but everybody associated with fighting
stood up out of respect for this guy who,

1121
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:23,771
you know,

1122
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:27,460
the day he retire should be immediately
put into the UFC hall of fame.

1123
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:27,731
Yeah,

1124
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,331
I agree.

1125
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:28,671
I agree.

1126
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:28,930
I mean,

1127
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,240
there should be some sort of
a martial arts hall of fame,

1128
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,811
you know,

1129
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,010
like not just the UFC,

1130
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,690
just to all schools,

1131
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,130
all disciplines.

1132
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,030
You know,

1133
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,140
he's in there for sure.

1134
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,351
I mean,

1135
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:39,300
he explained,

1136
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,581
I mean,

1137
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:43,870
he showed how you could win fights off
your back and the heavyweight division,

1138
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:44,740
which nobody was doing.

1139
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,340
Worries.

1140
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,080
Triangling Mark Coleman,

1141
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,850
who the fuck is going
to try and Mark Coleman,

1142
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,190
he's going to pick it up and slam me.

1143
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:50,890
I mean,

1144
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,180
and mark home and by the way,

1145
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,230
fighting in pride,

1146
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:55,420
most likely on a variety
of Mexican supplements.

1147
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:55,601
I mean,

1148
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:56,740
he's fucking,

1149
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,270
he looks insane.

1150
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,081
He was enormous.

1151
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,700
He was so good back then too.

1152
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,211
I mean,

1153
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:01,901
that was mark,

1154
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,650
you know,

1155
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,490
like during the days where he won the
pride heavyweight Grand Prix leather skin,

1156
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,320
fucking animal.

1157
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,520
Mark Coleman.

1158
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,331
I was there.

1159
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,820
I'm of the first fight
ever worked was UFC 12.

1160
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,860
And that was when Mark Coleman won the
UFC heavyweight title beat Dan Severn.

1161
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:20,110
He got him in a fucking judo headlock
and just almost pulled his head off.

1162
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,300
It was the old school yard,

1163
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,250
the school yard moving.

1164
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:23,771
Well it wasn't,

1165
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,060
it wasn't quite the school yard move.

1166
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:25,421
He was like,

1167
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:27,610
he was kind of in like side control,

1168
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:31,610
but laying on top of them and he had
his head and he was just fucking Yank.

1169
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,480
And can I forget the,

1170
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,920
you know,

1171
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,530
catch wrestling Josh Barnett?

1172
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,191
Isn't that what he got?

1173
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,150
Dean lister in us?

1174
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,870
And then,

1175
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,703
uh,

1176
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,740
all Sinek who's a current UFC heavyweight
who's two and o right now at 47 years

1177
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:44,291
old in the UFC,

1178
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,124
he's a heavyweight.

1179
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,330
He tapped out cre tech,

1180
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,890
the three guys in a row at that technique.

1181
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:48,724
It's brutal.

1182
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,301
Oh yeah.

1183
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,560
If a guy gets you like that,

1184
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,030
especially a guy like Josh Barnett,

1185
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,710
he's got a ridiculous grip.

1186
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,210
He gets you in that position
and good night fucks.

1187
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,710
I mean fucking tab dean
lister who's a Abu Dhabi,

1188
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:00,161
great.

1189
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:03,040
One of the best submission wrestlers
in the world means something.

1190
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:03,581
If you can't,

1191
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:06,520
that guy a bad dude.

1192
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,690
He's a bad motherfucker and he is the
best representative in my opinion,

1193
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,630
in all of modern MMA for catch wrestling.

1194
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,820
I mean he really is a
student of that game.

1195
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:17,320
He really understands that sport.

1196
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,080
That was the fight when
he fought Daniel Cormay.

1197
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,670
That was a fight that woke me up.

1198
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:21,910
You know,

1199
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,920
when you see us at me mean caught me.

1200
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:23,651
I wouldn't have like eight,

1201
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,820
nine fights at that point in time.

1202
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,241
I'm not sure.

1203
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:25,421
I mean,

1204
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,350
he had barely any,

1205
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,730
any experience.

1206
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:31,330
And he goes in there and beats a guy
like Josh Barnett were granted his

1207
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:31,901
wrestling game.

1208
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:33,100
A major advantage in that.

1209
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,390
But you know,

1210
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:35,530
still Barnett's,

1211
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:36,370
a crafty guy.

1212
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,360
You make any mistakes in there.

1213
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,350
He's going to catch you.

1214
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,040
Screen keeps

1215
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,281
going.

1216
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:41,114
Black over here.

1217
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,983
Jamie,

1218
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,250
is this not real?

1219
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,580
I don't know.

1220
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,413
It's still going out.

1221
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,783
Okay.

1222
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,710
It's not on.

1223
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,930
Not on my fucking computer.

1224
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:48,764
It's not,

1225
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,790
yeah.

1226
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,271
All their goes,

1227
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:51,104
came back.

1228
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,321
Uh,

1229
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:51,621
yeah.

1230
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:53,810
Josh Barnett is a very good wrestler too.

1231
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:56,510
So to see Daniel Cormier launch
him through the air like that.

1232
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:57,950
And the same thing he
did to Dan Henderson,

1233
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,000
who fuck has ever done that.

1234
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,780
Dan Henderson,

1235
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,700
I trained the first time
that traded Daniel Cormier,

1236
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,280
we were all doing one
of these shows here in,

1237
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:03,921
in La.

1238
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,251
And he's like,

1239
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:04,580
Hey,

1240
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:04,771
let's,

1241
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:05,900
let's get a session in today.

1242
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:10,901
And so we go to this tiny little gym
and it's got one of those really small

1243
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,074
cages.

1244
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,650
I mean,

1245
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:12,891
you know,

1246
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,740
I could lay across at night almost be,

1247
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,081
you know,

1248
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:16,170
as long as the Cajun,

1249
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,040
I'm trained to a core mia
and he's picking me up.

1250
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:19,251
I mean,

1251
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:21,500
if he wanted to throw me
right out of this octagon,

1252
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,140
I've never had a man
picked me up that easy.

1253
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,160
Once his hips pop,

1254
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,200
you're in the air and it just,

1255
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,540
it shows the kind of leverage and be,

1256
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:29,840
you know,

1257
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,650
the length and the technique that Jon
Jones has to have stopped that repeatedly

1258
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:35,090
and stifle those attempts.

1259
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,440
Yeah.

1260
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,060
When the one time that Daniel
did take them down like that,

1261
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,870
it was for a second and John was back
up to his feet like he was on springs

1262
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:44,810
wouldn't even have been scored
a takedown in wrestling news.

1263
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,170
Yeah.

1264
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,260
I mean he'd belly down
immediately and pop Rebecca.

1265
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,153
It was incredible.

1266
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,441
Yeah.

1267
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:49,580
John is a freak.

1268
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:49,851
I mean,

1269
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:51,320
he's a real freak athlete,

1270
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,011
you know.

1271
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:53,480
And the crazy part is he,

1272
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,710
you know,

1273
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,730
I don't know if John's ever been in
a Jujitsu class in shrimped before.

1274
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,930
Really like [inaudible] he's never
lifted weights in between fights.

1275
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:03,890
To my knowledge.

1276
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,210
He doesn't train.

1277
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:05,901
The key comes,

1278
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,420
he does his seven to nine week camp.

1279
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,900
He leaves martial arts is over at the,

1280
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:12,290
he's got a heavy bag in his basement,

1281
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,240
his house in New York that
he'll hit her once in a while.

1282
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,830
Like I'm dead serious.

1283
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,390
And so now he's actually
moving to Albuquerque and
saying how I'm going to train

1284
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:20,871
year round.

1285
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:21,704
I mean it's,

1286
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,221
you know,

1287
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:24,410
aside from all the other
things going on with him,

1288
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:24,521
he,

1289
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,270
he's obviously got some
things to take care of,

1290
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:27,530
but he comes out of this,

1291
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,360
the other end in search
training year round.

1292
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,280
It's really,

1293
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:31,941
really scary.

1294
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:32,151
I mean,

1295
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:32,531
the guy,

1296
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,310
he never lifts weights in between fights.

1297
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:37,910
He just comes in and start
lifting then that's so incredible.

1298
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,960
It's so crazy.

1299
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,700
It doesn't train in between fights.

1300
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,440
So what does he do in between fights?

1301
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,140
Just hangs out.

1302
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,973
He's got nothing there.

1303
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,930
He lives in Ithaca,

1304
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,711
Ithaca,

1305
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:45,981
New York.

1306
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,270
I drove when I was supposed to,

1307
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,800
when I was fighting Phil Davis,

1308
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,210
they gave me that fight.

1309
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,100
It was right after I had
just fought in December.

1310
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,330
I had just had a baby.

1311
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,201
And so we were,

1312
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:56,340
we already had plane tickets
booked to go to Pennsylvania.

1313
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,070
You see some family for
Christmas where I'm from.

1314
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,881
And so man,

1315
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:00,020
I got to train with some wrestlers.

1316
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,650
I'm them fighting this
guy named Phil Davis,

1317
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:02,790
who I can't find any footage on,

1318
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,160
but I know he's a national champion.

1319
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,250
I'm not really a good
matchup for this guy.

1320
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,330
So of course,

1321
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:08,690
you know,

1322
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,200
I end up driving all the way up to upstate
New York to try and train with John.

1323
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:13,340
And I'm trained in some,

1324
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,550
I don't know if it was like
Ithaca College summat somewhere.

1325
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:20,180
He shows up in sweat pants and
tosses me all over the place.

1326
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:20,330
I mean,

1327
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,590
he didn't know anything back then.

1328
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,030
He knew a little bit of wrestling.

1329
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:24,350
He didn't know any Jujitsu,

1330
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,640
he didn't know how to strike.

1331
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,620
He was watching the first
day and Greg Jackson's gym,

1332
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,461
he's a call man.

1333
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,380
I watched all these youtube
videos and Muhammad Ali.

1334
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:33,560
So he goes in there and he's got his
hands down and he snapped and jabs playing

1335
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:33,861
the rope,

1336
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:35,510
a dope with Muhammad Ali and just,

1337
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:35,801
you know,

1338
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,490
toasting everybody what a freak.

1339
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,110
Greg was running around the gym,

1340
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,690
running around the gym saying
till his wife saying to me that,

1341
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,730
that's my next champion.

1342
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,600
That's my next champion.

1343
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,081
At the time,

1344
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,190
I was still at light heavyweight.

1345
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,150
So Greg politely said,

1346
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:48,361
well,

1347
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:49,230
after you Brian,

1348
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,011
and I looked at him,

1349
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:50,251
I said,

1350
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:50,401
look,

1351
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:50,641
Greg,

1352
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,060
I'm,

1353
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,060
I'm old enough and mature enough that
that I can tell you right off the bat,

1354
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:54,431
look you,

1355
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:55,020
you could,

1356
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,450
you could save that shit for someone else.

1357
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:58,284
All right,

1358
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,630
well that's rare and that's one of
the reasons why you've been able to

1359
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:05,550
transition successfully into a career
in broadcasting is that like you,

1360
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,820
you let it go like in a
way that very few guys do.

1361
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,391
Like you,

1362
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:10,830
you let it go with many,

1363
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:13,020
many miles still left on your engine.

1364
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:13,920
You just decided,

1365
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,754
you know what?

1366
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,170
I'm okay.

1367
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:16,561
I'm good.

1368
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,250
I'm young,

1369
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,083
I'm healthy.

1370
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,350
I can still fight for sure.

1371
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,000
You could still compete
at the highest level,

1372
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,500
but you decided and yeah,

1373
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,430
I'm good.

1374
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,791
You know,

1375
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,990
and there was a couple,

1376
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:25,681
you know,

1377
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:26,910
there are a couple things to it.

1378
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,800
Um,

1379
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,633
one,

1380
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,011
you know,

1381
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:29,221
when,

1382
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:33,120
when I got knocked out by Vandelay I knew
right then that night in my hotel room

1383
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:33,721
that I was done.

1384
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:36,990
If I can't beat a fighter
who's an aging fighter who yes,

1385
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:38,850
he's one of the best of all
time ds and aging fighter.

1386
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,380
I'm now taking a step backwards.

1387
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
I had to evaluate because I
played football for 14 years.

1388
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,180
Um,

1389
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,100
got hit with a few LEDs and Iraq.

1390
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,960
I mean there's a few
indicators here and then,

1391
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:49,350
you know,

1392
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,070
I,

1393
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,880
I trained in the air and came up in MMA
where it was you go to war twice a week

1394
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:54,714
in sparring.

1395
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,111
Yeah.

1396
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:56,040
That was a different era.

1397
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,700
Right now they're just starting to,

1398
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,760
you're starting to see
those guys in the gym.

1399
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,630
The 10 year later,

1400
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:03,950
guys that are still,

1401
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,730
you know,

1402
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,380
sort of in the sport but have diminished
considerably in their faculties have

1403
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:10,370
diminished considerably.

1404
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,100
And that's the,

1405
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,980
that's a big issue that a lot of people
have is those guys that nobody talks to,

1406
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:20,180
those guys that are still around and you
get a chance to see what that style of

1407
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,740
training can do to you.

1408
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,740
Now you've seen a lot of
guys who were training there.

1409
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,990
If you've kind good training partners,

1410
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,580
you can get so much better by
not hitting each other harm.

1411
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,260
So Lou,

1412
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,420
and that's something that people
have a hard time accepting.

1413
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:33,620
Everybody wants everybody to be tough.

1414
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,860
Most fucking guys in
the UFC already tough.

1415
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,020
They don't have to take
punches to be tough,

1416
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,591
you know,

1417
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,100
it's just what you need to
do is work on your reflexes,

1418
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,690
your timing,

1419
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,461
your technique,

1420
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,160
and then the skillset
working on strategies,

1421
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:50,960
working on understanding what to do in
various positions were to never be what

1422
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:54,770
to do if you find yourself in a place
that instead of just winging it on

1423
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:55,251
toughness,

1424
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:55,790
which you'll see,

1425
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,720
you're still seeing,

1426
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,860
you're still seeing guys fight at the
highest level with their fucking Chin up

1427
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,281
in the air,

1428
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,250
their hands down and they're winging
punches and they're going in.

1429
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:04,821
And you know,

1430
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:07,210
occasionally it works and
occasionally it doesn't.

1431
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,651
And they're,

1432
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:07,910
and they're,

1433
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,510
they're flipping coins
when they do it and it's,

1434
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,773
you know,

1435
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,800
it's exactly right.

1436
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:15,610
And a big part of my focus when I
get to visit with all these fighters,

1437
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:16,870
before I call their fights,

1438
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,310
I'll talk to him about that.

1439
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:18,581
You know,

1440
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:23,230
your objective is to make the maximum
amount of money for as long as you can in

1441
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:23,711
your career.

1442
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:25,450
Fight as many times a year as you can.

1443
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,860
And I'll always ask them,

1444
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:28,120
do you get paid in the gym?

1445
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,010
Of course they look at me like I'm stupid.

1446
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:30,221
No,

1447
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:30,910
I don't.

1448
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,810
You could pay when you fight.

1449
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:32,644
Right?

1450
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,370
So why,

1451
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,510
why are you fighting in the gym?

1452
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,471
You can look,

1453
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:35,980
I'm guilty

1454
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,071
of,

1455
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:37,150
and I use it myself.

1456
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:37,920
I,

1457
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,171
I,

1458
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,060
for years never got rocked.

1459
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,280
And I spar with some
really hard hitting guys.

1460
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:42,461
You know,

1461
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:43,930
Jardeen Rashad Evans,

1462
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:44,381
you know,

1463
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:47,980
some really good guys that that would
get after I would never get rocked.

1464
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,360
All of a sudden,

1465
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,021
you know,

1466
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,340
towards the end of my career,

1467
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:52,570
my last two camps,

1468
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,291
I started to notice,

1469
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:53,880
man,

1470
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,030
I'm starting to get some headaches.

1471
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,691
You know,

1472
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:56,524
I started,

1473
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:56,921
you know,

1474
00:38:56,921 --> 00:39:01,450
feeling the repercussions of training
so hard for so many years and instead of

1475
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:03,940
focusing on sparring partners
that can mimic my opponent,

1476
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,420
I'm just focusing on winning in
the gym against various level guys.

1477
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:08,890
We're going to go 100% against me.

1478
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:09,490
And,

1479
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,050
and that takes away from your career,

1480
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,973
cuts it short,

1481
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,460
and it cuts down that window to where you
can make that maximum amount of money.

1482
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,091
You know,

1483
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:16,420
we're,

1484
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,580
you look at these guys now
that are getting smarter,

1485
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:19,414
just like you said,

1486
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,490
and they're tracking that sort of thing.

1487
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:21,701
You know,

1488
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:25,600
Mark Henry counts how many strikes
Frankie Edgar puts out a sparring session

1489
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,220
because when they do their game plan,

1490
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,690
you need to fight at this pace.

1491
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,670
I want this many strikes per round.

1492
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:31,840
This what you have to do to win the fight.

1493
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,760
So he'll watch Frankie sparring the whole
camp to make sure he's on pace to win

1494
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,560
that fight for what they
feel he'll need to do to win.

1495
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,730
And he's using like a clicker.

1496
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,510
Yes.

1497
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,270
Mark Henry's one of the most
underrated trainers in the game today.

1498
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,730
He's a guy who does not
get enough credit and I,

1499
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,870
I've talked to shop cause Shab did some
training down there with a Frankie Edgar

1500
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,711
and he was like,

1501
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:55,570
this guy's got fucking notebook after
notebook filled with all the different

1502
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:56,470
strategies,

1503
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:57,131
techniques,

1504
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,300
things they're working on,

1505
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:00,220
things to do for very fighters.

1506
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,660
I mean you look what he did the cub,

1507
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:03,420
I mean cubs a fucking monster.

1508
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,080
He is such a good fighter.

1509
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:09,950
And Frankie shut him down it and cubs
a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and,

1510
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:13,930
and he got into half guard and
really he knew what to do from there.

1511
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,000
But because of the continuous strikes,

1512
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:18,110
I mean it was a pace on tiny,

1513
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,200
not even just in the
striking room but on top.

1514
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:20,610
Yeah.

1515
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,090
Frankie never stopped punching,

1516
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,800
which when you're punching
a guy and half guard,

1517
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,670
it makes you a threat to pass them
out past to full side control.

1518
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,130
It made cub worry more
about retaining half guard,

1519
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,110
maybe get back to full guard
than blocking the punches,

1520
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:32,944
hitting his face.

1521
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,240
And on top of that,

1522
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,620
every time a guy's punching you,

1523
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,483
you can't breathe.

1524
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,810
So every time a guys punching you,

1525
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,980
you're tightening up your,

1526
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,250
you're constricting your body when
he's punching your body and you're,

1527
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:44,890
you're cutting in cutting back
on the amount of oxygen to get.

1528
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,770
That's like one of the strategies and
Nick Diaz is always used in his career.

1529
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,090
He'll hit a guy 150 times at like 50%
he just gets in front of your face and

1530
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:53,290
starts throwing punches
and people are like,

1531
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:53,531
oh,

1532
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:54,364
those aren't even hurt.

1533
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,241
Yes.

1534
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:55,751
That first of all,

1535
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:56,590
yes they do.

1536
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,250
Yes they do.

1537
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,390
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

1538
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,420
Let Him Punch him 50% it
might not knock you dead,

1539
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,450
but it fucking hurts and he
hits you with four of those.

1540
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,070
It's probably almost as good as one full
full blast punch is going to hit you

1541
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,780
with a bunch of them and you're
not going to be able to breathe.

1542
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,500
You're going to be tightening
up constantly toe a Paul Daley,

1543
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:15,970
Robbie Lawler knocked both out.

1544
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,720
Yeah.

1545
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,240
You know what I mean?

1546
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,140
Those are just two of the examples
of what he's able to do and you know,

1547
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,600
he has good accuracy mean
he'll knock them out.

1548
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,230
He's pretty pinpoint when he goes and
hits a guy in the chin rate when they

1549
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,160
think it's not hurting,

1550
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,300
then he does drop them and it's a
suffocating style because I feel,

1551
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:32,860
and I don't know if there's
science that backs up,

1552
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:33,694
I haven't researched a bit.

1553
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,240
When you're exhausted,

1554
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,980
you're easier to get knocked out.

1555
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,480
You know,

1556
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,790
you can't tense up as much when you
and roll with the punches as much.

1557
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,460
You end up taking it square and it rocks.

1558
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,590
The jaw crushes the
nerves and in your own,

1559
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,101
yeah,

1560
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:46,820
there's no doubt.

1561
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,080
And you know those fights,

1562
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:48,410
man.

1563
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:48,861
God Damn.

1564
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:50,120
Especially the Paul daily fight.

1565
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,040
His Chin is another thing.

1566
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,281
I mean,

1567
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:53,300
you can't teach that.

1568
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,970
You can't teach the ability to
absorb punishment that he has.

1569
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:56,241
I mean,

1570
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:57,074
it's just,

1571
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,570
he's so tough and the psychology to,

1572
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,051
you know,

1573
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,810
to walk into an octagon
for all these people,

1574
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,110
everybody you know and care about in the
world is going to watch that fight and

1575
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,180
you've got to face him afterwards and,

1576
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:09,200
and your decision,

1577
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:09,381
I mean,

1578
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:12,920
you talk about the fight or flight
and they're still fighters who,

1579
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,620
even though they're professional
fighters and they're there,

1580
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,670
are way tougher than your normal populace.

1581
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,893
You know,

1582
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,470
there's,

1583
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,303
there's level,

1584
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,150
many subtle levels.

1585
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:21,290
Once you get to the highest level,

1586
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,150
Nick Diaz doesn't,

1587
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:23,841
he doesn't care.

1588
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,310
He's going to go toe to toe with you.

1589
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:26,180
It doesn't matter who it is.

1590
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:26,691
You know,

1591
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:27,501
Anderson Silva,

1592
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,410
he's going to go toe to toe with
them and there's no issues there.

1593
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:32,610
Even though he hasn't been
in the octagon a long time.

1594
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,381
There's,

1595
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,660
there's something psychologically
in that man where,

1596
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:35,811
hey,

1597
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:36,171
you know what?

1598
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:39,020
If you tell me you're going to draw a
line and fight that I'm there and he'll

1599
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:40,040
admit he didn't even like fighting.

1600
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:41,721
Yeah.

1601
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:42,620
Which is pretty crazy.

1602
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,280
It's tough.

1603
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,120
He wants that money.

1604
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:44,511
You know what I mean?

1605
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:47,660
He made a lot of money in the George
Saint Pierre fight and then took a long

1606
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:50,840
time off and now he's coming back and
fighting Anderson Silva on the Andersons

1607
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:51,674
comeback fight,

1608
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,060
which is man,

1609
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:55,080
what a lot of questions and that fight,

1610
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,860
right?

1611
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,840
That's fights all.

1612
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:57,800
It's one big room.

1613
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,690
That should be the poster
for that fucking fight.

1614
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:00,710
Just a question mark.

1615
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,320
Who the fuck knows what's
going to happen in that fight?

1616
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,720
And most people will look at say,

1617
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:08,180
well you know Dee has going to come
out and he's going to want to box and

1618
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:10,010
Anderson just has so
many weapons on the feet.

1619
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:11,810
But how does he throw those weapons?

1620
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,561
And you know,

1621
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:15,630
we haven't seen the Diaz
brothers do too many leg check,

1622
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,030
checking leg kicks yet.

1623
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:17,211
You know,

1624
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,340
certainly Nate didn't do it
against how Hilda Santos.

1625
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,780
But if Nick Diaz or if you have Nick
Diaz comes out there and he checks a few

1626
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:24,890
leg kicks for Anderson,

1627
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,930
does that slow down the attack?

1628
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,441
You know,

1629
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:28,950
does he hit the same area again?

1630
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:29,781
Does he check that?

1631
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:30,351
Who knows?

1632
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:30,890
I mean,

1633
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,071
you know,

1634
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:32,240
if I have to bet money,

1635
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:32,571
you know,

1636
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:33,710
I'm going to put it on the all time.

1637
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,670
Great Anderson Silva,

1638
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:38,540
but I'm not quite ready to count out
Nick Diaz out of this fight just yet.

1639
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,740
I'm not counting them out at all.

1640
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,080
And Anderson Silva for folks who
don't know what we're talking about,

1641
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:43,610
is the greatest of all time,

1642
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,560
broke his leg in his last
fight through a kick,

1643
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,770
Chris Weidman lift up his knee.

1644
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:50,930
Anderson caught him in
the top part of the Shin,

1645
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:53,510
which is a brutal spot to get checked.

1646
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,910
And Anderson's leg snapped like a twig.

1647
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:56,780
It was really,

1648
00:43:56,781 --> 00:44:00,020
I've only seen it happened twice
live Corey hill long time ago.

1649
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,870
Who looked like a guy who would break.

1650
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,381
I mean,

1651
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:05,870
Cory was really tall for the weight class.

1652
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,950
Was he fighting one 55 one
55 that was a disgusting cut.

1653
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,281
Oh,

1654
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:10,851
he was really,

1655
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:11,211
really,

1656
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:11,541
really,

1657
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,374
really thin.

1658
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,310
And uh,

1659
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,500
I mean probably take something
out of your bones too.

1660
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:15,681
I mean,

1661
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:17,750
it takes something out
of your organs for sure.

1662
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,430
Super Bad for your kidneys and these guys
are dehydrating themselves like that.

1663
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:26,540
But Corey breaking his
leg was very shocking.

1664
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:30,620
But there was something about watching
Anderson break his leg where you just

1665
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:32,030
know the Anderson isn't

1666
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,140
all time great.

1667
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,250
The all time great.

1668
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,411
The,

1669
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:38,700
the most spectacular performer
we've ever seen in the UFC,

1670
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:39,240
in his neck,

1671
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,860
his leg just snapped the,

1672
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:42,880
the best martial artists

1673
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,980
in my opinion,

1674
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,570
in the history of martial arts.

1675
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:47,010
Do you mean when you look at like the end,

1676
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:47,940
you want to talk about,

1677
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,751
you know,

1678
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:49,111
Benny,

1679
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:52,490
the jet bill superfoot Wallace and
you have Bruce Lee and yet all that,

1680
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:52,741
you know,

1681
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:55,530
and you can go way back in
history path pavers for sure.

1682
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:56,311
Absolutely.

1683
00:44:56,311 --> 00:45:00,240
You've got to then look at Anderson
Silva and how he was able to bring to the

1684
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:03,870
most complete fighting style known demand.

1685
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,370
The artistry he brought to it,

1686
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,920
the many different ways he
want from different kicks,

1687
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:08,611
a submission to me,

1688
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:08,881
he can,

1689
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:09,720
he can do it all.

1690
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,300
I still think the greatest fighter to
ever go in the octagon is John Jones.

1691
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:14,580
So I don't think any,

1692
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:17,120
I don't think anybody has ever beat that.

1693
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,520
The level competition he's beaten by,

1694
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,880
uh,

1695
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,290
by the margins that he's done.

1696
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:23,980
So,

1697
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,341
I mean,

1698
00:45:24,341 --> 00:45:26,770
drops me Cheetah unconscious to the floor.

1699
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:27,731
I mean,

1700
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:28,541
the way he's done it,

1701
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:32,530
he submitted [inaudible] after he got
his arm fucked up and that arm bar and

1702
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:33,490
refuse to tap.

1703
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,240
Yup.

1704
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,841
You know what I mean?

1705
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:38,380
Fought Gustafson and from all indications,

1706
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:42,190
barely fucking trained for that fight
and still gutted it out in those final

1707
00:45:42,191 --> 00:45:42,641
rounds.

1708
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:43,290
And one,

1709
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,121
it's funny you bring that.

1710
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:44,461
I mean that,

1711
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:44,731
that's,

1712
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:45,870
that's what I've heard as well.

1713
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:46,641
I don't know if they're true,

1714
00:45:46,641 --> 00:45:48,210
but that's certainly the rumblings.

1715
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:48,421
You know,

1716
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:48,641
that,

1717
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:49,200
that that was,

1718
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,410
there was some stuff taken lately.

1719
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,350
It's very rare when you hear those
rumblings and they're not true.

1720
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:54,591
I mean,

1721
00:45:54,591 --> 00:45:56,660
when was it half the time you
heard of that guy barely trained.

1722
00:45:56,661 --> 00:45:56,841
You're like,

1723
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:57,710
what the fuck you talking about?

1724
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:58,730
The guy was doing two a days.

1725
00:45:58,731 --> 00:45:59,810
He was running five miles.

1726
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:01,420
He was eating nothing but the,

1727
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:02,990
the most wholesome foods.

1728
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,190
That's not what I heard.

1729
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:06,380
I heard he was doing the exact opposite.

1730
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,750
He was eating some very unwholesome foods.

1731
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:09,260
Yeah.

1732
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,381
Well,

1733
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:09,820
I mean when,

1734
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:13,640
when he fought shogun for the title or
the worst beatings I've seen inside the

1735
00:46:13,641 --> 00:46:14,270
octagon,

1736
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:19,070
he in fucking top line knee and his
opening move is he's the youngest guy to

1737
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:20,420
ever fight for the UFC title.

1738
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,171
He throws a fuck,

1739
00:46:21,171 --> 00:46:22,850
not the youngest guy to
ever fight for a title.

1740
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,530
I believe that was John Alessio.

1741
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,520
I think John Alessia was 20 when he fought
patent military way back in the day.

1742
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,450
But you know,

1743
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,160
he's got to win it.

1744
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,220
Youngest just got to win.

1745
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,550
It throws a fucking flying
knee on Shogun and cracks.

1746
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:35,420
I'm right in the chin.

1747
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,560
I mean,

1748
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,030
I mean just ridiculous stuff that he
throw me through what he try flying armbar

1749
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:40,760
and core me.

1750
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,410
I got a theory about that shit man.

1751
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,940
My theory is that guys who grow up with
brothers that beat the fuck out of them

1752
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,070
or just on a completely different level,

1753
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,770
cause Weidman grew up with a
brother to beat the fuck out of him.

1754
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,440
Matt Hughes and his brother
beat the fuck out of each other.

1755
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,860
John Jones had two super athlete brothers.

1756
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,160
He's got two brothers that are fucking
NFL studs and you know his brother Arthur

1757
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:08,060
by all all indications kicks John's
ass when they work out together.

1758
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:08,221
Yeah.

1759
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:08,550
And He'd,

1760
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,560
he'd kicked John's ass,

1761
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:10,394
grown up plenty.

1762
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,650
And he was a state champion
wrestler I believe yet.

1763
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,000
Huge guy too.

1764
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,020
Huge.

1765
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:15,171
Yeah,

1766
00:47:15,171 --> 00:47:16,130
he's 300 plus.

1767
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,800
And when you grow up like that,

1768
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:21,320
I think you just have a level of tea.

1769
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,930
I think also your body develop stronger.

1770
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:24,520
You know,

1771
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,310
Muse is something about
tangling with a brother,

1772
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,144
your whole,

1773
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,960
I mean you're in competition
from the time you're a baby,

1774
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,970
you're always going to war.

1775
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,670
And coupled with that,

1776
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,620
I have not seen in a guy
like John the belief,

1777
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,630
you know John Will,

1778
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,533
you know,

1779
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,020
he'll watch a movie about like cheat
or something and I'm making this up

1780
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:48,630
obviously and and health
think it truly exists in him.

1781
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:49,080
So he has,

1782
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,990
he meditates near a waterfall
the day of his fight always.

1783
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:52,890
They got to find water,

1784
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:54,390
he's got to go to water and you know,

1785
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:56,260
he sits there and he'll
meditate and he focuses on,

1786
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,080
most guys would point to that and say,

1787
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:00,150
that is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

1788
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:02,550
They try and make fun of
somebody for John doesn't care.

1789
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,541
John,

1790
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:03,781
you know,

1791
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:06,810
being in the locker room with him for
several fights from the same card.

1792
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,850
He's back there as this young kid
who has very few life experiences.

1793
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,470
So calm.

1794
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,470
Never once as a thought of him
losing run through his mind.

1795
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,540
I mean when he went out
and fought Vladimir,

1796
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:19,201
met your Shanko.

1797
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:21,350
I fought in that cart and,

1798
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,830
and John's Jujitsu.

1799
00:48:22,831 --> 00:48:25,680
I had submitted him several
times in that training camp.

1800
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,120
He goes out there against flatty and the
game plan was to strike with him cause

1801
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,140
Laddie was such a good restaurant.

1802
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,030
So get on the ground and John
wasn't good on the ground.

1803
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:36,540
Immediately takes Vladimir
down past his guard,

1804
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,050
elbows him into oblivion.

1805
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:38,310
The,

1806
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,143
the fights over.

1807
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,300
I didn't know that John even knew
how to pass the guard at that point.

1808
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,173
I'm serious.

1809
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:44,511
You know,

1810
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:47,220
you don't do beginners Jujitsu
classes at Greg Jackson's gym.

1811
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:48,960
He'll do it in like
private sessions with them,

1812
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:49,741
you know,

1813
00:48:49,741 --> 00:48:49,921
but,

1814
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:50,491
but John,

1815
00:48:50,491 --> 00:48:51,300
it just,

1816
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,541
you know,

1817
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,550
I remember submitting them
several times when we can.

1818
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:54,870
Then two weeks later we're in Denver,

1819
00:48:54,871 --> 00:48:57,240
Colorado for that camp
and he catches me in,

1820
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:58,074
in a submission.

1821
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,781
I look at Greg,

1822
00:48:58,781 --> 00:48:58,921
I go,

1823
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:00,660
did he learn Jujitsu in two weeks?

1824
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:01,471
You know,

1825
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,150
it's just always been that way.

1826
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,440
The only other guy that I hear that's
like that to that extreme for every move

1827
00:49:07,441 --> 00:49:09,690
they learn they could use
it instantly is Weidman.

1828
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:10,600
Really.

1829
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,650
When I talked to guys and I go
into hens those frequently for the,

1830
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,060
the nonprofit I run,

1831
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,810
there's a lot of guys up in Wall Street
who have been very generous and are very

1832
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,770
avid for veterans getting jobs and
they'll always meet me at handles and they

1833
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:24,120
train there and the guys there,

1834
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:25,230
we'll talk about it like,

1835
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,573
you know,

1836
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:27,443
uh,

1837
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,260
he,

1838
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,130
he sit there in these classes and it
takes me thousands of reps to get this

1839
00:49:32,131 --> 00:49:33,780
moved to work on high level competition.

1840
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,100
Weidman learns it,

1841
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:35,970
drills it once,

1842
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:37,920
and then submits everybody
in the class with that.

1843
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:39,710
He's just that much of
an animal and you know,

1844
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,650
he's a fucking,

1845
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,160
when you get a stud wrestler
that picks up Jujitsu,

1846
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,280
what a fucking horrific
combination that is.

1847
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:50,500
Especially for guys like me
and I mean it absolutely right.

1848
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:50,990
Anybody,

1849
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:51,350
man.

1850
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:51,790
Yeah.

1851
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:51,971
You know,

1852
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:52,160
I,

1853
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,200
you know Eric Bradley is wrestler.

1854
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:54,960
I don't,

1855
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,500
he don't,

1856
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,410
he was training at
Eddie's for awhile and uh,

1857
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:58,490
I uh,

1858
00:49:58,491 --> 00:50:00,140
we were doing this drill where,

1859
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:01,250
I mean he's not much bigger than me.

1860
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,570
He'd make maybe 15 pounds,

1861
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,830
but we're doing this drill.

1862
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,990
We're doing this neat
Abelli belly drill and a,

1863
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:06,261
you know,

1864
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:08,660
you started out with neon belly
and see how long you can hold it.

1865
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,270
He might as well had,

1866
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,050
it might have,

1867
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,390
might as well have had
a building on top of me.

1868
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,580
Might as well have had a
fucking full foundation,

1869
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,130
a few cars parked in,

1870
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:18,964
in the building.

1871
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,221
I mean,

1872
00:50:19,221 --> 00:50:20,054
I wasn't getting up.

1873
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,440
I got on top of him,

1874
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:22,370
he threw me off.

1875
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:23,204
Like I was like,

1876
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,111
who's getting out of bed?

1877
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:25,160
And it's throwing off the covers.

1878
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,210
It was just ridiculous.

1879
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,010
It's it since there's a a kid

1880
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,851
just like that.

1881
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:32,830
His name is Raymond Jordan and he
wrestled with Tyron Woodley and Ben asking

1882
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,800
verse and Missouri and he was younger
than those guys and he was a two time all

1883
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:37,131
American.

1884
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:38,630
There never was a
national champion though.

1885
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:39,740
And Woodley will tell you is like,

1886
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:40,790
I won't touch rain anymore,

1887
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:41,743
won't touch it.

1888
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,350
And so he went to go be Jordan Burroughs
main partner while he went and won

1889
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:45,800
gold.

1890
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,700
And I actually had him come to Atlanta
to help me train for four weeks before I

1891
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:50,570
fought Michael Bisman.

1892
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,490
The first week he was there,

1893
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:53,900
the UFC cameras were in town.

1894
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,131
And you know,

1895
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,060
you had me,

1896
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,370
you had Tom Watson who fights in the UFC.

1897
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:59,330
You had Douglas Lema,

1898
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:01,220
who's the Bella tour
champion was in there,

1899
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,270
uh,

1900
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,110
Juan Carnero,

1901
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,300
who's coming back to the
UFC and fight Mark Munoz.

1902
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,170
And then here's Raymond Jordan that this
kid who's never done this shit really

1903
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:10,004
before.

1904
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,340
He was beating everybody so
bad that the UFC camera said,

1905
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:13,761
Brian,

1906
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:15,500
this is some of the best
footage we've ever gotten,

1907
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,940
but we can't use any of it.

1908
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,990
Who is this kid?

1909
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,580
And he doesn't want to fight.

1910
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:20,420
It does.

1911
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,420
He was was the Russell amounts he mounts
INTAPP's high level worldclass level

1912
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:27,780
black belts cause he's,

1913
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:31,190
he's got that same funky
style on the mat that these,

1914
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,540
these Missouri Tigers have.

1915
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,670
He's most natural athlete I've ever met.

1916
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,740
Everything he throws is hard by the way.

1917
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:37,903
Um,

1918
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:38,601
just doesn't want,

1919
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:39,550
he's just not interested in,

1920
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,551
that's so crazy.

1921
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:41,090
So what does he do?

1922
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,960
Just coaches restaurant.

1923
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,860
I helped him get a job.

1924
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:45,320
He works at a company called
Med assets and it's the,

1925
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:48,320
it's run by the gentleman who chairs
the board of the company I run.

1926
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,330
And he's also brilliant by the way.

1927
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,450
He's an African American kid who
grew up with a crack dealing uncle.

1928
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,130
Both his parents are dead by six.

1929
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,440
And you would think this
kid graduated from Harvard.

1930
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,050
He,

1931
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,620
he's an anomaly and he's brilliant.

1932
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,970
And so he works in finance with them
and does deal analysis for a fortune 500

1933
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:06,070
company poker traded companies.

1934
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,913
Awesome.

1935
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,900
So just doesn't have the desire to fight.

1936
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,410
No.

1937
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:09,621
You know,

1938
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,830
he looks say sa,

1939
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:11,300
you know,

1940
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,300
he's been grinding for so long with
wrestling and I think it burnt them out.

1941
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,200
You know,

1942
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,100
a lot of those guys,

1943
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:16,850
it's tough.

1944
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,760
Is there a sport where people
overtrained more than in wrestling?

1945
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,600
No.

1946
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,180
I mean it teaches a mental
toughness and that is true.

1947
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:28,120
There's no doubt about it that wrestlers
can perform and come back and in and

1948
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,460
push in ways that a lot of guys
and other sports as they did,

1949
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:33,110
they never developed that gear,

1950
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,460
that sort of extra gear that you see
like a guy like Johnny Hendricks have or

1951
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:39,620
you see like some of these wrestlers have.

1952
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,700
But then you get a guy like Robbie Lawler
who has a fucking gear and you know,

1953
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,440
he had a little bit of
a wrestling background,

1954
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:50,390
but it was never like an NCAA national
champion or anything along those lines.

1955
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah.

1956
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,810
The odds are definitely
higher coming out of that,

1957
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,400
you know,

1958
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,670
uh,

1959
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:55,580
that population,

1960
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:55,651
you,

1961
00:52:55,651 --> 00:52:55,851
when you,

1962
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:56,661
when you look at that,

1963
00:52:56,661 --> 00:53:00,800
that talent pool of amateur
wrestlers in really in any country,

1964
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:00,981
I mean,

1965
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:03,260
look at the kids were
getting in from Dagestan now.

1966
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,280
I mean these guys are animals and it's
not just because of their combat sambo

1967
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:08,110
and wrestling background.

1968
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:08,943
I mean you'd go,

1969
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:14,140
I would love to go over there and see
how could be Abner Maga Madoff grew up,

1970
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,660
the hardships saying it's just
a different kind of people,

1971
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:17,841
you know,

1972
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:19,850
they're not nearly as spoiled is.

1973
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:21,320
Most of our asses are over here.

1974
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:22,154
State side.

1975
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:22,620
That's a,

1976
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,890
that's without a doubt a fact.

1977
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,220
How beep number good Madoff

1978
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,130
is the scariest guy at one 55
next to Paris in my opinion.

1979
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,750
I can't wait for him to get healthy.

1980
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,390
I mean I'm looking forward to those
angels fighting Pedis Cause I think

1981
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:36,060
stylistically it's a
very intriguing fight.

1982
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,640
But then you watch what Norma men off did.

1983
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:41,070
A Dos Anjos he just fucking shut up.

1984
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:42,360
I watched that fight again the other day.

1985
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,620
He just racked all of them.

1986
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,310
Everybody.

1987
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,160
He does it to everybody and he's not a,

1988
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:46,951
you look at him,

1989
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:48,600
he doesn't look like Tyron Woodley.

1990
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:48,931
You know,

1991
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,640
he doesn't look like you
look at Tyron Woodley.

1992
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,511
If he smashed his,

1993
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:52,051
somebody go,

1994
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:52,501
well Jesus,

1995
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:53,334
look at the guy.

1996
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:53,670
Yeah,

1997
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,480
I mean look at the guy,

1998
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,860
but you look at number commander,

1999
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,350
if he looks like an athlete for
sure it looks like a strong guy,

2000
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,550
but the way he's fucking rag doll on
people is shocking the way he did it to

2001
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:03,360
able to Hilo.

2002
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,660
I mean just like people
shocking hables a a stud.

2003
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:07,770
Athletes are strong as hell,

2004
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:08,071
you know,

2005
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:08,820
it's,

2006
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,151
you know,

2007
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:13,290
near Morgan that have his kinesthetic
awareness in his leverage in technique.

2008
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,770
And then I think they're,

2009
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:19,060
the real key ingredient though is his
will guys that have that wrestling back

2010
00:54:19,061 --> 00:54:20,010
and they have that gear.

2011
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,340
If you don't believe someone can stop you,

2012
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,900
it's so powerful.

2013
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,570
And he has that and the
talent and that's really,

2014
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:28,320
really scary.

2015
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,471
Yeah.

2016
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,430
He fights like a werewolf.

2017
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,080
I mean there's something about him.

2018
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,890
It's like he's like his intensity
and violence is just so heightened.

2019
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:36,690
It's like a as next level,

2020
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,550
just whatever it is.

2021
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,270
I mean if his striking ever
catches up to his grappling,

2022
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,490
Jesus fucking Christ man.

2023
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,090
I mean,

2024
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,650
and it most likely will,

2025
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,350
I mean depending on what's
the state of his knee,

2026
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,530
cause I know he hurt his knee and then
the room was where he got it operated on

2027
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,470
and then heard it again
like came back too quickly.

2028
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:55,951
Really.

2029
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:56,480
You know I,

2030
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,690
I had seen him maybe two
months ago and you know,

2031
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:02,310
speaking to some of
his management as well.

2032
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:04,380
I mean they believe he's
going to be back soon.

2033
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:05,214
Right around,

2034
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,090
I think the time that pedis is gonna
Fight dos Anjos so he'll be waiting in the

2035
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:09,780
wings,

2036
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,021
you know,

2037
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:10,501
quickly he,

2038
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:11,800
I think he's even complained that to sign.

2039
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:12,660
Just leaving it in the shot.

2040
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:13,231
Yeah,

2041
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:14,280
he is complaining that,

2042
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:15,180
but he's not ready to say,

2043
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,410
I mean you can't train right now.

2044
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:16,860
No.

2045
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,491
And if he does,

2046
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:18,240
fuck is knee,

2047
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,720
but probably just fucking duct tape it
together and get back in there anyway.

2048
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,060
We're saying you don't want
to ruin your career to come,

2049
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:24,720
you know,

2050
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,531
take your time.

2051
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,540
And the one crazy thing is though,

2052
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:28,201
if if aunt,

2053
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:31,490
cause it's not a walk in the park for
pedes to beat Anjos does not just as

2054
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,280
dangerous and doesn't just wrestling
look really good against Nate Diaz,

2055
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,920
but pennys he's a sniper.

2056
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,360
He just needs one shot.

2057
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,280
That's how scary that kid is.

2058
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:41,880
I mean he,

2059
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,061
you know,

2060
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:45,390
he can go into a fight and barely
messes hair and only hit you once.

2061
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,600
He also has a style that's based on
not like there's a style of kicking and

2062
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:53,160
punching that a lot of these guys do.

2063
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:56,910
That's Moy Thai style where there's a
step and then a kick a step and then a

2064
00:55:56,911 --> 00:56:00,150
kick and pedis has got that
taekwondo thing where he's,

2065
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:02,790
he's standing there and he
just throws it Zero Telegraph,

2066
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:07,680
Zero Telegraph with o power and it's
tough to fuck with if you watch him like

2067
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:08,730
the head kick that he landed on,

2068
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:09,564
Joe Lozan,

2069
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,890
here's it comes out of nowhere.

2070
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:12,240
The one he landed on Donald's Roni,

2071
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:13,200
it comes out of nowhere.

2072
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,630
And so Ronnie's a fucking ex all
Stryker and he's in phenomenal.

2073
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,950
That kid naturally has incredible cardio.

2074
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,280
We would go do these sand dunes
at Jackson's and add altitude.

2075
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,840
These things are are 60
to 70 meter high or or,

2076
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:28,191
or,

2077
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:29,800
or length sand dunes that,

2078
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:33,130
that are a steep incline to where the
sand falls and you have to crawl up with

2079
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:33,940
all force.

2080
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,290
He glides up to this thing,

2081
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,101
smokes everybody.

2082
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:36,820
Even when he's not in,

2083
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,420
in premier shape to kick him
in the body and Kayo him.

2084
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:40,901
I mean,

2085
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,730
you've got a bruise deep,

2086
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:43,031
deep,

2087
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:43,421
deep on the,

2088
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:44,860
I call them soul kicks.

2089
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,420
You kick a dude so hard,

2090
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:47,254
you see that.

2091
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,250
You see the shit face and the soul
just come sneaking right out the mouth.

2092
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:51,701
You know,

2093
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:52,451
that's what happens.

2094
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:52,751
There's nothing.

2095
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:54,910
You can do those liver shots,

2096
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,161
man.

2097
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:58,570
Then not like anything anybody could
describe unless you've been hit like that.

2098
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:58,930
Oh,

2099
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:03,580
it's this weird thing where your body
just stops working and it's war as sucks

2100
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:05,470
because you're helpless and you're,

2101
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,580
but you're conscious,

2102
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,970
so you're forced to watch the dude
kick your ass while you're helpless.

2103
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,020
You can't do anything to stop,

2104
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:12,970
especially in MMA and boxing.

2105
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,800
At least you'd go down and the,

2106
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:16,000
you know the countdowns,

2107
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,720
like Oscar de la Hoya versus
Bernard Hopkins and he was
the only time we've ever

2108
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:21,460
seen del La Jolla gets stopped like that.

2109
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,240
But Bernard just fucking
hooked him right in that lever.

2110
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:26,590
And you see his whole body just,

2111
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,160
it's the weirdest thing man.

2112
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,790
And sometimes you could play it off,

2113
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,243
you know,

2114
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,930
you get hit and you can kind of move
with it and like a guy doesn't know.

2115
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:42,610
But then there's times where you get hit
and like it doesn't the cro cop versus

2116
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:43,231
heath herring,

2117
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:43,960
you ever see that?

2118
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,440
Yes.

2119
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,940
There's a fucking photograph online
CV would find this photo of Cro,

2120
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:53,941
cop's Shin buried halfway
into he heath herrings body.

2121
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,890
And this is when cro
cop was fucking Croak.

2122
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:57,460
Yeah.

2123
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:02,460
When he was on his run towards the title
and he hit heath herring with this at

2124
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:03,851
my house,

2125
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:04,720
I couldn't breathe.

2126
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,220
I was watching it at home and I was like,

2127
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:07,480
look,

2128
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,980
look at that fucking kick.

2129
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,450
Oh my God,

2130
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:10,661
Dude.

2131
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,690
That's like taking your,

2132
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:12,580
your lungs,

2133
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,680
kidneys and intestines and just,

2134
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:17,530
I mean smushing them all
together for a brief second.

2135
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:18,820
I mean that is disgusting.

2136
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,301
And look,

2137
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:21,280
his foot is pulled back so you know,

2138
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:26,140
it's all shin bone and you know
how god Damn Hard Mirko kicks.

2139
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,980
That is the most horrific
looking body shot I've ever seen.

2140
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:32,050
Anybody take in a photograph,

2141
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,710
did it?

2142
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,431
I mean you don't see,

2143
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:35,050
you see that and like car wrecks.

2144
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:35,560
Yeah,

2145
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,760
that's exactly what it looks like.

2146
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:37,570
It looks like you got,

2147
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:41,200
he looks like he was on a motorcycle and
he crashed into a telephone pole that

2148
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,550
was on the back of a pickup truck.

2149
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,271
You know,

2150
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:44,170
just boom.

2151
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:47,020
His whole body is mat
that puts any picture.

2152
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:50,260
I've got a couple of pictures where I'm
taking shots and that puts everything I

2153
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:50,830
had to shame.

2154
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,311
I feel,

2155
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,690
I feel like a chump just looking at it.

2156
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:54,430
And Dad is the liver kick.

2157
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,380
That is the liver kick.

2158
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:56,771
That's all.

2159
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:59,200
I mean it's a rough
your heart and separate.

2160
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,610
It's everything.

2161
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,421
Anything internal,

2162
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:01,940
it's over.

2163
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,340
The ribs are probably broken.

2164
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,440
Probably broke some ribs.

2165
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,830
And I'd like to talk to heath about that.

2166
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,280
Yeah.

2167
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,500
Jesus fucking Christ and,

2168
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:07,901
and you know,

2169
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:10,330
we saw that with Maci
diverse Dalloway doll.

2170
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:10,760
I mean it,

2171
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,593
you know,

2172
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,740
Dalloway has done such a
fantastic job of finally,

2173
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:15,041
you know,

2174
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,320
reaching his potential and
showcase her that he does.

2175
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,830
And it's so hard for fighters cause
you want to at least go out there and

2176
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:26,030
showcase your skills and similar
to pedes but a different style,

2177
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:26,241
you know,

2178
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:31,241
taekwondo and now you're looking at at
karate and a guy who no telegraph sends

2179
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,740
it right underneath the elbow.

2180
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:36,920
Your garden pinpoint accuracy
in the fight is over.

2181
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,753
I called that fight.

2182
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,930
It's sounded like someone took a two by
four and just smacked it off this table

2183
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:43,280
and it echoed throughout the stadium.

2184
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:43,761
Yeah,

2185
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:47,780
I watched that and as soon as I saw
the look on his face like oh this is

2186
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:48,830
probably over done.

2187
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,030
Yeah he's got that.

2188
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,300
And he hit him with his Shin
and his instep at the same time.

2189
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,890
I mean in step kicks,

2190
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,570
like a lot of people think that like the
foot area is like not as effective in,

2191
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:00,560
it's not as hard,

2192
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:02,840
but God damn it's hard
enough to knock you out.

2193
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,640
I mean it's still a God damn bone.

2194
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,850
You can kick some of the
pretty hard this Thai,

2195
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,960
the Thai style,

2196
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,270
you could deliver a bit more power,

2197
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:13,370
but it does take a little
more time to get there.

2198
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,001
And you know,

2199
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,830
some of them depending on the athlete too,

2200
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,520
you know where I kicked harder
more from a a Thai style stance,

2201
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:23,300
but I don't have the flexibility
of a guy like an Anthony Pettis.

2202
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,660
Right.

2203
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:23,891
And,

2204
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:24,471
and you know,

2205
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:24,891
what are,

2206
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:25,670
what are their level,

2207
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:28,970
their muscle levers like two in their
hips and what's their fast twitch muscle

2208
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:29,331
fibers.

2209
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:29,511
Like,

2210
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:30,344
you know,

2211
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,880
you can pick different styles,

2212
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:36,530
but sometimes you get the athletes who
did train the perfect styles for their

2213
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:37,281
body style,

2214
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:38,001
their genetics.

2215
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,780
And that's where you get the Anthony
Pettis and the Leo to Machida's who,

2216
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,830
who have the,

2217
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:45,980
the perfect genetic
structure for that as well.

2218
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,221
Well,

2219
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:50,960
there's also the speed that you
develop when you do it your whole life.

2220
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,100
That's almost,

2221
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:57,210
you almost can't replicate it by starting
in your 20s or your thirties and you

2222
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,550
learning martial arts.

2223
01:00:58,790 --> 01:00:59,060
You know,

2224
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,340
we'd coming from a wrestling
background and learning how to kick,

2225
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:04,580
you're probably never going to be able
to collect and Cheetah or luck pedis,

2226
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,150
you know,

2227
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,220
they have this ridiculous speed.

2228
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:07,911
It's just,

2229
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:10,850
it's this weird thing that they can
do to their body because their body

2230
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,800
developed doing that.

2231
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,071
I mean,

2232
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:14,930
they went through maturity doing that.

2233
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:19,220
Their muscles literally grew
onto their bones throwing kicks.

2234
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:19,671
Yeah.

2235
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:19,941
I mean,

2236
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:21,560
lifelong martial arts.

2237
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:21,850
He,

2238
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,470
you didn't win when I was
still fighting the UFC.

2239
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:27,410
You still had a handful
of guys that were like me.

2240
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:27,591
I mean,

2241
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,960
I didn't even start thinking
about doing this till 26.

2242
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:33,560
Never had a first real
lesson till I was 27.

2243
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,453
That's so crazy.

2244
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,480
And so,

2245
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,590
um,

2246
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:36,861
I mean,

2247
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,720
now you got these guys
like Rory Macdonald,

2248
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,860
they grew up doing it.

2249
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:44,090
You're a GSP was one of the first and
he was a lifelong martial artists and

2250
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:44,640
that's where your,

2251
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:44,960
you know,

2252
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,860
Michael Bisman was a lifelong martial
artist and now you're getting guys that

2253
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:50,150
are even higher level athletes,

2254
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:51,140
not necessarily GSP,

2255
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:54,830
but higher level athletes that are
lifelong martial artists coming into this

2256
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:55,101
sport.

2257
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:57,620
And I consider wrestlers
lifelong martial artist as well.

2258
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,041
You know,

2259
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,050
when you're doing that shit
since you're five years old,

2260
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,130
you know you are,

2261
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,870
I mean to me wrestling's a martial arts,

2262
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:04,010
one of the best in the war in the world.

2263
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,550
Yeah.

2264
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,000
One of them.

2265
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,200
I think the most important,

2266
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,490
if you're a really good wrestle,

2267
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,990
you dictate where the fight takes place.

2268
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,710
Absolutely.

2269
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,640
But the,

2270
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:13,960
some wrestlers never
develop that strength.

2271
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,960
It's almost like their body's not designed
to strike like a good example with

2272
01:02:17,961 --> 01:02:19,160
all due respect is Matt,

2273
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,560
who was one of the fucking
toughest guys ever fight in MMA.

2274
01:02:21,561 --> 01:02:23,040
It was a fantastic grappler.

2275
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,330
Well I think he wants silver,

2276
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:24,931
silver,

2277
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:27,330
silver looks fucking great wrestler.

2278
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,120
I mean you got got ahold
of you manhandled people,

2279
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:35,490
but his striking was always
fairly awkward on his feet.

2280
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:36,930
Never developed,

2281
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:37,420
like,

2282
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:37,921
you know,

2283
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,810
you're never going to mistake
him for Anderson Silva.

2284
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,380
Never feet.

2285
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,890
And it probably never
wasn't available to them.

2286
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:44,550
I mean,

2287
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:48,510
how much scar tissue they build up in
their hips and their shoulders from years

2288
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,350
and years of wrestling,

2289
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,320
which I know for me coming from
football and the Marine Corps,

2290
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:52,980
you know,

2291
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,671
even now,

2292
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:53,881
I mean,

2293
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:53,951
you,

2294
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,700
you're supposed to be able to
touch one hand behind your head,

2295
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:57,780
the other hand behind your back,

2296
01:02:57,781 --> 01:02:59,760
you feel to meet your fingers
in between your shoulder blades.

2297
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,271
I mean,

2298
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:01,240
I've got like 2 million.

2299
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:01,620
Yeah,

2300
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,760
I've got like two feet.

2301
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:03,481
I'm work.

2302
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:04,081
We give it a shot.

2303
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:04,914
Let's see what you can do.

2304
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,190
One Hand behind the head sore,

2305
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:07,861
right shoulder.

2306
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:08,940
So I can't do it one way.

2307
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,880
I can do it like this canyon.

2308
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,630
Yeah.

2309
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:11,941
All right.

2310
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:12,031
Well,

2311
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:12,330
I mean,

2312
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,770
a lot of those guys probably can,

2313
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,570
I'm almost embarrassed to show mine.

2314
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,331
Wow,

2315
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:18,991
that's crazy,

2316
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:19,410
dude.

2317
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:20,243
That's all I got.

2318
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:21,790
It's,

2319
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:22,350
I mean,

2320
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:22,981
but that's a lot of,

2321
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:24,060
you have a lot of muscle to,

2322
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:24,440
isn't that?

2323
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,273
Yeah.

2324
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,910
I've separated both shoulders,

2325
01:03:26,911 --> 01:03:28,920
the AC joints a couple of times each.

2326
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:29,640
And,

2327
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,473
um,

2328
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:30,791
you know,

2329
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:31,411
a hump in with,

2330
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:33,330
with big packs all the
time in the military,

2331
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:35,100
shit built up scar tissue all the time.

2332
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:35,851
Oh for sure.

2333
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,310
And then grappling is
the worst off shoulders,

2334
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,410
knees and necks and backs.

2335
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,650
And after awhile it's everybody's
playing demolition derby.

2336
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,640
After awhile,

2337
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:44,881
you know,

2338
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:46,350
frames get bent fucking,

2339
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:47,184
you know,

2340
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,310
things blow out.

2341
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:48,930
That's it,

2342
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,171
eh?

2343
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:49,560
Yeah.

2344
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,560
And you see that's where you got to get
the crafty old veterans who come out

2345
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:55,880
there and pull off some sick moves and
have their experience to win fights and

2346
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,330
or they ride off into the sunset.

2347
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:01,380
Well again with Nogueira the word is
that no care needs like an hour to get

2348
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:02,880
ready just to train.

2349
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:08,030
Like he has a guy who travels with him
and the guy does massage and stretches

2350
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:13,380
him and does all this shit and like
literally can't train unless he does this

2351
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,090
hour long regimen before he gets in there.

2352
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:16,140
Wow.

2353
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:16,531
Yeah.

2354
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:17,460
I mean there's just,

2355
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,680
there's so much your body can take,

2356
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:20,041
you know,

2357
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:25,041
and so many guys have fucking fuse
joints or fused up disks rather.

2358
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:25,950
Um,

2359
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,400
some,

2360
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,340
some guys are getting
artificial discs put in there.

2361
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:30,870
Apparently they're getting
way better at that.

2362
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:31,051
I know.

2363
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:32,060
Braulio esteem,

2364
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,820
Osa,

2365
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,080
worldclass Jujitsu,

2366
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:34,711
black belt.

2367
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:35,544
He has,

2368
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:36,060
um,

2369
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,830
an artificial disc in his neck that
somehow or another it rotates and moves.

2370
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:41,640
Well.

2371
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,240
It's like,

2372
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,510
it's something they do in Europe and I
guess they're starting to do it here in

2373
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:46,260
America.

2374
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:46,550
You know,

2375
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,220
who had one,

2376
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,700
he had an artificial disc putting his
neck is the fuck is named Freddie Prinze

2377
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:51,690
jr the uh,

2378
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:52,524
the actor,

2379
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,860
he just doing Jujitsu and uh,

2380
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,670
I mean he's really doing Jujitsu likes,

2381
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,111
you know,

2382
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,441
he's,

2383
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:02,010
he's doing a lot of rolling and apparently
he just had neck surgery and he's

2384
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:07,200
showing all these a photos of the scar
and the neck surgery and you know,

2385
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:07,560
and uh,

2386
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,810
he trains down with Henna and here on,

2387
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:11,160
and those guys down in Torrance.

2388
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,600
And I asked him about [inaudible].

2389
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:13,861
He said,

2390
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:14,011
yeah,

2391
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:14,491
he's training.

2392
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:15,121
He trains hard.

2393
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,740
He says he's a legit blue belt.

2394
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,620
No Kid.

2395
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:17,891
Yeah.

2396
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:18,010
And

2397
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,360
isn't that goes Foxville?

2398
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:20,080
No,

2399
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,560
I mean,

2400
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,310
it happened.

2401
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:21,770
It happens.

2402
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:22,361
This port for sure.

2403
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:22,870
And you know,

2404
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,340
it's interesting because when,

2405
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,890
as we talk about this and we,

2406
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:27,760
and we've talked a lot
about the damage guys,

2407
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,500
cause we've gone through
all the various techniques.

2408
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,431
You know,

2409
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:31,540
after you had,

2410
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:31,870
you know,

2411
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,160
a discussion with Brendan Schaub,

2412
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:34,990
a lot of people came out
and they started saying,

2413
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:35,141
hey,

2414
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:37,660
should we feel bad for
talking about this sport?

2415
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:37,921
And I,

2416
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:39,640
and I've heard that conversation again,

2417
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:40,180
you know,

2418
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,760
at what point should we feel
guilty for watching guys?

2419
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,320
We know our aging fighters.

2420
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,190
And you know,

2421
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,720
you could do the same thing with football.

2422
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,720
You could certainly do the same
thing in the military where there's,

2423
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:51,430
there's a lot of traumatic brain injuries
taking place in the military as well.

2424
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,730
One thing that,

2425
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:56,090
that I think people forget and that I
think people need to understand that it's,

2426
01:05:56,091 --> 01:05:59,170
it's not to excuse anything or
take away from the conversation.

2427
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,413
It's,

2428
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,840
it's a little bit of a mitigation.

2429
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:02,880
The,

2430
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,590
the men and women who do sports like this,

2431
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,180
if you take it away from them,

2432
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,130
they're going to find it elsewhere.

2433
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:10,181
I mean it's,

2434
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:10,871
it's a need.

2435
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:11,021
You know,

2436
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:14,530
for a guy like me had I not
found mixed martial arts,

2437
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,330
I was going to find something.

2438
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:16,571
There's,

2439
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:21,130
there's like there's drive inside us to
do something extreme that makes people

2440
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:22,270
raise their eyebrows and say,

2441
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:23,680
are you sure you want it?

2442
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:25,120
You really are going to do that.

2443
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,530
They have that,

2444
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:27,680
that desire and,

2445
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:29,300
and it's just a personality trait.

2446
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:29,860
I mean if,

2447
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,630
if mixed martial arts didn't exist,

2448
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:32,830
I mean look at cowboy Cerrone,

2449
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,840
the things he does to,

2450
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:38,590
to fill that hole in his life and
you're going to get a lot of guys,

2451
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:40,120
that's why guys don't want to retire.

2452
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,470
It's just part of who they are.

2453
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,090
We all know the risks.

2454
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,650
We all know everything we're up against.

2455
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:45,880
We still sign the contract.

2456
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:50,800
And so it's important to remind them
that if you know for people that are anti

2457
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:51,820
this and anti that,

2458
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:52,810
you know,

2459
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,520
we're going to do something
like that anyways,

2460
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:55,960
we're going to find something else to do.

2461
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:58,000
And at some point we've got to be
accountable for her own actions.

2462
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:58,191
Well,

2463
01:06:58,191 --> 01:07:01,610
there's a wide variety of human beings
is always going to be sedentary.

2464
01:07:01,611 --> 01:07:04,820
People that sit in their couch is going
to be people who want fucking rock climb

2465
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:05,654
with no ropes.

2466
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,420
It's just like you ever
see that Alex Honnold guy,

2467
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,870
the the free climber Guy,

2468
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:12,080
Jesus Christ,

2469
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,220
we had him on the podcast.

2470
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:14,360
He's the most mellow,

2471
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,440
laid back,

2472
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:16,850
super sweet guy,

2473
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,140
great to talk to,

2474
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:19,700
but this fucking guy,

2475
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,530
he not only does he climb these insane
peaks that people get scared to climb

2476
01:07:24,531 --> 01:07:25,280
with ropes.

2477
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,480
He does it with no ropes.

2478
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,840
He also takes paths that no
one has ever done before.

2479
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:34,990
He takes his fucking crazy pass that
have never been accomplished by anyone,

2480
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:36,800
and he does it with no fucking rope.

2481
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:37,540
He said,

2482
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,120
he look at,

2483
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:38,953
he goes,

2484
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,970
not just straight up,

2485
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,210
he goes at an angle the wrong way.

2486
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:49,540
Like he goes at an angle like 15
degrees towards him and he climbs.

2487
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:50,751
Look at Dutch.

2488
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:51,350
I mean that's,

2489
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:52,460
that's him with ropes.

2490
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,690
You could see a rope there,

2491
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:54,500
but there's,

2492
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,230
there's video of him
climbing this one air.

2493
01:07:57,231 --> 01:07:58,064
Look at that right there.

2494
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,660
That's no fucking rope.

2495
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,920
He's got no rope there and he's
got no road and he is incredible.

2496
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:04,491
He is like,

2497
01:08:04,491 --> 01:08:04,761
what,

2498
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:07,670
1,002 thousand feet
over the fucking ground.

2499
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:08,990
Holy Christ.

2500
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:09,861
And the crazy,

2501
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:10,280
I mean there's,

2502
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,880
there's,

2503
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,090
there's nobody around them
that I see pushing him.

2504
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,420
No.

2505
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:14,661
You know,

2506
01:08:14,661 --> 01:08:15,270
in terms,

2507
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,431
hey,

2508
01:08:15,431 --> 01:08:16,070
like I have

2509
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,581
to do this.

2510
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:18,800
Like you'll see other
people that'll do extreme,

2511
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:19,730
amazing things,

2512
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,631
but there's,

2513
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:24,140
there's people around them to make them
feel more comfortable while doing it.

2514
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,700
You're on your own.

2515
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,453
That's incredible.

2516
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,030
Yeah.

2517
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,440
He lives in his fucking van.

2518
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,370
He has a van,

2519
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,780
he sleeps in his van.

2520
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:35,780
He's got his little boxes for
underwear and toothpaste and shit.

2521
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,440
And he just sleeps in his van and climbs
all the time is as he found a way to

2522
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:40,041
monetize them.

2523
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,750
And as he make any money
for climbing and stuff,

2524
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,051
at least,

2525
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:42,711
I don't know.

2526
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:42,951
I mean,

2527
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:44,180
I would like to help the guy,

2528
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:44,960
but you know,

2529
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,990
there's the people that
are in that industry,

2530
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:48,741
quote unquote,

2531
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:48,981
the,

2532
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:49,211
the,

2533
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:50,510
the free climbing world.

2534
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,120
They're terrified of him
because they're like,

2535
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:53,241
well,

2536
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:53,931
this guy,

2537
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:54,431
it's just,

2538
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:54,860
it's,

2539
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:55,400
I mean,

2540
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,000
there was an interview that I watched on
one of those major shows where I found

2541
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,680
out about him where they said,

2542
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:00,921
look,

2543
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,950
it's not a matter of
if he's going to fall,

2544
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,080
it's a matter of when is he going to fall.

2545
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,010
You know,

2546
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:07,460
he does.

2547
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,240
He disagrees.

2548
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:08,721
He says,

2549
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:09,650
I know what I'm doing.

2550
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,100
Uh,

2551
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,270
every time I do this,

2552
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:12,290
I,

2553
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,330
I plot my strategy.

2554
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,550
I figure out what path I'm going to take.

2555
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,470
He does it with ropes first.

2556
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,890
He maps it all out and
as he's mapping it out,

2557
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,300
he's climbing up and he's seeing,

2558
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:23,601
okay,

2559
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:24,830
well what can I do here?

2560
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,920
But even told me on the podcast one time,

2561
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:31,220
he was doing one of these fucking
climbs and he started the climb,

2562
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,061
got like,

2563
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:32,361
you know,

2564
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:34,550
x amount of feet up and
realize you forgot his powder.

2565
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,571
So you know,

2566
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:35,781
they,

2567
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:38,240
they put that powder to keep
their fingers are slipping.

2568
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,420
I don't even lift weights
without fucking powder.

2569
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:41,871
You know,

2570
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:43,550
I don't even do kettle
bells without this shit.

2571
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:46,940
This guy's climbing 5,000 or so.

2572
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:47,431
I'm a homeowner,

2573
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:49,490
so how many fucking fee to
be it will be is right here.

2574
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,061
Like look at that.

2575
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,650
And that's an incredible,

2576
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:52,790
he's insane.

2577
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,890
But he did it without fucking powder.

2578
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,910
God halfway up ran into some
other climbers who couldn't
believe he didn't have

2579
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,744
any ropes.

2580
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:00,081
They'll like,

2581
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:00,700
you're just climbing.

2582
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,370
They gave him a powder bag and then he
finished the rest of the climb and then

2583
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:06,050
left the powder bag at the top for them.

2584
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:06,790
I love the public,

2585
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:07,910
a heart monitor on him.

2586
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,040
If you know something
that would like show,

2587
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:10,320
you know,

2588
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,850
what's his heart rate at when he does
this and it's probably something like

2589
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:14,960
disgustingly low.

2590
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,270
Yeah,

2591
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,811
but he says he,

2592
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,420
it says it's really mellow.

2593
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:17,841
He says,

2594
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:19,400
if your heart gets,

2595
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:19,600
if,

2596
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,500
if there's a moment where
your heart's racing,

2597
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:22,880
you're probably fucked.

2598
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:24,500
Like you probably made a really,

2599
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:24,921
really,

2600
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,540
really terrible mistake,

2601
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:28,340
but you're,

2602
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:28,611
you know,

2603
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:31,190
your point is that there's
guys that are like that.

2604
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:31,470
I mean,

2605
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:33,920
what is more dangerous is
fighting more dangerous and that,

2606
01:10:33,921 --> 01:10:38,420
well it depends right now fighting's
more dangerous until he falls,

2607
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:40,280
then that's way more far more.

2608
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,420
But there's going to be,

2609
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:41,930
there's,

2610
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,640
there's people that have,

2611
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:48,740
the reason why we have human
beings in 2015 is because there's,

2612
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:53,600
there's a genetic predisposition
that some folks have to taking risks,

2613
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:54,980
exploring new lands,

2614
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,000
getting in boats,

2615
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,200
going across the,

2616
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:59,570
the ocean fighting and battles,

2617
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,410
conquering new new environments.

2618
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:02,910
I mean,

2619
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,640
this a part of being a human.

2620
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:09,790
There's a drive that some people have
and it sort of speaks to this idea that

2621
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,090
everyone has a role in this
crazy dance that is life.

2622
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,060
And without each one of us,

2623
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,230
it would never work.

2624
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:20,041
And that all of us,

2625
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,030
somehow or another,

2626
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:26,150
are integrated as this one gigantic
super organism and we're moving humanity

2627
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:27,990
towards some ultimate goal.

2628
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,970
But without these risk takers,

2629
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:30,930
without warriors,

2630
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:34,540
without people that are willing to
climb fucking rocks and all that,

2631
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,390
it's a part of who we are.

2632
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,261
Absolute.

2633
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:38,094
And you can't,

2634
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:38,281
you know,

2635
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:41,100
I've heard people say like mixed
martial arts should be illegal.

2636
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:41,521
I'm like,

2637
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:41,790
Whoa,

2638
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,031
Whoa,

2639
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:42,864
stop,

2640
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,321
stop.

2641
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:44,470
You can't nerf the fucking world.

2642
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:45,304
You're going to die no matter what.

2643
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:45,820
Yeah,

2644
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:46,840
if you don't get head kicked,

2645
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:47,830
you're still going to die.

2646
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:48,971
Absolutely.

2647
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:49,571
And you know,

2648
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:49,781
there,

2649
01:11:49,781 --> 01:11:50,614
there's,

2650
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,480
there's a lot of mitigating factors,

2651
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:53,620
but the end of the day,

2652
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:53,921
you know,

2653
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:56,530
every fighter chooses to do this,

2654
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,720
it's on them to do it.

2655
01:11:58,721 --> 01:11:59,001
And,

2656
01:11:59,001 --> 01:11:59,980
and you know,

2657
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:00,670
Gosh,

2658
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:02,320
football is way worse.

2659
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:02,891
You know,

2660
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:04,930
I called one season of college football.

2661
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,020
There were two games where I saw guys,

2662
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,380
you know,

2663
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,820
Tibias break in half in one game.

2664
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:15,120
The Amaanah headshots you take if you're
a defense or offensive linemen in those

2665
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:15,880
games.

2666
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,250
When I played football with Gi,

2667
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:21,250
graduated from the Naval Academy and Oh
three we didn't have anybody checking if

2668
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:22,450
we had any concussions.

2669
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,340
I was,

2670
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:23,970
they've,

2671
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:28,450
since then they have a band
having a wedge on kickoff return.

2672
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,880
I was the wedge breaker on kickoff team.

2673
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:34,780
So I would take a couple of a Phaedra
and I would sprint all the way down field

2674
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,140
and I'd run rate into four dudes sitting
right next to each other from Notre

2675
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:38,380
Dame.

2676
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,120
I don't stand a chance against these guys.

2677
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:42,790
I just got to be a sacrificial
lamb to bust this thing up.

2678
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,510
Right.

2679
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,170
You know,

2680
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:46,330
I have no idea if I've got
a concussion doing that.

2681
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,010
I know it didn't feel good.

2682
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:48,490
What?

2683
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,000
What?

2684
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,230
How does the federal help?

2685
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,370
I,

2686
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:51,791
who knows?

2687
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:52,930
It gets your heartbeat and real fast.

2688
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:54,190
We thought it's just placebo.

2689
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:54,481
Oh,

2690
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:56,020
a federal is like a stimulant.

2691
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:56,411
Yeah.

2692
01:12:56,411 --> 01:12:57,071
Remember they dal,

2693
01:12:57,071 --> 01:12:58,360
it's like a ton of caffeine,

2694
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:58,750
right?

2695
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,860
They banded shortly.

2696
01:12:59,861 --> 01:13:01,240
If we couldn't even use it anymore,

2697
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:02,560
I think my senior year was banned.

2698
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:03,161
It was tooken out.

2699
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:03,710
All supplements.

2700
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:04,900
So jujitsu class wants.

2701
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:08,520
After I took a couple of rip fuels and
I almost had a fucking heart attack.

2702
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:09,070
Do you remember that?

2703
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:09,980
I remember riff fuels,

2704
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:13,600
that shit used to be literally used to
be able to go to GNC and buy crank it.

2705
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:14,890
You can get it like sands,

2706
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:15,843
Sam's club.

2707
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,230
It was fucking crank.

2708
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,083
I mean it was,

2709
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,120
your heart would be and you feel like
you could fucking run through a wall.

2710
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:23,740
It was so retarded

2711
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:26,840
that that stuff was
completely legal is a very,

2712
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:29,390
very bizarre thing that,

2713
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,720
I mean if you look at the 2003 when
you're talking about when you're playing

2714
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:33,350
football,

2715
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:36,830
you look at that and you
look at the reality of today.

2716
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,120
Well what are you showing me here,

2717
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:38,770
Jamie?

2718
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,180
Oh No,

2719
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,230
I didn't see it.

2720
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:43,450
You didn't tell him you're
going to show me anything.

2721
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:44,360
He's got the straw.

2722
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:45,120
Oh my God,

2723
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,470
you just flew through the air
and that'll ruin your day.

2724
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,670
Oh Dude,

2725
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,953
they're going to look at them.

2726
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:51,620
Yeah.

2727
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,210
Paleo

2728
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,580
and then it collapses
and everybody cheers.

2729
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,690
And back then,

2730
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,700
I mean there was no protocol.

2731
01:13:58,701 --> 01:13:59,520
It's like when I played,

2732
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,900
I played six years of Pop Warner football
and one of the drills we do for our

2733
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:05,730
tackling drills two times a week,

2734
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:07,230
we'd line up the whole team in one line,

2735
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,070
the first guy to get the ball,

2736
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,630
get to run through each guy individually.

2737
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,351
One on one,

2738
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:10,990
just run,

2739
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,823
hit Ron.

2740
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:12,440
Hey

2741
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,410
run hop Warner's little kids.

2742
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,970
We've got a bunch of dads are just
guys from the neighborhood that Vaughn,

2743
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,540
I mean they don't know
anything about football.

2744
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:20,374
I don't know anything.

2745
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,180
It's been an incredible that human
beings have been around for thousands and

2746
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:25,720
thousands and thousands of years.

2747
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:30,520
And it was 2003 that's
only 12 fucking years ago.

2748
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,210
Nobody knew that you were
getting concussions all the time.

2749
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:35,080
And this could be bad.

2750
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:35,680
Oh yeah.

2751
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,210
That doesn't seem to make any sense.

2752
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:37,990
Does it doesn't.

2753
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:38,321
But you know,

2754
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:38,861
it's funny,

2755
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,570
I mean it opens up a whole other door.

2756
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,590
We are still so prime

2757
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,200
for as advanced as we are technologically.

2758
01:14:45,201 --> 01:14:49,370
When you look at what's taking
place in the world right now and,

2759
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,130
and how easy it still is
for people that take lives.

2760
01:14:53,131 --> 01:14:53,291
You know,

2761
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,730
I've seen studies on chimpanzees with aid,

2762
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:57,740
they have murderer with
chimps and things like that.

2763
01:14:57,741 --> 01:15:01,190
And so some scientists will argue
that it's kind of predetermined in our

2764
01:15:01,191 --> 01:15:02,930
genetics and in our DNA that,

2765
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:03,411
you know,

2766
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:04,131
we're aggressive,

2767
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:05,030
we're going to do things like this.

2768
01:15:05,031 --> 01:15:09,810
But I mean there's still a lot of primal
qualities that we have in humanity.

2769
01:15:09,811 --> 01:15:09,951
I mean,

2770
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:13,020
you look at what took place
in France today when I'm so,

2771
01:15:13,021 --> 01:15:14,810
so in France,

2772
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,310
three guys who,

2773
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,680
who are expected to be
Muslim because they were,

2774
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,540
they were chanting Muslim
chants and they went in,

2775
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:25,910
they did an attack on a French
magazine that does frequent cartoons,

2776
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:27,643
um,

2777
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,071
you know,

2778
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:29,780
basically making fun
of the Muslim religion.

2779
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,580
And so these guys attacked at separate
everybody and executed I believe nine

2780
01:15:34,581 --> 01:15:34,941
people.

2781
01:15:34,941 --> 01:15:37,460
And then on the way out til
killed two more police officers.

2782
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:37,990
And,

2783
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,260
and these three men,

2784
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,861
you know,

2785
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:40,051
they,

2786
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:40,261
they,

2787
01:15:40,261 --> 01:15:40,871
they think they,

2788
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:42,440
they haven't released a
lot of information on them,

2789
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:44,570
but they went in there like
they were trained military.

2790
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:46,280
It didn't look like your average,

2791
01:15:46,281 --> 01:15:46,461
you know,

2792
01:15:46,461 --> 01:15:48,410
typical terrorist who
got recruited online,

2793
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,060
found a gun and wit and shoot somebody.

2794
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:50,691
It wasn't the,

2795
01:15:50,691 --> 01:15:51,020
uh,

2796
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,750
the two brothers who made
a pot bomb up in Boston.

2797
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:55,130
These dudes knew what they were doing.

2798
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,090
Um,

2799
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:56,271
you know,

2800
01:15:56,271 --> 01:15:56,470
and,

2801
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,720
and,

2802
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:56,961
and,

2803
01:15:56,961 --> 01:15:59,090
and it's huge news to couple with that.

2804
01:15:59,091 --> 01:15:59,301
You know,

2805
01:15:59,301 --> 01:16:00,230
it's getting less news.

2806
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,031
I think there was a,

2807
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:04,520
a suicide bomb in Yemen
that killed 30 people.

2808
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,900
This is incredible.

2809
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,040
[inaudible] parachuting.

2810
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,270
Suspects are still at large,

2811
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,260
two of them are still at large,

2812
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,100
and this was all over making
fun of a fucking religion.

2813
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,090
That's incredible,

2814
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:15,411
man.

2815
01:16:15,411 --> 01:16:15,531
They,

2816
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:15,711
they,

2817
01:16:15,711 --> 01:16:16,191
in fact,

2818
01:16:16,191 --> 01:16:16,511
one of them,

2819
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,600
I think they showed one of the,

2820
01:16:17,601 --> 01:16:20,460
one of the cartoons and the
main cartoonists day day,

2821
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,800
they knew her by name.

2822
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:24,230
They knew people by name separate
and they made sure she was killed.

2823
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,280
Um,

2824
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,350
but she even did one on Mohamed.

2825
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,633
Okay.

2826
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,660
And so what a crazy religion where
you can't even draw their guy.

2827
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:33,381
I mean,

2828
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:33,861
you could,

2829
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:34,460
you could have,

2830
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:34,701
I mean,

2831
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:36,560
Sam Kinison who used to be a preacher,

2832
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,030
had Jesus Christ,

2833
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:40,610
jokes about him getting
nailed to the cross.

2834
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:41,361
I mean,

2835
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:43,880
he had jokes about Jesus Christ,

2836
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:46,100
about his wife,

2837
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:46,400
you know,

2838
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,850
saying he's a loser and you're
hanging out with the 12 apostles,

2839
01:16:49,851 --> 01:16:50,481
they're losers.

2840
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:51,320
You're friends are losers.

2841
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:53,720
He mocked,

2842
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,670
openly mocked this religion that,

2843
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,070
you know,

2844
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,250
he used to be a part of no repercussions.

2845
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,520
You draw Muhammad just
drawn and you're fucking,

2846
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,151
you know,

2847
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:04,880
your suspect or you're a
subject to this kind of shit.

2848
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,740
It's incredible.

2849
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:06,201
It's,

2850
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:07,034
uh,

2851
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,080
you know,

2852
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,340
it,

2853
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,440
it never in my life,

2854
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,510
and obviously I haven't been everywhere,

2855
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:13,070
so I'm pretty well traveled.

2856
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,481
I've just,

2857
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:17,990
I've never been anywhere like my
time in the Middle East where,

2858
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:19,700
where I've seen not everybody,

2859
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:23,390
but certain people value
human life so little,

2860
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:24,613
so little.

2861
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,000
And it's a really hard thing to comprehend
when you're there and you try with a

2862
01:17:29,001 --> 01:17:31,250
language barrier to understand it more.

2863
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,980
And the only thing I was
able to conclude was that,

2864
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:34,760
you know,

2865
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,760
this certain population
has been so accustomed to
violence for so many centuries

2866
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,200
that uh,

2867
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,790
their endurance for it is so much
greater than Western civilization.

2868
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:47,300
And,

2869
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,081
and that is,

2870
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:51,590
that is part of the problem with us
getting involved in conflicts over there

2871
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:52,401
where look,

2872
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:52,880
you know,

2873
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,880
they're going to replenish their forces
every time someone turns 16 they're

2874
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:58,160
going to join the ranks
or whatever age it may be.

2875
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,211
Whereas,

2876
01:17:59,211 --> 01:17:59,541
you know,

2877
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,374
here,

2878
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,070
um,

2879
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,240
we're not able to do that,

2880
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:02,661
you know,

2881
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:02,791
are,

2882
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:02,931
are,

2883
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:03,201
you know,

2884
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:06,920
in order to be a son who had a great point
or to be successful military campaign

2885
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:07,551
need three things.

2886
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:08,151
You need the people,

2887
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:11,030
you need the government and you
need the military without all three

2888
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:11,751
synchronized,

2889
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:12,890
you will not be successful.

2890
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:13,671
If you lose one of them,

2891
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:14,504
it's out.

2892
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,070
And you could see Vietnam,

2893
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,120
you could see Iraq.

2894
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,860
When the people get disgusted,

2895
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:21,890
then it becomes a problem and it's
going to pull back the government.

2896
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:22,340
And then you know,

2897
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,570
the military is going to pull back.

2898
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,060
And really you're going
to see us get outlasted.

2899
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:26,211
Now.

2900
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:28,520
I'm not making the argument
that we belonged and you know,

2901
01:18:28,521 --> 01:18:30,110
that's a whole other bag
of worms we can get there.

2902
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:31,460
But you know,

2903
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:32,571
over there,

2904
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,120
they know we're setting dates
for when we're going to withdraw.

2905
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:35,331
I mean,

2906
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:38,990
they're just so much more
use to violence that,

2907
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:39,651
that not,

2908
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:40,880
and I shouldn't generalize everybody,

2909
01:18:40,881 --> 01:18:41,051
but,

2910
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:42,060
but the,

2911
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:42,943
the,

2912
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:43,581
the units,

2913
01:18:43,581 --> 01:18:43,760
you know,

2914
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,740
I k al-Qaida Taliban,

2915
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:46,280
uh,

2916
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,310
they're so used to violence that
they can stomach it and they're just,

2917
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,900
it's just the way they've always lived.

2918
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:51,381
Well,

2919
01:18:51,381 --> 01:18:54,710
it's what you were saying about
God's like a beep number Grumet off.

2920
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:58,340
Growing up in Dagestan and growing up
in these really harsh environments,

2921
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:58,760
it,

2922
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,060
they,

2923
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,320
they become tougher.

2924
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:05,321
People were so used to a certain easy
way of life that these folks have this

2925
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:07,940
much more intense,

2926
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:13,120
much more dangerous environment that
they live in and that is normal to them.

2927
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,310
And when people grow up
in certain environments,

2928
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,380
that becomes how they live.

2929
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:19,760
And we're adaptable as hell.

2930
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,051
Well,

2931
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:20,510
yeah,

2932
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:20,751
I mean,

2933
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:21,501
you look at one of them,

2934
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:24,320
one of the most disturbing
when when I try to explain,

2935
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,030
because people will forget,

2936
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,283
um,

2937
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,580
or they'll take for granted,

2938
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:30,650
I should say how evil,

2939
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,550
uh,

2940
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:31,780
or,

2941
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,980
or what kind of evil
does exist in the world.

2942
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:34,150
And,

2943
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:36,410
and people will talk
about Isis and you know,

2944
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:36,591
uh,

2945
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:36,800
you know,

2946
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,790
Ben Affleck made a comment,

2947
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,650
they couldn't even fill
a baseball stadium,

2948
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:39,861
you know,

2949
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:41,540
a Aa be at ball stadium
or something like that.

2950
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:42,374
They're not a threat.

2951
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,210
People will take for granted,

2952
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:44,901
you know,

2953
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:46,670
that the type of evil that
does exist in the world,

2954
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:48,650
and it's not just obviously
in the Muslim culture.

2955
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:49,011
I just,

2956
01:19:49,011 --> 01:19:49,311
you know,

2957
01:19:49,311 --> 01:19:49,911
as an example,

2958
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:50,351
it exists.

2959
01:19:50,351 --> 01:19:53,540
It exists plenty in Africa
as well in certain areas.

2960
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,610
But one video all tell people,

2961
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:55,950
you know,

2962
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:56,570
checkout,

2963
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,770
and it's not for everybody.

2964
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:00,640
But if you look at a video
of the [inaudible] massacre,

2965
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,040
which,

2966
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,650
which happened in
Dagestan where Chechnyan,

2967
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:04,371
uh,

2968
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:09,371
rebels massacred Russian soldiers and
they basically one by one while they're

2969
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:11,341
alive,

2970
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:15,120
behead them where it takes a long
enemy and the video is disgusting.

2971
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,210
I don't recommend anybody here
who's listening this go watch it.

2972
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,420
This is when I get into intense debate
with people that I know are mature enough

2973
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:22,171
to handle it in,

2974
01:20:22,171 --> 01:20:22,760
in,

2975
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,570
or trying to understand certain things.

2976
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,000
I'll recommend you if you want
to understand this a little bit,

2977
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:27,834
take a look at this.

2978
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,130
I mean,

2979
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:33,540
it's hard to watch to understand that
that exists and to imagine that a human

2980
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:36,330
being is capable not
only of doing it once,

2981
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:41,250
but repeatedly and talking casually like
we are right now while they're doing

2982
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:41,371
it.

2983
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:43,800
While someone's squirms on
the ground being decapitated,

2984
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:47,460
that takes something inside
that that is sickening,

2985
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:48,443
that is frightening.

2986
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:50,990
And it exists throughout human history.

2987
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:51,501
It does.

2988
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:53,150
It's a quality that solutely does.

2989
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:56,870
Human beings can tap into and
almost in a way that animals can't,

2990
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:57,941
it's almost in the,

2991
01:20:57,941 --> 01:20:58,101
the,

2992
01:20:58,101 --> 01:20:59,480
the mind has the,

2993
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:04,100
the human mind has this
ability to compartmentalize
and to rationalize and to be

2994
01:21:04,101 --> 01:21:06,770
capable of things that
even animals aren't,

2995
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,200
aren't capable of doing
animals killed to eat.

2996
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:13,040
Or occasionally the intelligent
animals like chimpanzees,

2997
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:13,611
you know,

2998
01:21:13,611 --> 01:21:13,791
they'll,

2999
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:18,791
they'll kill to protect environments or
proper overthrow overthrow the alpha.

3000
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:19,140
Yeah.

3001
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,150
But what these,

3002
01:21:20,151 --> 01:21:20,780
these are,

3003
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,070
this is a different thing.

3004
01:21:22,071 --> 01:21:22,850
I mean this is,

3005
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,680
this is ritualized killing.

3006
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:25,550
This is,

3007
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:29,720
this is killing on a level that
the justification of that is,

3008
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:33,500
is it's hard to comprehend for the
average person that lives in a nice,

3009
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,130
you know,

3010
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,310
community and it goes to the supermarket
and likes to go to a restaurant and

3011
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:38,450
order a glass of wine,

3012
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:39,680
clink glasses.

3013
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:40,670
And this is like,

3014
01:21:40,671 --> 01:21:40,851
well,

3015
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:41,840
I support war.

3016
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,460
You know what war is?

3017
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:44,930
They have no idea.

3018
01:21:44,931 --> 01:21:45,190
Yeah,

3019
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:45,730
no idea.

3020
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:45,981
I mean,

3021
01:21:45,981 --> 01:21:46,814
and it's not just,

3022
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:47,111
you know,

3023
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:49,510
I certainly don't want the people at home
to think we're generalizing the Middle

3024
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:49,511
East.

3025
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:52,360
I mean you can go to Rwanda and
look at what took places or one,

3026
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,030
look what takes place in
Sudan every single day.

3027
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:55,751
You know,

3028
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:57,760
and it's sad cause you
talked about how we're this,

3029
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,271
this,

3030
01:21:58,271 --> 01:21:58,601
this,

3031
01:21:58,601 --> 01:22:02,560
a global race of beings at all
have a place at the table to,

3032
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:03,790
to progress ourselves.

3033
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:06,010
Yet there's still so many things,

3034
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:06,491
you know,

3035
01:22:06,491 --> 01:22:08,800
that show that we are still very primal.

3036
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,271
Well,

3037
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:12,180
there's areas of the world that
just have not caught up yet.

3038
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:16,050
There's areas of the world that give
us a window into the past would,

3039
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:18,840
it must've been like to
live thousands of years ago.

3040
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:23,520
When you hear about all these barbaric
events that happened in human history

3041
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,740
that most people just
like to look at and go,

3042
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:25,921
oh,

3043
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:27,390
those were the dark ages.

3044
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:28,070
This was,

3045
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:28,350
you know,

3046
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,030
back in Gingiss cons day.

3047
01:22:30,031 --> 01:22:30,870
This was backward.

3048
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,540
Alexander the Great was around,

3049
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:32,731
no,

3050
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:32,890
no,

3051
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:33,650
no.

3052
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,820
It's the fucking Congo doesn't 15.

3053
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,590
If you were there right now in,

3054
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:37,831
in,

3055
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:42,450
in one of those areas where warlords or
tearing into villages and machete and

3056
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:43,284
people's to death,

3057
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,890
you would watch exactly what,

3058
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,420
what would have happened
a thousand years ago,

3059
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:49,440
10,000 years ago.

3060
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:49,921
I mean,

3061
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:53,520
the only difference is these people have
clothes that were made in a factory and

3062
01:22:53,521 --> 01:22:56,100
machetes that were made
in a factory and guns.

3063
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:56,400
Yeah.

3064
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,091
Other than that,

3065
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,770
it's human barbarism.

3066
01:22:58,860 --> 01:22:59,693
Absolutely.

3067
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,631
And it's a,

3068
01:23:00,631 --> 01:23:01,080
it's,

3069
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,260
it's very disconcerting for a
lot of people because you know,

3070
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:04,710
you,

3071
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:05,950
when a child,

3072
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,380
especially when I was a kid,

3073
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,750
I'm 47 and when I was,

3074
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:11,540
um,

3075
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,640
I don't know how old I was,

3076
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:15,250
I was probably like nine or something,

3077
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,170
maybe 10 when the Vietnam war ended.

3078
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:18,070
I don't know what,

3079
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,070
but I was living in California
and I remember it was on TV.

3080
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:24,430
It was on the news where America
is pulling out of the Vietnam bar.

3081
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:26,410
And I remember thinking
it was a little kid.

3082
01:23:26,411 --> 01:23:26,531
Well,

3083
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:27,364
this is great.

3084
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,380
Glad we figured out that war is bad
and we're never going to do this again

3085
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:35,050
because everybody really
hates war and we're moving on.

3086
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:40,051
I remember having this idea in my mind
as a child that we are evolving past war

3087
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:43,720
and this is good that I grew up in a day,

3088
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:43,991
you know,

3089
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:44,741
cause I talked to,

3090
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:45,190
uh,

3091
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,150
my Stepdad,

3092
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:46,450
you know,

3093
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,600
he was worried about getting
drafted and never did.

3094
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,060
And there's people in
my neighborhood that,

3095
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:52,450
uh,

3096
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:56,860
had been to Vietnam and I talked to
them about it and everybody was almost

3097
01:23:56,861 --> 01:23:59,980
unanimous that we shouldn't have
been there and the war is bad.

3098
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,180
And then I was a kid.

3099
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:05,740
I was maybe 21 when we went
into the first Gulf War.

3100
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:09,130
And I remember watching on TV
with my roommate and me and my,

3101
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:09,370
uh,

3102
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,210
my friend Jimmy,

3103
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,120
my roommate,

3104
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,471
we were like,

3105
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:12,460
holy fucking shit.

3106
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:13,294
We're doing it again.

3107
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:13,920
Couldn't believe.

3108
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:18,920
But it was that long stretch that
America had not been in like a real quote

3109
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:20,020
unquote war.

3110
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,850
We had gone through some military actions,

3111
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,100
a lot of covert shit,

3112
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,480
a lot of things that weren't
in the news and daily basis.

3113
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:30,720
And so people weren't really aware of how
the world works and how much bloodshed

3114
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:35,110
is required in order to
keep peace in certain areas.

3115
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,210
And then all of a sudden it's on again.

3116
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:37,660
Yeah.

3117
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:38,231
I remember thinking,

3118
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:39,070
I can't believe this.

3119
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:39,440
You know,

3120
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,900
and it's interesting too because you know,

3121
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:41,710
people,

3122
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,810
people don't bring this up off.

3123
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:45,670
And could you imagine
what would happen if,

3124
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:50,110
if our navy was so downsize that
they no longer patrol the waters?

3125
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:50,331
What,

3126
01:24:50,331 --> 01:24:52,060
what would oil prices be like?

3127
01:24:52,061 --> 01:24:56,890
Shipping link is piracy is still a
problem and we ended up doing most of,

3128
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:57,760
or ma,

3129
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,410
we do a lot of policing,

3130
01:24:59,740 --> 01:24:59,981
you know,

3131
01:24:59,981 --> 01:25:01,120
out there in the seas with,

3132
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:02,770
with constant appointments for our navy.

3133
01:25:02,771 --> 01:25:03,970
And uh,

3134
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:04,843
it's,

3135
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:05,861
it's crazy,

3136
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:06,431
but the world,

3137
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:06,641
you know,

3138
01:25:06,641 --> 01:25:06,731
and,

3139
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:06,901
and,

3140
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:07,351
and you know,

3141
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:07,500
as in,

3142
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:07,741
sorry,

3143
01:25:07,741 --> 01:25:08,830
I got into discussion with a,

3144
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:10,480
with a Harvard Law Grad today about it.

3145
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:10,931
You know,

3146
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:11,531
what came first?

3147
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:12,221
The chicken or the egg,

3148
01:25:12,221 --> 01:25:12,730
you know,

3149
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:16,810
had we not gone to them in the Middle
East and interfered with that have

3150
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:19,480
prevented a lot of the terrorist
attacks that we've taken place.

3151
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,110
You know?

3152
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:22,330
And she threw that out there and I said,

3153
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:22,631
well,

3154
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:23,050
you know,

3155
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,520
this attack happened in France.

3156
01:25:24,521 --> 01:25:26,920
How much involvement is France
had in Iraq and Afghanistan?

3157
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:27,971
You know,

3158
01:25:27,971 --> 01:25:31,000
and so it's hard to ever
comprehend at this point,

3159
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:31,291
but there,

3160
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:35,350
there is a lot of violence in the world
and there's a hatred that we can't

3161
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:35,861
comprehend.

3162
01:25:35,861 --> 01:25:39,010
Like the way that the al Qaeda in Iraq,

3163
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:39,910
when I was there,

3164
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,410
hated us.

3165
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:46,360
We in America could never
comprehend that kind of hatred.

3166
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,070
We don't even know what it's like.

3167
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:49,030
I didn't know what it was like.

3168
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:49,661
I couldn't have met.

3169
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:53,890
I mean to the point where you are
willing to not only try to kill me,

3170
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:59,460
but you'll kill innocent children just
to get at me and have no issues doing it.

3171
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:04,700
You'll repeatedly tried to do that.

3172
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:07,970
That what that does to the mind,

3173
01:26:07,971 --> 01:26:08,241
you know,

3174
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:13,040
when people will look at post traumatic
stress and in it the is not meant to,

3175
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:13,341
to,

3176
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:14,450
to handle all of that.

3177
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,070
Especially when it's a young kid.

3178
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:16,670
You know,

3179
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:17,241
who's 18,

3180
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:19,190
19 years old who most likely came from,

3181
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,761
you know,

3182
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:21,230
a pretty poor background.

3183
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:23,720
That's the reason they decided to enlist
in the military during a time of two

3184
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:24,440
wars.

3185
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:24,981
So it,

3186
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:25,814
it's,

3187
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,040
it's an unbelievable debate and discussion
that's going to take place for years

3188
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,530
and we'll never know.

3189
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:33,520
We'll never fully know
because of course there,

3190
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,910
there's so much politics at play
with it as well that clouds the,

3191
01:26:37,911 --> 01:26:41,180
the overall analysis of
what truly takes place.

3192
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:41,811
Um,

3193
01:26:41,811 --> 01:26:41,951
and,

3194
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:42,261
and you know,

3195
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:44,420
that goes into a whole
lot of discussion on how,

3196
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,111
you know,

3197
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:47,270
certain policies are made,

3198
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:47,660
you know,

3199
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,190
based on political timelines,

3200
01:26:49,191 --> 01:26:50,420
vice when they're actually needed.

3201
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:52,570
It's also one of the,

3202
01:26:52,571 --> 01:26:57,571
the true horrors about drones that is
constantly up for debate because drones

3203
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:00,950
are so nonspecific.

3204
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:04,850
There's so many people that have been
killed by drones that were absolutely

3205
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:05,301
innocent.

3206
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:06,440
A lot of them children,

3207
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:07,640
a lot of them women,

3208
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:08,930
a lot of them completely,

3209
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:09,560
you know,

3210
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,560
civilians and that a lot of people
on the other side would say,

3211
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:14,811
well,

3212
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:18,320
what you're talking about these horrific
things they're done by the United

3213
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:18,321
States,

3214
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:22,520
but they're done in this weird way with
a robot that flies in the sky and shoots

3215
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:23,354
missiles.

3216
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:23,750
It's,

3217
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,510
it's sterilized in the sense
that it's not like the,

3218
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:26,841
you know,

3219
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,261
these,

3220
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:27,710
uh,

3221
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,060
these Russians,

3222
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:29,450
you know,

3223
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:33,350
killing Chechnyan rebels or Chechen
rebels killing Russians with a knife.

3224
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:33,730
It's,

3225
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:34,160
it's,

3226
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,420
it's sterilized in,

3227
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:38,570
in the sense that no one has
to get blood on their hands.

3228
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,160
They're you using a remote control.

3229
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:41,120
They're watching a monitor,

3230
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:42,020
the pressing a button,

3231
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:44,330
but the same result that's taking place.

3232
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:45,061
Certainly.

3233
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:45,660
And I mean it,

3234
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:45,841
the,

3235
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:46,830
the end result is,

3236
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:47,151
is,

3237
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:48,320
is human life has been,

3238
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:49,140
has been terminated.

3239
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:49,950
Did you,

3240
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:51,990
when you enlisted and you went over,

3241
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:56,580
was this a part of like sort of the same
drive that lead that lead you to be a

3242
01:27:56,581 --> 01:27:57,180
fighter?

3243
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,670
You know,

3244
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:58,540
I think so.

3245
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:58,841
You know,

3246
01:27:58,841 --> 01:27:59,500
for me,

3247
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,130
I was in high school at the time and
I was getting recruited by a bunch of

3248
01:28:03,131 --> 01:28:06,640
different schools to play football and
I kind of already had a sense that,

3249
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:08,950
that I really would like to
attend a military academy.

3250
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:09,740
But then,

3251
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,050
um,

3252
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:12,670
I also started getting heavily recruited
by a lot of Ivy League schools.

3253
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:14,020
And in my education mattered,

3254
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:16,060
I looked at some of the graduation
rate to some of the other,

3255
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:16,631
you know,

3256
01:28:16,631 --> 01:28:20,230
Division One AA schools recruit me in
a West Virginia and Maryland and the

3257
01:28:20,231 --> 01:28:21,520
graduation rates were low.

3258
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:22,540
And I,

3259
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,051
I knew,

3260
01:28:23,051 --> 01:28:23,261
look,

3261
01:28:23,261 --> 01:28:24,760
I'm not going to go play
professional football.

3262
01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:25,391
I need to go somewhere.

3263
01:28:25,391 --> 01:28:26,410
I'm going to get education.

3264
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,390
And the Naval Academy was free.

3265
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,320
You don't get a full,

3266
01:28:29,321 --> 01:28:31,120
so you don't get a scholarship
to an ivy league school.

3267
01:28:31,121 --> 01:28:32,920
So my mom was a home health nurse,

3268
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,140
isn't gonna be able to
afford to send me to Yale,

3269
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:36,190
even with the financial aid.

3270
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:41,190
So I went to the Naval Academy and also
I've always been a pretty intense guy

3271
01:28:41,921 --> 01:28:44,920
who took things more seriously
maybe than they need to be taken.

3272
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:45,761
And so I thought,

3273
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:45,941
look,

3274
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,700
this is a place I'm going to go and
I'm going to get along with the people

3275
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:49,420
better.

3276
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,550
But when I was there initially
it was time of peace.

3277
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,780
You graduated,

3278
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,600
you either went in the navy or the
Marine Corps and you would deploy,

3279
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:56,470
you'd go on a boat,

3280
01:28:56,471 --> 01:28:58,900
you'd float around a bunch of
cities for six to seven months,

3281
01:28:59,050 --> 01:28:59,920
have a good time,

3282
01:28:59,921 --> 01:29:00,790
then come home,

3283
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,340
then maybe do one more,

3284
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:04,050
then moved to a different duty station.

3285
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:09,051
It wasn't the same when I was a junior
is when nine 11 happened and shit changed

3286
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,380
forever.

3287
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,520
It was never the same.

3288
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,371
And then the,

3289
01:29:12,371 --> 01:29:13,680
the second Iraq war,

3290
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,030
it actually started when I was a senior.

3291
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:17,820
So I had friends that were in the,

3292
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:18,301
you know,

3293
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:21,510
initial wave and the second Iraq
war that I played football with.

3294
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:22,291
Um,

3295
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:22,441
you know,

3296
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,580
before I'd even graduated.

3297
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,300
So you didn't necessarily
sign up to go to war,

3298
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:30,870
you signed up because you felt like those
were people that you would relate to

3299
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:31,440
more.

3300
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:31,860
Yeah.

3301
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,281
But I mean,

3302
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:35,730
at the same time I bought
into the whole package,

3303
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,001
you know,

3304
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:37,320
I wanted to serve my country.

3305
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:37,801
I knew,

3306
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:38,101
look,

3307
01:29:38,101 --> 01:29:38,934
you know,

3308
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,773
um,

3309
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:44,730
inside I felt like I was a warrior at
the time and this is where I belong and

3310
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:45,564
this is where,

3311
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,320
you know,

3312
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:46,990
my,

3313
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:50,460
my leadership skills can be honed and I
can develop and this is where I should

3314
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:51,030
be.

3315
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:52,200
When the war started,

3316
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:52,621
you know,

3317
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:54,510
I could have easily chosen to go,

3318
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:55,471
you know,

3319
01:29:55,471 --> 01:29:58,260
I could have gone surface warfare and
been on a boat and been pretty much away

3320
01:29:58,261 --> 01:29:58,711
from the fight.

3321
01:29:58,711 --> 01:29:58,831
You know,

3322
01:29:58,831 --> 01:30:00,000
I chose to go marine corps,

3323
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:01,320
chose to go infantry,

3324
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,861
you know,

3325
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:04,710
and chose to be there where I
already had friends that were there.

3326
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:04,891
You know,

3327
01:30:04,891 --> 01:30:09,030
there was no way I wasn't going to
be a guy who served at that time.

3328
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,360
What was it that drew
you into doing infantry?

3329
01:30:12,361 --> 01:30:13,194
What was it like?

3330
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:13,620
What,

3331
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,670
when you decided,

3332
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:16,470
when you made that commitment,

3333
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,551
like what was,

3334
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:18,540
what was on your mind?

3335
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,170
You know,

3336
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:20,820
I couldn't see any other choice.

3337
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:21,121
You know,

3338
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:23,580
I would feel guilty had I not,

3339
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:24,121
you know,

3340
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:26,940
before I had ever even gone
infantry officer school,

3341
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,631
um,

3342
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:30,930
Ronnie Winchester who played offensive
tackle first when I was a sophomore,

3343
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,153
he was killed.

3344
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,360
Um,

3345
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,910
and then while I was in
infant officer course,

3346
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:36,750
a guy at graduate,

3347
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:37,561
JP blacksmith,

3348
01:30:37,561 --> 01:30:38,580
he was killed in Fallujah.

3349
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:39,121
So,

3350
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:39,540
I mean,

3351
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:44,130
there was a time period there for several
years where when guys call that we

3352
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:45,060
hadn't heard from in a while,

3353
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:46,320
we almost didn't want
to pick up the phone.

3354
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:47,071
You know,

3355
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:47,260
it was,

3356
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:48,210
it was really,

3357
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:50,100
it was a really difficult time.

3358
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:51,293
Um,

3359
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:51,811
but,

3360
01:30:51,811 --> 01:30:52,500
but that's,

3361
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,190
that's war.

3362
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:53,401
I mean,

3363
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:53,581
it's,

3364
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:54,414
it's ugly.

3365
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:55,050
It's,

3366
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,010
it sucks.

3367
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,291
There's,

3368
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:57,480
there's nothing fun about it.

3369
01:30:57,481 --> 01:30:57,651
And,

3370
01:30:57,651 --> 01:30:57,811
and,

3371
01:30:57,811 --> 01:30:58,644
you know,

3372
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,600
a pet peeve of mine is a lot of
other cultures and even sometimes,

3373
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:03,781
you know,

3374
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:04,614
in our own,

3375
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,530
they make these assumptions about
the men and women that go to war.

3376
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:07,861
You know,

3377
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:11,280
I actually got asked in inline
to a way in when I was in Japan,

3378
01:31:11,281 --> 01:31:13,680
and I'm going to name the fighter
because I don't want to insult anybody.

3379
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,630
He looks at me and says,

3380
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:16,471
while we're waiting,

3381
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:17,304
we're about to go wham.

3382
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:18,241
He's like,

3383
01:31:18,241 --> 01:31:18,870
Brian,

3384
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,560
you know,

3385
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,040
how do you justify going to Iraq and
just killing generations of people?

3386
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:24,931
And I was like,

3387
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:25,290
well,

3388
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:29,070
I think you're a little misinformed
and I'm certainly willing to have that

3389
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:30,030
discussion with you.

3390
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,020
Um,

3391
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,670
but I don't think now's
the appropriate time.

3392
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:32,941
He's like,

3393
01:31:32,941 --> 01:31:33,181
well,

3394
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:33,930
I'm fucking nosy.

3395
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,310
So that's exact quote.

3396
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:36,451
I'm nosy.

3397
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:37,141
So you know,

3398
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:37,420
let's,

3399
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:37,601
uh,

3400
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:38,690
I'm asking about it.

3401
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:40,531
And so,

3402
01:31:40,531 --> 01:31:40,960
you know,

3403
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,401
I mean,

3404
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:42,330
it's the,

3405
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:42,560
the,

3406
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,910
the happiest moments of,

3407
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:45,170
you know,

3408
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:45,811
my specialty,

3409
01:31:45,811 --> 01:31:46,890
my second tour,

3410
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:50,310
there were two schools in our area of
operations that never had school because

3411
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:51,870
if the teachers taught they'd be killed,

3412
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,050
I'll kinda would kill them immediately
if they taught those students.

3413
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,060
And this area had never
been patrolled before.

3414
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:58,050
So we started patrolling.

3415
01:31:58,051 --> 01:32:01,630
We started securing it five
months into our deployment.

3416
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:06,040
We had the areas so secure that these
kids were able to go to school again.

3417
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:08,110
And that was a really proud day.

3418
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:08,950
I mean it wasn't,

3419
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,170
it's not what a lot of people think where,

3420
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:11,800
you know,

3421
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,250
we go over there and all
we want to do is kill,

3422
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:15,491
kill,

3423
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:16,030
kill.

3424
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:20,890
I mean 90% I mean you don't even see
the enemy in these kinds of wars.

3425
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:21,600
It's snipers.

3426
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,433
It's Ibds,

3427
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,160
it's unseen enemies.

3428
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:27,580
You're walking the streets trying to help
these people getting blown up and shot

3429
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:28,150
at,

3430
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:28,511
you know,

3431
01:32:28,511 --> 01:32:30,460
where you came and tell
where it's coming from.

3432
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,930
[inaudible] and most of the
scenarios and really what we found,

3433
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:38,230
because the doctrine for this kind of
war was never written in the military had

3434
01:32:38,231 --> 01:32:42,160
to adapt to it and we had to create
this new counterinsurgency warfare.

3435
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:43,570
The key was the people,

3436
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:45,850
whoever owned the trust of the people,

3437
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,650
one the conflict because the people,

3438
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:51,520
if they trusted you would then give you
the Intel necessary to find out where

3439
01:32:51,521 --> 01:32:54,190
I'll kite is coming in from
and who they're influencing,

3440
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:54,971
who they're using,

3441
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:56,650
their who their informants are,

3442
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,471
how to catch them,

3443
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:58,570
what time you can catch him,

3444
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,010
and that was the main factor.

3445
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,780
By month six over there,

3446
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:05,110
we were literally getting names and full
descriptions of who was coming in and

3447
01:33:05,111 --> 01:33:06,910
we had snatched up 30 guys in a month.

3448
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:07,571
You know,

3449
01:33:07,571 --> 01:33:10,960
it was because the people at that
point trusted us and believed,

3450
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:11,081
hey,

3451
01:33:11,081 --> 01:33:11,720
you know what,

3452
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,000
the,

3453
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,191
the,

3454
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:13,210
these guys are helping us.

3455
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,710
They're injecting money into our economy,

3456
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:16,030
helping us reopen the shops.

3457
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:18,310
They're securing the school
so the kids can go to school.

3458
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:19,780
They're helping to clean up the garbage.

3459
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,220
They're really here to help.

3460
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:22,810
And that's what made
the biggest difference.

3461
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,820
It was more shaking
hands than it ever was,

3462
01:33:24,821 --> 01:33:25,654
pulling triggers,

3463
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,940
yet I can't tell you how many comments,

3464
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:28,511
you know,

3465
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:29,800
the biggest hatred all received,

3466
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:33,280
both social media and even just
in the fight world in general,

3467
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:34,700
from mostly foreign culture,

3468
01:33:34,701 --> 01:33:35,341
sometimes even ours.

3469
01:33:35,341 --> 01:33:37,420
And America is all get called a murderer.

3470
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,081
And look,

3471
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:38,590
I don't,

3472
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,240
I don't take it personally
because I know the truth.

3473
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:41,290
Obviously I'm secure in that,

3474
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,050
but there's a lot of
misinformation out there.

3475
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,181
That's,

3476
01:33:45,181 --> 01:33:45,810
um,

3477
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:48,540
that's the main representation,

3478
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:49,400
um,

3479
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:49,850
of,

3480
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:53,190
of people that go to war
is that you're over there.

3481
01:33:53,191 --> 01:33:54,600
You're invading this country.

3482
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,500
You never hear that you're,

3483
01:33:57,501 --> 01:34:01,200
you're getting the support of the
people and that that's how you win those

3484
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:01,770
fights.

3485
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,030
That's how you win those battles.

3486
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:03,370
You,

3487
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:06,000
you always hear like we're
invading in this country.

3488
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,380
They don't want us there.

3489
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:09,990
You're dealing with a Muslim country.

3490
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,540
But even in these is consciousness.

3491
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:12,870
These Islamic countries,

3492
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:18,050
these people that practice the Islamic
religion are still against these radical

3493
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:22,950
fundamentalist people that are throwing
acid in the face of the children that

3494
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:26,880
are trying to go to school and trying
to keep women from driving cars and all

3495
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:28,830
the crazy shit that we keep hearing about.

3496
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:33,630
So how much conflict is there
like inter religion conflict?

3497
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:35,910
I mean it seems like it must be,

3498
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:40,800
it must be very difficult for these
people in this as Islamic country to take

3499
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:43,770
trust in these soldiers
that come over from America.

3500
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:45,540
Oh absolutely.

3501
01:34:45,541 --> 01:34:48,120
Especially when you first get there
and you go to an area that's never been

3502
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:48,954
patrol before,

3503
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:49,621
you know,

3504
01:34:49,621 --> 01:34:49,741
in,

3505
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:50,574
in any,

3506
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:51,030
you know,

3507
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:52,710
any screw up that takes place.

3508
01:34:52,711 --> 01:34:52,951
You know,

3509
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:53,221
if,

3510
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:53,850
if,

3511
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:54,331
if,

3512
01:34:54,331 --> 01:34:55,164
uh,

3513
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:58,550
if something happens and
there is collateral damage,

3514
01:34:58,551 --> 01:35:00,140
if there you do get into a firefight,

3515
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:03,500
the enemy only attacks you when
you're surrounded by civilians.

3516
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:05,720
And so if something bad does happen,

3517
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:06,890
it will set you back.

3518
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:07,611
Weeks,

3519
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:10,580
months could even be
years in the conflict.

3520
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,930
And so,

3521
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:16,850
and that goes against the maybe the 350
positive things that that took place at

3522
01:35:16,851 --> 01:35:17,570
that time.

3523
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,370
But there were a lot of people,

3524
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,091
at least,

3525
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:20,271
you know,

3526
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:23,360
I can speak from my perspective and the
two area of operations I operate in,

3527
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:25,970
there are a lot of people
that wanted us to be there.

3528
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:29,480
There were a lot of people
that had smartphones in a
lot of people that saw how

3529
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:31,280
people live in other civilizations.

3530
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,800
And we're fed up with
having corrupt governments,

3531
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:34,521
you know,

3532
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:34,731
that,

3533
01:35:34,731 --> 01:35:38,180
that word that we're basically taking
from them at all times and using them as

3534
01:35:38,181 --> 01:35:40,880
pawns and they wanted to
live that kind of life.

3535
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:44,750
And they get angry when these extremist
groups set back their religion.

3536
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,181
And,

3537
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:46,610
and even just their culture,

3538
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,971
you know,

3539
01:35:46,971 --> 01:35:48,860
when you see something like
what happened in Paris,

3540
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,261
you know,

3541
01:35:49,261 --> 01:35:50,094
we talked about that,

3542
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,890
that's going to bring
back everybody saying,

3543
01:35:51,891 --> 01:35:52,071
Hey,

3544
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:52,790
you know,

3545
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,271
uh,

3546
01:35:53,271 --> 01:35:56,600
the entire Islam religion
is completely evil.

3547
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:56,931
You know,

3548
01:35:56,931 --> 01:35:59,400
you're going to get bill Maher out
there saying it again and again.

3549
01:35:59,401 --> 01:36:00,230
And again,

3550
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:03,950
there are people in the Muslim
religion that don't believe like that.

3551
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:06,170
They don't believe in that
and they're not extremist,

3552
01:36:06,171 --> 01:36:06,770
but it's,

3553
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:07,400
it's this,

3554
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,220
it's this horrible conflict that
we're dealing with right now.

3555
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,240
Um,

3556
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,480
and like so many others were not
capable of having good open discussion.

3557
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,510
You get someone who believes in this
ideology all the way at the far end of the

3558
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:18,140
table.

3559
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,940
Then you get the other
person who believes is here.

3560
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,020
And for some reason,

3561
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:22,640
both of them think they're 100% right,

3562
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:24,710
which is absolute insanity.

3563
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:25,491
I mean,

3564
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:27,680
what argument have you ever
been in where you're 100% right?

3565
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,151
Yeah.

3566
01:36:28,151 --> 01:36:28,451
Well,

3567
01:36:28,451 --> 01:36:31,330
especially when it comes
to something like religion,

3568
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:31,710
you know,

3569
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:34,960
and the Islamic religion in general,

3570
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:38,800
it's such as such an old
religion and it's got so many,

3571
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,800
when you look at so many interpretations.

3572
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:42,430
Yeah.

3573
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:43,263
The look at,

3574
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:44,141
you look at the,

3575
01:36:44,141 --> 01:36:44,381
the,

3576
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:49,381
the Koran and you look at all the
various things that people fight for and

3577
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:50,860
people that believe,

3578
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:51,420
you know,

3579
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:52,570
just our doctrine.

3580
01:36:52,571 --> 01:36:52,940
Like,

3581
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,500
you know,

3582
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:53,800
the,

3583
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,540
the way women are supposed to be treated,

3584
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:57,310
the way gays are supposed to be treated,

3585
01:36:57,630 --> 01:36:58,750
that all those things.

3586
01:36:59,130 --> 01:36:59,381
I mean,

3587
01:36:59,381 --> 01:36:59,561
you're,

3588
01:36:59,561 --> 01:37:02,530
you're talking about some shit that's
been around for thousands of years and

3589
01:37:02,531 --> 01:37:02,641
it's,

3590
01:37:02,641 --> 01:37:05,710
it's so hard to move past that stuff.

3591
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,030
It's so hard when,

3592
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:10,270
when that's ingrained in a culture and
people are fighting for it and willing to

3593
01:37:10,271 --> 01:37:11,920
die for it as is,

3594
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:15,280
it's so difficult to re restructure that.

3595
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:15,601
Oh,

3596
01:37:15,601 --> 01:37:15,991
absolutely.

3597
01:37:15,991 --> 01:37:16,680
Absolutely.

3598
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,790
And yet we still,

3599
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:18,181
you know,

3600
01:37:18,181 --> 01:37:19,260
we continue to try,

3601
01:37:19,261 --> 01:37:19,411
it's,

3602
01:37:19,411 --> 01:37:21,540
it's interesting when you look
at history like of Afghanistan,

3603
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:22,120
so,

3604
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,580
but we only try when
there's resources there.

3605
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:24,791
Oh.

3606
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:26,020
So it's really fucked up.

3607
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:26,470
I mean we're,

3608
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:27,303
we really only,

3609
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:30,700
we really only get concerned about
people's wellbeing when we can make some

3610
01:37:30,701 --> 01:37:31,340
money out of this

3611
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:32,060
situation there.

3612
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,060
There's gotta be,

3613
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:33,360
yeah,

3614
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:33,880
exactly.

3615
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,930
There's gotta be some kind
of political agenda involved,

3616
01:37:36,931 --> 01:37:37,764
which is,

3617
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:38,161
you know,

3618
01:37:38,161 --> 01:37:40,170
it's one of the more
frustrating as you see.

3619
01:37:40,171 --> 01:37:40,561
Yeah.

3620
01:37:40,561 --> 01:37:40,951
One more.

3621
01:37:40,951 --> 01:37:43,740
One of the more frustrating things you
see in American politics where I just rip

3622
01:37:43,741 --> 01:37:44,520
my hair out.

3623
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,330
If we found a fucking gigantic
plot of oil under North Korea,

3624
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:49,770
thanks for give very juicy.

3625
01:37:49,771 --> 01:37:50,604
Very quickly.

3626
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:54,420
If we found out like tomorrow that this
fucking hundred trillion dollars with an

3627
01:37:54,421 --> 01:37:55,254
oil in north,

3628
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,640
this is a very particularly unusually
rich mine of oil and be like,

3629
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:00,750
Oh shit,

3630
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,580
we did cut off their fucking Internet.

3631
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,320
We'd cut off their electricity.

3632
01:38:04,321 --> 01:38:08,430
I mean shit would get crazy really
quickly if they found out that all the

3633
01:38:08,431 --> 01:38:09,264
worlds,

3634
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:09,931
you know,

3635
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:11,430
resource supplies,

3636
01:38:11,431 --> 01:38:11,641
you know,

3637
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:12,960
as far as like natural gas,

3638
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:13,470
oil,

3639
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:14,640
whatever the fuck we need was,

3640
01:38:14,641 --> 01:38:15,660
it was in North Korea.

3641
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:16,260
We could,

3642
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,670
the whole world could live fine.

3643
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:18,680
We'd be there.

3644
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:18,950
Well,

3645
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:19,161
you know,

3646
01:38:19,161 --> 01:38:21,650
and one of the other things though too
is that we get the double edge sword

3647
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,390
where if we don't go,

3648
01:38:23,450 --> 01:38:24,830
we're criticized when we go,

3649
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:25,700
we're criticized.

3650
01:38:25,701 --> 01:38:26,331
So I mean we're,

3651
01:38:26,331 --> 01:38:26,740
you know,

3652
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:27,573
it's,

3653
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,861
you know,

3654
01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:27,981
there,

3655
01:38:27,981 --> 01:38:31,370
there's always a lot more detailed and
we're not privy to all the Intel reports.

3656
01:38:31,371 --> 01:38:31,521
You know,

3657
01:38:31,521 --> 01:38:32,121
when people,

3658
01:38:32,121 --> 01:38:35,450
like when the Syrian rebellion
started and people asked,

3659
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:35,691
you know,

3660
01:38:35,691 --> 01:38:36,140
hey,

3661
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,310
should we go into Syria?

3662
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:38,690
Should we supply them with weapons?

3663
01:38:38,691 --> 01:38:39,680
What should we do?

3664
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:40,341
You know,

3665
01:38:40,341 --> 01:38:43,370
we're basing our assumptions
off what the media tells us,

3666
01:38:43,371 --> 01:38:46,370
which there's so much bullshit
wrapped up in that as well.

3667
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:50,180
We're not privy to all the Intel that
people in the Pentagon or getting.

3668
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:50,871
Um,

3669
01:38:50,871 --> 01:38:53,660
so it's really hard for us to
speculate on what we should do.

3670
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:54,494
But in the end,

3671
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:57,740
we ended up arming a
whole lot of people and,

3672
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,253
uh,

3673
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:02,480
at least a decent sized portion of
those people ended up being isis,

3674
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:03,381
you know,

3675
01:39:03,381 --> 01:39:04,540
which it's,

3676
01:39:04,541 --> 01:39:04,841
it's a,

3677
01:39:04,841 --> 01:39:05,220
it's,

3678
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,500
it's crazy at the level,

3679
01:39:06,501 --> 01:39:07,040
you know,

3680
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,570
where's the accountability in that?

3681
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:08,911
Well,

3682
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:10,340
it's almost like the,

3683
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,510
you know what you're
saying is like that the,

3684
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:16,980
the average person is not privy to the
information that the Pentagon is getting,

3685
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:18,750
but the Pentagon is not,

3686
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,351
they're not.

3687
01:39:19,351 --> 01:39:20,340
They're like,

3688
01:39:20,341 --> 01:39:25,290
don't you really have to be there to get
like hands on information and who the

3689
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:29,490
fuck can do that other than the people
that are directly interacting with them

3690
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,400
and they're not dictating
policy and what are they doing?

3691
01:39:32,401 --> 01:39:32,491
Well,

3692
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:33,090
but they're there.

3693
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,320
They're feeding information,

3694
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:35,280
feeding information,

3695
01:39:35,281 --> 01:39:36,360
they're following orders,

3696
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:37,410
they're fighting battles.

3697
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:38,490
And you know,

3698
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:41,400
ultimately you got two people
that are against each other.

3699
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:43,110
They don't speak the
same fucking language.

3700
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:43,531
You're,

3701
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:44,820
you're in a country that,

3702
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:45,181
you know,

3703
01:39:45,181 --> 01:39:48,390
ideally we shouldn't be in
the first place and you know,

3704
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:49,560
people are trying to kill everybody.

3705
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:52,980
The whole thing is fucking crazy and t
to be able to try to make sense out of

3706
01:39:52,981 --> 01:39:53,580
that.

3707
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:58,230
The only thing that gives me any hope
whatsoever is the idea that over time,

3708
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:01,560
logic and reason and
education will work out.

3709
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:03,780
And as long as we're on
the right side of all that,

3710
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:06,490
that with all the blunders
and the mistakes and all the,

3711
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,120
the,

3712
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:07,560
the,

3713
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:07,950
the,

3714
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:08,521
the,

3715
01:40:08,521 --> 01:40:13,521
the friendly fire and all the civilian
casualties that are unfortunate that over

3716
01:40:14,371 --> 01:40:15,001
time,

3717
01:40:15,001 --> 01:40:18,210
logic and reason will
settle all these issues.

3718
01:40:18,211 --> 01:40:21,810
But that doesn't say Shit Shit like
that happening today in France.

3719
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,700
It doesn't seem like that's the case.

3720
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:27,720
It seems like we're going to go birth
to grave and live in this fucking crazy

3721
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:29,690
world of bombs and bullets and,

3722
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:30,870
and then we're going to,

3723
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:32,590
we're going to end and the,

3724
01:40:32,591 --> 01:40:32,641
the,

3725
01:40:32,641 --> 01:40:33,720
our generation,

3726
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:36,840
the next generation is going to have
to fucking pick up and carry the ball.

3727
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:37,160
Yeah.

3728
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,570
And it's going to fuel the argument of,

3729
01:40:38,571 --> 01:40:38,751
Hey,

3730
01:40:38,751 --> 01:40:39,051
look,

3731
01:40:39,051 --> 01:40:39,411
you know,

3732
01:40:39,411 --> 01:40:39,520
and,

3733
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,360
and of course me having gone to Iraq,

3734
01:40:41,361 --> 01:40:41,800
I would,

3735
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,060
you know,

3736
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:42,160
I,

3737
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,440
I would love to believe that whether
we should have been there or not,

3738
01:40:45,441 --> 01:40:48,920
at least going kept the
violence there on us.

3739
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:50,090
Who signed up for it.

3740
01:40:50,091 --> 01:40:50,811
Feiss you know,

3741
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:51,281
here on,

3742
01:40:51,281 --> 01:40:51,620
on,

3743
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:51,831
on,

3744
01:40:51,831 --> 01:40:52,590
on our land,

3745
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:53,590
etc. You know,

3746
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,130
you

3747
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,420
like to hope that's true because you,

3748
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:57,850
you've had so many friends
that you've lost doing it.

3749
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,631
But,

3750
01:40:58,631 --> 01:40:58,841
uh,

3751
01:40:58,841 --> 01:40:59,141
you know,

3752
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:00,760
when you see things like
what happened in Paris,

3753
01:41:00,761 --> 01:41:01,720
that's going to feel the argument of,

3754
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:02,410
well,

3755
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:02,711
you know,

3756
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:06,460
we have to be in these
countries to control these
things because they hate us so

3757
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:09,340
much that they're willing
to go to extremes that,

3758
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:10,174
that we're not,

3759
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:10,810
you know,

3760
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:11,411
Isis,

3761
01:41:11,411 --> 01:41:12,011
Taliban,

3762
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:12,844
al Qaeda,

3763
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:15,460
they're never going to stop
hating Western civilization.

3764
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:17,020
They're never going to stop attacking us.

3765
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,190
Um,

3766
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:18,581
you know,

3767
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:18,880
uh,

3768
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,481
Palestine,

3769
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:21,160
Israel never going to
stop going back and forth,

3770
01:41:21,161 --> 01:41:23,380
which is one of the reasons they hate
us anyways because of our support of

3771
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:24,214
Israel as well.

3772
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:28,030
It is such a complex scenario that,

3773
01:41:28,031 --> 01:41:28,241
I mean,

3774
01:41:28,241 --> 01:41:28,401
you,

3775
01:41:28,401 --> 01:41:32,260
you could discuss it with
scholars for hours and hours,

3776
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,010
um,

3777
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,980
and you wonder when we're going to find
a better way to solve these problems.

3778
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:36,550
Yeah.

3779
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:36,741
If,

3780
01:41:36,741 --> 01:41:37,574
if ever,

3781
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:38,411
and you know,

3782
01:41:38,411 --> 01:41:42,310
every time something looks cool like
him Momar Kadafi getting killed me watch

3783
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:45,910
that crazy footage of those
guys sticking knives up as,

3784
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,380
you know,

3785
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:47,961
killing them.

3786
01:41:47,961 --> 01:41:48,311
And you're like,

3787
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:48,521
well,

3788
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:49,630
they got rid of that asshole.

3789
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:51,730
Libby has way more fucked up now.

3790
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,593
Who's running it?

3791
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:53,540
We spent,

3792
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,220
you know,

3793
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:54,550
that's,

3794
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:55,091
that's one,

3795
01:41:55,091 --> 01:41:55,240
uh,

3796
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:55,751
one of my,

3797
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:56,051
I mean,

3798
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:57,460
we spend a lot of money,

3799
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:58,630
a lot of money on some,

3800
01:41:58,631 --> 01:41:58,871
you know,

3801
01:41:58,871 --> 01:42:01,210
and on some really stupid stuff too.

3802
01:42:01,211 --> 01:42:01,601
I don't know if he,

3803
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:02,950
if he had a chance to take a look at,

3804
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:03,784
um,

3805
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,631
uh,

3806
01:42:04,631 --> 01:42:06,060
what rand Paul was posting.

3807
01:42:06,061 --> 01:42:08,350
He was airing some grievances and
he was talking about millions.

3808
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:09,184
We expend to like,

3809
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:09,791
you know,

3810
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,290
monitor monkeys throwing,

3811
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:11,770
I don't know,

3812
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:12,790
throwing feces.

3813
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:13,031
I mean,

3814
01:42:13,031 --> 01:42:15,730
we're weird things that we actually
legitimately did spend money on,

3815
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:16,870
which is just out of this world.

3816
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,620
But we spent a lot of money on what
we did in Libya and we have no,

3817
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,000
does this administration,

3818
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:23,860
do they have any idea
who's in control of that?

3819
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,230
We did something similar in Egypt too.

3820
01:42:26,231 --> 01:42:26,531
I mean,

3821
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:27,190
it's just the,

3822
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:27,401
the,

3823
01:42:27,401 --> 01:42:27,731
the,

3824
01:42:27,731 --> 01:42:30,070
the accountability and the dollar spent,

3825
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,293
you know,

3826
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,830
it's very frustrating.

3827
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:33,551
Yeah.

3828
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:34,870
And incredibly frustrating.

3829
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:36,220
And it's also,

3830
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:41,610
it's hard for people that are in
America who live this life of privilege.

3831
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:47,530
And this easy first world
civilization that we have.

3832
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:51,340
It's hard for us to even understand that
there's these things going on in these

3833
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:52,360
other countries.

3834
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,010
We see it on television,

3835
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:55,690
we read about it in the news,

3836
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,790
but to actually witness it,

3837
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:58,091
it's,

3838
01:42:58,091 --> 01:43:00,580
it's so difficult for us to,

3839
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:04,090
to even comprehend war you.

3840
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:05,050
You've been there,

3841
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:05,621
you,

3842
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:06,071
you,

3843
01:43:06,071 --> 01:43:08,440
you've taken part in
and you've been there,

3844
01:43:08,441 --> 01:43:10,000
you've been boots on the ground,

3845
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:11,050
you've experienced it,

3846
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:11,980
you've lost friends.

3847
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:13,420
Your perspective,

3848
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,850
it must be so difficult to communicate
with someone who has this idealistic

3849
01:43:18,851 --> 01:43:20,500
point of view where they've,

3850
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:24,010
they're completely insulated from the
reality of what a war actually is.

3851
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:24,361
It's,

3852
01:43:24,361 --> 01:43:25,390
it's very hard.

3853
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:26,201
It's very hard.

3854
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,310
And at the same time,

3855
01:43:27,311 --> 01:43:29,530
you have to fight against your own,

3856
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:32,740
your own bias because
when you do go to war,

3857
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,580
um,

3858
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:36,370
of course you want to believe that you
were there for all the right reasons.

3859
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:36,701
You know,

3860
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:38,680
you don't want to believe
in conspiracy theories,

3861
01:43:38,681 --> 01:43:39,514
et cetera.

3862
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,330
Um,

3863
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:40,780
and it's,

3864
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,531
it's hard to do.

3865
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:42,890
It's hard to read all the,

3866
01:43:42,891 --> 01:43:43,181
you know,

3867
01:43:43,181 --> 01:43:43,391
hey,

3868
01:43:43,391 --> 01:43:44,860
now we're seeing lessons learned,

3869
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:45,940
you know,

3870
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:48,090
was the Iraq war complete waste?

3871
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:48,581
And you know,

3872
01:43:48,581 --> 01:43:48,821
when you,

3873
01:43:48,821 --> 01:43:50,640
when you saw as we've withdrawed in,

3874
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:51,980
in what's place in

3875
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,510
Iraq to,

3876
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:56,530
to people like me and
in all my friends and,

3877
01:43:56,531 --> 01:43:56,691
and,

3878
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:56,951
and,

3879
01:43:56,951 --> 01:43:57,471
and you know,

3880
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:59,900
my generation of military
that have gone over there.

3881
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:04,901
And that's heartbreaking to see it begin
to collapse and violence spiked to the

3882
01:44:05,721 --> 01:44:06,810
levels that have,

3883
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:09,860
that have started since
isis has been born.

3884
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:10,641
And again,

3885
01:44:10,641 --> 01:44:11,061
the argument,

3886
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:11,181
well,

3887
01:44:11,181 --> 01:44:13,610
if we never went over in the first
place in Isis would never been born,

3888
01:44:13,611 --> 01:44:15,230
but have we never left prematurely,

3889
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,580
they probably wouldn't
have been born either.

3890
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:20,930
There's so many ways you can go with
it and everybody wants to be right.

3891
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:21,831
You know,

3892
01:44:21,831 --> 01:44:25,320
I don't think anybody truly has all the
information to say exactly what would

3893
01:44:25,321 --> 01:44:26,180
have been the right decision,

3894
01:44:26,181 --> 01:44:28,130
but it's all just really,

3895
01:44:28,131 --> 01:44:28,851
really sad.

3896
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:28,981
And,

3897
01:44:28,981 --> 01:44:29,814
and we,

3898
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:32,900
we elect people to make
these decisions for us.

3899
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,430
And you know,

3900
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:35,293
I,

3901
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:38,060
I can't say that I feel comfortable
with all those people in there.

3902
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:38,271
You know,

3903
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:43,271
I feel like the private sector is
much more accountable today than the

3904
01:44:44,991 --> 01:44:45,824
government sector.

3905
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:46,161
I mean,

3906
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:47,870
it's easy to get fire
in the private sector.

3907
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:50,100
You either deliver towards
the bottom line or you don't,

3908
01:44:50,101 --> 01:44:52,460
and you go away in the public sector,

3909
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:56,120
you can do all kinds of stuff
and still get reelected.

3910
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:56,910
Yeah.

3911
01:44:56,910 --> 01:44:57,241
I mean,

3912
01:44:57,241 --> 01:45:01,950
Marion Barry came back as the mayor of
Washington DC after he got caught smoking

3913
01:45:01,951 --> 01:45:02,311
crack,

3914
01:45:02,311 --> 01:45:03,270
he came back and won.

3915
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,760
That's an extreme example obviously,

3916
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:06,690
but the,

3917
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:09,900
the shit that goes on behind the
scenes that we don't know about,

3918
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,510
and then you compare it
to what we do know about,

3919
01:45:12,511 --> 01:45:13,800
you've got a guy like Dick Cheney,

3920
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:16,480
who was the CEO of Halliburton accompany,

3921
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:21,060
that's they make their money off
of rebuilding shit that he blew up.

3922
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:24,060
And then he gets into office and
he's the fucking vice president.

3923
01:45:24,061 --> 01:45:28,710
And also we're blowing
shit up and Halliburton is
getting these huge fucking no

3924
01:45:28,711 --> 01:45:29,700
bid contracts.

3925
01:45:29,701 --> 01:45:30,390
There's no,

3926
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:31,830
no one competing against them.

3927
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:35,250
And they're making billions
of dollars rebuilding.

3928
01:45:35,251 --> 01:45:37,290
And if you talk to the people that
are involved in the rebuilding,

3929
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:37,561
they're like,

3930
01:45:37,561 --> 01:45:38,040
look,

3931
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:42,080
we're just putting fucking water treatment
plants and factories in place that we

3932
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:42,480
don't even,

3933
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,231
they don't even need,

3934
01:45:43,231 --> 01:45:44,280
they're not even gonna use,

3935
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:45,930
but we have the contracts to do them.

3936
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:46,700
So we're building this

3937
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:48,520
so we could submit it and we can get paid.

3938
01:45:48,521 --> 01:45:49,480
So we get smitten invoice.

3939
01:45:49,481 --> 01:45:49,910
Yet it's,

3940
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:50,743
it's,

3941
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:52,180
it's sad and look,

3942
01:45:52,181 --> 01:45:52,451
you know,

3943
01:45:52,451 --> 01:45:55,600
people love to point at
America at our corruption,

3944
01:45:55,601 --> 01:45:56,321
but you know,

3945
01:45:56,321 --> 01:45:56,980
we talked about him.

3946
01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:57,430
I mean,

3947
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:59,620
there's corruption at every single level.

3948
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:00,130
Me,

3949
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:00,841
every single click,

3950
01:46:00,841 --> 01:46:01,360
you know,

3951
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,440
when you put money and power on the
line does something to a human being,

3952
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:07,380
especially power.

3953
01:46:07,381 --> 01:46:07,621
I mean,

3954
01:46:07,621 --> 01:46:11,370
that's my argument when all this police
brutality shit's going on in everybody's

3955
01:46:11,371 --> 01:46:11,551
like,

3956
01:46:11,551 --> 01:46:11,791
hey,

3957
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:11,941
you know,

3958
01:46:11,941 --> 01:46:13,110
the police need to be accountable.

3959
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,410
Yes,

3960
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:14,640
they've,

3961
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,510
they absolutely do.

3962
01:46:15,511 --> 01:46:16,950
Here's part of the problem.

3963
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:19,770
I don't think anybody is
fucking qualified to be a cop.

3964
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:22,110
I think when you're a cop for 2030 years,

3965
01:46:22,111 --> 01:46:25,630
you're dodging bullets and every fucking
door you opened up every domestic

3966
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:26,431
dispute.

3967
01:46:26,431 --> 01:46:30,060
Some chick might stab you in the neck
for arresting her husband that beat the

3968
01:46:30,061 --> 01:46:30,990
shit out of her.

3969
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:31,560
I mean,

3970
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,450
people are fucking crazy.

3971
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,140
You're dealing with worst case
scenario almost every day.

3972
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:39,030
And I think we,

3973
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,100
we want cops to be better at their job.

3974
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:42,510
We don't want cops to kill people,

3975
01:46:42,511 --> 01:46:47,250
but I really don't know how many people
are qualified for that fucking job.

3976
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:48,930
I don't know how many people can do it.

3977
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:49,980
And it's not like we

3978
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,330
get the same caliber person that goes
on to be a doctor that ends up being and

3979
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,720
going to be a police officer.

3980
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:55,520
It's a very different,

3981
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:56,341
it's like you said,

3982
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:57,930
it's a very difficult job,

3983
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:00,360
but they're human and we are,

3984
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:01,470
we are flawed.

3985
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,041
I mean we are,

3986
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:04,350
we are all completely flawed and it's uh,

3987
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:04,891
yeah,

3988
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:05,341
I mean that,

3989
01:47:05,341 --> 01:47:06,174
that's,

3990
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,610
that's been a frustrating thing,

3991
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:09,271
you know,

3992
01:47:09,271 --> 01:47:11,910
in this country where we see this
argument and in that goes back to what I

3993
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:12,750
talked about before.

3994
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,790
Depending on what news station you go on,

3995
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:17,520
you get one side completely over here.

3996
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:21,150
Then you get the other side completely
over there and nobody willing to really

3997
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:25,860
discuss this middle area cause both
sides make really good points in certain

3998
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:26,460
areas,

3999
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,930
but nobody wants to discuss the weight.

4000
01:47:27,931 --> 01:47:28,764
Hey guys,

4001
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,190
there is a possibility that both of
you guys are right in certain areas and

4002
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:33,750
maybe if we can come to terms on this,

4003
01:47:33,751 --> 01:47:34,920
we could actually fix the problem.

4004
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,990
I really felt that with Ferguson,

4005
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:37,951
with Ferguson,

4006
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:41,160
I felt like God damn everybody's
digging their line in the sand.

4007
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:46,161
And there's people on one side that think
that the j the killing was unjustified

4008
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:51,390
and that the cop should have
been tried and should go to jail.

4009
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:55,140
But they're unwilling to look at the
fact that that guy robbed a fucking

4010
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:58,530
convenience store moments
before he was shot.

4011
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,200
That guy definitely tried
to get the gun from the cop.

4012
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:02,150
I mean he had,

4013
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:02,650
uh,

4014
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:02,930
he,

4015
01:48:02,930 --> 01:48:06,240
he was shot in his fucking
hand that he was trying,

4016
01:48:06,241 --> 01:48:09,360
it was a close range in this
cop's car and they're like,

4017
01:48:09,361 --> 01:48:10,021
look at its face.

4018
01:48:10,021 --> 01:48:11,100
The cop was barely hit.

4019
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,750
Now you know as well as,

4020
01:48:12,751 --> 01:48:16,510
I know you could go through a fucking
five round fight and look like you were

4021
01:48:16,511 --> 01:48:17,520
not barely hit.

4022
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:18,150
Meanwhile,

4023
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:22,770
you're getting rocked like sometimes
swelling takes hours to show up.

4024
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:24,230
Sometimes people don't do,

4025
01:48:24,231 --> 01:48:25,140
they don't swell.

4026
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:27,990
Sometimes you get caught
clean and there's no mark on.

4027
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:30,210
You get knocked out
cold and you look fine.

4028
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:34,020
Like this idea that he should have a
fucking hatchet wound in his forehead

4029
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:34,590
before he,

4030
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:36,300
he's pulling the trigger on this kid.

4031
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:39,660
Then you look at the other side that says,

4032
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:40,200
well,

4033
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,180
these are terrible people and the,

4034
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:42,481
you know,

4035
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:44,910
he should have been shot
because he was a bad person.

4036
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,390
Okay,

4037
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:47,700
what would you be like if you
grew up in that and absolutely.

4038
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,220
What would you be like if you were
that kid and that fucking impoverished

4039
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:51,720
neighborhood with no hope?

4040
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:53,730
Everyone around you is doing drugs.

4041
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:55,440
Everyone around you is involved in crime.

4042
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:57,360
That's the real fucking problem.

4043
01:48:57,361 --> 01:49:01,230
The real problem is you're wasting the
potential of this young human being

4044
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:05,970
because he's being forced to develop
in this horrible situation that nobody

4045
01:49:05,971 --> 01:49:09,660
seems to have any incentive
to go in and try to fix.

4046
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:13,890
Nobody is talking about going into these
neighborhoods and trying to clean them

4047
01:49:13,891 --> 01:49:18,480
up and using massive federal resources
and money to try to try to calm these

4048
01:49:18,481 --> 01:49:22,350
fucking places down and try to
give these people some hope.

4049
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,060
Then there's both sides.

4050
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:24,241
Oh,

4051
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:24,721
absolutely.

4052
01:49:24,721 --> 01:49:26,260
Digging their heels in the sand.

4053
01:49:26,261 --> 01:49:26,331
Right.

4054
01:49:26,331 --> 01:49:26,590
And we

4055
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:29,590
asked these police officers
to do an awfully tough job.

4056
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:29,831
You know,

4057
01:49:29,831 --> 01:49:30,061
they,

4058
01:49:30,061 --> 01:49:30,610
they don't,

4059
01:49:30,610 --> 01:49:33,580
they're not going to get credit for all
the everyday right things they're going

4060
01:49:33,581 --> 01:49:33,851
to do,

4061
01:49:33,851 --> 01:49:34,600
but when,

4062
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,660
when it hits the fan and they got
to make the really tough decision,

4063
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,090
we scrutinize the living hell out of Oh,

4064
01:49:40,091 --> 01:49:40,540
for sure.

4065
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:41,710
And it becomes very difficult,

4066
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:43,000
but I couldn't agree more.

4067
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,200
Um,

4068
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:44,770
you know,

4069
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:45,603
there's,

4070
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:46,421
Gosh,

4071
01:49:46,421 --> 01:49:46,581
I,

4072
01:49:46,581 --> 01:49:48,280
I to say that I hate

4073
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,870
both political parties equally.

4074
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:50,860
Um,

4075
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:51,191
you know,

4076
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:51,921
just because of the,

4077
01:49:51,921 --> 01:49:52,041
the,

4078
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:52,271
the,

4079
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:53,440
the lack of integrity.

4080
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:57,340
I tend in a lot of areas to lean
more towards the conservative side,

4081
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:58,780
but then there's some areas where,

4082
01:49:58,980 --> 01:49:59,200
you know,

4083
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,090
I've got completely liberal views as well.

4084
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:02,223
Um,

4085
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,820
but on this one,

4086
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,211
you know,

4087
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:05,260
when you really look,

4088
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:05,861
and I've had these,

4089
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:07,300
these great conversations with,

4090
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:09,130
with kids who did grow up
in neighborhoods like this,

4091
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:12,100
and you try and have these discussions
and you look at it and you look at it,

4092
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,980
the one thing that you can look at to say,

4093
01:50:14,981 --> 01:50:15,610
you know,

4094
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:17,860
at least one thing that
can be the equalizers.

4095
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:18,694
Education.

4096
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,960
You know where I live in,

4097
01:50:19,961 --> 01:50:20,771
I live in a suburb,

4098
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:24,850
north Atlanta and in the school districts
by where I live are the best in the

4099
01:50:24,851 --> 01:50:25,684
state.

4100
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:26,111
Now,

4101
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:30,220
if I had to send my kids
to a South Fulton County,

4102
01:50:30,221 --> 01:50:33,490
which is in south Atlanta to
one of those public schools,

4103
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:35,080
there's no way in hell
it's on my daughter's here.

4104
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:36,183
No Way.

4105
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,330
Both public schools,

4106
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,490
both funded by taxes,

4107
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:43,540
but the difference is completely different
than the one fucked one is a platinum

4108
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:44,374
level school.

4109
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,820
And the other one isn't.

4110
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:46,301
I mean,

4111
01:50:46,301 --> 01:50:47,740
d minus level school.

4112
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:52,210
And so these kids don't have a choice
to which parents they're born or which

4113
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:53,320
household they're born into.

4114
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:54,161
Our forced,

4115
01:50:54,161 --> 01:50:54,431
if they,

4116
01:50:54,431 --> 01:50:54,821
if they,

4117
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:58,690
if they already have parents that were
caught in a poverty cycle that don't have

4118
01:50:58,691 --> 01:51:00,820
a whole lot of education and
perspectives to their home,

4119
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:01,690
life isn't great,

4120
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,540
then they go to a school
that's not so great and,

4121
01:51:04,770 --> 01:51:06,020
and then you've got the,

4122
01:51:06,021 --> 01:51:08,910
the criminal justice system that
can continually just recycles.

4123
01:51:08,911 --> 01:51:09,151
And we,

4124
01:51:09,151 --> 01:51:09,640
we,

4125
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,401
we put them in jail,

4126
01:51:10,401 --> 01:51:10,501
ain't,

4127
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:11,334
I mean it's,

4128
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:14,620
it's a situation where the
odds are not in their favor.

4129
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:15,640
And if there's one,

4130
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:15,790
you know,

4131
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:18,670
if there's two things that in this
country that we should have with all the

4132
01:51:18,671 --> 01:51:20,620
money we have and that we send overseas,

4133
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:23,700
I mean one of them should
definitely be platinum schools are,

4134
01:51:23,701 --> 01:51:25,180
our schools should be phenomenal.

4135
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:25,601
You know,

4136
01:51:25,601 --> 01:51:26,830
you've got this tenure thing,

4137
01:51:26,831 --> 01:51:29,200
which makes it really hard
to fire a bad teacher.

4138
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:29,861
You know,

4139
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:34,840
the whole system needs to be reformed
badly because education could be that

4140
01:51:34,841 --> 01:51:38,350
great equalizer regardless
of what ethnicity you are.

4141
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:41,230
And when you find out how
much teachers get paid.

4142
01:51:41,231 --> 01:51:41,740
I mean,

4143
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:43,750
I know UFC fighters complain about pay.

4144
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:46,000
Find out how much a
fucking teacher gets paid.

4145
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,200
Jesus Christ,

4146
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:49,090
they're making a teacher
salary in one night.

4147
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:49,570
It's,

4148
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:50,560
but I mean,

4149
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:51,970
obviously you can't compare the two,

4150
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:52,380
but you,

4151
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:52,710
you,

4152
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:53,543
you,

4153
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,910
you have to look at the,

4154
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:59,911
just the sheer ridiculousness of teacher
salaries and the idea that this is,

4155
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:04,990
these are the people that are supposed
to literally teach our children the

4156
01:52:04,991 --> 01:52:08,080
skills they need to get
through life successfully.

4157
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:09,141
And we're,

4158
01:52:09,141 --> 01:52:10,720
we're giving them no incentive.

4159
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:11,111
We're,

4160
01:52:11,111 --> 01:52:16,060
we're asking them to do it almost
against their best interest financially.

4161
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:16,780
We're almost like,

4162
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:16,991
look,

4163
01:52:16,991 --> 01:52:17,824
I know you're smart.

4164
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:19,630
I know you have all this education.

4165
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:23,230
I know he could probably make a lot of
money going and working for some company

4166
01:52:23,231 --> 01:52:24,370
that's very profitable.

4167
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:25,750
But you know,

4168
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:26,860
you want to be a teacher,

4169
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:27,211
guess what?

4170
01:52:27,211 --> 01:52:29,440
You're going to make 35
grand a year and you know,

4171
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:29,860
you're gonna,

4172
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:32,590
you're gonna have months off and you know,

4173
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:33,520
while you're in school,

4174
01:52:33,521 --> 01:52:33,821
you know,

4175
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:36,610
you're going to fucking deal with
the dregs of society's children.

4176
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:41,850
People that you know have all sorts of
criminal pasts and all sorts of drug

4177
01:52:41,981 --> 01:52:43,960
problems and violence.

4178
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:46,370
These kids are gonna grow up with
violence and you're going to be forced to

4179
01:52:46,371 --> 01:52:48,950
corral them and try to
wrangle them in class.

4180
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:53,600
I mean I've seen videos of of teachers
getting assaulted in classes where you

4181
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:53,841
know,

4182
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:54,231
uh,

4183
01:52:54,231 --> 01:52:57,200
there was some video or some
girl jumped up of receipt,

4184
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:59,930
started beating the shit out of this
teacher and then he just started fighting

4185
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:03,260
back and then other kids jumped a
teacher and it just fucking chaos.

4186
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:06,440
Imagine you're doing this for 35 grand
a year or whatever the fuck they're

4187
01:53:06,441 --> 01:53:07,274
getting paid.

4188
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:07,660
My,

4189
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:08,451
my older sister,

4190
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:09,440
she was a teacher for years.

4191
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:11,990
She left because that reason she
wasn't getting paid very much.

4192
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:14,600
And then anytime that she
had a problem with a student,

4193
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,520
if the parent got involved,

4194
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:19,730
the administration would normally take
the side of the parent and the student

4195
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:21,900
and she wasn't allowed to,

4196
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:26,480
to actually teach and discipline a child
who is putting up their own barriers to

4197
01:53:26,481 --> 01:53:27,171
their education.

4198
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:29,690
It became very frustrating for
you and you're dealing with,

4199
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:29,960
you know,

4200
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:30,950
you deal with a kid,

4201
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:32,690
get a kid that's 16 years old,

4202
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:35,480
16 years of conditioning,

4203
01:53:35,481 --> 01:53:36,311
of life,

4204
01:53:36,311 --> 01:53:40,310
of experiences and all the stuff
that they're getting from their home.

4205
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:40,940
I mean,

4206
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,020
you can only guess,

4207
01:53:42,021 --> 01:53:43,400
you can only guess as to what,

4208
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:45,740
what their background is like it's her.

4209
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:48,410
It's really horrific and a
lot of ways that we have.

4210
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:54,670
The one thing that is just so important
is human beings like the developing

4211
01:53:55,821 --> 01:53:56,451
human beings.

4212
01:53:56,451 --> 01:53:57,260
Maybe if you want it,

4213
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:57,921
I've always said this,

4214
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:00,410
if you want to have a
culture with less losers,

4215
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:03,920
like wouldn't that be like the
best way to keep America strong,

4216
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:05,600
develop less losers?

4217
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:05,961
Well,

4218
01:54:05,961 --> 01:54:07,130
where do you develop less losers?

4219
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:08,540
You fucking go with children.

4220
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,210
You try to figure out what's the
best way to develop children.

4221
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:15,320
And it's one of the least the areas where
we put the least amount of resources

4222
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:15,950
in this country.

4223
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:16,581
And when you look at,

4224
01:54:16,581 --> 01:54:16,760
I mean,

4225
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:19,760
what is it less than 50%
of people pay their taxes?

4226
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:21,140
Is that true at the,

4227
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,140
it's somewhere around that.

4228
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,300
Look up that stat.

4229
01:54:23,301 --> 01:54:24,050
If he can,

4230
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:28,250
but I mean there there's a big percentage
of people that don't pay their taxes

4231
01:54:28,251 --> 01:54:29,780
and so you get a lot
of people to complain.

4232
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:30,883
You know,

4233
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:33,440
guys like I don't even want
to know what you pay in taxes.

4234
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:36,830
I know I pay a lot in taxes and it sucks
every time you get to write that check,

4235
01:54:36,831 --> 01:54:38,600
you're paying a ton in taxes.

4236
01:54:38,601 --> 01:54:43,100
But imagine what it's like if
you got a lot of people that,

4237
01:54:43,101 --> 01:54:48,101
that vice living off the government are
now providing for themselves and paying

4238
01:54:48,201 --> 01:54:49,760
taxes and you know,

4239
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:50,660
it's what you said,

4240
01:54:50,661 --> 01:54:50,871
you know,

4241
01:54:50,871 --> 01:54:53,240
having a country with
less losers and it really,

4242
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:54,680
the key is education.

4243
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,341
Yeah.

4244
01:54:55,341 --> 01:54:57,110
I don't get the,

4245
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:01,520
I know there's a lot of people that have
a gigantic issue when you look it up,

4246
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:04,640
a lot of people have a
gigantic issue with taxes.

4247
01:55:04,641 --> 01:55:04,941
And uh,

4248
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:05,111
my,

4249
01:55:05,111 --> 01:55:05,420
my,

4250
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,700
my issue is waste and fraud.

4251
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:10,040
My issue is bureaucracy.

4252
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:14,280
My issue is the amount of people that
have jobs and only exist because the,

4253
01:55:14,281 --> 01:55:14,501
the,

4254
01:55:14,501 --> 01:55:14,601
the,

4255
01:55:14,601 --> 01:55:18,500
the government is trying to create jobs
for these people because this is sort of

4256
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:20,030
some way to feed into the economy.

4257
01:55:20,031 --> 01:55:20,361
And this is,

4258
01:55:20,361 --> 01:55:22,460
this is a bunch of
unnecessary fucking jobs.

4259
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:26,090
There's a bunch of laws that shouldn't
exist as a bunch of people reinforcing

4260
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:30,470
those ridiculous jobs and the reinforcing
those ridiculous laws and that becomes

4261
01:55:30,471 --> 01:55:30,831
a job.

4262
01:55:30,831 --> 01:55:31,850
It becomes an industry.

4263
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:32,151
I mean,

4264
01:55:32,151 --> 01:55:33,980
the war on drugs is a
perfect example of that.

4265
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:39,130
And I think that if we could figure out
a way to utilize taxes in some sort of

4266
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:44,070
an efficient and equitable

4267
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,850
way,

4268
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:46,260
I'm all for paying taxes.

4269
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:46,441
I mean,

4270
01:55:46,441 --> 01:55:47,400
I pay him anyway.

4271
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:49,110
You're not going to not do it.

4272
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:50,160
You're not going to jail.

4273
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:51,900
I'm not Wesley Snipes in it.

4274
01:55:51,901 --> 01:55:54,680
And just trying to avoid
taxes and they leave,

4275
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:58,050
walked up Lauren Hill from the fucking
food Fujis like she's some sort of a

4276
01:55:58,051 --> 01:55:58,884
threat to the,

4277
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:00,960
the general piece of our culture.

4278
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:01,530
And it's,

4279
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:01,801
you know,

4280
01:56:01,801 --> 01:56:02,160
and it's,

4281
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,900
it's 26% is that what it says?

4282
01:56:03,901 --> 01:56:08,901
46% of American households
won't pay federal income
taxes in 2008 that was 2011.

4283
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:10,190
It's probably even higher now still.

4284
01:56:10,191 --> 01:56:10,420
Yeah,

4285
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:11,210
it's still pretty high.

4286
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:11,480
But it,

4287
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:11,761
you know,

4288
01:56:11,761 --> 01:56:13,050
it's interesting you say that because,

4289
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,273
um,

4290
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:14,551
you know,

4291
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:14,731
when,

4292
01:56:14,731 --> 01:56:14,951
when,

4293
01:56:14,951 --> 01:56:15,750
when you look at,

4294
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:16,411
at lockup,

4295
01:56:16,411 --> 01:56:21,030
so there's 50 new crime
laws on average made a year,

4296
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,300
which is about a total of 4,500 laws,

4297
01:56:24,301 --> 01:56:27,690
which is 2,700 pages of criminal laws.

4298
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:33,110
And then over 50% of the jail population
are over drugs for nonviolent crimes.

4299
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:37,773
God,

4300
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,341
you know,

4301
01:56:38,341 --> 01:56:38,941
we've got,

4302
01:56:38,941 --> 01:56:39,391
in America,

4303
01:56:39,391 --> 01:56:41,220
we've got 5% of the world's population,

4304
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:45,690
25% though of the world's prisoners
are in American and incredible.

4305
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:49,260
And in 53% of the people that go to
jail or beneath the poverty line,

4306
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:57,080
53% are below the poverty line as if you
expect people that are just scratching

4307
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,670
by to follow the rules.

4308
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:00,121
But I mean,

4309
01:57:00,121 --> 01:57:01,020
how do you fix that?

4310
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:01,800
I mean,

4311
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,491
if you look at what,

4312
01:57:02,491 --> 01:57:02,881
you know,

4313
01:57:02,881 --> 01:57:04,500
when you look at Brazil for instance,

4314
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:04,861
where the,

4315
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:05,160
the,

4316
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:05,670
the,

4317
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:09,660
we think that there's a gap between
the haves and have nots in America.

4318
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,030
It's enormous in Brazil.

4319
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:13,350
It is enormous.

4320
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:16,590
And it's funny because
when you human beings,

4321
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:17,790
we have ingenuity.

4322
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,580
I mean it's like you talk about
we have a drive for discovery,

4323
01:57:20,581 --> 01:57:21,870
we will find a way.

4324
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,161
And when you,

4325
01:57:23,161 --> 01:57:25,530
when you have that poverty
trap in certain areas,

4326
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,680
they're going to find a way in,

4327
01:57:26,681 --> 01:57:26,801
in,

4328
01:57:26,801 --> 01:57:28,190
in Brazil and some of those novellas,

4329
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:32,340
they found a black market
illegal way of sustaining life.

4330
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:32,840
And,

4331
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:33,121
and,

4332
01:57:33,121 --> 01:57:35,040
and it's very difficult there.

4333
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:35,701
I mean,

4334
01:57:35,701 --> 01:57:37,230
were these favelas in the hills?

4335
01:57:37,231 --> 01:57:39,930
I mean those police don't have a
whole lot of control over those.

4336
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:40,410
Yeah.

4337
01:57:40,410 --> 01:57:41,280
If any at all.

4338
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:42,101
Yeah.

4339
01:57:42,101 --> 01:57:46,240
The favelas is a very fascinating
situation where you've got this group of

4340
01:57:46,241 --> 01:57:50,650
people above the people that have money
and the people that are in these places

4341
01:57:50,651 --> 01:57:53,830
with this incredible view are
the people that are really poor.

4342
01:57:54,010 --> 01:57:54,480
I mean,

4343
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,320
it's the opposite of
how it is in California.

4344
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:00,740
The Hollywood hills where all the rich
folks live and down on the bottoms were

4345
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:01,070
the,

4346
01:58:01,070 --> 01:58:02,200
the regular folks live.

4347
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:04,090
The people that can afford
to live in the hills,

4348
01:58:04,091 --> 01:58:07,300
they get that incredible view that
people that are down on the ground,

4349
01:58:07,570 --> 01:58:08,860
those are the people that a man,

4350
01:58:08,861 --> 01:58:11,860
I'd love to live up in
those hills and the hills.

4351
01:58:11,861 --> 01:58:13,000
It's really kind of crazy.

4352
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,781
Just wedged in,

4353
01:58:13,781 --> 01:58:13,991
I mean,

4354
01:58:13,991 --> 01:58:16,240
stacked boxes on top of one another with,

4355
01:58:16,241 --> 01:58:18,190
with just a horrible standard of living.

4356
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:19,024
But uh,

4357
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:19,481
yeah,

4358
01:58:19,481 --> 01:58:23,540
it makes it really difficult when you
look at our criminal justice system and

4359
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:23,711
in,

4360
01:58:23,711 --> 01:58:24,850
in some of those things you talked about.

4361
01:58:24,851 --> 01:58:26,190
But one of the things that,

4362
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:29,380
that I look at too is where you
get these career politicians that,

4363
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:30,081
you know,

4364
01:58:30,081 --> 01:58:30,411
yeah,

4365
01:58:30,411 --> 01:58:32,030
they've got experienced
balancing a budget,

4366
01:58:32,031 --> 01:58:33,530
but they've got a staff
that kind of looks at it.

4367
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:34,431
You know,

4368
01:58:34,431 --> 01:58:36,320
my experience coming from the military,

4369
01:58:36,321 --> 01:58:39,950
then over to the private sector in
seeing the accountability there.

4370
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:40,820
You know,

4371
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:43,510
if a CFO of a publicly traded company,

4372
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:47,950
you are scrutinized to the
t on every expenditure,

4373
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:50,020
what that's gonna do to your stock price.

4374
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,390
These are men and women that are very,

4375
01:58:52,391 --> 01:58:57,391
very capable of going into Washington DC
in leaning out some of the problems we

4376
01:58:58,121 --> 01:58:58,960
have there.

4377
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,400
They're very capable of doing that,

4378
01:59:00,401 --> 01:59:02,400
but of course they don't
want to give up all their,

4379
01:59:02,401 --> 01:59:03,250
their freedoms.

4380
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:06,250
They don't want to get paid 170 k year
because they're making a heck of a lot

4381
01:59:06,251 --> 01:59:06,971
more than that with this,

4382
01:59:06,971 --> 01:59:08,470
this publicly traded company too,

4383
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:12,730
but to go be a politician of every
little bit of their life scrutinize like,

4384
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:12,941
hey,

4385
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:14,740
this lady back in high school did this.

4386
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:19,150
That deters a lot of these
really brilliant people
in the private sector from

4387
01:59:19,151 --> 01:59:21,490
going and running for
office where you don't,

4388
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:25,630
they may be a lot more capable than his
career long politician who got an office

4389
01:59:25,631 --> 01:59:30,460
when they were 32 years old and
has been in public office since.

4390
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:30,931
Yeah.

4391
01:59:30,931 --> 01:59:33,900
Isn't it kind of a crazy
situation we find ourselves in,

4392
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:39,050
especially today with social media and
the Internet and the accountability that

4393
01:59:40,291 --> 01:59:43,300
these people have about their private
lives is the only people that were going

4394
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:47,790
to get to run for office are people
that no one can fucking relate to cause

4395
01:59:47,791 --> 01:59:49,260
they've never taken any chances.

4396
01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:50,790
They never done anything fucked up.

4397
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:54,000
They never had a fucking
orgy that never done coke.

4398
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:55,530
They've never done anything stupid.

4399
01:59:55,531 --> 01:59:55,981
They never,

4400
01:59:55,981 --> 01:59:56,430
you know,

4401
01:59:56,430 --> 02:00:01,430
they did just everything that they've
done that was crazy or fun would

4402
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,040
automatically disqualify them for the job.

4403
02:00:05,041 --> 02:00:07,590
But we can't take into the,

4404
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:12,710
we can't in our minds rationalize the
idea that people make mistakes and through

4405
02:00:14,521 --> 02:00:17,070
those mistakes you build
character and you become a better,

4406
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:18,141
I'll tell you,

4407
02:00:18,141 --> 02:00:18,640
you know,

4408
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,440
I run a company and you know,

4409
02:00:20,441 --> 02:00:23,200
the people that we bring into the company
and the company helps veterans get

4410
02:00:23,201 --> 02:00:24,034
jobs and get out.

4411
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:28,300
One of my prerequisites is I don't
want perfect people on staff.

4412
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:29,320
Not that we're,

4413
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:32,110
we don't discriminate
against them by any means,

4414
02:00:32,111 --> 02:00:34,570
but I like bringing people on my team,

4415
02:00:34,571 --> 02:00:36,160
specifically my leadership team,

4416
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:38,080
who have been down and out before,

4417
02:00:38,290 --> 02:00:42,340
who have had to dig themselves back
up and overcome adversity because when

4418
02:00:42,341 --> 02:00:43,061
things go bad,

4419
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:43,691
they don't panic.

4420
02:00:43,691 --> 02:00:46,960
You know how they're gonna respond already
because they've been through things

4421
02:00:46,961 --> 02:00:49,000
in their life before where
it's been very difficult.

4422
02:00:49,001 --> 02:00:52,510
It's one of the values that we pitched
to companies on hiring more veterans is,

4423
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:53,110
look,

4424
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:55,360
you're going to hire these folks
when there's a bad day at work.

4425
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:57,310
Sales are down or somebody
didn't show up for work.

4426
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:58,810
They're not going to panic about it.

4427
02:00:58,811 --> 02:00:58,961
That,

4428
02:00:58,961 --> 02:00:59,141
that,

4429
02:00:59,141 --> 02:00:59,410
that's,

4430
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:00,580
that's small to them.

4431
02:01:00,581 --> 02:01:01,450
This is minor.

4432
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:02,500
Um,

4433
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,490
that's a very good point.

4434
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:03,971
It's,

4435
02:01:03,971 --> 02:01:04,301
you know,

4436
02:01:04,301 --> 02:01:06,610
those are the people
that I want on my team.

4437
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:08,080
Same thing in political office.

4438
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:08,261
I mean,

4439
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:09,370
you get all these perfect people,

4440
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:12,160
then you throw them into DC where
then they start having orgies.

4441
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:14,080
That's when they start
going a little crazy.

4442
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:15,550
And you know,

4443
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:18,780
they have a contained for so long and
you get the Anthony Wiener's up there.

4444
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:21,250
Well this fucking shit
that's going on with Clinton.

4445
02:01:21,251 --> 02:01:21,581
You know,

4446
02:01:21,581 --> 02:01:21,851
this,

4447
02:01:21,851 --> 02:01:24,250
this thing that this guy who,

4448
02:01:24,251 --> 02:01:24,820
uh,

4449
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:28,660
had an island and essentially
had these underage sex slaves.

4450
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:29,890
Do you know about this whole thing?

4451
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:30,060
Oh,

4452
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:31,990
I went and visited this island.

4453
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:32,531
Oh,

4454
02:01:32,531 --> 02:01:33,281
fucking Christ.

4455
02:01:33,281 --> 02:01:33,941
Google that.

4456
02:01:33,941 --> 02:01:34,660
Jamie.

4457
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:35,493
Yes.

4458
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:39,070
I got an a ton of heat and social
media because I said yesterday,

4459
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:39,801
you know,

4460
02:01:39,801 --> 02:01:40,460
the John Jones

4461
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,011
thing comes out in,

4462
02:01:41,011 --> 02:01:42,140
I don't want to get to perform off 70.

4463
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:42,471
But I said,

4464
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:42,980
you know,

4465
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:43,431
they asked,

4466
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:43,611
you know,

4467
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:44,960
will he ever be able to overcome this?

4468
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:45,201
I said,

4469
02:01:45,201 --> 02:01:49,460
look in a country where Bill Clinton can
do what he did and then become more the

4470
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:52,070
highest paid public speakers in
the hero of his political party.

4471
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:52,521
Yes.

4472
02:01:52,521 --> 02:01:53,780
Jon Jones can be forgiven for,

4473
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,740
for snorting cocaine.

4474
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:55,161
Yeah.

4475
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:59,230
He said a 27 year old people went nuts
and on social media it was all stand can

4476
02:01:59,240 --> 02:01:59,661
pears,

4477
02:01:59,661 --> 02:02:00,830
Jon Jones to Bill Clinton.

4478
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:02,421
Well you did.

4479
02:02:02,421 --> 02:02:03,440
But it's correct.

4480
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:04,400
It's a good comparison.

4481
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:05,360
It's the scenario.

4482
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:06,470
We'll look at this man,

4483
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:06,741
this,

4484
02:02:06,741 --> 02:02:08,630
this is really fucking crazy.

4485
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:09,270
This.

4486
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:10,103
Um,

4487
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:13,220
especially if Hillary is
running for president right now,

4488
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:15,980
which apparently it looks like it's
going to be Hillary versus Jeb Bush.

4489
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,061
This guy,

4490
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:18,410
Jeffrey Epstein,

4491
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:22,380
was accused of luring
underage girls to his,

4492
02:02:22,381 --> 02:02:23,214
he had some,

4493
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:24,163
some,

4494
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:28,730
some retreat somewhere and
Clinton went there several times.

4495
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:32,330
So it's just fucked me.

4496
02:02:32,331 --> 02:02:32,571
I mean,

4497
02:02:32,571 --> 02:02:33,860
he's a fucking wild man.

4498
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,080
Bill Clinton was a god damn wild man.

4499
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:37,550
We know that for a fact.

4500
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:38,120
I,

4501
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:38,361
you know,

4502
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:39,740
I don't want to divulge his name,

4503
02:02:39,741 --> 02:02:43,460
but I spent time with a
guy who's worth $2 billion.

4504
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:43,701
He's,

4505
02:02:43,701 --> 02:02:48,350
he's one of the most
successful CEOs in the country.

4506
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:48,571
And,

4507
02:02:48,571 --> 02:02:52,070
and he told me a story where he hung out
with Bill Clinton one time when he was

4508
02:02:52,071 --> 02:02:53,210
president and,

4509
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:54,230
and you know,

4510
02:02:54,231 --> 02:02:58,040
they're at some there at some
establishment and bill says,

4511
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:58,520
Hey,

4512
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,290
we should buy those
girls down there shots.

4513
02:03:00,291 --> 02:03:01,070
And the guy,

4514
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:02,100
the gentleman I know goes,

4515
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:04,070
Mr President,

4516
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:05,720
I don't think that's a good idea.

4517
02:03:05,721 --> 02:03:06,531
If you want to do that,

4518
02:03:06,531 --> 02:03:08,180
let me order them and send them down.

4519
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:08,781
Oh No,

4520
02:03:08,781 --> 02:03:08,931
no,

4521
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:09,081
no.

4522
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:10,160
I'm going to go ahead and do it.

4523
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:12,380
And he said that his personal security,

4524
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:15,290
his secret service members used to
call Bill Clinton's to call him Elvis.

4525
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,450
That was their code
name for him with Elvis.

4526
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:19,430
Wow.

4527
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:21,290
Who's a wild motherfucker.

4528
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:22,281
Look,

4529
02:03:22,281 --> 02:03:23,390
he had that sickness.

4530
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:24,711
He had it.

4531
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:26,530
He had a full blown people to,

4532
02:03:26,531 --> 02:03:29,450
I mean his Iq is
supposedly off the charts.

4533
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,040
He's one of the brightest guys.

4534
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:32,900
That's why he likes pussy so much.

4535
02:03:32,901 --> 02:03:35,150
He knows Mike Tyson said it best.

4536
02:03:35,151 --> 02:03:35,631
He said,

4537
02:03:35,631 --> 02:03:37,370
if God may found better than puts,

4538
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,540
he kept it to himself.

4539
02:03:38,570 --> 02:03:38,940
You know,

4540
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:42,020
I've got a phrase that I
use to all married men.

4541
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,913
Um,

4542
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:44,143
you know,

4543
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:45,290
I tell him all the time,

4544
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:45,591
I said,

4545
02:03:45,591 --> 02:03:46,220
listen,

4546
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:46,491
you know,

4547
02:03:46,491 --> 02:03:48,770
and I tell to a lot of fighters when
they're married as well because they

4548
02:03:48,771 --> 02:03:49,281
travel,

4549
02:03:49,281 --> 02:03:50,330
there's gonna be a lot of temptation.

4550
02:03:50,331 --> 02:03:50,601
I said,

4551
02:03:50,601 --> 02:03:51,434
look,

4552
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,750
pussy is undefeated.

4553
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:54,763
It's never like,

4554
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,050
it's never lost.

4555
02:03:57,051 --> 02:03:58,370
If you go head to head with it,

4556
02:03:58,371 --> 02:03:59,630
you are going to lose.

4557
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:01,940
And you need to avoid those situations.

4558
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,800
You need to avoid those situations.

4559
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:03,921
And,

4560
02:04:03,921 --> 02:04:04,671
and you know,

4561
02:04:04,671 --> 02:04:06,950
I've got certain protocols
if I go out to call a fight,

4562
02:04:06,951 --> 02:04:07,251
you know,

4563
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:07,731
and in a,

4564
02:04:07,731 --> 02:04:07,881
if,

4565
02:04:07,881 --> 02:04:08,061
if,

4566
02:04:08,061 --> 02:04:08,780
if I'm,

4567
02:04:08,780 --> 02:04:10,880
if I'm going to go out and
it's Vegas like last weekend,

4568
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:11,480
you know,

4569
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:14,000
I'm not going to go out and have
more than two drinks out in public,

4570
02:04:14,001 --> 02:04:16,220
in an environment where
I am not with my wife.

4571
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:17,840
And then once its second drink is up,

4572
02:04:17,841 --> 02:04:18,561
I'm going back to her.

4573
02:04:18,561 --> 02:04:19,210
I'm not even gonna,

4574
02:04:19,210 --> 02:04:21,020
I'm not gonna put myself
in that situation.

4575
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:21,950
You know,

4576
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:23,300
when you've got a Ferrari at home,

4577
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:25,880
you don't go out test driving
Cadillacs and you know what I mean?

4578
02:04:25,881 --> 02:04:27,950
And so kind of like brings
a good car these days.

4579
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:32,720
CTSV you ever drive one
Goddamn hell of an automobile?

4580
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:34,300
Probably more reliable there.

4581
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:35,450
You're ruining your room.

4582
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:36,891
I know what you're saying.

4583
02:04:36,891 --> 02:04:38,130
I'm just standing up with Cadillacs.

4584
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:38,970
I'm a car guy.

4585
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:39,863
Sorry.

4586
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:40,350
Sorry.

4587
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:41,150
Canada land,

4588
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:42,300
Cat Ferrari's,

4589
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:43,770
a fucking breakdown on the highway.

4590
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:44,900
That's there.

4591
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,780
But either way,

4592
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:46,860
don't take it on.

4593
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:48,480
Don't take it on head to head.

4594
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:49,560
Don't go head to head with it.

4595
02:04:49,561 --> 02:04:50,311
You will lose.

4596
02:04:50,311 --> 02:04:51,091
It's never lost.

4597
02:04:51,091 --> 02:04:51,480
Yes.

4598
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:55,090
I like what you're saying up to that
point up to the Cadillac Ferrari thing,

4599
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:56,213
but no.

4600
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:58,861
Yeah.

4601
02:04:58,861 --> 02:04:59,220
I mean,

4602
02:04:59,220 --> 02:04:59,461
look,

4603
02:04:59,461 --> 02:04:59,611
we're,

4604
02:04:59,611 --> 02:05:00,020
we're,

4605
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:03,120
you're fighting fucking
thousands of years of DNA.

4606
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:03,601
Essentially.

4607
02:05:03,601 --> 02:05:05,460
You're fighting all the DNA that existed,

4608
02:05:05,461 --> 02:05:10,290
that kept human beings alive when 50%
of the babies would die when most people

4609
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:11,910
never live to be past 30 I mean,

4610
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:13,170
you're fighting that.

4611
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,440
I mean the urge that men have to,

4612
02:05:15,441 --> 02:05:15,770
to,

4613
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:16,830
to procreate,

4614
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:17,640
that is,

4615
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:19,120
that's the reason why there's people,

4616
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,660
we were lazy about procreating,

4617
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:24,930
about having sex if it's
having sex was as all right.

4618
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:26,580
Nobody would have fucking kids.

4619
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:27,150
No,

4620
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:28,830
none of them have children
and I have children.

4621
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:33,510
You would never know what a great
experience it is to be a father,

4622
02:05:33,511 --> 02:05:34,560
how fantastic it is,

4623
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:35,580
how enriching it is.

4624
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:39,660
If you just looked at it from watching
some guy and his wife with the kids

4625
02:05:39,661 --> 02:05:42,990
crying at the movie theater or
someone at the airport like,

4626
02:05:42,991 --> 02:05:43,824
fuck that.

4627
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:44,611
I'm young.

4628
02:05:44,611 --> 02:05:45,301
I'm single.

4629
02:05:45,301 --> 02:05:46,134
I like,

4630
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:50,310
I like waking up when I want without
someone yelling at me without some fucking

4631
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,590
kid that I have to clean their diaper.

4632
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:54,270
But then you have kids
you understand like,

4633
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:54,841
oh,

4634
02:05:54,841 --> 02:05:56,580
this isn't somebody else's kid.

4635
02:05:56,581 --> 02:05:57,540
This is my kid,

4636
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:58,830
this is a part of me.

4637
02:05:58,831 --> 02:05:59,900
This is love.

4638
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:01,500
That's indescribable.

4639
02:06:01,501 --> 02:06:06,501
And then it becomes this sort of new level
of your life that it's very difficult

4640
02:06:06,661 --> 02:06:09,060
to explain to someone who
doesn't have children.

4641
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:09,540
Yeah,

4642
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:11,040
I have a lot of single friends.

4643
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:13,950
I have a lot of comics that
are my friends that you know,

4644
02:06:13,951 --> 02:06:14,910
that don't have kids.

4645
02:06:14,911 --> 02:06:15,570
And they go,

4646
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:19,230
I'll fucking willy nilly crazy
slinging dick all over the world.

4647
02:06:19,231 --> 02:06:20,310
They're fucking wild men.

4648
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:22,140
And I tried it.

4649
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:22,471
They're like,

4650
02:06:22,471 --> 02:06:22,921
man,

4651
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:23,021
I,

4652
02:06:23,021 --> 02:06:23,220
I,

4653
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:23,491
you know,

4654
02:06:23,491 --> 02:06:24,690
I would hate to have kids.

4655
02:06:24,691 --> 02:06:24,961
I'm like,

4656
02:06:24,961 --> 02:06:25,171
yeah,

4657
02:06:25,171 --> 02:06:26,004
you say that.

4658
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:27,120
I have no idea.

4659
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:27,630
It's the meat.

4660
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:27,991
To me,

4661
02:06:27,991 --> 02:06:28,950
it's the meaning of life.

4662
02:06:29,010 --> 02:06:30,570
I couldn't imagine,

4663
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:31,081
you know,

4664
02:06:31,081 --> 02:06:35,790
I had my first daughter and it wasn't
that long after I'd gotten back from Iraq

4665
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:36,511
the second time.

4666
02:06:36,511 --> 02:06:38,040
And it was such a powerful,

4667
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,960
one of the most powerful
experience in my life.

4668
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:43,380
You go from an environment where
you see so much life taken.

4669
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:46,440
And then I'm sitting in
a roommate and I see,

4670
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:47,041
you know,

4671
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:47,850
life given.

4672
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:48,900
And you know,

4673
02:06:48,901 --> 02:06:52,530
for me at that time I was already thinking
about getting out of the military and

4674
02:06:52,531 --> 02:06:55,320
there's a lot of guilt inside me
for doing that because I was so,

4675
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:58,470
I was so good at being a marine officer.

4676
02:06:58,471 --> 02:07:00,270
I loved leading marines.

4677
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:00,541
You know,

4678
02:07:00,541 --> 02:07:03,690
I didn't love going to what
I loved leading marines
and you feel guilty because

4679
02:07:03,691 --> 02:07:03,961
you know,

4680
02:07:03,961 --> 02:07:06,390
these guys are going to keep
going back and what you should do.

4681
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:07,350
Um,

4682
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:09,000
but when my first daughter was born,

4683
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:11,760
it was just an absolutely
life changing experience.

4684
02:07:11,761 --> 02:07:11,941
I mean,

4685
02:07:11,941 --> 02:07:12,660
for me,

4686
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,430
the rest of this is a puppet show.

4687
02:07:14,730 --> 02:07:15,051
I mean you,

4688
02:07:15,051 --> 02:07:15,231
you,

4689
02:07:15,231 --> 02:07:15,361
you,

4690
02:07:15,361 --> 02:07:18,150
we do all these things that we can
get home to where we want to be.

4691
02:07:18,151 --> 02:07:18,984
I can get on my,

4692
02:07:19,190 --> 02:07:23,040
my living room floor and just be with my
three daughters and they bring out the

4693
02:07:23,041 --> 02:07:23,761
best side of me.

4694
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:24,810
They inspire me.

4695
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,180
They're by far my best accomplishment.

4696
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:27,421
I mean,

4697
02:07:27,421 --> 02:07:29,970
I absolutely live for them and you know,

4698
02:07:29,971 --> 02:07:30,181
you,

4699
02:07:30,181 --> 02:07:30,901
you can relate.

4700
02:07:30,901 --> 02:07:31,051
You know,

4701
02:07:31,051 --> 02:07:34,210
when you sit down and you
lay next to a girl that,

4702
02:07:34,211 --> 02:07:35,170
that you may have just had,

4703
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:35,830
you know,

4704
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:37,390
a random relations with,

4705
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:40,360
that's nothing like laying down next
to your child is a fall asleep and they

4706
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:41,380
lean over and just tell you,

4707
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:41,861
I love you.

4708
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:42,180
Daddy

4709
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:43,320
is very different.

4710
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,940
But if the chicks really hot,

4711
02:07:44,941 --> 02:07:45,774
it's still awesome.

4712
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:49,350
I'm just saying if you're not
married and the chicks really high,

4713
02:07:49,351 --> 02:07:50,340
it's pretty God damn good,

4714
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:52,410
especially whatever.

4715
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:53,581
But yeah,

4716
02:07:53,581 --> 02:07:54,930
there's just a different level.

4717
02:07:54,931 --> 02:07:55,230
Like,

4718
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:55,710
you know,

4719
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:58,620
I visited my daughter at school today
and she didn't know we're going to be

4720
02:07:58,621 --> 02:07:59,180
there.

4721
02:07:59,180 --> 02:07:59,550
Um,

4722
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:00,383
and uh,

4723
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:02,280
she turns around and sees me,

4724
02:08:02,281 --> 02:08:02,491
you know,

4725
02:08:02,491 --> 02:08:06,390
she's six and her eyes light up and
she runs over and gives me a hug.

4726
02:08:06,391 --> 02:08:11,190
And this is a warm that comes over you
that no one will ever understand unless

4727
02:08:11,191 --> 02:08:12,240
you have a kid.

4728
02:08:12,241 --> 02:08:13,074
He just won't,

4729
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:13,531
you know,

4730
02:08:13,531 --> 02:08:17,070
and I'm not saying that it's a better
life and I'm not saying that I'm a better

4731
02:08:17,071 --> 02:08:17,904
person.

4732
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,760
I'm not saying that everybody has to go
out and have a kid cause I hate those

4733
02:08:20,761 --> 02:08:21,211
arguments.

4734
02:08:21,211 --> 02:08:22,860
And I used to hate those
arguments when I was single.

4735
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:23,520
People would say,

4736
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:24,031
look good.

4737
02:08:24,031 --> 02:08:24,340
You know what?

4738
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:25,080
Fucking,

4739
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:26,430
you're not mature until you have a kid.

4740
02:08:26,431 --> 02:08:26,760
You know?

4741
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:29,430
I believe there's a lot of people
that don't need to have kids.

4742
02:08:29,670 --> 02:08:33,090
I believe there's a lot of people that
they can contribute to this society,

4743
02:08:33,091 --> 02:08:33,751
to this culture,

4744
02:08:33,751 --> 02:08:35,550
to this world without ever procreate.

4745
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,061
Absolutely.

4746
02:08:36,061 --> 02:08:37,350
There's nothing wrong with that.

4747
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,340
There's nothing wrong with that.

4748
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:39,690
For me though,

4749
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:41,790
I'm such a selfish person.

4750
02:08:41,970 --> 02:08:42,151
Um,

4751
02:08:42,151 --> 02:08:43,500
so I shouldn't even say self.

4752
02:08:43,501 --> 02:08:45,740
I'm so self obsessed with my,

4753
02:08:45,770 --> 02:08:47,060
my own goals and my,

4754
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:48,390
I'm always in my head.

4755
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:51,840
I'm always concentrating on
my thoughts and my emotions.

4756
02:08:51,841 --> 02:08:56,841
That having a child made me rewire
it rewired all of my thinking because

4757
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:00,300
everything I do now,

4758
02:09:00,301 --> 02:09:02,610
I think about my children.

4759
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:07,170
I think about them as little human beings
and I'm responsible for little human

4760
02:09:07,171 --> 02:09:08,004
beings that I,

4761
02:09:08,030 --> 02:09:09,510
and I can't do anything too crazy.

4762
02:09:09,511 --> 02:09:11,880
I can't do anything that's
going to risk my life.

4763
02:09:11,881 --> 02:09:12,091
I'm,

4764
02:09:12,091 --> 02:09:13,320
I have to take care of them.

4765
02:09:13,321 --> 02:09:13,531
I mean,

4766
02:09:13,531 --> 02:09:13,941
it's just,

4767
02:09:13,941 --> 02:09:18,360
there's a thing about that I never
used to think or worry about.

4768
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:18,901
I mean,

4769
02:09:18,901 --> 02:09:21,510
I certainly didn't want to die before,

4770
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:25,320
but I never used to think about it the
way I think about it now because now I

4771
02:09:25,321 --> 02:09:28,770
think about leaving behind my
children and that's a horrific idea.

4772
02:09:28,990 --> 02:09:29,531
Powerful.

4773
02:09:29,531 --> 02:09:29,730
You know,

4774
02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:29,920
you,

4775
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:31,270
you couldn't say it any better.

4776
02:09:31,271 --> 02:09:33,730
I mean it was at the time
I had my first daughter,

4777
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:34,960
I had zero fears.

4778
02:09:34,961 --> 02:09:35,111
I mean,

4779
02:09:35,111 --> 02:09:37,240
I took a lot of risks,

4780
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:38,100
um,

4781
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:38,240
in,

4782
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:40,480
in my job at that time and did not care.

4783
02:09:40,481 --> 02:09:43,600
Then all of a sudden you have this child
and this fear is introduced to your

4784
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:44,170
world.

4785
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:45,490
Not just about you dying,

4786
02:09:45,491 --> 02:09:46,001
lean behind,

4787
02:09:46,001 --> 02:09:47,830
but what about the child?

4788
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:48,250
You know,

4789
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:49,360
they're going to drive one day,

4790
02:09:49,361 --> 02:09:51,580
they're going to get their heartbroken
when day or what happens here.

4791
02:09:51,581 --> 02:09:52,390
He and I had a,

4792
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:56,140
I had a friend of mine who
lives right up the block and he,

4793
02:09:56,141 --> 02:09:57,310
his firstborn son,

4794
02:09:57,311 --> 02:10:02,311
11 years old or on a ski trip in Colorado
and someone was towing a paraplegic

4795
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:03,754
down the slope.

4796
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:04,351
And the,

4797
02:10:04,351 --> 02:10:06,160
the wire they were using to tow him,

4798
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:08,560
hit his son in the neck
and killed him instantly.

4799
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:09,520
Oh God.

4800
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,160
I mean it was,

4801
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:12,910
and it to today to be there for him.

4802
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:15,100
And not that I was able to do much,

4803
02:10:15,101 --> 02:10:15,371
but to,

4804
02:10:15,371 --> 02:10:17,980
to see him have to recover from that is,

4805
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:18,911
you know,

4806
02:10:18,911 --> 02:10:19,151
look,

4807
02:10:19,151 --> 02:10:20,550
I've been on the battlefield and,

4808
02:10:20,551 --> 02:10:21,550
and I've seen a lot of,

4809
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:23,740
a lot of things I would
never wish on anybody.

4810
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:24,700
Um,

4811
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:28,180
but losing your own child is just brutal.

4812
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,073
It's brutal.

4813
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:32,260
It must be indescribable.

4814
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,410
What did you know Jeremy Stevens brought
this up when he was on a podcast about

4815
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:38,360
fighters having daughters?

4816
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:39,470
All daughters.

4817
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:40,700
You've got all daughters.

4818
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:42,200
Jon Jones has all daughters.

4819
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:43,310
Mark Coleman has r.

4820
02:10:43,311 --> 02:10:43,490
Dot.

4821
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:44,323
All daughters.

4822
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:46,400
I mean this is like a long list.

4823
02:10:46,430 --> 02:10:50,780
Alpha males of these savages that only
have daughters is that the universe is

4824
02:10:50,781 --> 02:10:51,920
trying to balance itself out.

4825
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:52,813
You know,

4826
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:53,900
what is that?

4827
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:54,920
There's something with it with,

4828
02:10:54,921 --> 02:10:55,191
you know,

4829
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:57,340
your natural testosterone count is so hot.

4830
02:10:57,341 --> 02:10:58,060
I don't know.

4831
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:58,850
There's,

4832
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:59,130
I've,

4833
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:00,620
I've read different articles about it.

4834
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:02,870
I remember before I had my third,

4835
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,000
Chris Weidman was trying
to give me some tips,

4836
02:11:05,001 --> 02:11:05,101
like,

4837
02:11:05,101 --> 02:11:06,140
you got to eat this.

4838
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:07,191
They got to do it.

4839
02:11:07,191 --> 02:11:08,120
Just like that.

4840
02:11:08,121 --> 02:11:08,301
I mean,

4841
02:11:08,301 --> 02:11:08,600
he,

4842
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:12,380
he gave me the play by play and
he says that's how he had his boy.

4843
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,010
You know,

4844
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:13,100
he,

4845
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:13,311
that,

4846
02:11:13,311 --> 02:11:14,720
that's exactly how he did it.

4847
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,980
And he followed the steps scenario.

4848
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:16,641
Of course,

4849
02:11:16,641 --> 02:11:19,100
I wasn't patient enough to put
in the amount of time he did.

4850
02:11:19,101 --> 02:11:20,160
And I don't believe it.

4851
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:21,560
Dumb luck.

4852
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:22,101
I think it's,

4853
02:11:22,101 --> 02:11:22,380
you know,

4854
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:24,110
the fucking Zigzag,

4855
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:24,681
you know,

4856
02:11:24,681 --> 02:11:24,911
the,

4857
02:11:24,911 --> 02:11:27,470
the right fucking sperm
gets to the right egg.

4858
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,080
But Bam,

4859
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:28,881
Jetson millionaire,

4860
02:11:28,881 --> 02:11:31,370
I don't think there's any
logic or science to it.

4861
02:11:31,371 --> 02:11:32,630
It's a bunch of old wives' tales.

4862
02:11:32,650 --> 02:11:33,020
Yeah.

4863
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:33,231
I mean,

4864
02:11:33,231 --> 02:11:37,200
I go home and I am surrounded
by estrogen meets around it.

4865
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:38,840
It's an incredible,

4866
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,700
it's a weakness.

4867
02:11:40,730 --> 02:11:41,210
It's,

4868
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:41,721
you gotta get,

4869
02:11:41,721 --> 02:11:42,410
they get you.

4870
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:43,243
Oh yeah.

4871
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:45,710
I got a bit I'm doing about
it in my act right now.

4872
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:49,070
It's just cause it's so like when you're
around a bunch of people who think

4873
02:11:49,071 --> 02:11:50,270
completely different than you,

4874
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:52,360
you really understand like the,

4875
02:11:52,361 --> 02:11:52,581
the,

4876
02:11:52,581 --> 02:11:56,150
the troubles that men
and women have tried.

4877
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:57,043
You know,

4878
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:57,590
this,

4879
02:11:57,590 --> 02:12:00,200
this thing where we're trying to
figure out how to get along together.

4880
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:00,650
You,

4881
02:12:00,650 --> 02:12:00,980
you,

4882
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:03,110
you really understand it at a base level.

4883
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:03,470
Yeah.

4884
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:04,430
Oh this is like,

4885
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,590
this is like a totally different animal.

4886
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:11,240
This is like a kangaroo trying to live
within Orangutang like you guys are

4887
02:12:11,241 --> 02:12:13,010
fucking w there's so different.

4888
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:14,630
It's so different.

4889
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:19,780
And then you have these weird traders
that sort of like cross the barrier and

4890
02:12:20,061 --> 02:12:22,460
try to meet in the middle
and like mineral assholes.

4891
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:27,170
I'm different and they try to like
sell themselves internetive to men.

4892
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:30,830
But meanwhile they are men and then your
wives are using it as an example in an

4893
02:12:30,831 --> 02:12:34,460
argument with you that that got some
fucking creep and then they always get

4894
02:12:34,461 --> 02:12:38,690
caught doing something fucking gross
and those get caught raping somebody or

4895
02:12:38,691 --> 02:12:39,080
something like,

4896
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:39,410
ah,

4897
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:39,711
yeah,

4898
02:12:39,711 --> 02:12:40,480
there you go.

4899
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:40,670
Yeah.

4900
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:41,570
Like Bill Cosby,

4901
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:42,650
perfect example.

4902
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:46,160
Bill Cosby forever was telling
Comedians don't tell dirty jokes.

4903
02:12:46,161 --> 02:12:47,480
She never tell dirty jokes.

4904
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:48,960
Crushing Eddie Murphy for he was,

4905
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:50,480
oh and not just Eddie Murphy.

4906
02:12:50,481 --> 02:12:52,190
He did it to v Chris Rock.

4907
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:56,450
He did it to a host of
especially black comedians.

4908
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:57,463
Meanwhile,

4909
02:12:57,830 --> 02:13:01,200
if the stories are true
with 30 women aren't buyers,

4910
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:03,080
it's getting a little ridiculous,

4911
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:03,690
but that's,

4912
02:13:03,690 --> 02:13:05,060
it's exactly what you find out.

4913
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:06,380
I mean Ted Haggard,

4914
02:13:06,410 --> 02:13:11,410
that fucking that preacher who was a
always like a railing against gay people

4915
02:13:12,111 --> 02:13:12,820
and against,

4916
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:13,190
you know,

4917
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:15,650
God says that gay men
should not be married.

4918
02:13:15,651 --> 02:13:16,411
It's an abomination.

4919
02:13:16,411 --> 02:13:19,460
Me By always doing math and
fucking getting gay hookers.

4920
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,630
It's all the same shit.

4921
02:13:20,631 --> 02:13:21,450
It's like these,

4922
02:13:21,450 --> 02:13:23,630
these fucking traitors that cross this,

4923
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:24,381
this,

4924
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:28,970
this line where they're trying to portray
themselves as the alternative to tea

4925
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:29,790
to reality.

4926
02:13:29,790 --> 02:13:31,350
They believe they're the enlightened one.

4927
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,320
Fucking gross scams,

4928
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:34,860
disgusting male feminists.

4929
02:13:34,861 --> 02:13:35,694
That's what we're talking about.

4930
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:36,930
You'll hear me out there.

4931
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:37,764
You creeps.

4932
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,500
You need to do dead lifts all of you.

4933
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:44,820
It is funny because there's been a
couple times where I've started to get

4934
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:45,480
pretty,

4935
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:47,370
pretty serious on the podcast here.

4936
02:13:47,550 --> 02:13:48,500
And then Joel complete,

4937
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:50,270
like when I talked about
the Friday and the county,

4938
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:53,220
he completely turned
important or you know,

4939
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:53,521
hey,

4940
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:53,881
uh,

4941
02:13:53,881 --> 02:13:54,421
you know,

4942
02:13:54,421 --> 02:13:54,660
uh,

4943
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:55,493
he,

4944
02:13:55,510 --> 02:13:57,690
he's laying next to my
daughter instead of like,

4945
02:13:57,691 --> 02:13:57,871
you know,

4946
02:13:57,871 --> 02:13:58,450
another woman,

4947
02:13:58,450 --> 02:13:59,370
he throws that one in there.

4948
02:13:59,371 --> 02:14:00,204
It reminds me,

4949
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:02,370
I did the Howard stern show once,

4950
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:06,210
and this is back in 2000 I was an
active duty Marine Corps captain.

4951
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:07,470
Was that when you were in the WC?

4952
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:08,550
We do light heavyweight champion.

4953
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:09,030
Yeah.

4954
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:11,520
And so the versus network,

4955
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:13,020
God rest their souls,

4956
02:14:13,021 --> 02:14:13,854
rest in peace.

4957
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:16,800
They somehow get me on the
Howard stern show and I go,

4958
02:14:16,801 --> 02:14:16,941
well,

4959
02:14:16,941 --> 02:14:18,060
what am I going on for it?

4960
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:20,000
I'm worried it's an active duty captain.

4961
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:20,491
The Marine Corps.

4962
02:14:20,491 --> 02:14:23,010
I can get in a lot of trouble
for saying the wrong thing here.

4963
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:24,870
And so they tell me,

4964
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:25,231
oh,

4965
02:14:25,231 --> 02:14:25,621
don't worry,

4966
02:14:25,621 --> 02:14:27,990
you're just there to present
a check from the WEC.

4967
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:30,180
But if he will start asking you questions,

4968
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,040
try to stay on as long as you can.

4969
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:32,641
Okay,

4970
02:14:32,641 --> 02:14:32,941
cool.

4971
02:14:32,941 --> 02:14:33,930
What's the contest?

4972
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:37,410
The hottest chick with the ugliest car.

4973
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:38,670
Oh God.

4974
02:14:39,090 --> 02:14:39,781
I mean hip,

4975
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:41,220
the ugliest scar.

4976
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,590
And so a fuck.

4977
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:44,041
But it,

4978
02:14:44,041 --> 02:14:44,251
you know,

4979
02:14:44,251 --> 02:14:46,050
at one point there's actually still,

4980
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:46,590
yeah,

4981
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:48,210
I think the video is still somewhere,

4982
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:48,571
but,

4983
02:14:48,571 --> 02:14:49,404
uh,

4984
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:51,140
we're doing this interview and,

4985
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:54,990
and Howard was being very serious and he
was asking me what it's like for these

4986
02:14:54,991 --> 02:14:57,330
young men and women that
deploy and how difficult it is.

4987
02:14:57,331 --> 02:14:59,160
And I'm getting into it and,

4988
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,810
and I could see his wheels turning,

4989
02:15:00,811 --> 02:15:01,960
like he's getting sympathetic and every,

4990
02:15:01,961 --> 02:15:03,000
and there's really serious,

4991
02:15:03,001 --> 02:15:04,050
and this isn't his brand.

4992
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:07,770
So he thinks on his feet and he's nimble
and right out of nowhere he comes.

4993
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,180
Wow,

4994
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:09,901
that is so mean.

4995
02:15:09,901 --> 02:15:10,561
How old are you?

4996
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:11,540
25 years.

4997
02:15:11,930 --> 02:15:12,840
The pressure,

4998
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:14,183
you guys,

4999
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:15,600
you must be jerking off what,

5000
02:15:15,601 --> 02:15:15,961
seven,

5001
02:15:15,961 --> 02:15:16,794
eight times a day?

5002
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:17,633
What are you doing?

5003
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:18,783
And

5004
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:20,671
I mean,

5005
02:15:20,671 --> 02:15:20,851
I,

5006
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:22,710
I knew I was worn,

5007
02:15:22,711 --> 02:15:22,921
you know,

5008
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:23,071
hey,

5009
02:15:23,071 --> 02:15:23,311
look,

5010
02:15:23,311 --> 02:15:25,050
this guy's gonna throw
a curve ball or to a,

5011
02:15:25,051 --> 02:15:25,590
you know,

5012
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:26,880
I wasn't ready for that.

5013
02:15:26,881 --> 02:15:29,850
I forget how I tiptoed
and tap danced around it.

5014
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:30,751
But I mean,

5015
02:15:30,751 --> 02:15:31,261
it was,

5016
02:15:31,261 --> 02:15:31,890
uh,

5017
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:32,790
it wasn't easy.

5018
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:33,750
It wasn't easy.

5019
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:34,111
Yeah,

5020
02:15:34,111 --> 02:15:34,710
there's no,

5021
02:15:34,710 --> 02:15:36,480
there's no easy way to tiptoe around that.

5022
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:37,110
No,

5023
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:37,411
no.

5024
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:37,921
And you know,

5025
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:39,750
there's marines out there
just waiting in the hall.

5026
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:40,111
Hey,

5027
02:15:40,111 --> 02:15:40,441
junior,

5028
02:15:40,441 --> 02:15:43,620
that damn cat than on there talking about
jerking off on the Howard stern show.

5029
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:44,021
Yes.

5030
02:15:44,021 --> 02:15:44,491
No weird.

5031
02:15:44,491 --> 02:15:45,750
You can admit to jerking off.

5032
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:47,430
It's a very strange thing.

5033
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,210
It's was like,

5034
02:15:48,210 --> 02:15:49,440
I don't understand that world.

5035
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:52,680
I'll never understand a world
where someone gets angry
at you for talking about

5036
02:15:52,681 --> 02:15:53,280
jerking off.

5037
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:53,401
Well,

5038
02:15:53,401 --> 02:15:54,330
it's like women in shitting.

5039
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:55,170
Yeah.

5040
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:56,003
It doesn't happen.

5041
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,960
Some chicks will get down.

5042
02:15:58,050 --> 02:15:58,930
They'll tell you.

5043
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,181
They'll let you know.

5044
02:16:00,181 --> 02:16:01,050
I appreciate that.

5045
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:01,291
You know,

5046
02:16:01,291 --> 02:16:02,130
when a guy who can't,

5047
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:02,731
you know,

5048
02:16:02,731 --> 02:16:03,564
I had a friend,

5049
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,440
he uh,

5050
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,330
he was over this girl's house.

5051
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:07,320
They're about to get busy.

5052
02:16:07,321 --> 02:16:08,250
He went to use the bathroom.

5053
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:11,070
She had forgot to flush and there was a
floater in there and he said he killed

5054
02:16:11,071 --> 02:16:11,820
his boner.

5055
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:12,211
And he said,

5056
02:16:12,211 --> 02:16:13,044
he left.

5057
02:16:13,110 --> 02:16:13,441
And I go,

5058
02:16:13,441 --> 02:16:13,570
what?

5059
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:14,131
She Hadi goes,

5060
02:16:14,131 --> 02:16:14,761
she was really hot.

5061
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:14,941
I go,

5062
02:16:14,941 --> 02:16:16,140
you're a fucking pussy.

5063
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:16,741
I go,

5064
02:16:16,741 --> 02:16:17,610
you'll flush it.

5065
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:19,080
You man up your race,

5066
02:16:19,081 --> 02:16:19,914
your memory,

5067
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:21,300
shake it up a little bit yourself.

5068
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,430
The fucking Volkan neck pinch,

5069
02:16:23,690 --> 02:16:24,180
you know,

5070
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:25,800
there's no way he was an Alpha male.

5071
02:16:25,801 --> 02:16:26,790
He had to be a bravo.

5072
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,710
I don't know what he was,

5073
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,171
you know,

5074
02:16:29,171 --> 02:16:29,740
I mean,

5075
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:29,980
you

5076
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,281
know him.

5077
02:16:30,281 --> 02:16:31,360
He's a good guy.

5078
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:32,590
He'll definitely a boys.

5079
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:33,280
Yeah,

5080
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,880
maybe.

5081
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,390
I Dunno,

5082
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:35,650
I just don't understand that.

5083
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:36,701
I just think,

5084
02:16:36,701 --> 02:16:37,180
you know,

5085
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:38,830
there's a reality to this world.

5086
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:39,700
Food comes in,

5087
02:16:39,730 --> 02:16:40,563
shit comes out,

5088
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:41,230
deal with it.

5089
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:41,791
It's pretty soon.

5090
02:16:41,791 --> 02:16:42,350
You know,

5091
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:43,360
if you can't,

5092
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:47,680
you know you're going to miss out on some
opportunities if you can't close those

5093
02:16:47,681 --> 02:16:48,790
doors of perception.

5094
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:51,610
It's amazing how funny
that stuff has to kids,

5095
02:16:51,611 --> 02:16:52,390
by the way too.

5096
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:53,223
I mean it's,

5097
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:56,890
you say poop in my house and then you'd
swear you'd say it was your level of

5098
02:16:56,891 --> 02:16:57,460
comedian.

5099
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:57,721
Dude,

5100
02:16:57,721 --> 02:16:59,290
my kids love to say poop.

5101
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:00,081
My kids will,

5102
02:17:00,081 --> 02:17:03,420
I'll read stories and as I'm
reading the stories like the get,

5103
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:03,940
you know,

5104
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:07,750
there's a lot of times just like pauses
and like the story when you try to read

5105
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:08,081
the story,

5106
02:17:08,081 --> 02:17:08,620
right?

5107
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,221
And they're like,

5108
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:11,060
can they pumped his past?

5109
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:12,490
You know,

5110
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:13,980
you've got a six year
old and a four year old.

5111
02:17:13,981 --> 02:17:15,250
I think it's fucking awesome.

5112
02:17:15,251 --> 02:17:16,390
Anytime you could say poop,

5113
02:17:16,630 --> 02:17:17,590
is that how old are your girls are?

5114
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:17,920
Yeah,

5115
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:18,161
that's,

5116
02:17:18,161 --> 02:17:18,551
I've got,

5117
02:17:18,551 --> 02:17:19,271
I've got seven,

5118
02:17:19,271 --> 02:17:20,440
five and one and a half.

5119
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:21,693
They're so cute.

5120
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,580
It makes you really
understand and appreciate,

5121
02:17:24,581 --> 02:17:28,110
really understand and appreciate the
differences between men and women on a,

5122
02:17:28,111 --> 02:17:28,360
uh,

5123
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:33,100
like a base level having a baby grow
up to be a little girl and you go and,

5124
02:17:33,101 --> 02:17:35,440
and also see the variations
between the two of them.

5125
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:36,460
You know?

5126
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:40,780
And when I say like I get
angry at male feminism,

5127
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:42,040
I don't mean that I'm,

5128
02:17:42,041 --> 02:17:44,860
I don't think that everyone should have
equal rights cause that's not what I

5129
02:17:44,861 --> 02:17:45,371
mean at all.

5130
02:17:45,371 --> 02:17:50,371
I just think there's a lot of policies
out there that are passing themselves off

5131
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:53,650
as a better alternative
to a masculine man.

5132
02:17:53,830 --> 02:17:57,580
And that masculinity for whatever
reason is under attack is wrong.

5133
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:58,240
Yeah.

5134
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:58,421
Yeah,

5135
02:17:58,421 --> 02:17:58,841
absolutely.

5136
02:17:58,841 --> 02:17:59,081
It's,

5137
02:17:59,081 --> 02:17:59,881
it's wrong for you.

5138
02:17:59,881 --> 02:18:01,810
The strong toxic masculinity.

5139
02:18:01,811 --> 02:18:05,620
I've heard this expression many times
like what are you fucking talking about?

5140
02:18:05,621 --> 02:18:08,080
Like there's nothing wrong with
women being feminine either.

5141
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:11,740
And that's the other thing about women
being feminine is that somehow or

5142
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:12,220
another,

5143
02:18:12,220 --> 02:18:17,110
a lot of these women who are like pro
equal rights will get upset if a girl

5144
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:18,250
wants to dress sexy.

5145
02:18:18,251 --> 02:18:22,180
If a girl wants to wear what's
considered by our society to be sexually

5146
02:18:22,181 --> 02:18:22,631
attractive,

5147
02:18:22,631 --> 02:18:23,351
high heels,

5148
02:18:23,351 --> 02:18:26,360
short skirts that this is
playing into men's hands stuff.

5149
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:27,160
Guess what?

5150
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:28,450
Some women like it,

5151
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:29,560
they liked dressing.

5152
02:18:29,561 --> 02:18:30,370
Absolutely.

5153
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:33,340
There's nothing wrong with a guy
who wants to dress like that either.

5154
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:38,020
Who gives a fuck like this live
and let live for whatever reason.

5155
02:18:38,021 --> 02:18:38,440
It only,

5156
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:43,180
it only works for some people if it
suits their purpose or their ideology as

5157
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:44,080
soon as it doesn't.

5158
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:48,670
Any guy that likes to compete and an
aggressive sport must be a piece of shit.

5159
02:18:48,730 --> 02:18:49,090
Oh yeah,

5160
02:18:49,090 --> 02:18:50,050
that's not true.

5161
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:51,220
I know it's not true.

5162
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,660
I've experienced it.

5163
02:18:52,661 --> 02:18:56,710
I know a lot of guys that are really
nice people that also like to fight.

5164
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:58,760
Absolutely and plenty of them in this,

5165
02:18:58,761 --> 02:19:01,690
this idea that that's
incomprehensible that the,

5166
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:02,021
these,

5167
02:19:02,021 --> 02:19:04,120
these things are mutually exclusive.

5168
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:05,171
I reject that.

5169
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:05,621
I think it's,

5170
02:19:05,621 --> 02:19:06,760
I think it's preposterous.

5171
02:19:06,761 --> 02:19:10,870
And I think that idea is perpetrated by
people who are trying to present this

5172
02:19:10,871 --> 02:19:12,340
alternative to the norm,

5173
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:15,190
that they know they can't compete as men.

5174
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:18,070
And so they want to pretend
that somehow or another,

5175
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,680
all the things that we associate with men,

5176
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:22,150
muscle cars,

5177
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,230
sports,

5178
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:23,621
you know,

5179
02:19:23,621 --> 02:19:24,161
whatever,

5180
02:19:24,161 --> 02:19:25,090
having a big Dick,

5181
02:19:25,091 --> 02:19:26,500
all those things are terrible.

5182
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:28,190
And that was what they are.

5183
02:19:28,191 --> 02:19:28,800
This,

5184
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:32,780
this guy who cries every time he sees a
fucking a commercial in it with a puppy.

5185
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:33,440
That's,

5186
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:34,790
that's the better choice.

5187
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:35,331
And you're in,

5188
02:19:35,331 --> 02:19:36,500
you're wrong for being the other way.

5189
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:36,741
You know,

5190
02:19:36,741 --> 02:19:36,941
it's,

5191
02:19:36,941 --> 02:19:39,980
it's envy and insecurity can,

5192
02:19:39,981 --> 02:19:40,251
can,

5193
02:19:40,251 --> 02:19:41,630
can make any one of us,

5194
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:42,860
I mean really ugly.

5195
02:19:42,861 --> 02:19:43,371
And then you hear it,

5196
02:19:43,371 --> 02:19:43,620
you know,

5197
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:44,480
the green have you,

5198
02:19:44,481 --> 02:19:45,314
makes you ugly and everything.

5199
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:45,950
But I think,

5200
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:48,200
I think a lot of that is what it is,

5201
02:19:48,201 --> 02:19:49,580
creates that intolerance.

5202
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,600
You know,

5203
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:50,871
I mean,

5204
02:19:50,871 --> 02:19:52,010
people ask me all the time,

5205
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:52,501
you know,

5206
02:19:52,501 --> 02:19:52,681
Oh,

5207
02:19:52,681 --> 02:19:52,871
you're,

5208
02:19:52,871 --> 02:19:53,111
you're,

5209
02:19:53,111 --> 02:19:53,721
you're white.

5210
02:19:53,721 --> 02:19:54,680
You were in the Marine Corp,

5211
02:19:54,681 --> 02:19:55,461
so all,

5212
02:19:55,461 --> 02:19:56,294
you must be,

5213
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:56,810
you know,

5214
02:19:56,810 --> 02:19:58,070
flea against all this,

5215
02:19:58,071 --> 02:19:58,371
you know,

5216
02:19:58,371 --> 02:20:00,050
a homosexual stuff in the marriage.

5217
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:02,300
I don't give a shit.

5218
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:03,560
Don't care at all.

5219
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:06,230
With his month is much hate
as I've seen in the world.

5220
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:07,520
What do I care about?

5221
02:20:07,521 --> 02:20:08,450
Two people love each other.

5222
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:09,681
I have no issues.

5223
02:20:09,681 --> 02:20:12,230
Why whatsoever with that whatsoever.

5224
02:20:12,260 --> 02:20:12,591
Yeah.

5225
02:20:12,591 --> 02:20:14,750
My issues with people that
have a problem with it.

5226
02:20:14,751 --> 02:20:18,080
I have a real issue for people that
have a problem with people who just love

5227
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:18,680
each other.

5228
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:20,990
I don't know what it's
like to want to love a man.

5229
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:21,351
I don't,

5230
02:20:21,351 --> 02:20:23,060
I can't believe my wife loves me.

5231
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:25,160
I can't believe any women love men.

5232
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:26,830
Why would you want Dick that?

5233
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:27,693
I don't get it.

5234
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:27,950
It's a,

5235
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:29,270
to me it's like having,

5236
02:20:29,271 --> 02:20:30,830
Dick is like having a magic trick.

5237
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:32,720
Like I can't believe this works.

5238
02:20:33,370 --> 02:20:35,090
I can pull a rabbit out of my hat.

5239
02:20:35,091 --> 02:20:37,130
I can't believe you want to see this.

5240
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:38,330
Like I don't understand it,

5241
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:42,890
but the idea that somehow or another
it's evil that a man wants it,

5242
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:44,150
but it's not evil that a woman,

5243
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:45,440
let's fucking preposterous.

5244
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:46,160
Who gives a shit.

5245
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:47,000
It's ridiculous.

5246
02:20:47,001 --> 02:20:48,920
I don't care if men wear high heels.

5247
02:20:48,921 --> 02:20:51,860
I don't care if women
dress like a fucking biker.

5248
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:54,020
I don't give a fuck as
long as you're nice.

5249
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:54,471
I mean,

5250
02:20:54,471 --> 02:20:54,770
I've,

5251
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:59,770
I have had friends and relations with
some of the weirdest fucking people across

5252
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:02,030
the full spectrum of humanity.

5253
02:21:02,031 --> 02:21:03,530
And all I care about is,

5254
02:21:03,531 --> 02:21:04,400
are you nice?

5255
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:06,320
Are you interesting to talk to?

5256
02:21:06,321 --> 02:21:07,310
Are you intelligent?

5257
02:21:07,550 --> 02:21:08,030
Can I,

5258
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:13,030
can I enjoy my time with you without
feeling like your judging me or you're

5259
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:16,100
being aggressive towards me or
passive aggressive towards me?

5260
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:16,970
And I mean,

5261
02:21:16,971 --> 02:21:18,290
I've had some of the weirdest,

5262
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:18,980
most,

5263
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:19,491
uh,

5264
02:21:19,491 --> 02:21:22,910
aggressive conversations with people
that are supposedly progressive,

5265
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:23,421
you know,

5266
02:21:23,421 --> 02:21:27,830
that decide before they even get
to talk to me that I'm the enemy,

5267
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,371
you know,

5268
02:21:28,371 --> 02:21:31,160
because I got tattoos
or I lift weights or I,

5269
02:21:31,161 --> 02:21:31,880
you know,

5270
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:33,620
compete in martial arts or I do,

5271
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:33,771
you know,

5272
02:21:33,771 --> 02:21:38,771
whatever the fuck it is that they
decided was what put me into this enemy.

5273
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:40,960
Bracka but those,

5274
02:21:40,970 --> 02:21:41,280
those,

5275
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:41,500
the,

5276
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:42,080
these,

5277
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:47,080
these insecurities that we have
like the live and let live ideal is,

5278
02:21:48,050 --> 02:21:48,291
is,

5279
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:50,750
is one of the best ways to live your life.

5280
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:51,950
This is live and let live.

5281
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:55,220
Don't create any enemies that
aren't really your enemy.

5282
02:21:55,810 --> 02:21:56,080
Yeah.

5283
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:56,310
Well,

5284
02:21:56,310 --> 02:21:56,951
and you know,

5285
02:21:56,951 --> 02:21:57,381
we,

5286
02:21:57,381 --> 02:21:58,840
we make it harder on ourselves.

5287
02:21:58,841 --> 02:21:59,021
You know,

5288
02:21:59,021 --> 02:21:59,920
when you look at that,

5289
02:21:59,921 --> 02:22:01,210
I mean the live and let live means,

5290
02:22:01,211 --> 02:22:01,620
hey look,

5291
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:06,010
be be concerned with your circle and be
tolerant of all those around and try to

5292
02:22:06,011 --> 02:22:06,641
understand,

5293
02:22:06,641 --> 02:22:06,791
right,

5294
02:22:06,791 --> 02:22:07,331
which we all,

5295
02:22:07,331 --> 02:22:08,290
we all make mistakes.

5296
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:09,153
Certainly I do.

5297
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:10,300
Um,

5298
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:12,280
we make it harder because
then you look at all these,

5299
02:22:12,281 --> 02:22:16,100
these new things that we have
that really bolster insecurity.

5300
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:17,470
If you look at Twitter for example,

5301
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:21,910
Twitter is this universe full
of all of us that are really,

5302
02:22:21,911 --> 02:22:24,250
really insecure looking for
other people's approval.

5303
02:22:24,670 --> 02:22:24,881
You know,

5304
02:22:24,881 --> 02:22:26,430
how can I think of the next statement

5305
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:27,660
that's going to get as many favorites,

5306
02:22:27,661 --> 02:22:27,991
likes,

5307
02:22:27,991 --> 02:22:30,750
retweets and getting
and get other people to,

5308
02:22:30,751 --> 02:22:31,584
to then,

5309
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:32,011
you know,

5310
02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:32,791
be friend to me.

5311
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:34,350
So I have so many and follow me.

5312
02:22:34,351 --> 02:22:35,430
And I mean it's,

5313
02:22:35,431 --> 02:22:39,570
it's everybody's trying to one up each
other and it's this environment where we

5314
02:22:39,571 --> 02:22:41,070
go out there looking to make,

5315
02:22:41,071 --> 02:22:41,370
I mean,

5316
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:44,000
how many times we get sniped
for everything you said.

5317
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:44,390
I mean,

5318
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:46,380
I can't call a fight card without,

5319
02:22:46,381 --> 02:22:46,531
I mean,

5320
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:46,860
look,

5321
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:49,290
we're talking for seven and a half hours,

5322
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:52,050
seven and a half hours is
how long we're talking.

5323
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:53,400
It's impossible.

5324
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,940
I challenge you to find somebody who's
going to talk for seven and a half hours

5325
02:22:56,941 --> 02:22:57,661
and not piss you off.

5326
02:22:57,661 --> 02:22:58,330
At least one.

5327
02:22:58,330 --> 02:23:00,580
Not only that you're calling a live fight.

5328
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:00,850
Well,

5329
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:05,150
we're shit is going down on the
spot and sometimes you're incorrect.

5330
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:05,600
Yeah,

5331
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:06,071
there's nothing,

5332
02:23:06,071 --> 02:23:06,940
there's no way around it.

5333
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:10,840
You're talking about two guys throwing
fucking bones at each other in a cage.

5334
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:11,650
I mean,

5335
02:23:11,650 --> 02:23:15,760
they're swinging at each other
and you make mistakes and you,

5336
02:23:15,770 --> 02:23:15,951
you,

5337
02:23:15,951 --> 02:23:16,161
you,

5338
02:23:16,161 --> 02:23:17,180
you don't see a choke.

5339
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:18,430
You miss a position,

5340
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:18,851
you know,

5341
02:23:18,851 --> 02:23:19,151
you,

5342
02:23:19,151 --> 02:23:19,421
you,

5343
02:23:19,421 --> 02:23:20,140
you the,

5344
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:21,100
it's going to happen.

5345
02:23:21,101 --> 02:23:25,330
But there's so many people out there
that just looking to point a finger and

5346
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:27,430
that's where Goldie gets in trouble.

5347
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:31,000
Goldberg fucking engages
with these people.

5348
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:33,430
I had to pull them aside
after the NFL thing.

5349
02:23:33,431 --> 02:23:33,671
I go,

5350
02:23:33,671 --> 02:23:33,881
dude,

5351
02:23:33,881 --> 02:23:35,470
I fucking told you about this before.

5352
02:23:35,471 --> 02:23:36,940
You can't argue with these people.

5353
02:23:36,941 --> 02:23:37,774
Why are you arguing?

5354
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:38,770
You don't even know them.

5355
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:39,220
Yeah.

5356
02:23:39,220 --> 02:23:39,771
Who knows who,

5357
02:23:39,771 --> 02:23:40,541
who they are,

5358
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:41,590
who knows what they're doing.

5359
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:42,221
Some of them,

5360
02:23:42,221 --> 02:23:43,210
they don't even have an Avatar.

5361
02:23:43,211 --> 02:23:44,010
It's an egg.

5362
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:44,200
Yeah.

5363
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:45,490
And even if it isn't Avatar,

5364
02:23:45,491 --> 02:23:46,010
who the fuck,

5365
02:23:46,010 --> 02:23:47,400
how do you know if it's that them,

5366
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:49,210
it could be anybody.

5367
02:23:49,211 --> 02:23:53,560
They could have taken a picture out of
a fucking magazine taking a camera photo

5368
02:23:53,561 --> 02:23:54,394
of that picture.

5369
02:23:54,430 --> 02:23:55,540
Use that as an Avatar.

5370
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:56,351
You're a fat fuck.

5371
02:23:56,351 --> 02:23:57,071
You don't even know them.

5372
02:23:57,071 --> 02:23:57,431
Yeah.

5373
02:23:57,431 --> 02:23:58,390
I don't even know what they look like.

5374
02:23:58,391 --> 02:23:59,224
You have no idea.

5375
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:00,970
You're arguing with fucking goats.

5376
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:02,210
Well,

5377
02:24:02,210 --> 02:24:03,250
and the thing is too,

5378
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:04,181
that people have to is,

5379
02:24:04,181 --> 02:24:05,050
is the people

5380
02:24:05,090 --> 02:24:08,930
well that will engage like he
does in a lot of instances.

5381
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:12,740
They tend to be very passionate
and care a lot about what they do.

5382
02:24:12,741 --> 02:24:14,390
So it's easy to lure them in there.

5383
02:24:14,391 --> 02:24:18,800
So while you're trying to destroy them
and you're trying to break them down,

5384
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:20,690
at least understanding
knowledge like that,

5385
02:24:20,691 --> 02:24:23,370
they really do care about their job and
the product they're putting out there.

5386
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:25,160
They're trying to be good.

5387
02:24:25,550 --> 02:24:26,030
Um,

5388
02:24:26,030 --> 02:24:29,210
and obviously maybe they made some
mistakes and you were able to lure them in

5389
02:24:29,211 --> 02:24:30,800
into to saying things they didn't mean.

5390
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:32,520
But there are guys out there,

5391
02:24:32,521 --> 02:24:32,851
you know,

5392
02:24:32,851 --> 02:24:34,200
I don't want to name any names,

5393
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:38,580
but there are guys out there
that do commentary for MMA
that should not be doing

5394
02:24:38,581 --> 02:24:39,120
it.

5395
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:40,950
And I can't listen.

5396
02:24:40,951 --> 02:24:44,130
There's guys that I can't listen to that
I literally have to turn the fucking

5397
02:24:44,131 --> 02:24:46,370
volume down and other
organizations because they,

5398
02:24:46,590 --> 02:24:47,760
they just drive me crazy.

5399
02:24:47,761 --> 02:24:48,081
They did.

5400
02:24:48,081 --> 02:24:49,470
I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

5401
02:24:49,471 --> 02:24:50,610
They don't know what
they're talking about.

5402
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:51,660
And I get crazy.

5403
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:52,650
So I understand it.

5404
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:54,180
And if you think I'm one of those guys,

5405
02:24:54,181 --> 02:24:54,780
I get it.

5406
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,613
I think you're wrong,

5407
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:56,473
but I get it.

5408
02:24:56,550 --> 02:24:57,420
I understand.

5409
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,710
But I,

5410
02:24:59,130 --> 02:24:59,970
I think this,

5411
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,510
this ability to reach people
and to express your opinion,

5412
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:06,180
it's way more valuable than it's negative.

5413
02:25:06,730 --> 02:25:08,090
I get a lot out of it.

5414
02:25:08,091 --> 02:25:09,480
I get a lot of the underground,

5415
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:12,180
I get a lot of the criticism
and sometimes the right,

5416
02:25:12,181 --> 02:25:12,391
I mean,

5417
02:25:12,391 --> 02:25:13,240
I'm not all perfect.

5418
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:13,950
Absolutely.

5419
02:25:13,950 --> 02:25:16,560
I fuck up call sometimes or I'll,

5420
02:25:16,590 --> 02:25:16,861
you know,

5421
02:25:16,861 --> 02:25:18,360
miss things or you know,

5422
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:20,310
one of the things that
people need to consider,

5423
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:21,490
you don't need to consider,

5424
02:25:21,490 --> 02:25:22,890
but when you're watching fights,

5425
02:25:22,891 --> 02:25:24,220
you're watching in the octagon.

5426
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,360
When we're watching,

5427
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:26,710
there's oftentimes like,

5428
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:28,150
I think a punch landed,

5429
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:28,691
but it really,

5430
02:25:28,691 --> 02:25:31,350
a guy tripped and it's because
of the guys back is to me.

5431
02:25:31,351 --> 02:25:34,900
And you can't tell if someone's standing
and your back's to you and someone

5432
02:25:34,901 --> 02:25:37,510
throws a punch and they
see the guy fall backwards.

5433
02:25:37,511 --> 02:25:39,790
You think the guy got
hurt and then they're,

5434
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:42,220
the people that are watching at home
have the benefit of watching it from the

5435
02:25:42,221 --> 02:25:43,870
side and they're seeing a punch,

5436
02:25:43,871 --> 02:25:44,704
not land.

5437
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,030
All that kind of stuff happens.

5438
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:46,893
You,

5439
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:48,910
you could watch the monitors I guess.

5440
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:49,960
And sometimes I do,

5441
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:50,741
but man,

5442
02:25:50,741 --> 02:25:51,730
I want to watch it live.

5443
02:25:51,731 --> 02:25:52,600
I don't watch those fucking

5444
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:54,680
monitors so much better to watch live,

5445
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:55,011
you know,

5446
02:25:55,011 --> 02:25:55,844
as a fan.

5447
02:25:56,060 --> 02:25:56,390
And you know,

5448
02:25:56,390 --> 02:25:59,750
I tried to stick to the monitors because
I remember the first card I call was in

5449
02:25:59,751 --> 02:26:04,130
Rio when Phil Davis Fault Yoda Machita
and Machita through a whole bunch of his

5450
02:26:04,131 --> 02:26:06,770
blitzes going away from me in India,

5451
02:26:06,771 --> 02:26:07,431
Phil Davidson,

5452
02:26:07,431 --> 02:26:10,010
it looked like they all landed and
I watched some of the replaced,

5453
02:26:10,011 --> 02:26:10,940
not all of them landed.

5454
02:26:10,941 --> 02:26:11,481
So it was,

5455
02:26:11,481 --> 02:26:14,810
it was one of those difficult things
where with the monitor I think I can,

5456
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:16,190
I can see more.

5457
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,970
Um,

5458
02:26:16,970 --> 02:26:18,800
but there's times when
they're close to me,

5459
02:26:18,830 --> 02:26:19,700
I can't help it.

5460
02:26:19,701 --> 02:26:24,260
I want to look through the cage because
I need to get in wrapped into that fight

5461
02:26:24,261 --> 02:26:25,880
and feel the crowd feel them.

5462
02:26:25,881 --> 02:26:26,271
Because look,

5463
02:26:26,271 --> 02:26:26,421
it's,

5464
02:26:26,421 --> 02:26:28,340
it's our job to,

5465
02:26:28,341 --> 02:26:29,660
to be provocative,

5466
02:26:29,870 --> 02:26:31,280
to break things down,

5467
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:34,220
to make it entertaining and
all our true to do that.

5468
02:26:34,310 --> 02:26:35,840
There's also a voice in our ear,

5469
02:26:35,841 --> 02:26:38,600
multiple voices in our ear
telling us all kinds of wild,

5470
02:26:38,601 --> 02:26:39,111
hey look,

5471
02:26:39,111 --> 02:26:40,810
I've got the replay and was a Headbutt,

5472
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:41,031
you know,

5473
02:26:41,031 --> 02:26:41,510
so there's,

5474
02:26:41,510 --> 02:26:42,081
there's things,

5475
02:26:42,081 --> 02:26:45,470
there's lots of things going on
during that seven hour period.

5476
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:46,280
Um,

5477
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:48,770
that that can also lead to
a distraction or lead to,

5478
02:26:48,771 --> 02:26:49,604
to a misstep.

5479
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:50,180
Those,

5480
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:50,610
those

5481
02:26:50,610 --> 02:26:51,480
voices in your ear,

5482
02:26:51,481 --> 02:26:53,050
a brutal when you're
in the middle of talk,

5483
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:55,770
it's like a big point
you're trying to make.

5484
02:26:55,771 --> 02:26:56,720
And then someone's like,

5485
02:26:56,730 --> 02:26:56,890
well,

5486
02:26:56,890 --> 02:26:58,040
we got a replay on Ron.

5487
02:26:58,041 --> 02:26:58,320
You know,

5488
02:26:58,320 --> 02:26:59,250
look at your monitor,

5489
02:26:59,251 --> 02:27:00,001
look at the B monitor.

5490
02:27:00,001 --> 02:27:00,890
Like Ah,

5491
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:01,521
and you,

5492
02:27:01,521 --> 02:27:05,880
you hear someone talking in your ear
while you're talking and you know that a

5493
02:27:05,881 --> 02:27:09,450
fucking million and a half people
are here plus our hearing you.

5494
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:12,390
And then who knows how many fucking
people are gonna hear over the course of

5495
02:27:12,391 --> 02:27:13,224
time.

5496
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:14,790
They're going to listen to that,

5497
02:27:14,820 --> 02:27:15,780
that broadcast.

5498
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:17,250
I watched that Phil Davis,

5499
02:27:17,251 --> 02:27:18,540
Leo Machida fight the other day.

5500
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,400
It was way closer than I thought it was.

5501
02:27:20,610 --> 02:27:21,061
And a,

5502
02:27:21,061 --> 02:27:22,200
I could see Phil winning.

5503
02:27:22,201 --> 02:27:22,471
I mean,

5504
02:27:22,471 --> 02:27:25,440
Phil did get takedowns and
did do damage on the ground.

5505
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:28,020
And like you were saying
like a lot of those shots,

5506
02:27:28,021 --> 02:27:29,280
that mosquito is very,

5507
02:27:29,281 --> 02:27:29,701
very,

5508
02:27:29,701 --> 02:27:30,780
very close fight.

5509
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:33,240
But a lot of people were calling in
one of the greatest robberies ever.

5510
02:27:33,241 --> 02:27:33,991
But man,

5511
02:27:33,991 --> 02:27:34,711
I watched it again.

5512
02:27:34,711 --> 02:27:35,010
I was like,

5513
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:35,251
Ooh,

5514
02:27:35,251 --> 02:27:35,731
I don't think,

5515
02:27:35,731 --> 02:27:36,564
not so much.

5516
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:38,040
And I don't think it's one
of the greatest robberies.

5517
02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:39,260
It's very fucking close.

5518
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:41,250
And even the Cheadle Italia and you know,

5519
02:27:41,430 --> 02:27:44,580
when I talked to him before
his fight with CBD Holloway,

5520
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:44,971
you know,

5521
02:27:44,971 --> 02:27:49,830
he's had to adapt his style though
because he had a whole bunch of really

5522
02:27:49,831 --> 02:27:50,940
contested decisions.

5523
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:51,541
You know,

5524
02:27:51,541 --> 02:27:54,720
his rampage Jackson fight
his fight with Phil Davis.

5525
02:27:54,721 --> 02:27:57,690
He was leaving a lot of
fights where he felt like,

5526
02:27:57,691 --> 02:27:58,021
okay,

5527
02:27:58,021 --> 02:27:58,231
look,

5528
02:27:58,231 --> 02:27:59,640
I was in total control,

5529
02:28:00,060 --> 02:28:00,893
but he didn't.

5530
02:28:00,930 --> 02:28:01,101
He,

5531
02:28:01,101 --> 02:28:01,351
you know,

5532
02:28:01,351 --> 02:28:03,120
he made it confusing for the judges.

5533
02:28:03,121 --> 02:28:03,721
And when you do that,

5534
02:28:03,721 --> 02:28:03,931
look,

5535
02:28:03,931 --> 02:28:04,800
judges are human too.

5536
02:28:04,801 --> 02:28:07,380
We've talked all tonight about
how flawed we are as humans.

5537
02:28:07,390 --> 02:28:08,340
We all make mistakes.

5538
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:12,930
And that happens there that absolutely
you've got to do the things he's had to

5539
02:28:12,931 --> 02:28:13,830
get more aggressive.

5540
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:16,920
He can't just counter punch his head to
get a little bit more offensive with his

5541
02:28:16,921 --> 02:28:21,650
style to ensure that he's going to get
those decisions because if doesn't get

5542
02:28:21,651 --> 02:28:21,741
them,

5543
02:28:21,741 --> 02:28:22,160
he can't

5544
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:24,800
be totally disappointed when he's
got a little bit of a passive style.

5545
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:25,101
Yeah,

5546
02:28:25,101 --> 02:28:28,430
I'm glad he went down to one 85 I think
he should have been there all along,

5547
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:31,760
but she does one of those guys who would
weigh in at two oh three two oh four

5548
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:32,780
didn't cut any weight,

5549
02:28:32,940 --> 02:28:33,860
not crazy.

5550
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:34,850
And he's not a huge,

5551
02:28:34,851 --> 02:28:35,690
he's not a huge middle weight.

5552
02:28:35,691 --> 02:28:35,871
I mean,

5553
02:28:35,871 --> 02:28:36,530
he walks,

5554
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:37,363
he'll be,

5555
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:37,821
you know,

5556
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:41,410
one 97 196 when I fought at middle weight,

5557
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:45,320
I would show up to the venue
at two oh seven on Tuesday,

5558
02:28:45,650 --> 02:28:47,600
make one 85 Friday,

5559
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:49,820
fight back at tool seven on Saturday.

5560
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:50,661
That was crazy.

5561
02:28:50,661 --> 02:28:51,860
And I was big then.

5562
02:28:51,861 --> 02:28:53,600
Now I look at these dudes now.

5563
02:28:53,601 --> 02:28:55,070
I mean they're almost
all like that anymore.

5564
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:55,900
Well look at Weidman.

5565
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:56,733
Why machine?

5566
02:28:57,080 --> 02:29:02,080
He's a big fucking guy to 25 to 30 he's
a big thick guy and he's strong as shit.

5567
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:06,470
And that's one of the things I think
Machita realized in that fight.

5568
02:29:06,471 --> 02:29:06,621
Like,

5569
02:29:06,621 --> 02:29:07,010
wow,

5570
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:08,180
I'm not a big middle weight.

5571
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:08,591
No.

5572
02:29:08,591 --> 02:29:09,800
You know when you're fighting Weidman,

5573
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:13,220
you unload everything but the kitchen
sink and then he waves the in afterwards.

5574
02:29:13,580 --> 02:29:17,330
I mean he unloaded on Weidman and Weidman
was still there and the fact that why,

5575
02:29:17,331 --> 02:29:21,950
I mean who thought round one Weidman gets
rate and Machida's face and starts out

5576
02:29:21,951 --> 02:29:23,120
striking first three rounds,

5577
02:29:23,121 --> 02:29:24,440
he out struck Machita.

5578
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:27,020
Now it's not a pure kickboxing match.

5579
02:29:27,021 --> 02:29:30,620
The threat of the takedown certainly
opens up your arsenal more and limits

5580
02:29:30,621 --> 02:29:31,454
Leo's,

5581
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:32,630
but it was still,

5582
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:36,830
we've never seen someone go in there
and take that route towards beating

5583
02:29:36,831 --> 02:29:37,340
Machita.

5584
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:37,521
Well,

5585
02:29:37,521 --> 02:29:41,600
he's very confident in his chin and his
knock out power and he also has a really

5586
02:29:41,601 --> 02:29:43,070
good sense of distance.

5587
02:29:43,090 --> 02:29:43,400
Yeah.

5588
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:45,110
That's one thing that people
don't give him enough credit.

5589
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:47,300
They think he's just his
face forward attacking guy.

5590
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:50,600
Now he moves in and then he moves
back and he moves in and moves back.

5591
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:54,720
He's throwing faints a lot and breed
long goes such a good fucking striking

5592
02:29:54,721 --> 02:29:55,430
coach.

5593
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:56,930
Especially with wrestlers,

5594
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:59,570
you know that he really
understands how to,

5595
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,200
how to teach those guys how to,

5596
02:30:01,330 --> 02:30:06,330
how to fight with the constant threat
of the takedown and then attack off of

5597
02:30:06,771 --> 02:30:07,221
those.

5598
02:30:07,221 --> 02:30:08,480
Off of those opportunities.

5599
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:12,200
You talk about controlling distanced
me when someone knocks you out with a

5600
02:30:12,210 --> 02:30:13,520
counter elbow.

5601
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:14,090
Yeah.

5602
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:14,910
How often?

5603
02:30:14,910 --> 02:30:19,880
I mean that is really hard to do to
Timon elbow on a counter strike and knock

5604
02:30:19,881 --> 02:30:20,714
somebody out.

5605
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:23,060
I mean that's understanding
the range of your opponent,

5606
02:30:23,061 --> 02:30:24,650
how far they're a feel.

5607
02:30:24,830 --> 02:30:28,820
It's a feel that not every fighter has
and Chris definitely hasn't yet long ago.

5608
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:30,680
Well it was also one of
those guys technically,

5609
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:31,521
but he also,

5610
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:34,460
I think he makes his fighters feel like
they're better than they should be.

5611
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:36,950
Like he makes them feel like their rate
or run through that brick wall cause

5612
02:30:36,951 --> 02:30:39,880
he's just that tough
northeast gritty do like,

5613
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:40,851
hey ray,

5614
02:30:40,851 --> 02:30:42,660
how do you think he's going
to do against Weidman and end?

5615
02:30:42,661 --> 02:30:43,730
He told me two days before the flight,

5616
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:45,620
aw he's Brian,

5617
02:30:45,621 --> 02:30:46,520
he's going to smoke them.

5618
02:30:46,610 --> 02:30:48,350
This'll be ego run rate the room.

5619
02:30:48,351 --> 02:30:48,531
It's,

5620
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:51,260
it's so funny to hear his
confidence and how tough he is.

5621
02:30:51,470 --> 02:30:51,621
Well,

5622
02:30:51,621 --> 02:30:54,470
he told me it was one of
Weidman's earlier victories.

5623
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:55,310
Um,

5624
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:56,050
I think,

5625
02:30:56,050 --> 02:30:56,883
uh,

5626
02:30:57,020 --> 02:30:59,000
I think after he fought Tom Lawler,

5627
02:30:59,530 --> 02:30:59,960
um,

5628
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:00,500
he,

5629
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,040
he,

5630
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,380
I was in the cage with
them and ray long goes,

5631
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:04,790
he's a motherfucker.

5632
02:31:05,030 --> 02:31:06,470
I'm telling you his kids,

5633
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:11,480
a motherfucker think he said to
me about why and when he goes,

5634
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:13,130
we're all lucky he's fighting.

5635
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:14,353
Trust me,

5636
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:18,620
we're all lucky he's in a fucking cage
fighting because if he was out there,

5637
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:20,040
if he didn't have an outlet,

5638
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:21,090
oh Christ,

5639
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:21,840
no shows.

5640
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,820
I've seen some shit with
this kid and the gym.

5641
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:27,730
That'd be a great land and will be
a great Reebok tee shirt for wide.

5642
02:31:27,740 --> 02:31:28,220
All luck.

5643
02:31:28,220 --> 02:31:32,100
He's fighting it that or he's a
motherfucker when you look at him too.

5644
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:34,680
He's so handsome and so it looks so nice.

5645
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:38,130
He's a little more respectable looking
young man to be such a fucking murderer

5646
02:31:38,131 --> 02:31:38,460
in there.

5647
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:39,061
He did that.

5648
02:31:39,061 --> 02:31:39,621
He did the,

5649
02:31:39,621 --> 02:31:40,920
the desk show at this one time.

5650
02:31:40,921 --> 02:31:41,760
He's got his wife,

5651
02:31:41,761 --> 02:31:42,810
his kids up there.

5652
02:31:42,811 --> 02:31:43,860
And it's like you said,

5653
02:31:44,010 --> 02:31:45,290
just because someone's a fighter,

5654
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:47,100
does it mean it they're this aggressive,

5655
02:31:47,101 --> 02:31:47,990
atrocious human being.

5656
02:31:47,991 --> 02:31:51,480
An exact Frankie Edgar's one
of the greatest guys ever.

5657
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:54,600
And probably the pound
for pound or forget,

5658
02:31:54,601 --> 02:31:55,230
wait,

5659
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:57,480
toughest guy in the UFC?

5660
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:58,380
He's a savage.

5661
02:31:58,440 --> 02:31:58,710
Yeah,

5662
02:31:58,710 --> 02:32:01,040
I mean gritty like the,

5663
02:32:01,060 --> 02:32:01,250
the,

5664
02:32:01,250 --> 02:32:04,290
the heart that that guy has and
the pace that he puts on you.

5665
02:32:04,290 --> 02:32:04,561
I mean,

5666
02:32:04,561 --> 02:32:05,190
he'd go,

5667
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:09,190
I think that guy pays
for pace is like there's,

5668
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:11,310
there's almost no one who could beat that.

5669
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:15,840
There's almost no one who has a work ethic
like him in pain doesn't register the

5670
02:32:15,841 --> 02:32:16,621
same with him,

5671
02:32:16,621 --> 02:32:16,871
you know?

5672
02:32:16,871 --> 02:32:16,961
And,

5673
02:32:16,961 --> 02:32:18,120
and he's totally sane.

5674
02:32:18,121 --> 02:32:19,020
We've had some fires,

5675
02:32:19,021 --> 02:32:19,471
Nafta and that.

5676
02:32:19,471 --> 02:32:20,700
I don't think pain registered with you.

5677
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:21,660
I don't think they were all there.

5678
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:22,620
You know,

5679
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:24,750
Frankie's a guy that
when he feels it hurt,

5680
02:32:24,751 --> 02:32:25,501
his heart's burning,

5681
02:32:25,501 --> 02:32:26,191
his lungs built,

5682
02:32:26,191 --> 02:32:26,551
burning,

5683
02:32:26,551 --> 02:32:27,181
he just teaches,

5684
02:32:27,181 --> 02:32:28,140
tells himself to go forward.

5685
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:29,040
He just keeps going.

5686
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:30,001
And the other thing I,

5687
02:32:30,001 --> 02:32:30,660
you know,

5688
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:31,950
when you see a mountain public,

5689
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:33,173
none of it's gone.

5690
02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:33,451
I mean,

5691
02:32:33,451 --> 02:32:37,050
he's still the same kid that'll go eat
like a bowl of pasta down to the local,

5692
02:32:37,070 --> 02:32:39,240
you know that the corner
store with everybody.

5693
02:32:39,241 --> 02:32:39,541
And that's,

5694
02:32:39,541 --> 02:32:39,721
I mean,

5695
02:32:39,721 --> 02:32:41,700
his whole community just loves that guy.

5696
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:42,181
Yeah.

5697
02:32:42,181 --> 02:32:42,990
He's a great guy.

5698
02:32:42,990 --> 02:32:43,471
He is.

5699
02:32:43,471 --> 02:32:43,801
He's it.

5700
02:32:43,801 --> 02:32:45,240
He's a is a perfect example.

5701
02:32:45,241 --> 02:32:45,721
What you were saying,

5702
02:32:45,721 --> 02:32:46,980
like you'd think of a cage fighter,

5703
02:32:46,981 --> 02:32:48,360
especially a champion,

5704
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:49,590
a championship level,

5705
02:32:49,591 --> 02:32:52,590
UFC fighter in this nicest
fucking guy you ever want to meet.

5706
02:32:52,591 --> 02:32:53,160
Yeah,

5707
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:53,490
yeah.

5708
02:32:53,490 --> 02:32:55,140
There's a lot of those in this sport.

5709
02:32:55,170 --> 02:32:58,350
There's a lot of those guys in the
sport that defy the stereotypes.

5710
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:00,630
And that's one of the things that
I love about the sport and the,

5711
02:33:00,631 --> 02:33:01,920
one of the reasons for that I think,

5712
02:33:01,921 --> 02:33:03,960
is that so many fighters,

5713
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:08,130
they develop this understanding
of who they really are in the gym.

5714
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:09,360
This you can't have,

5715
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:12,600
you can have an unchecked ego
and be a basketball player.

5716
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:13,051
You know,

5717
02:33:13,051 --> 02:33:15,840
you could really think of the fucking
greatest thing since sliced bread.

5718
02:33:15,870 --> 02:33:19,320
You're slammed Dunkin people because
you're not getting strangled every day.

5719
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:21,120
You're not getting guys with a run,

5720
02:33:21,121 --> 02:33:24,630
a fresh guy in every five minutes and
they're all murderers and they're all just

5721
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:26,071
on top of you,

5722
02:33:26,071 --> 02:33:28,410
smothering you need and you in the Dick,

5723
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:29,191
you know you're not,

5724
02:33:29,191 --> 02:33:30,240
you're not getting that.

5725
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:35,430
And that humility that you get from
training and tapping and losing and,

5726
02:33:35,700 --> 02:33:37,170
and getting it all beaten out of you.

5727
02:33:37,171 --> 02:33:42,171
Also the aggression that you expend in
the gym to just blow it all out of your

5728
02:33:42,361 --> 02:33:43,080
system.

5729
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:45,420
You don't have any need
to get in fights outside.

5730
02:33:45,690 --> 02:33:46,980
And you know what I've noticed too,

5731
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:48,870
it for me at least
personally helped me a lot.

5732
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:51,720
When you go through this
really hard workouts,

5733
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,090
you get on with this,

5734
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:54,023
when it's over,

5735
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:58,020
you get this moment of almost
euphoria where you gain perspective.

5736
02:33:58,460 --> 02:33:58,730
And,

5737
02:33:58,730 --> 02:33:59,760
and for me,

5738
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:00,810
you know,

5739
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:05,520
MMA fighting help me with a lot of demons
that I carried over that I never had

5740
02:34:05,521 --> 02:34:06,071
issues with them.

5741
02:34:06,071 --> 02:34:07,230
I in my personal life,

5742
02:34:07,470 --> 02:34:07,711
you know,

5743
02:34:07,711 --> 02:34:10,710
because I had fighting is
my outlet and you know,

5744
02:34:10,711 --> 02:34:14,160
you would finish these workouts or you'd
finish a fight and have the high of

5745
02:34:14,161 --> 02:34:17,890
winning a fight and it would give you
this perspective on your life and all of a

5746
02:34:17,891 --> 02:34:18,100
sudden

5747
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:18,933
you have more of this,

5748
02:34:19,090 --> 02:34:22,840
this clear thought process to make
decisions and not rush decisions or see

5749
02:34:22,841 --> 02:34:25,600
things a little more clearly
and not get angry about x,

5750
02:34:25,601 --> 02:34:25,811
y,

5751
02:34:25,811 --> 02:34:28,990
or z because all of a sudden now you're
seeing them a little differently and you

5752
02:34:28,991 --> 02:34:30,100
get that when you're,

5753
02:34:30,250 --> 02:34:31,450
when you're exhausted.

5754
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:32,330
Yeah,

5755
02:34:32,330 --> 02:34:32,571
yeah.

5756
02:34:32,571 --> 02:34:33,091
When you did,

5757
02:34:33,091 --> 02:34:36,740
you've expended all your
biological need for aggression,

5758
02:34:36,890 --> 02:34:38,030
which men,

5759
02:34:38,090 --> 02:34:39,380
you have to stoss throne.

5760
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:40,221
You have a dick.

5761
02:34:40,221 --> 02:34:40,731
It works.

5762
02:34:40,731 --> 02:34:40,941
I mean,

5763
02:34:40,941 --> 02:34:43,220
this is a reason why people go to war.

5764
02:34:43,221 --> 02:34:45,440
All this stuff is a part of our genetics.

5765
02:34:45,441 --> 02:34:46,670
It's a part of our DNA.

5766
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:48,020
And to expend it,

5767
02:34:48,021 --> 02:34:53,021
to just get it all out of your system
creates this balance and that balance

5768
02:34:53,870 --> 02:34:55,430
doesn't exist in a lot of people.

5769
02:34:55,431 --> 02:34:59,660
There's a lot of people out there that
have this unaddressed aggression inside

5770
02:34:59,661 --> 02:34:59,990
of them.

5771
02:34:59,990 --> 02:35:02,570
That's why I see people that
would never get into a fight.

5772
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:03,381
Fuck you.

5773
02:35:03,381 --> 02:35:04,041
They're in their car,

5774
02:35:04,041 --> 02:35:06,530
they're fucking finger in
people and lay it on a horse.

5775
02:35:06,531 --> 02:35:07,281
I'm screaming.

5776
02:35:07,281 --> 02:35:08,900
It's like this is their release.

5777
02:35:08,901 --> 02:35:10,670
Like they don't have a real release.

5778
02:35:10,790 --> 02:35:12,830
And so since we're not living in a world,

5779
02:35:12,831 --> 02:35:17,060
we have to worry about barbarians running
over the hill with broad swords every

5780
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:20,360
couple of weeks and you're not fighting
off Jaguars that are trying to kill your

5781
02:35:20,361 --> 02:35:21,320
babies and eat them.

5782
02:35:21,350 --> 02:35:21,621
You,

5783
02:35:21,621 --> 02:35:21,831
you,

5784
02:35:21,831 --> 02:35:22,220
you,

5785
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:26,420
we go through this life with all these
genetic needs that are never met.

5786
02:35:26,890 --> 02:35:27,201
You know?

5787
02:35:27,201 --> 02:35:27,920
I mean,

5788
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:29,550
in many ways it,

5789
02:35:29,551 --> 02:35:34,310
it's just the downfall of our
culture that I've always said,

5790
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:36,770
if you want to get rid of bullying,

5791
02:35:36,890 --> 02:35:37,880
teach people how to fight.

5792
02:35:38,060 --> 02:35:39,440
And a lot of people
think that that's like,

5793
02:35:39,441 --> 02:35:40,370
that's counterintuitive.

5794
02:35:40,371 --> 02:35:41,121
That's ridiculous.

5795
02:35:41,121 --> 02:35:43,280
Like you're going to make bullies
that know how to fight better.

5796
02:35:43,281 --> 02:35:44,560
The stronger blue's gonna Merge,

5797
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:45,980
they're gonna kick everybody's ass.

5798
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,480
I bet not.

5799
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:48,410
I bet not.

5800
02:35:48,410 --> 02:35:50,810
I bet what you're going to do is you're
going to get people that have a greater

5801
02:35:50,811 --> 02:35:53,330
understanding of where this
aggression is coming from,

5802
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:54,710
where their bullying is coming.

5803
02:35:54,730 --> 02:35:57,260
They will understand this is
a lot of it is insecurity.

5804
02:35:57,310 --> 02:35:57,611
Yes,

5805
02:35:57,611 --> 02:35:58,291
exactly.

5806
02:35:58,291 --> 02:36:01,180
It confidence is the number
one deterrent for bullies.

5807
02:36:01,181 --> 02:36:03,550
If bully bullies don't
bully confident kids,

5808
02:36:03,551 --> 02:36:04,360
they just don't.

5809
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:08,410
If there's a possible threat that
that kid may hit you back or,

5810
02:36:08,411 --> 02:36:09,550
or may actually beat you,

5811
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:10,450
they're not going to bully you.

5812
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:12,100
And so I would talk to parents,

5813
02:36:12,101 --> 02:36:12,281
you know,

5814
02:36:12,281 --> 02:36:13,330
when I would teach kids,

5815
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:14,010
um,

5816
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:15,100
all the time that look,

5817
02:36:15,101 --> 02:36:15,790
you know,

5818
02:36:15,790 --> 02:36:17,980
learning to defend
yourself as a life skill.

5819
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,830
It's a life skill to learn how to do that.

5820
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:22,150
And it gives you,

5821
02:36:22,151 --> 02:36:23,650
it bleeds into other areas.

5822
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:24,101
You know,

5823
02:36:24,101 --> 02:36:27,160
if you can push yourself
and get comfortable as in
these really uncomfortable

5824
02:36:27,161 --> 02:36:27,994
situations,

5825
02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:30,700
it's going to help you when you have
to go and maybe speak in front of the

5826
02:36:30,701 --> 02:36:31,360
class.

5827
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:31,481
You know,

5828
02:36:31,481 --> 02:36:34,290
the first time you grapple
against somebody with all that Pr,

5829
02:36:34,300 --> 02:36:35,650
I mean you get the kids get nervous.

5830
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:36,640
And when I would train,

5831
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:39,610
I would train marines and the first
time it would make them grapple.

5832
02:36:39,611 --> 02:36:39,911
I had,

5833
02:36:39,911 --> 02:36:41,680
I had one that threw up right after.

5834
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:43,001
There's so much pride.

5835
02:36:43,001 --> 02:36:43,780
They were afraid.

5836
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:47,470
I got tapped out for all my other
classmates and it's such an Alpha Male,

5837
02:36:47,471 --> 02:36:47,831
you know,

5838
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:48,461
play and,

5839
02:36:48,461 --> 02:36:51,040
and they got so nervous
a couple of weeks later.

5840
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:51,431
I mean,

5841
02:36:51,431 --> 02:36:53,950
they're all in and they're
comfortable in that environment.

5842
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:56,080
Maybe now public speaking comes more,

5843
02:36:56,081 --> 02:36:56,501
you know,

5844
02:36:56,501 --> 02:36:57,071
more naturally.

5845
02:36:57,071 --> 02:36:57,461
I mean they,

5846
02:36:57,461 --> 02:36:59,140
they get that fear and they get over it.

5847
02:36:59,141 --> 02:37:00,850
That bleeds into other areas of your life.

5848
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:01,803
No doubt.

5849
02:37:01,820 --> 02:37:02,080
No.

5850
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:05,220
I mean I've seen people in class
for the first time hyperventilating,

5851
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:07,410
not like guys who've
done all sorts of sports,

5852
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:10,200
but someone mounts him and all sudden
you see them like they can't fucking

5853
02:37:10,201 --> 02:37:10,891
breathe and you're like,

5854
02:37:10,891 --> 02:37:11,724
calm down dude.

5855
02:37:11,850 --> 02:37:12,990
Think of this as a game.

5856
02:37:12,991 --> 02:37:13,920
You're playing pool here,

5857
02:37:13,921 --> 02:37:14,970
you're playing basketball.

5858
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:15,771
It's a game.

5859
02:37:15,771 --> 02:37:16,150
It's just,

5860
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:17,900
it's game of arm bars and chokes.

5861
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:18,311
You know,

5862
02:37:18,311 --> 02:37:20,360
you mess around with some of
these pro football players.

5863
02:37:20,361 --> 02:37:20,601
You know,

5864
02:37:20,601 --> 02:37:20,801
I've,

5865
02:37:20,801 --> 02:37:23,510
I've spent some time with Glaser
who trains a lot of those NFL guys.

5866
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:27,050
You mess around with them and you start
dominating them and they start to panic.

5867
02:37:27,230 --> 02:37:30,410
Their egos are so big and
there's so you wait a minute,

5868
02:37:30,411 --> 02:37:33,140
why is this smaller guy than
me doing to me what he's doing?

5869
02:37:33,141 --> 02:37:34,850
And they begin to panic
and hyperventilate.

5870
02:37:34,851 --> 02:37:35,684
Just like you said.

5871
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:37,960
Well it's also football players.

5872
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:39,200
They never really go.

5873
02:37:39,201 --> 02:37:41,090
I mean they kind of go one on one,

5874
02:37:41,270 --> 02:37:44,570
but for these brief moments
and then whistles are blown,

5875
02:37:44,571 --> 02:37:46,650
flags are raised seconds.

5876
02:37:47,330 --> 02:37:52,100
You don't have to have that dig down deep
Frankie Edgar type heart and very few

5877
02:37:52,101 --> 02:37:52,611
of them do.

5878
02:37:52,611 --> 02:37:56,300
That's why it's so rare when you see a
guy like Hershel Walker subjects himself

5879
02:37:56,301 --> 02:38:00,530
to that shit in his late forties
what a fucking stud that guy is.

5880
02:38:00,531 --> 02:38:02,330
He's the scariest guy of all time,

5881
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:03,800
48 years old,

5882
02:38:03,801 --> 02:38:06,620
smashing people in strike
force and you just go,

5883
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:07,060
what?

5884
02:38:07,060 --> 02:38:11,600
I mean he probably would be like John
Jones if he started into his ego his young

5885
02:38:11,601 --> 02:38:12,020
days.

5886
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:14,990
I mean the athleticism he had and
little his physique at that age,

5887
02:38:14,991 --> 02:38:16,490
you just push ups and sit ups.

5888
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:17,630
I don't believe him.

5889
02:38:17,810 --> 02:38:18,620
I really don't.

5890
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:22,010
Cause he says a lot of shit that's
just not scientifically possible.

5891
02:38:22,310 --> 02:38:22,851
Like he says,

5892
02:38:22,851 --> 02:38:27,851
he only eats a salad and one meal a day
that's a here to fucking be so skinny.

5893
02:38:28,430 --> 02:38:29,190
Well,

5894
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:30,830
and I don't think he's the lion.

5895
02:38:30,890 --> 02:38:31,760
This is what I think.

5896
02:38:31,790 --> 02:38:32,181
He,

5897
02:38:32,181 --> 02:38:35,060
he has trauma induced,

5898
02:38:35,230 --> 02:38:35,840
um,

5899
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:40,610
issues that he's had from football where
he has multiple personality disorder.

5900
02:38:40,850 --> 02:38:41,181
I mean,

5901
02:38:41,181 --> 02:38:43,160
he's spoken openly about those,

5902
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:45,950
that he has more than one
person inside of his head.

5903
02:38:45,951 --> 02:38:50,660
And I know he's dealt with
this variety of different ways.

5904
02:38:50,661 --> 02:38:51,390
Therapy.

5905
02:38:51,390 --> 02:38:51,561
I,

5906
02:38:51,561 --> 02:38:53,030
I dunno if he's on medication,

5907
02:38:53,031 --> 02:38:53,930
I don't know what the deal is,

5908
02:38:53,931 --> 02:38:58,130
but if you have multiple personalities
and they're all living inside of your

5909
02:38:58,131 --> 02:38:58,640
head,

5910
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:00,590
you might have one guy who just eats soup.

5911
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:06,050
The fuck is another guy doing dead
lifts and eating fucking steak.

5912
02:39:06,080 --> 02:39:06,890
Okay.

5913
02:39:06,890 --> 02:39:10,730
That guy just doesn't talk to
you as a guy that you don't,

5914
02:39:10,910 --> 02:39:11,211
I mean,

5915
02:39:11,211 --> 02:39:11,781
I just don't,

5916
02:39:11,781 --> 02:39:11,991
I mean,

5917
02:39:11,991 --> 02:39:13,280
I think it for sure.

5918
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:17,450
He definitely did a lot of his exercises
just doing chin ups and pushups and

5919
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:17,841
look,

5920
02:39:17,841 --> 02:39:18,680
if you do enough of them,

5921
02:39:18,681 --> 02:39:19,940
you can get pretty fucking swole.

5922
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:20,420
Yeah.

5923
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:24,410
There's a lot of guys who calisthenics
and build them a great body,

5924
02:39:24,411 --> 02:39:25,790
but you're getting all set.

5925
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:28,450
I'm waiting on this really
serious scientific risk.

5926
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:31,270
There may be one due
to eat soup inside it.

5927
02:39:31,310 --> 02:39:31,551
Yeah,

5928
02:39:31,551 --> 02:39:32,600
I think that's what it is.

5929
02:39:32,601 --> 02:39:32,991
I think.

5930
02:39:32,991 --> 02:39:33,780
Yeah,

5931
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:38,780
but it's kind of crazy that he went into
MMA after this trauma induced multiple

5932
02:39:39,681 --> 02:39:43,550
personality disorder and I don't mean
not necessarily trauma physically,

5933
02:39:43,551 --> 02:39:46,880
but I think there's a lot of emotional
trauma and mental trauma as well.

5934
02:39:47,060 --> 02:39:51,020
But then again also a lifelong
career of getting hit in the end.

5935
02:39:51,021 --> 02:39:51,410
Yeah,

5936
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:54,740
I mean the collisions that that
guy was a part of our on record,

5937
02:39:54,741 --> 02:39:57,410
you can watch them and
nobody rides for free.

5938
02:39:57,411 --> 02:39:59,300
They're all just fucking
crash into each other.

5939
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:04,301
Super Athletes sprinting full blast
and fucking elbows and head to head

5940
02:40:04,521 --> 02:40:07,370
collisions and back before there
was this concussion protocol.

5941
02:40:07,371 --> 02:40:07,731
By the way,

5942
02:40:07,731 --> 02:40:09,950
where guys get them now
and they're out for weeks,

5943
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:11,000
weeks,

5944
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,070
you're back the next play back then,

5945
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:18,100
what do you think is the number of
times where a person can be knocked out

5946
02:40:18,831 --> 02:40:20,870
before the athletic
commission steps in and says,

5947
02:40:20,871 --> 02:40:21,704
Hey,

5948
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:22,760
this is enough?

5949
02:40:22,790 --> 02:40:23,300
Three,

5950
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:24,030
three.

5951
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:24,930
I think,

5952
02:40:24,931 --> 02:40:25,171
yeah,

5953
02:40:25,171 --> 02:40:25,380
my,

5954
02:40:25,380 --> 02:40:26,250
in my opinion,

5955
02:40:26,251 --> 02:40:29,340
I think at the athletic commissions
need to have a limit to where it,

5956
02:40:29,370 --> 02:40:29,851
once you,

5957
02:40:29,851 --> 02:40:32,310
if you get knocked out three times,

5958
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,181
then you,

5959
02:40:33,181 --> 02:40:36,810
I think you should have to go in front
of a board to get your license in my

5960
02:40:36,811 --> 02:40:38,340
opinion and I'm sure that you know,

5961
02:40:38,341 --> 02:40:41,780
I haven't fully thought through this to
cover also for people started bashing me

5962
02:40:41,781 --> 02:40:42,510
for,

5963
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:44,730
but look you and you can defend yourself.

5964
02:40:44,731 --> 02:40:45,270
Hey Look,

5965
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:47,430
you know I've got three but
in this one I'm not out.

5966
02:40:47,431 --> 02:40:48,450
The ref stops this,

5967
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:48,930
this is,

5968
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:49,890
I was exhausted.

5969
02:40:49,891 --> 02:40:52,650
You could visually and then you have,

5970
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:52,951
you know,

5971
02:40:52,951 --> 02:40:56,280
a panel at the organization's involved
to make a decision on whether you can be

5972
02:40:56,281 --> 02:40:57,060
commissioned again.

5973
02:40:57,060 --> 02:41:01,110
Do you think if this is the case and if
we're really going to be careful about

5974
02:41:01,111 --> 02:41:01,291
this,

5975
02:41:01,291 --> 02:41:06,291
do you think that fighter's should be
required to film training sessions so that

5976
02:41:06,751 --> 02:41:10,830
we can review so that we know
exactly like if you're sparring,

5977
02:41:11,190 --> 02:41:12,023
like you,

5978
02:41:12,030 --> 02:41:15,480
like you know how many times
guys been knocked out in the gym?

5979
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:15,951
Yeah.

5980
02:41:15,951 --> 02:41:16,220
You know,

5981
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:18,920
it'd be tough because they don't think
they have the capital to put in the right

5982
02:41:18,921 --> 02:41:19,720
kind of equipment.

5983
02:41:19,720 --> 02:41:20,560
I don't think so either.

5984
02:41:20,561 --> 02:41:21,520
But I mean if,

5985
02:41:21,790 --> 02:41:26,790
if you can go $40,000 for a fucking blood
test and they have 500 fighters that

5986
02:41:27,671 --> 02:41:29,290
are possibly subject to this,

5987
02:41:29,291 --> 02:41:30,420
if they make it too,

5988
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:35,230
I mean most guys are just going to get
urine tested up until a certain point in

5989
02:41:35,231 --> 02:41:35,980
their career,

5990
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:37,870
but then they get to a certain
point and you're going to,

5991
02:41:37,930 --> 02:41:41,110
you're going to have to go
through the full water testing.

5992
02:41:41,410 --> 02:41:42,250
If that's the case.

5993
02:41:42,251 --> 02:41:42,431
I mean,

5994
02:41:42,431 --> 02:41:44,560
how much does it cost
to put Gopros and gyms?

5995
02:41:44,770 --> 02:41:44,981
I mean,

5996
02:41:44,981 --> 02:41:45,850
how much does it cost to me,

5997
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:50,470
there's ones that we have
now that are wifi enabled.

5998
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:55,620
They can all be linked up
to a UFC database and the
UFC could be monitored or at

5999
02:41:56,861 --> 02:42:00,430
least storing all of the footage of,

6000
02:42:00,460 --> 02:42:00,701
you know,

6001
02:42:00,701 --> 02:42:03,370
all these gyms and then make
them sign contracts like saying,

6002
02:42:03,371 --> 02:42:03,850
look it,

6003
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:05,380
you have to let us know if you're,

6004
02:42:05,381 --> 02:42:07,660
you're sustaining a concussion in the gym.

6005
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:11,250
Like there's so many fights where
you see guys get knocked out,

6006
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:11,471
you go,

6007
02:42:11,471 --> 02:42:15,070
well that doesn't even look right cause
you know that that guy got knocked out

6008
02:42:15,071 --> 02:42:16,450
in the gym a bunch of times.

6009
02:42:16,780 --> 02:42:17,613
Like um,

6010
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:18,340
uh,

6011
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:22,180
Travis Luder versus who's the
guy that veto for Marvin Eastman?

6012
02:42:22,450 --> 02:42:23,520
You ever remember that fight?

6013
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:24,610
Marvin Eastman?

6014
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:26,860
The word was that he got
knocked out not once,

6015
02:42:26,861 --> 02:42:31,240
but twice in camp leading up to
that fight once by Tito Ortiz,

6016
02:42:31,241 --> 02:42:33,330
he got hit with a knee
or something and once in,

6017
02:42:33,370 --> 02:42:35,290
during a take down he
got knocked out again.

6018
02:42:35,470 --> 02:42:38,890
So you're dealing with a guy
who had like six serious trauma.

6019
02:42:39,220 --> 02:42:41,320
And then Travis catches him with a punch,

6020
02:42:41,321 --> 02:42:42,760
which is a pretty decent punch,

6021
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:44,440
but it catches him on the end of it.

6022
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:45,820
And Marvin goes down,

6023
02:42:45,821 --> 02:42:47,800
like he got shot by a sniper rifle

6024
02:42:48,470 --> 02:42:49,081
Jitsu guy,

6025
02:42:49,081 --> 02:42:50,550
knocks out the striker out of nowhere.

6026
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:51,640
Travis get hit hard.

6027
02:42:51,710 --> 02:42:52,511
He's a tough guy,

6028
02:42:52,511 --> 02:42:54,700
but it was just a weird Kao.

6029
02:42:54,701 --> 02:42:55,020
Oh

6030
02:42:55,020 --> 02:42:55,260
yeah.

6031
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:55,921
Same thing happened.

6032
02:42:55,921 --> 02:42:56,551
Rashad Evans,

6033
02:42:56,551 --> 02:42:57,510
when he fought loaded Machida,

6034
02:42:58,170 --> 02:42:59,820
his last sparring session,

6035
02:42:59,970 --> 02:43:01,590
he got rocked bat,

6036
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:04,740
I mean dropped and he got hit in the
same exact spot in the Cheetah would

6037
02:43:04,741 --> 02:43:05,970
eventually knock them out it by who?

6038
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:07,141
Oh Gosh,

6039
02:43:07,141 --> 02:43:07,974
you that wasn't,

6040
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:10,530
I don't think it was Jardeen.

6041
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:12,581
I'm forgetting who,

6042
02:43:12,581 --> 02:43:12,940
but I remember,

6043
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:13,600
I mean,

6044
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:15,250
he could tell the story better than I,

6045
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:15,450
well,

6046
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:18,160
I've heard the Forrest Griffin leading
up to the Anderson Silva fight was

6047
02:43:18,161 --> 02:43:19,510
knocked out pretty badly too.

6048
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:21,830
And the way he used to spar him.

6049
02:43:21,831 --> 02:43:22,330
That's right.

6050
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:22,751
I used to,

6051
02:43:22,751 --> 02:43:22,960
you know,

6052
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:23,920
I've sparred with him.

6053
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:25,060
Um,

6054
02:43:25,060 --> 02:43:28,060
I sparred with him three days,

6055
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:30,610
three days after I got back
from my second tour in Iraq.

6056
02:43:30,850 --> 02:43:32,290
I still had sand in my ears.

6057
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:32,861
And Scott,

6058
02:43:32,861 --> 02:43:33,730
never Scott Adams.

6059
02:43:33,731 --> 02:43:34,930
The matchmaker if the WC.

6060
02:43:34,931 --> 02:43:35,764
Sure.

6061
02:43:35,780 --> 02:43:36,521
He was like,

6062
02:43:36,521 --> 02:43:36,641
Hey,

6063
02:43:36,641 --> 02:43:36,851
look,

6064
02:43:36,851 --> 02:43:37,870
I need to get you out here real quick.

6065
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:38,860
I need you a photo shoot.

6066
02:43:38,861 --> 02:43:39,760
We're going to promote your fight,

6067
02:43:39,761 --> 02:43:40,001
your fight,

6068
02:43:40,001 --> 02:43:40,990
and in six weeks,

6069
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:41,880
and I'd just,

6070
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:42,250
all right,

6071
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:44,680
I'll go to Vegas and bring my
wife sight see a little bit.

6072
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:45,250
Nope.

6073
02:43:45,250 --> 02:43:48,670
We go straight to this
gym and I'm in a ring.

6074
02:43:48,671 --> 02:43:51,400
I had to borrow all this care
of no mouthpiece and he's like,

6075
02:43:51,401 --> 02:43:51,521
Hey,

6076
02:43:51,521 --> 02:43:52,540
I want you to spar this guy.

6077
02:43:52,541 --> 02:43:53,021
You need to get,

6078
02:43:53,021 --> 02:43:53,201
you know,

6079
02:43:53,201 --> 02:43:54,760
you need to get back in
the gym and get in shape.

6080
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,140
I have no idea who the guy is.

6081
02:43:56,141 --> 02:43:57,700
I just know he's way bigger than me.

6082
02:43:58,050 --> 02:44:01,030
Turns out it's Roy Nelson
and the coach goes,

6083
02:44:01,031 --> 02:44:02,170
we're going to do five minute rounds.

6084
02:44:02,171 --> 02:44:02,320
Guys.

6085
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:03,610
I had never done five minutes before.

6086
02:44:03,850 --> 02:44:05,380
I thought you only did that fights like,

6087
02:44:05,390 --> 02:44:06,011
that's crazy.

6088
02:44:06,011 --> 02:44:06,910
Nobody does five rounds.

6089
02:44:07,390 --> 02:44:10,240
Roy's hitting me with these
overhand rights and dude,

6090
02:44:10,241 --> 02:44:12,370
sand is still flying out of my ears.

6091
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:12,521
You know?

6092
02:44:12,521 --> 02:44:12,701
I mean,

6093
02:44:12,701 --> 02:44:13,630
it was bad.

6094
02:44:13,631 --> 02:44:16,630
It was literally survival mode two times.

6095
02:44:16,631 --> 02:44:17,261
He almost knocked me.

6096
02:44:17,261 --> 02:44:17,501
I mean,

6097
02:44:17,501 --> 02:44:18,000
I went,

6098
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,100
you like the rocky four up
and over the ropes in any,

6099
02:44:21,101 --> 02:44:22,120
threw me back in.

6100
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:24,310
And then as soon as we finished there,

6101
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:25,461
oh no,

6102
02:44:25,461 --> 02:44:25,690
no,

6103
02:44:25,690 --> 02:44:26,770
that's morning sparring here.

6104
02:44:26,771 --> 02:44:28,940
We're going to go to sparring
over at Randy couture's new gym.

6105
02:44:28,941 --> 02:44:29,181
So I'd,

6106
02:44:29,181 --> 02:44:31,180
I'd go down there and
it's Forrest Griffin.

6107
02:44:31,181 --> 02:44:32,140
I've got no mouth piece.

6108
02:44:32,141 --> 02:44:32,501
And again,

6109
02:44:32,501 --> 02:44:32,860
the kosher,

6110
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:33,041
hey,

6111
02:44:33,041 --> 02:44:34,360
he's got no mouthpiece for,

6112
02:44:34,361 --> 02:44:36,160
she's in the military's
got free dental chips.

6113
02:44:36,161 --> 02:44:36,994
My teeth.

6114
02:44:37,150 --> 02:44:37,361
I mean,

6115
02:44:37,361 --> 02:44:39,220
but he used to get after it.

6116
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:39,611
I mean,

6117
02:44:39,611 --> 02:44:41,830
spark as hard as humanly possible.

6118
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:42,611
Yeah.

6119
02:44:42,611 --> 02:44:43,444
Well look at him now.

6120
02:44:43,450 --> 02:44:43,780
Yeah.

6121
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:45,020
Fucked up now because of it.

6122
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:45,160
He,

6123
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:46,660
he's his shoulder so bad.

6124
02:44:46,661 --> 02:44:47,630
I can't even brush his teeth.

6125
02:44:47,631 --> 02:44:48,370
And supposedly,

6126
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:49,203
Holy Shit,

6127
02:44:49,470 --> 02:44:51,350
he's apparently he's right shoulder.

6128
02:44:51,351 --> 02:44:51,791
It's just like,

6129
02:44:51,791 --> 02:44:52,930
it's just not working.

6130
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:54,041
Yeah.

6131
02:44:54,041 --> 02:44:54,581
I mean he's,

6132
02:44:54,581 --> 02:44:56,620
he's lost a lot of mass
when he looked at them.

6133
02:44:56,650 --> 02:44:57,250
Get all these,

6134
02:44:57,250 --> 02:44:58,750
had a lot of atrophy in his body.

6135
02:44:59,170 --> 02:44:59,530
I mean,

6136
02:44:59,530 --> 02:45:02,350
that guy fought fucking
hard and trained hard.

6137
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:02,891
I mean,

6138
02:45:02,891 --> 02:45:05,120
Randy couture always said nobody
works harder than forest green.

6139
02:45:05,121 --> 02:45:05,954
Yeah.

6140
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:06,210
Yeah.

6141
02:45:06,210 --> 02:45:07,720
But it's not always work hard.

6142
02:45:07,721 --> 02:45:07,990
Right.

6143
02:45:07,990 --> 02:45:08,531
It's work.

6144
02:45:08,531 --> 02:45:11,200
Smart guys are getting so
much smarter about that now.

6145
02:45:11,201 --> 02:45:11,381
I mean,

6146
02:45:11,381 --> 02:45:12,071
you look at like,

6147
02:45:12,071 --> 02:45:13,360
you know a guy like Anthony who's been,

6148
02:45:13,390 --> 02:45:13,571
you know,

6149
02:45:13,571 --> 02:45:14,950
he's been injured frequently,

6150
02:45:14,951 --> 02:45:18,010
but he's had to change his whole
training residence that he yes,

6151
02:45:18,011 --> 02:45:18,701
he gets himself,

6152
02:45:18,701 --> 02:45:21,760
they're healthy cowboy
Serone for as crazy as he is,

6153
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:22,391
I think it was,

6154
02:45:22,391 --> 02:45:22,540
you know,

6155
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:23,680
three fights ago.

6156
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:25,900
He got dinged a little bit in practice.

6157
02:45:25,901 --> 02:45:28,510
He just eliminated sparring
and just stopped doing it.

6158
02:45:28,511 --> 02:45:30,430
That entire camp does a lot.

6159
02:45:30,431 --> 02:45:33,160
He does a lot less now
than people realize.

6160
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:37,420
And in everybody he spars with is someone
hand selected and that understands,

6161
02:45:37,421 --> 02:45:38,500
and this is a wild man,

6162
02:45:38,501 --> 02:45:39,281
but he knows,

6163
02:45:39,281 --> 02:45:39,521
look,

6164
02:45:39,521 --> 02:45:40,090
I've,

6165
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:40,990
things are changing.

6166
02:45:40,991 --> 02:45:43,330
Coaches are finally sort of relates
because back when I was fighting,

6167
02:45:43,331 --> 02:45:47,610
I mean none of these coaches
actually fought in the Onco,

6168
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:48,410
right?

6169
02:45:48,410 --> 02:45:50,230
They were playing jazz at that point.

6170
02:45:50,231 --> 02:45:52,980
Nobody really knew the formula
to how to win in this state.

6171
02:45:52,981 --> 02:45:53,860
They acted like it,

6172
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:56,560
but now they're finally starting to
learn and now we're starting to have guys

6173
02:45:56,561 --> 02:46:00,850
like Ludwig who grew up doing it and
now it's switched to the other side and

6174
02:46:00,851 --> 02:46:04,060
become a coach or seeing more guys
like that as well that understand,

6175
02:46:04,061 --> 02:46:04,630
you know what,

6176
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:06,610
you got to hold these
guys back from themselves,

6177
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:07,391
pulled them back,

6178
02:46:07,391 --> 02:46:08,141
train less,

6179
02:46:08,141 --> 02:46:12,140
less rounds them healthy to the fight
and there'll be way more productive.

6180
02:46:12,590 --> 02:46:12,891
Yeah,

6181
02:46:12,891 --> 02:46:16,310
it's really going to be interesting to
see what Duke roof is does with cm punk

6182
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:19,580
because Duke Roufus is
essentially taking this guy once,

6183
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:22,370
I read this article today where
they're interviewing Duke and he said,

6184
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:22,671
you know,

6185
02:46:22,671 --> 02:46:24,380
I'm going to build this guy up from the,

6186
02:46:24,410 --> 02:46:25,340
from the ground up,

6187
02:46:25,610 --> 02:46:27,080
and he's not gonna spar
with anybody but me.

6188
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:27,741
He's like,

6189
02:46:27,741 --> 02:46:28,100
he's got,

6190
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:30,710
I'm going to have him spot with me
because I know that no one's going to hurt

6191
02:46:30,711 --> 02:46:30,840
him.

6192
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:31,101
I'm,

6193
02:46:31,101 --> 02:46:33,200
I'm going to have give
them have total control,

6194
02:46:33,350 --> 02:46:34,101
but I'm gonna correct.

6195
02:46:34,101 --> 02:46:38,360
All of them is mistakes and it's a great
call to have a guy like Duke do that

6196
02:46:38,361 --> 02:46:42,410
because he is a master striker and a
master instructor and he couldn't get a

6197
02:46:42,411 --> 02:46:44,990
better coach for MMA for striking in MMA.

6198
02:46:45,140 --> 02:46:49,610
I put him right up there with Dwayne
and with for Rasa hobby and you know,

6199
02:46:49,611 --> 02:46:50,840
all the Matt Hume,

6200
02:46:50,841 --> 02:46:51,680
all the great guys.

6201
02:46:52,010 --> 02:46:57,010
But I think that a guy like that is like
an interesting sort of a test ground.

6202
02:46:57,800 --> 02:46:58,310
I mean,

6203
02:46:58,310 --> 02:46:59,860
first of all for the,

6204
02:47:00,230 --> 02:47:03,710
the public's just let me just credibility.

6205
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:04,151
I mean you're,

6206
02:47:04,151 --> 02:47:06,680
you're talking about a guy who
was no amateur wrestling bouts,

6207
02:47:06,860 --> 02:47:08,270
no amateur karate belts,

6208
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:09,860
no amateur kickboxing bowels,

6209
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:11,120
no amateur boxing bouts,

6210
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:12,380
no sumo,

6211
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:13,513
nothing.

6212
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:15,320
Just pro-wrestling.

6213
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:15,590
Yep.

6214
02:47:15,590 --> 02:47:16,101
Which is,

6215
02:47:16,101 --> 02:47:16,370
you know,

6216
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:17,031
entertainment.

6217
02:47:17,031 --> 02:47:18,860
So he's some sort of an athlete.

6218
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:21,710
He looks like he's in good shape
down a little Jiu Jitsu training.

6219
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:22,221
I mean,

6220
02:47:22,221 --> 02:47:23,960
I dunno how much she wears a white belt.

6221
02:47:23,990 --> 02:47:24,410
I mean,

6222
02:47:24,410 --> 02:47:25,130
that ain't good.

6223
02:47:25,130 --> 02:47:25,550
Nope.

6224
02:47:25,550 --> 02:47:26,383
And he's,

6225
02:47:26,630 --> 02:47:27,411
he's getting there,

6226
02:47:27,411 --> 02:47:30,440
he's going to fight in the UFC and
a lot of people have issues with it.

6227
02:47:30,441 --> 02:47:30,591
I mean,

6228
02:47:30,591 --> 02:47:32,600
Jon Jones said he hopes
he gets knocked out,

6229
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:33,441
you know,

6230
02:47:33,441 --> 02:47:34,190
and yeah,

6231
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:37,790
I mean there's a lot of people that find
a Ben [inaudible] pissed is all hell

6232
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:39,080
with a good right to be

6233
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:40,280
and he's going to be coaching him now.

6234
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:40,520
Yeah,

6235
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:41,750
he absolutely right to be

6236
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:42,361
Ben.

6237
02:47:42,361 --> 02:47:42,560
You know,

6238
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:45,570
they will say Ben has and doesn't have
enough experience than the UFC hires is

6239
02:47:45,571 --> 02:47:49,230
zero and zero guy to
fight in the fucking UFC.

6240
02:47:49,250 --> 02:47:50,910
And against who though?

6241
02:47:51,030 --> 02:47:54,990
Another guy that they're going to handpick
for that zero and zero guy who also

6242
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:56,370
doesn't belong in the UFC,

6243
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,980
which is going to be really fascinating.

6244
02:47:59,010 --> 02:47:59,400
I mean,

6245
02:47:59,400 --> 02:48:02,190
how do they make it
compelling match for cm punk?

6246
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:05,510
I think him by himself is that compelling?

6247
02:48:05,511 --> 02:48:10,511
He has such a draw and that people want
to see him come out of character who

6248
02:48:10,581 --> 02:48:11,840
this real guy is,

6249
02:48:11,841 --> 02:48:12,141
you know,

6250
02:48:12,141 --> 02:48:12,631
and they went,

6251
02:48:12,631 --> 02:48:13,040
hey,

6252
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:13,670
is he,

6253
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:13,881
you know,

6254
02:48:13,881 --> 02:48:14,451
and the WB,

6255
02:48:14,451 --> 02:48:16,400
he was a straight edge guy who was,

6256
02:48:16,401 --> 02:48:16,791
you know,

6257
02:48:16,791 --> 02:48:17,300
he had,

6258
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:17,690
you know,

6259
02:48:17,690 --> 02:48:19,430
iron balls and blah blah blah blah blah.

6260
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:20,660
Is He really that way?

6261
02:48:20,930 --> 02:48:21,261
You know,

6262
02:48:21,261 --> 02:48:22,670
does he show up in the octagon?

6263
02:48:22,671 --> 02:48:23,421
Is he scared?

6264
02:48:23,421 --> 02:48:24,560
Is he afraid to throw a punch?

6265
02:48:24,561 --> 02:48:25,100
Does he,

6266
02:48:25,100 --> 02:48:25,311
you know,

6267
02:48:25,311 --> 02:48:26,840
leaning back with his Chin held high?

6268
02:48:26,841 --> 02:48:28,790
Does he get demolished
or does he fight hard?

6269
02:48:28,820 --> 02:48:29,241
You know,

6270
02:48:29,241 --> 02:48:31,970
is if he tests positive for fucking EJBs

6271
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:35,211
Twitter,

6272
02:48:35,211 --> 02:48:37,190
Twitter would absolutely just break.

6273
02:48:37,330 --> 02:48:38,500
It would be hilarious.

6274
02:48:38,650 --> 02:48:39,580
It would be hilarious.

6275
02:48:39,581 --> 02:48:40,840
It would be Cosby ask,

6276
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:41,270
oh

6277
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,103
wait,

6278
02:48:42,910 --> 02:48:43,171
you know,

6279
02:48:43,171 --> 02:48:46,350
and he's an extremely intelligent
guy when you talk to me,

6280
02:48:46,351 --> 02:48:49,800
very bright guy and he's on this
journey and you can't fault him.

6281
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:51,300
He just said I wanted to fight.

6282
02:48:51,630 --> 02:48:52,920
He can't fault him at did that.

6283
02:48:52,930 --> 02:48:54,930
The organization's going sign them and,

6284
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:55,290
and,

6285
02:48:55,290 --> 02:48:55,661
and I,

6286
02:48:55,661 --> 02:48:56,460
I get,

6287
02:48:56,460 --> 02:48:56,731
you know,

6288
02:48:56,731 --> 02:48:58,170
where they're going with it as well.

6289
02:48:58,380 --> 02:48:59,580
But the good thing for him,

6290
02:48:59,581 --> 02:49:00,840
and when I spoke to him actually,

6291
02:49:00,841 --> 02:49:01,051
you know,

6292
02:49:01,051 --> 02:49:02,010
this past weekend,

6293
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:03,600
there's no timeline from,

6294
02:49:03,601 --> 02:49:06,180
he can go train as long
as he wants to train.

6295
02:49:06,181 --> 02:49:07,014
And when his,

6296
02:49:07,290 --> 02:49:09,120
when Duke says he's ready,

6297
02:49:09,390 --> 02:49:10,560
that's when they get to match them up.

6298
02:49:10,770 --> 02:49:14,160
What I want to know is at what point
did they start getting impatient,

6299
02:49:14,161 --> 02:49:14,721
tapping their toes,

6300
02:49:14,721 --> 02:49:14,881
saying,

6301
02:49:14,881 --> 02:49:15,031
hey,

6302
02:49:15,031 --> 02:49:15,630
look,

6303
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:16,770
it's been eight months.

6304
02:49:16,930 --> 02:49:18,000
Are you ready to fight yet or not?

6305
02:49:18,810 --> 02:49:19,330
UFC?

6306
02:49:19,330 --> 02:49:20,060
What's the point?

6307
02:49:20,060 --> 02:49:20,260
Yeah,

6308
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:21,610
that's a very good point.

6309
02:49:21,850 --> 02:49:22,181
Yeah.

6310
02:49:22,181 --> 02:49:22,451
I mean,

6311
02:49:22,451 --> 02:49:23,500
as long as he does that,

6312
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:23,681
I mean,

6313
02:49:23,681 --> 02:49:24,790
that's a smart thing to do.

6314
02:49:24,791 --> 02:49:24,921
I'm,

6315
02:49:24,921 --> 02:49:25,810
I've always said that it,

6316
02:49:25,811 --> 02:49:26,890
Brock Lesnar did that.

6317
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:29,020
He would have been one of the
greatest champions of all time.

6318
02:49:29,021 --> 02:49:30,580
If Brock Lesnar went to,

6319
02:49:30,680 --> 02:49:30,851
uh,

6320
02:49:30,851 --> 02:49:32,380
Matt Hume or for Rasa,

6321
02:49:32,381 --> 02:49:35,490
hobby type dude and had
someone just analyze his,

6322
02:49:35,570 --> 02:49:38,200
his physical movements and everything,

6323
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:40,330
you're going to do everything half speed.

6324
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:42,130
We're for four fucking months.

6325
02:49:42,131 --> 02:49:42,430
Yeah.

6326
02:49:42,430 --> 02:49:42,791
I want,

6327
02:49:42,791 --> 02:49:43,660
when I throw a kick,

6328
02:49:43,661 --> 02:49:45,730
I want your knee to come up
and I want you to check it.

6329
02:49:45,910 --> 02:49:47,080
When you throw a left hook,

6330
02:49:47,081 --> 02:49:50,140
I want to right leg kick just
to be coming out on instinct.

6331
02:49:50,350 --> 02:49:51,610
When someone throws a punch,

6332
02:49:51,700 --> 02:49:53,770
I want you instantly to roll with it.

6333
02:49:53,771 --> 02:49:55,810
I want to be it to be
a part of your anatomy.

6334
02:49:55,811 --> 02:49:57,340
I want to be a part of your DNA.

6335
02:49:57,490 --> 02:50:00,220
Drillers are killers and
it never became that guy.

6336
02:50:00,221 --> 02:50:02,400
He was just kind of brute force,

6337
02:50:02,410 --> 02:50:03,430
super athlete.

6338
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:04,330
It's like,

6339
02:50:04,330 --> 02:50:06,820
it was like someone giving
you a corvette Zr one,

6340
02:50:06,821 --> 02:50:08,260
but never teaching you how to drive.

6341
02:50:08,530 --> 02:50:10,750
And he'd get on the fucking
highway and you've got a few moves,

6342
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:12,790
you know how to turn left
and you know it turned right.

6343
02:50:12,791 --> 02:50:15,400
And for most cars it's going
to be enough to beat him.

6344
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:18,730
But then you get this Cain Velasquez
cart that knows how to do everything and

6345
02:50:18,731 --> 02:50:18,950
you're like,

6346
02:50:18,950 --> 02:50:19,240
ah,

6347
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:20,051
fuck dude,

6348
02:50:20,051 --> 02:50:21,000
that's an evil car.

6349
02:50:21,010 --> 02:50:21,830
It's an evil cards.

6350
02:50:21,830 --> 02:50:22,690
Scary car.

6351
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:24,830
After John beat Daniel Cormier,

6352
02:50:24,990 --> 02:50:25,391
you know,

6353
02:50:25,391 --> 02:50:27,130
and he said he would fight
cane and a heartbeat.

6354
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:28,870
Boy Did I get excited about that fight.

6355
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:30,340
I'm excited about that fight.

6356
02:50:30,341 --> 02:50:31,500
As much as I'm excited about it.

6357
02:50:31,501 --> 02:50:33,340
Gustafson rematch or rumble?

6358
02:50:33,341 --> 02:50:34,810
Johnson fight almost.

6359
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:37,000
It depends on what happens
in the Gustafson rumble.

6360
02:50:37,001 --> 02:50:37,834
Johnson fight.

6361
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:43,020
If Gustafson knocks out rumble Johnson
or rumble Johnson knocks out Gustafson.

6362
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:46,540
If one of those guys finishes the
other guy in a very definitive way,

6363
02:50:46,541 --> 02:50:47,470
then I want to see that fight.

6364
02:50:47,560 --> 02:50:48,040
Yeah.

6365
02:50:48,040 --> 02:50:50,910
But until that John versus came,

6366
02:50:50,911 --> 02:50:52,090
he be fucking crazy too.

6367
02:50:52,300 --> 02:50:54,850
You know how long canes
been out over a year?

6368
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:56,091
Does he,

6369
02:50:56,091 --> 02:50:57,100
I mean you,

6370
02:50:57,350 --> 02:51:01,550
we expect because he was so dominant
that he comes back true to form,

6371
02:51:01,551 --> 02:51:02,271
but you got to wonder,

6372
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:03,104
does he,

6373
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:03,501
I mean,

6374
02:51:03,501 --> 02:51:03,801
that's it.

6375
02:51:03,801 --> 02:51:05,690
He's had a lot of injuries and,

6376
02:51:05,870 --> 02:51:07,010
and certainly,

6377
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:07,521
you know,

6378
02:51:07,521 --> 02:51:08,810
Verdomme he,

6379
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,060
he gets overlooked time and time again.

6380
02:51:11,061 --> 02:51:11,271
I mean,

6381
02:51:11,271 --> 02:51:13,100
I certainly did when
he fought Travis Brown,

6382
02:51:13,580 --> 02:51:17,060
I thought Travis Browne was going to
have a lot more success man for doom.

6383
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:18,321
I mean,

6384
02:51:18,321 --> 02:51:18,571
he may,

6385
02:51:18,571 --> 02:51:19,401
he made him look,

6386
02:51:19,401 --> 02:51:20,510
he made them look mediocre.

6387
02:51:20,540 --> 02:51:21,800
How about the Double Jab?

6388
02:51:21,801 --> 02:51:25,440
Where the fuck did he developed a
fucking Lennox Lewis Style Double Jab?

6389
02:51:25,850 --> 02:51:26,091
I mean,

6390
02:51:26,091 --> 02:51:27,410
he look great standing up.

6391
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:27,711
I mean,

6392
02:51:27,711 --> 02:51:31,100
his standup has improved
a really dramatic fashion.

6393
02:51:31,370 --> 02:51:33,890
Knocking out Mark Hunt
with a fucking flying knee.

6394
02:51:34,130 --> 02:51:34,963
Like what?

6395
02:51:35,170 --> 02:51:35,500
Yeah,

6396
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:38,590
I fell Cordero got a lot
of love from the past guys.

6397
02:51:38,591 --> 02:51:39,424
He's trained,

6398
02:51:39,490 --> 02:51:40,181
but honestly,

6399
02:51:40,181 --> 02:51:44,500
some of his best work has been
recently what he's done with VRE doom.

6400
02:51:44,650 --> 02:51:46,260
What he's done with Hofeld dos Anjos.

6401
02:51:46,261 --> 02:51:46,600
Yeah.

6402
02:51:46,600 --> 02:51:47,021
I mean he's,

6403
02:51:47,021 --> 02:51:48,310
he's starting to bring up,

6404
02:51:48,520 --> 02:51:48,881
um,

6405
02:51:48,881 --> 02:51:50,320
son of a gun I'm missing.

6406
02:51:50,380 --> 02:51:51,213
Um,

6407
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:54,700
Darwish Peniel dark [inaudible] as well.

6408
02:51:54,730 --> 02:51:55,151
Who's,

6409
02:51:55,151 --> 02:51:58,000
who's undefeated in the UFC so
far has had some very good fights.

6410
02:51:58,010 --> 02:51:58,190
Who's,

6411
02:51:58,190 --> 02:51:58,961
who's a black belt,

6412
02:51:58,961 --> 02:52:02,380
he's a grappler that now is turned
striker and being successful.

6413
02:52:02,590 --> 02:52:06,190
He's starting produce guys that
shouldn't be good and really showing

6414
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:08,620
some depth in the technique to not the,

6415
02:52:08,621 --> 02:52:11,230
the crazy shoe box style
people were accustomed to,

6416
02:52:11,650 --> 02:52:13,300
but a lot of traps,

6417
02:52:13,301 --> 02:52:14,680
trickery set up,

6418
02:52:14,681 --> 02:52:14,921
you know,

6419
02:52:14,921 --> 02:52:19,921
very technical it lots of volume striking
with a lot of depth to a different

6420
02:52:20,591 --> 02:52:20,891
looks,

6421
02:52:20,891 --> 02:52:21,790
different styles

6422
02:52:21,890 --> 02:52:23,990
and Codero you can't get a nicer guy.

6423
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:25,340
And that's the other thing is that these,

6424
02:52:25,341 --> 02:52:28,760
these fires have this bond with him
because he's such a lovable guy.

6425
02:52:28,761 --> 02:52:29,241
So great.

6426
02:52:29,241 --> 02:52:31,130
They want to win for him a lot.

6427
02:52:31,131 --> 02:52:32,480
Like the Ray Longo thing.

6428
02:52:32,481 --> 02:52:33,110
Like they,

6429
02:52:33,110 --> 02:52:34,130
they love Ray Longo.

6430
02:52:34,131 --> 02:52:34,910
They want,

6431
02:52:34,910 --> 02:52:35,900
they want that guy.

6432
02:52:35,910 --> 02:52:37,900
Therefore then they want
to make that guy happened.

6433
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:40,490
Hafael is just such a nice guy.

6434
02:52:40,700 --> 02:52:43,370
He's such a nice guy and you know,

6435
02:52:43,371 --> 02:52:48,350
it was a great fighter himself really
understands and really becoming a part of,

6436
02:52:48,351 --> 02:52:52,340
or because he's a part of shoot to
box the history of MMA mean he's like,

6437
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:53,293
he's legacy.

6438
02:52:53,330 --> 02:52:53,750
Yeah,

6439
02:52:53,750 --> 02:52:54,200
yeah,

6440
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:54,741
absolutely.

6441
02:52:54,741 --> 02:52:55,610
What were that comes from?

6442
02:52:55,850 --> 02:53:00,110
Imagine calling a fight and having Ray
Longo come in for a fight and grab a

6443
02:53:00,111 --> 02:53:00,944
headset.

6444
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:04,820
I think Ray Longo and Matt Serra should
have their own fucking reality show.

6445
02:53:04,910 --> 02:53:05,420
I just,

6446
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:07,220
those two guys cornering fighters.

6447
02:53:07,310 --> 02:53:07,851
It would be,

6448
02:53:07,851 --> 02:53:10,040
it would be absolutely incredible.

6449
02:53:10,430 --> 02:53:11,151
Absolutely.

6450
02:53:11,151 --> 02:53:11,984
They're hilarious.

6451
02:53:12,500 --> 02:53:15,410
And they're like my favorite
kind of east coast guys,

6452
02:53:15,430 --> 02:53:15,930
you know,

6453
02:53:15,930 --> 02:53:18,170
that that east coast sense of humor,

6454
02:53:18,320 --> 02:53:20,180
humble self deprecating.

6455
02:53:20,181 --> 02:53:20,691
And I mean they're,

6456
02:53:20,691 --> 02:53:20,901
they're,

6457
02:53:20,901 --> 02:53:21,920
they're great human me,

6458
02:53:21,930 --> 02:53:26,120
I spent a weekend Fort Hood with Matt
Serra during one of the fight for the

6459
02:53:26,121 --> 02:53:26,511
troops.

6460
02:53:26,511 --> 02:53:26,721
I mean,

6461
02:53:26,721 --> 02:53:28,130
you couldn't find a funnier guy.

6462
02:53:28,131 --> 02:53:28,281
I mean,

6463
02:53:28,281 --> 02:53:29,690
the whole time Dane is texting him,

6464
02:53:29,691 --> 02:53:32,810
telling him how fattiness
and then we go to,

6465
02:53:32,870 --> 02:53:33,351
we go to,

6466
02:53:33,351 --> 02:53:35,540
who's the big puppet guy in Vegas?

6467
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:36,583
Terry Fator,

6468
02:53:36,950 --> 02:53:39,920
we get Dana gets front row
tickets as Terry Fator show.

6469
02:53:40,130 --> 02:53:41,690
And so Sarah's texts and Dana,

6470
02:53:41,810 --> 02:53:42,051
look,

6471
02:53:42,051 --> 02:53:43,160
I may have put on some weight,

6472
02:53:43,161 --> 02:53:43,790
but I,

6473
02:53:43,790 --> 02:53:44,061
you know,

6474
02:53:44,061 --> 02:53:46,340
I sure it's held in asked
for tickets to a puppet show.

6475
02:53:46,341 --> 02:53:46,641
Dana,

6476
02:53:46,641 --> 02:53:46,870
you know what?

6477
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:48,050
I'm 30 some years old.

6478
02:53:48,051 --> 02:53:48,910
I could have passed on.

6479
02:53:49,130 --> 02:53:50,630
I could've seen this by staying home.

6480
02:53:50,631 --> 02:53:51,051
My kids.

6481
02:53:51,051 --> 02:53:51,740
Thanks for nothing.

6482
02:53:51,740 --> 02:53:52,573
Yeah,

6483
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:53,611
it's funny.

6484
02:53:53,611 --> 02:53:54,320
Yeah,

6485
02:53:54,320 --> 02:53:55,430
he's fucking hilarious.

6486
02:53:55,460 --> 02:53:56,330
They're funny guys,

6487
02:53:56,331 --> 02:53:56,870
man.

6488
02:53:56,870 --> 02:53:59,020
That east coast mentality that there's uh,

6489
02:53:59,040 --> 02:53:59,281
there's,

6490
02:53:59,281 --> 02:54:02,870
there's just a different sort of sense
of humor that comes out of long island.

6491
02:54:03,350 --> 02:54:04,860
This fucking guy over here.

6492
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:06,030
Jesus Christ.

6493
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:07,281
They're funny,

6494
02:54:07,281 --> 02:54:08,000
man.

6495
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:08,391
Listen man,

6496
02:54:08,391 --> 02:54:09,080
we're out of time.

6497
02:54:09,080 --> 02:54:10,340
We did just did three hours.

6498
02:54:10,730 --> 02:54:11,271
Holy Shit.

6499
02:54:11,271 --> 02:54:13,610
You're the first ever
HD podcast we ever did.

6500
02:54:14,020 --> 02:54:14,420
Uh,

6501
02:54:14,420 --> 02:54:18,350
how many gigs is this going
to be too big for you stream.

6502
02:54:18,730 --> 02:54:18,971
We'll,

6503
02:54:18,971 --> 02:54:19,880
we'll see what this happens.

6504
02:54:19,881 --> 02:54:20,714
But you're the first one.

6505
02:54:21,050 --> 02:54:21,470
Ah,

6506
02:54:21,470 --> 02:54:22,160
listen man,

6507
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:22,970
run for president.

6508
02:54:22,970 --> 02:54:23,710
Please.

6509
02:54:23,710 --> 02:54:24,540
You can run.

6510
02:54:24,540 --> 02:54:25,550
You can do it eventually.

6511
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:29,650
Maybe one day if I get
pissed off at me ladies,

6512
02:54:30,090 --> 02:54:30,780
gentlemen,

6513
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:31,650
I think you could win.

6514
02:54:31,710 --> 02:54:32,543
I'll get behind you.

6515
02:54:33,150 --> 02:54:34,770
I'm not going to be like a
vice president or anything,

6516
02:54:34,830 --> 02:54:35,650
but I'll be a

6519
02:54:38,651 --> 02:54:39,580
They've got to come to the cabinet.

6520
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:40,481
Yeah,

6521
02:54:40,481 --> 02:54:42,430
I don't think you want
take your fucking cabinet.

6522
02:54:42,820 --> 02:54:46,210

stories to talk about.

6524
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:49,420
