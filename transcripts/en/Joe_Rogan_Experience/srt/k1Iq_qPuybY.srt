1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,990
and I think maybe that guy wouldn't
sexually harassed in the big world,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,470
but in this little world
where everything's like jammed
in together and you have

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:13,950
these clearly defined things like this
guy has got a plaque on his desk that

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:14,910
says the boss,

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,960
right,

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,370
and you got to come in
and he's got the desk.

8
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:18,181
Come on and shut the door.

9
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:18,840
Shut the door.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,890
Or if you like Matt Lauer,

11
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,630
you've got a button
where you lock the door,

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,750
click fuck.

13
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,131
Come on.

14
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,521
Inside.

15
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,330
We've got to discuss.

16
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,890
We've got to review your progress.

17
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,724
This click.

18
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,470
This is the world.

19
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,150
I mean,

20
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,540
if mean not exonerating.

21
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,130
Matt Lauer can't believe
I to say this again,

22
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,100
but if you're in that guy's world
and I don't even know what he did,

23
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,060
I didn't pay attention.

24
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,351
I met him once.

25
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,850
He was quite a gentleman,

26
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,160
but he's in this.

27
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,630
He's got to be working 10,

28
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,500
12 hours a day.

29
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,060
You're doing the today show.

30
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,390
Yeah,

31
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,680
it's insanely competitive.

32
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,940
That morning TV thing,

33
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,870
you have to be on the ball.

34
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,190
You have meetings,

35
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,020
you have fucking stuff to review.

36
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:52,641
You have guests.

37
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,710
Are you going to review your performance
in your conversations with people and.

38
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,060
Well,

39
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,400
Matt,

40
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,600
you know,

41
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,890
whenever you start talking about sex,

42
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,760
people drop off.

43
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,210
Look,

44
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,931
we've got the numbers.

45
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,320
We have the chart in the direct relation
to what you were saying earlier is what

46
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,850
I read about Matt Lauer was that,

47
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,220
uh,

48
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,540
he,

49
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,520
he couldn't have sex with just normal
people because he's famous and he's,

50
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:11,821
you know,

51
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,260
he'd get in trouble and he's married.

52
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,660
So he had to maintain the facade of that.

53
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,500
He and he couldn't have sex with other
famous people because that would come out

54
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,161
into the press.

55
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:22,230
So he had to have sex with
people who weren't famous.

56
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,460
They weren't just normal people.

57
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,570
And that left the office.

58
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,973
That was it.

59
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,860
So imagine if we lived
in a world where we said,

60
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,530
who gives a shit if Matt Lauer's
fucking someone other than his wife?

61
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,400
That's between them.

62
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,911
The sixties,

63
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:33,744
again,

64
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,550
I don't know what that was back when
Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties.

65
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,220
Shoot,

66
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,350
if you guys ever seen,

67
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,903
by the way last.

68
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,630
Sorry,

69
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,610
the last word on this for me anyway,

70
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,960
the people who are acting shocked and
outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie

71
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,310
rose are full of shit.

72
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,390
That's what I.

73
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,440
that's what kills me.

74
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,100
The hypocrisy of the people who have been
working with them for years and going,

75
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,810
oh,

76
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,960
I had no idea.

77
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,310
I heard about Charlie rose being a fucking
creep 15 years ago and I don't even

78
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,150
work in media.

79
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,283
You know,

80
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,940
it's like the bill cosby thing was open.

81
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,840
The bill cosby thing was an open cab.

82
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,421
If you see,

83
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,090
if you guys seen this is one of,

84
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,120
one of the grossest things you can
witness in a workplace is when the boss

85
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,200
starts giving fucking neck back

86
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,830
rubs.

87
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,670
You ever seen that?

88
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,650
A neck rub and boss.

89
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,760
So it is.

90
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,090
It is so fucking creepy to watch a big
fat fucking boss saddling up behind some

91
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,570
married secretary.

92
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,080
Just.

93
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,440
Oh,

94
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,360
how are you doing?

95
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,440
The day carol rubbing her neck and we
could see the look on her face frozen.

96
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,210
She's got kids.

97
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,921
She,

98
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,310
if she says to him,

99
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,360
Hey,

100
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,080
do you mind?

101
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,910
I don't really want you
to touch me right now.

102
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,120
He's going to go,

103
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,381
oh,

104
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,214
I'm sorry,

105
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,850
but then she doesn't know down the line,

106
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,550
down the line when he's doing
employee reviews and he's thinking,

107
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,620
you know what room,

108
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,690
that fucking time I just
wanted to Robert Back,

109
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,510
man,

110
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,770
but I'm not rubbing any.

111
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
That dude's backs in the office now that
man that is fucked up and that is one

112
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:10,651
of the sleaziest slimy as things and to
imagine when you're the boss to imagine

113
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,810
that these bosses,

114
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,471
they're oblivious,

115
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,131
they just don't know.

116
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,450
They just want to give them that corrupts.

117
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,220
They're not aware like come on.

118
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,550
They can feel that he's
rubbing their back.

119
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,980
If you can't feel their fucking.

120
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:28,660
Adam's trying to escape your
sweaty God damn fucking male.

121
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,523
Dominator.

122
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,150
How many guys become friends with women?

123
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,890
Have Air tag friends just so
they just creeping closer.

124
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:42,891
Almost like your stock and big game and
you want to just move real close to and

125
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,070
that's what they're doing.

126
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,270
One of the classics.

127
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,800
That's how I hunt elk.

128
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,910
I walk real slow.

129
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,100
Give it a neck rub.

130
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,620
Try not to make my intentions known,

131
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,450
but Eddie is one of the greatest
Jujitsu coaches on planet earth.

132
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,280
It means an amazing Jujitsu
coach and Jujitsu competitor,

133
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,410
and one of Eric Dubai's biggest videos
is about how Jujitsu is bullshit.

134
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,300
It just shows you.

135
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,880
It does,

136
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,290
isn't it?

137
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:10,950
About that.

138
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,280
It's like about wing Chung
Kung Fu defeats Jujitsu,

139
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,200
which is by the way,

140
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:16,830
not true.

141
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,150
Don't try it unless you're like way
bigger and the guy sucks at Jujitsu.

142
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,970
She got those guys in a room together
and they can just spit it out.

143
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,780
Yeah,

144
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,613
I don't think so.

145
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,930
They would just talk about
conspiracies to the end of time.

146
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,810
Eddie loves conspiracies.

147
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,150
I would like to talk to Eddie.

148
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,460
We can do that.

149
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,630
He's screaming,

150
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,893
screaming.

151
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,480
Might have to get you some
earplugs here tonight.

152
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:37,050
I said kick him.

153
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,940
He's interesting because he
knows so much about them all.

154
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,781
Oh man,

155
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,750
that's really interesting.

156
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,701
Confuses me.

157
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:41,971
I'm like,

158
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:43,380
how much time do you have?

159
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,120
Where do you have the time for this?

160
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,421
Yeah.

161
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:46,670
He's spouting off this,

162
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,870
this advanced physics references,

163
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,290
Mickelson areas failure
and things like that,

164
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:52,830
and it is.

165
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,340
Those are the flatter things.

166
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:54,610
Yeah,

167
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,990
those science experiments
that supposedly proved the.

168
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,230
The wasn't moving.

169
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,340
That one's hilarious to me because
when I first brought it up to Eddie,

170
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,510
Jamie pulled this up and send it to me
the other day that I first brought it up

171
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:09,390
to Eddie from like eight
years ago on the podcast,

172
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:14,391
one of the really early podcast when we
still did it in my house on a couch and

173
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,390
he's like,

174
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,110
what's the most ridiculous
conspiracy theory?

175
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:17,520
You're hurt?

176
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
And I said flat earth,

177
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,740
and he's like,

178
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,220
no,

179
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,720
people don't believe the earth is flat.

180
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,350
So he went from that to not only use
100 percent convinced that it's flat,

181
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:29,400
but he's definitely willing to listen.

182
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,473
He's down the rabbit hole.

183
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,363
He got sucked in.

184
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,130
He loves it and it's probably like a lot
of it is just from him watching endless

185
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:35,551
youtube.

186
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,690
It's 100 percent what it is.

187
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:37,524
Here it is right here.

188
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,910
What's the worst conspiracy to like?

189
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:42,600
The worst one?

190
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,433
Flat Earth.

191
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,320
There's people that are on
this flat to the young earth.

192
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:47,310
That's another bad one.

193
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:47,530
No,

194
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:47,691
no,

195
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:47,970
no.

196
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,541
Like today,

197
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,410
people don't believe that.

198
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,860
That's a big percentage of the Christian
population that I went with the young

199
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,780
earth there for fucking stranger.

200
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,700
We're all baked.

201
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,590
So I'd probably,

202
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,911
unfortunately.

203
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,480
But that was,

204
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,180
that was when he found
out about flatter for me.

205
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,470
And that was,

206
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,750
you started him down the
rabbit thousand episodes ago.

207
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,430
What episode was that?

208
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,180
Fifty four.

209
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,160
So that was probably 2010.

210
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,820
First year.

211
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,653
Yeah.

212
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,640
Yeah.

213
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,250
It doesn't fly.

214
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,480
That was a big on the,

215
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,440
on the Internet back then.

216
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm ahead of the curve.

217
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,540
Maybe responsible for this whole thing.

218
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:25,940
Well,

219
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,370
he and I used to watch ufo things forever,

220
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,260
but he got off a Ufo.

221
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:30,471
See,

222
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,640
he goes in waves,

223
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,210
right?

224
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,300
Eddie goes in waves,

225
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:38,060
like we were both like really into Ufo
and in particular Zechariah situation,

226
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,163
that was the big one.

227
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,100
I would've said the same
thing about bill cosby,

228
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,293
which you have.

229
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,141
Oh,

230
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,730
did I ever tell you this
story about bill cosby?

231
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,760
So I dated a girl in like,

232
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,210
oh,

233
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:51,691
five.

234
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,111
Oh six.

235
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:52,770
Oh seven.

236
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,603
Uh,

237
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,443
in New York,

238
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,741
beautiful girl,

239
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,540
mixed mixed race.

240
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,493
Um,

241
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,270
and like cool,

242
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,050
whatever.

243
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,883
Great.

244
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,760
And um,

245
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,310
she used to talk about sheep.

246
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,690
Some bill cosby came up one time,

247
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:07,080
she was like,

248
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,320
oh,

249
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,011
Mr Cosby,

250
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:08,844
what a sweet man.

251
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,370
And I was like,

252
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,203
man,

253
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,520
what do you,

254
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,353
what do you [inaudible]?

255
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,110
She's like,

256
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,630
Oh yeah,

257
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,420
one time I was on the
street crying and uh,

258
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,260
Mr Cosby walked up and
introduced himself and was like,

259
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:22,991
why are you crying?

260
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:23,824
And,

261
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,241
and,

262
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:24,930
uh,

263
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,763
and,

264
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,330
and,

265
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,960
you know,

266
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,540
and we struck up a
friendship and I was like,

267
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,123
he was trying to fuck him,

268
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,263
just so you know,

269
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm just like,

270
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,020
just saying I was trying to fuck you.

271
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,610
She's like,

272
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,001
no,

273
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,080
he was not trying to fuck me.

274
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:37,890
Like,

275
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,700
and uh,

276
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,150
and,

277
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,750
and like,

278
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,590
what are you talking about?

279
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:40,771
Like,

280
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:40,951
no,

281
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:41,784
it was just like,

282
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,751
again,

283
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,880
like I'm an animal for suggesting it,

284
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,361
like who?

285
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:48,900
You're so boarish why
would you possibly think?

286
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:49,830
And it's like,

287
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,830
cause I fucking met the guy
and he's not a good dude.

288
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,523
Um,

289
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,600
and uh,

290
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,880
and so she,

291
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,200
she defended him,

292
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,260
he used to take me to
place just all the shit.

293
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm like,

294
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,520
okay.

295
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,510
He just had a long game.

296
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:07,344
Yeah man.

297
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,453
And uh,

298
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,670
so then all this shit
comes up and I text her.

299
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:11,841
I go,

300
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,600
so what do you think,

301
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,021
what do you think?

302
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:13,854
You're a boy?

303
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,031
And she goes,

304
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:15,864
uh,

305
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,220
she said something like,

306
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:19,020
I think like,

307
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,400
he absolutely did it and I
think his wife was in on it,

308
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,780
which again,

309
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:25,550
I don't know what,

310
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,280
what you meant by that.

311
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,030
But.

312
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,810
So then I,

313
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,000
we're texting back and forth.

314
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,863
He goes,

315
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,270
you know,

316
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,270
one time I was supposed to meet him in
Philadelphia and he told me what to wear

317
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,200
and how to wear my hair.

318
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,520
Oh.

319
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,710
And she goes to.

320
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,030
And thankfully I got sick.

321
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,650
She was going to do it.

322
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,090
She was going to wear what she wanted.

323
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,013
Yeah.

324
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,321
Wow.

325
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,154
That was the time.

326
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,790
Yeah.

327
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,080
And set up yet.

328
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,621
And He,

329
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:50,270
uh,

330
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,730
he,

331
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,710
he was going to take her
to the ultimate musical.

332
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:53,940
Uh,

333
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,990
and she,

334
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,960
and thankfully she got sick
and didn't go and I was like,

335
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,670
and the whole time when it's like,

336
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,480
yeah,

337
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,450
that's the thing that one of the things
with some of these stories is like,

338
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,900
why would bill cosby want to
be friends with some lady?

339
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,771
