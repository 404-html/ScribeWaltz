1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,980
Oh, good googly Mowgli.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,380
this episode of the podcast,

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,440
if you're looking for like a regular
podcast where people are going to talk

4
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:14,310
about interesting shit and bring
up topics that are fascinating and

5
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:18,990
intellectually stimulating, that shit
ain't happening today. This episode.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,580
What are they saying? Are
they saying that? No. What
are they saying? The sing us.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,280
Oh Shit. We're already live.
You late. Fucks sit down,

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,200
up. Sexy face. Have you been
back to the freezing place?

9
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,150
And so we grabbed that backpack.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,700
You guys were broadcasting. Don't
have a, just a regular conversation.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,870
This is actually a podcast. Yeah, it's
videotape. Videotape to we're live.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,530
That's true. You don't want to be
videotaped. We can go incognito.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,290
We can just put a logo on my face,
right?

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,730
We're a, this is like I was
saying before, you guys walked in.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,770
This episode is not a regular podcast.
This is what we're calling,

16
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:10,570
we're calling them the fight
companion podcast. We did it, uh,

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,580
during the last few of see broadcasts
that a I wasn't a part of and we had a

18
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:18,030
great fucking time. So we decided
to do it again. Brendan Chavez here.

19
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,580
Hollow Brian.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,520
Brian Cowan is here, edge it
bra is here, the original,

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,250
uh, and uh, we are watching a,
yeah, yeah, sure. I'll get you some,

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,740
some nerve like a box of Alpha
brain right now for brain

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,770
function without it. Um, we're
watching the Brazil broadcast,

24
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,590
but I have UFC fight pass so we can,
uh,

25
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,420
we can watch the Moose saucy versus Munoz
fight, which has already taken place.

26
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:52,710
You know what happened?
You're a friend, a friend,

27
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:57,180
and a fan of a good dude.
It's a tough one, man.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,650
Musashi live like a fucking beast.
We'll, we'll come to that later. Well,

29
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,484
he took them down.

30
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,150
You want to watch it real quick while
we're waiting for the fights over here so

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,320
my neck doesn't hurt. It's not possible.
No, I'll show you the, this is,

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,910
this is the end.
It's pretty much this.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,480
You're saying Munoz could
take it right behind you.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,410
Munoz tried to take them down.
Watch. He tried to take him down,

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,150
got him to the ground, got inside
control, went for the Guillotine,

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,090
wound up being on top and uh,

37
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,900
eventually got his back from out
to them. Yeah, it was pretty slick.

38
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,570
Mark Turns did. He's good. He's
fucking really good. You know,

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,810
a lot of people sleep on his ground game,
man.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,440
They think about him as a kickboxer. They
shouldn't, it, his ground game is very,

41
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,800
very high level and it was a sweet
transition to the way you did it.

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,250
You know, Munoz is, uh, he's no
joke. You know, he's a good wrestler,

43
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:52,920
very strong guy and move saucy
for him to do this to him.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,560
This was a NCAA champ, right? Two Times
in a row, four time. All American.

45
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,370
Listen with Munoz in practice,

46
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,280
this is the same thing he
does when he gets the mount.

47
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:06,610
He goes for that single leg and
it causes them a lot of trouble.

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,870
So he would work with here on
Henner about options not to do that,

49
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:15,580
but it's just in his nature when the
bullets are flying to turn the wrestling,

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,550
he gets him in trouble, man. Yeah. Well,

51
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,470
that is the transition
that a lot of guys make,

52
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:23,110
especially when they feel like they're
super dominant wrestlers and they feel

53
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,410
like, look, I'm already where I want
to be. I can just complete this single.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,850
But while he's, he was going for, uh,

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,650
the takedown Musashi hit him with
some nasty fucking elbows. Man.

56
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,910
They were really ugly,
really ugly elbows and uh,

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,710
I think those probably took a lot out
of him. Man. Those were horrible elbows.

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,720
Oh, what a sweet move, man.
So he couldn't, he couldn't,

59
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:52,670
I was quite taken down and get on top.
The out grappled flattens.

60
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,480
What does your Sassy is, is, is that
a, an Iranian name? Persian name?

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,280
I think it is. Maybe Armenian.
You know, I'm not sure.

62
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,920
It sounds, uh, oh, that's
me. That's Joey. Oh Shit.

63
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,540
Let's find out. Tough man. Sucks to watch.

64
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,103
Yep.

65
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,550
You rock your live. Joey.
Do you live Joey Diaz?

66
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,780
[inaudible]

67
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,860
phone call baby.
He's Armenian.

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,380
Did you watch the Munoz slide? Oh,
he hung up. He probably lost him

69
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,480
saying that is funny. You
know, just asking if kiss was,

70
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,710
that's how funny Joey,
like

71
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,530
maybe like 15 years ago,
that's something you can Google or

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,280
hall of fame.
I don't think so.

73
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,900
Getting frozen yogurt,

74
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm getting pregnant with a beautiful
blonde a while back and gene Simmons is

75
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,580
sitting down as I come back
in to get like Vanilla Yogurt.

76
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,311
I said,

77
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,550
I'm going to get one and she's outside
and I go on and he looks at me and he

78
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:26,610
goes, he goes and I go, hey
man, how are you doing? I go,

79
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,460
it's like your friend. Very
cute. Like you're feeling
friend, something like that.

80
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,740
And I go and I go, I said, yeah, yeah,
it's great man. Yeah, it's amazing.

81
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:39,230
I'm just thinking about it.
You guys been doing this for 20 years,

82
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:43,280
you've been taught, you know, I'm
famous for 20 years and he goes 30 30.

83
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,640
I was like, right, right, right.
Okay. And that was the end of that.

84
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,940
It's high by the way, doing stand
up for him. That was it. Well,

85
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,260
doing Santa for him at the,
uh, MMA awards, like he's in
the front row. I think he,

86
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,490
I,
he didn't quite laugh,

87
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,100
but he did open his mouth a couple
of times and kind of looked at me.

88
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,920
Yeah. He kind of went out to one
of the most nervous I've ever been.

89
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,880
He came to see me on New Year's Eve. He
brought his family. That's nerve wracking.

90
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,140
Simmons, his brother and
his or his son rather. Uh,

91
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,830
who's funded six, eight giant kids.
All families. John, I was like,

92
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:17,380
their child a basketball is like, they
want you in a content is tall. Yeah.

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,360
Yeah. They're big humans. But
it was the weirdest thing ever.

94
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:23,590
It's like gene Simmons is in the crowd.
Like Gene Simmons kind of like,

95
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,410
Oh fuck yeah it does. I
tearing it up. I brought,

96
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,980
I brought it up and call them out. I had
to happen, had to for me, I was like,

97
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:34,160
I just got to tell you I'm nervous.
Well that's like I couldn't stand up.

98
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,991
I did stand up for,

99
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:39,410
for Harvey Cartel and Harry Dean Stanton
and there in the audience to see me.

100
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,880
Oh my God. I was, I was nervous
man. I found myself very
nerve Bieber in the crowd.

101
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
Yeah.
I wasn't nervous about,

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,990
oh, I saw you. You were shitting
your pants on Biba. Yeah.
Right. You sent me a text.

103
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:52,280
I got beavers hair.
Right.

104
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,980
What does Bieber, who's got the tattoo
with Floyd? He's hanging out with Floyd.

105
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,090
That's the problem. Come
on. Does he have to do

106
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,560
just be cool and fucking sing?
Don't act all tough. Tough.

107
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,763
Would it be,

108
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,450
I agree with all of you.
I don't think he's doing anything wrong.

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,620
I think if I was 19 I would be one

110
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,820
way more out of control.
If I had a half

111
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,690
the kids,
the kids doing fan fucking tasks,

112
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,960
so he ne he egged the neighbor's house,
whatever.

113
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,370
He's in a fight with an asshole
who lives next door to him.

114
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,580
I probably have indentured servants
I'd be out of out of you will think,

115
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,770
why not people killed his
next door. Neighbors would
be like 10 miles away, dude.

116
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,660
No, no, no, no. That's it.
Living next to books is a very

117
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,030
crowded community. I mean, Joe
and I am, I'm going to join.

118
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,210
I wanted to get a pit bull
Joe and I like idiots found,

119
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,980
I find this advertisement. It says
pitbulls bread right out of the box.

120
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,490
I was like the Joe. He goes,
what? I go, I found fighting dogs.

121
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,810
I want Charles on the end of a
leash was like, I'll come with you.

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,740
We'd go find that sketchy dude.
Catch the sketchy criminal, like,

123
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,690
oh yeah. I don't know if he's selling
it, but he's definitely, he gave his dog.

124
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,180
He was giving these talk is protein
powder. I was like, all right,

125
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:20,390
well I want one of those.
Yeah, it was great. Yeah,

126
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:25,391
kind of until it killed a baby cow and
two goats and a and another dog and then

127
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:30,260
they had to put it down.
Dogs are not good pets.

128
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,870
They're sweet as hell. And
then I just gave bread gain.
Brendan, the ones that are,

129
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,970
look, it's on the genetics man. 100% of
the genetics. I would have had a pitch,

130
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,690
so if I was Justin Bieber at that age,
I would have sort of Justin Bieber.

131
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,330
I'd have lions. Yeah. Fuck yeah. We can
think about what Tyson had. If you, uh,

132
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,760
it depends entirely on the dog,
but even if you soup,

133
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,130
like if you're really good
at like taking your dog

134
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,890
to dog parks and getting them
used to being around people,

135
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,480
they still have mad animal aggression,
aggression trigger.

136
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:07,590
You never know what them, what dom Irrera
when Justin Bieber was in the audience,

137
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,421
dumb Americans.
I mean,

138
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:10,710
cause you know Justin and
must've been really hard for you.

139
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,730
The struggle between the age of 13 and
14 when you were a man. By the way.

140
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,550
I still worse Damo railroad impression

141
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,940
that Justin beaver movie never surrender.
Never give up.

142
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,530
I believe when you're fly I
the one to see it. I said,

143
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,750
let's go watch that in goof
on it and we'll record.

144
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,670
We'll just goof on this stupid ass
movie like Justin Bieber movie.

145
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,380
I couldn't wait to watch it and goof on
it. But when you go and you watch it,

146
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,360
you man, when you, when you know
the story of how he blew up,

147
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,990
it's when you actually know how
to youtube. It's pretty crazy.

148
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,660
I thought he was a,
uh,

149
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,600
a producer project or like some labels
putting together. They did not want.

150
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,830
They didn't, nobody wanted to sign him.
He blew up on his own from Youtube.

151
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,040
How just cause he was so good. He's,
he's in a fucking amazing singer.

152
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,370
He can sing his ass. He plays
drums. He plays guitar in that.

153
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,160
Let's let everyone knows. Her fight is
about to start. If you're watching this,

154
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,810
the, here's the problem.
If you watch this online,

155
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,820
it's a 15 second delay between us.

156
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:19,230
This is what I had to get out between
when we're talking to the fights.

157
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,440
The fights are at Verde happened
by the time you're hearing this.

158
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,190
So pause like 15 seconds
and then catch up.

159
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,820
Right now it's four 51 of the first round.
You should apply.

160
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,000
Let honey Jason and Robbie Pearl.
I'm not, I'm not mad at those.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,910
Ring card girl is the new
Brazilian rent cars. Got Pow POW.

162
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,550
Did you get to thing on a shoulders?
Might be a little much.

163
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,160
She just couldn't get out of that
on a tee shirt instead. But honey,

164
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,900
Jason's a bad motherfucker and he's,
yeah, he's a wild man. He got in Brazil.

165
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,350
All right. Jeremy Stevens knocked
him out with a head kick, but he uh,

166
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,540
he came back with a wind.
His next fight after that,

167
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,020
Jeremy Stevens hit them
with the kick from hell.

168
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,890
I wonder how we got that
name homies and well, oh,

169
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,970
Jason's his nickname.
That's why he wears the hockey mask.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,100
I wonder how we got that one.

171
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,960
Has anybody ever asked him the
ultimate fighter tattoo? Yeah, he won.

172
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,800
He won the first season of the
Brazilian show. That that right.

173
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,470
If that's a left or a right,
right. Looks like if he,

174
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,240
if he throws it and commenced,
it's going to connect.

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,950
What are you talking about son?
Please? Can we mute him when he goes,

176
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,250
hey man, it was all of the UFC
fighter. Please talk to Brian.

177
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,260
Brian. Never say things
like that. And guys,

178
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,180
if you're going to comment on the fight,
you got to do it in a Brazilian accent.

179
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,750
Okay. You fee if you connect
with the ride like that,

180
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:44,751
there's going to be a pro Arnold
[inaudible] shitting on his dominant rare

181
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,510
impression. Oh, they're on the Brown. Oh,

182
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,830
transition trying for an
arm bar. Got a little, hi

183
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,370
honey. Jason falls off the top. He's
nice and loose. He's keeping loose.

184
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,370
Robbie Peralta, he's a tough motherfucker.
This is going to be a good fight.

185
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,080
This is an interesting fight.

186
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,530
He kinda looks like if Dan
Hardee and Jens Pulver had a kid.

187
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,490
Yeah. Or actually I think, I think
it's Tom Hardy. Chuck laid out.

188
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,830
Yeah. Both of those work. Yeah, it looks
there's a lot of Dan Hartigan there. Yeah,

189
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:19,420
there is

190
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,350
Dan Harlow with Jens Pulver.
He's good looking kid hardy.

191
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,840
Some chick hardy got pregnant.

192
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,380
Oh.

193
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,060
Oh Damn. I sneak. That was sweet.

194
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,470
What were you saying about pregnant chicks
though, before that elbow happened? No,

195
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:38,530
I was just getting into the
story of this background. Oh,

196
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:43,300
how he became looked like that.
I'll make a call right now.

197
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,340
If he catch, he's going to
catch them with that. Right.

198
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,830
That's spinning elbow
was fucking magnificent.

199
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,610
Tastic gonna catch him with the rice. You
know, you didn't see it common either.

200
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:56,320
He didn't, it didn't telegraph
it. He threw it. It was
beautiful and it was also,

201
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,000
it was unexpected. Did you guys
see some of the prelims? Yeah.

202
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,840
Did you see? Watch the hydro damn
fight. Yeah. What did you say?

203
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,650
Did you see a god? Who was it homeboy? Um,

204
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,900
they're just throwing caution to the wind.

205
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,330
Stopped the fight and the second
round? No. Which fight was it onto?

206
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:19,480
The first ones? Nope. Was the first
one on Fox. Oh Man, I missed him.

207
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,310
But a standing ovation would probably be
able to get that standing ovation from

208
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:30,930
Joe Silva. Wow. Which is hard
to do. It's not for what?

209
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:34,220
Five Joe Joe Silver first
fight on Fox sports one.

210
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,160
He's a real kind of sore that Joe Silva,
that mother fucker know,

211
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,370
seen a couple of fights in his day.

212
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:43,780
He knows about every fighter
on the planet at all times.

213
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,900
That sounds ridiculous.
But he basically does anytime a guy,

214
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,950
he's like making it into the big leagues.
Silva knows about it.

215
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,580
He's like a super fan and I love
talking to him about fights.

216
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,990
He trains too and he's always trained.
Yeah.

217
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,370
But I love talking to him about fights.

218
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,730
Me and him have some really interesting
conversation about fights. Yeah.

219
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,300
Oh, he put them in that arm
bar? No, he put me in an arm,
but I know he did it. No,

220
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,320
he didn't sit around. They were
just, no, no, not for real. For Real.

221
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,571
No.

222
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:14,571
You wanted to try out Joe
Joe's way bigger than that.

223
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,520
Show me some new variation.
Armbar and it wasn't effective.

224
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,410
You didn't repeat
real meat head stuff.

225
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,930
I was, you know, was he
was, he had a good idea.

226
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,580
Dia.

227
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,490
It's just he didn't take into account a
couple things and one of them was that

228
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:37,370
he wasn't controlling my body. I was
like, I'm not you. You don't know.

229
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,990
And it was a, it was a decent idea of
50 pounds of muscle on him that helped.

230
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:42,900
So no matter what,

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,020
if he would've put on a traditional
Brazilian Carlos Gracie senior Armando

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,950
still to slip

233
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,710
you gotta you gotta mid sized dog on him,
you could just add,

234
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,850
that's how much more weight
you have on it. We were, uh,
we were talking about, um,

235
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,030
Steve Maxwell was in here and he was
talking about how he had this dude who was

236
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:06,200
this gigantic football player.
It's just total super athlete,

237
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,520
280 fucking pounds,

238
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,540
pure muscle NFL player college where we're
talking to college. No, no, no, it was,

239
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,000
I forget, I forget. I think
either way. I think it was a a,

240
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,610
I think it was a NFL player,
but anyway, giant dude. Right.

241
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,330
And the a was rowing with one of his
brown belts and the guy gets him in a

242
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:27,200
mounted arm bar mount some takes his arm
fully locked in arm bar and they'd do

243
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,280
it. Stands up with them like
a Turkish getup. All my God,

244
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,670
all my arm over there and they were
like, don't slam. I'm dot. Oh my God.

245
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:37,250
I'm going to let him go. Let him go. Put
him down, put him down. Everybody backs.

246
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,650
Let them know it was just, there was,
it was so much stronger than it did.

247
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:42,411
Like the other dude was only,

248
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:45,920
or like a buck 60 he was so much
stronger than it was. Just insanity.

249
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,750
I just had some about Andre Carter who
played defensive end for the 40 niners

250
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,890
and for the past,
and I just met him.

251
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,460
He's six seven two 65 and just
the most ridiculous athlete.

252
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,730
And I always do this. How'd you
think you're doing the UFC? Huh?

253
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,170
Big Guy. Huh? Duwan EFC or
fuck no man, he get tore up.

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,700
He get wrong. Yeah, the enlist
and people are always like,

255
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,170
oh how it NFL elite athletes,
Lebron James.

256
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,340
It takes a special kind of athlete to
get punched in the face the first day in

257
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,590
the gym. Like you know what? I want to
do more of this. I'm gonna come back,

258
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,050
look at that elbow.
Look at this album.

259
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,850
Oh and there's not a million
dollar signing bonus jam.

260
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,220
I was hoping they were
going to show that again.

261
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:28,400
That elbow was goddamn beautiful.
Yeah. No million dollar signing bonus.

262
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,000
Super Dangerous. A long way. Very
nothing guaranteed. High risk.

263
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,490
Very low potential reward.

264
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,500
What it is is football players and any
professional athlete really they will,

265
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,050
if they got into Jujitsu
or if they got into MMA,

266
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,800
they will progress a lot
quicker than your average guy.

267
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,990
Cause they have the athleticism balance.
So that's what it was like. Will it,

268
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,970
does he have the whole package?
The mental package,

269
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,570
the work ethic and the technique,
the heart shit.

270
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,050
And because of the fact
that it's not a guarantee,

271
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,630
you got to be looking for glory.
You really have to be doing it for glory.

272
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:04,040
You can't really be mine it for money.

273
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,090
You gotta be doing it to get really
fucking good at and be Gloria. Listen,

274
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:12,020
there's a lot of guys who in the NFL
who I played with are in college and

275
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,160
there's some guys in fine too,

276
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:17,240
but mainly in these other sports where
they would walk away from if they could.

277
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:20,930
They hate doing it. They
hate playing football. It's
just the money. So damn good.

278
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,620
Rolled with some elite football
players. Oh yeah. Yeah.

279
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:29,360
I mean some big powerful guys used to
have at the gym. Who is that dude who was,

280
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:32,020
I don't know what level
football he played, but uh,

281
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,290
I used to always call rolling with him.
It was like riding liberal,

282
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,120
driving the ball, rolling with them.
You know what I'm talking about?

283
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,240
How many Alpha brain should I
take? Four. I take nine. Yeah,

284
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,160
give me and I take four floors.
Do you remember the Guy I'm talking about?

285
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,060
I want to take the football player, Eddie.
Uh, football, big black guy. Super strong.

286
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:58,950
Really flexible. No, wasn't
handy. Old Legends did. Yeah.

287
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:03,630
All logins old. The BRAYA
legends? Yes. Football player. Oh,

288
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:08,220
Leanne Macklin. I think that's him.
Yeah. He played running back in college.

289
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,390
Oh my God. This guy was an
athlete. Ridiculous. He's
learning Jujitsu, but athlete.

290
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,300
But it was like riding the bull.
He was just so fucking strong.

291
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,370
I'll tell you what I mean.
Shane.

292
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,080
Shane Carwyn was 300 pounds when I first
started with him and he would, you know,

293
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:25,190
Shane would, he'd go do his
job. He'd be gone having Andrew,

294
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,250
he'd be gone for six weeks and I'd be
working on Jujitsu three times a day,

295
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,730
seven days a week. I'm like, I can't
wait for Shane to get back. I'm a role,

296
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:36,690
this big Mug,
that thing that he's just so bad.

297
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,560
Nothing like you said, you'd strap
something on him. He just fricking,

298
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,760
her Kelly is out of honey.

299
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:46,761
Jason just mounted Robbie Peralta and
Robbie Paul to explode in his car.

300
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,820
He's talking real quick.
It was a good move. Both of
these guys are tough. Hey Man,

301
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,840
every guy,
see tonight's going to be pretty

302
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,900
sweaty if some of his,
uh,

303
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,370
is a sweat a lot.
They got a lot of muscle mass.

304
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,310
This guy has a little car to say.
These guys have a lot of muscle on them.

305
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,010
This guy's a stud. They like fighting
these guys. These guys fight.

306
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,720
These guys are fighting.
Ooh.

307
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,470
Oh. Tries to a Omoplata
lost it. Lost Control.

308
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,310
Try it needs to learn some rubber guard
like that shit until it doesn't work on

309
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:27,790
these guys guys. A lot of stuff
doesn't work. These guys exercise.

310
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,230
I saw natural shit's totally natural.

311
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,580
Can I be honest? Fighting hurts.
It hurts for anybody out there.

312
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,920
Robbie Peralta on top kicking haunted
Jason in the legs. It's got to hurt.

313
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,410
Interesting way. She fibers it.

314
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:52,120
Never know like how long to to stand
there and when to step them back up.

315
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,390
Obviously homeboy, he doesn't want
to go to the ground with them.

316
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,970
So you might say, I think you should
probably stand up possible. Right?

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,800
But it's a tricky situation.
It's like,

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,850
remember you used to watch those old Jack
Dempsey films and that he would knock

319
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:06,720
a dude down then hover over.
Cause when the guy tried to get back up,

320
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,690
you'd punch up and people would be like,
oh that's so cheap. That's so cheap.

321
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,870
You know, they used to be able to do that.
That's some cheap shit. Now you have to,

322
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,170
you know,

323
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,440
stand in neutral corner and the boxer
has to wait for the guy to get up.

324
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,910
But it's kind of unrealistic.
So when you see a scenario like this,

325
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,840
I think it's kind of interesting.
Peralta was, you know,

326
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,150
holding his legs and kicking them
and they're beautiful right hand.

327
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,880
That was nice.
That didn't hurt.

328
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,490
You see how he said come in and
he got hit the minute he got hit,

329
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:37,340
he started doing that. The a hydro
ego damned fight earlier. Um,

330
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,370
he was fighting, what's his
name? Never met her. Never
good. Madoff. I believe it is.

331
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,370
You're asking me to remember it when you
see Paulo Thiago so many lost another

332
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,620
one. He Paul. Tiago does. Yeah.
Damn. Who did he lose to today?

333
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,210
Some Russian cat. Did. I don't,
I think he's lost. He's lost.

334
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,800
That was going on with Thiago Silva. Like
that whole situation. Oh, Thiago Silva.

335
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,980
Yeah. Yeah. Um, apparently, uh, you know,

336
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:06,490
he got arrested and they kicked
him out of the UFC. Right. And uh,

337
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,810
he had a gun on him or something.
You know,

338
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,980
I don't know if he actually brought it up.

339
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,040
I'll tell you right now what this all
stems from his chicken live chicken is

340
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,200
chip.
No

341
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,000
job's going to drop some fucking chicken
head signs. Have you never heard shot?

342
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,510
He's like, oh, he hit that beautiful
fun. He took it as he took the Jab.

343
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:29,470
He spun and landed at all. But just loving
it and look at it. Oh, nice. Left Hook.

344
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,450
Next slide. Oh, I need, oh
right hand by honey. Jason.

345
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:39,070
Great. Right button. Proud to just
outfit. Oh, well this is a great fight.

346
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,150
They said, defense, you're outta here.
Let's just throw it. They let it go.

347
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,450
Brendan shot. We'll give a master
course under shaking heads,

348
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,130
shaking heads one oh was he will
hear your version and chicken heads.

349
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:54,100
It's a lot of people out there that will
ruin their fucking life with the wrong

350
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,230
person.
You hang out with the wrong people.

351
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,690
Brendan Walsh would teach her how to
avoid chicken heights. Simple Walsh.

352
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,360
I say it all the time. Brendan Frasier,
who's Brendan Brennan? Wallace.

353
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,840
Brendan Frasier. Brendan Schaub
apparently has a piece on him.

354
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,990
Heard that from girl.
Mm. I believe you have a,

355
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,100
you should do like one of those
late night infomercials on chicken.

356
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:18,190
It's chicken heads.

357
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,570
Do you have chicken and just show a
bunch of like different scenarios.

358
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,470
What would that song you could use you
to hear his song on your one album?

359
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,410
Boudou per nanny. It was kind of
stuff that guys, that was good.

360
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:33,480
That wasn't terrible. It's just
a good song. It was that day. Oh,

361
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,740
you got to hear it. That's a good
song. Don't tell yourself, well,

362
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:39,330
you know we haven't talked. We haven't
been in since UFC one 73 Oh yeah.

363
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,120
Tj Dillashaw. Damn. Those
incredible, right. Inspiring.

364
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,410
Look at how he eats the jab and
spins. Ooh, what was a right hand?

365
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,700
He ate the right hand. Oh, nice. Jumping
knee. To really wild fight. Why Walmart?

366
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,200
Mario ain't having it. Come
on. He's excited. Yeah,

367
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:02,520
they were just going to high five.
You know we get chilled though there.

368
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:05,560
They enjoyed the fight. They didn't
join it. I says God did. Yeah.

369
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:09,970
I like when the dudes do that. They must
have trained before together. Oh No,

370
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,350
they're just having a great fucking time.

371
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,780
They're just having a great fucking
time. That was a while. Wouldn't do that.

372
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,610
Mr. Brennan Shab.
Most boxers wouldn't do that either.

373
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,600
A lot of people wouldn't do that.
It's rare. You know what might happen?

374
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:27,160
Like one half of 1% of all UFC fights.
Risky kick.

375
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:29,680
When you do that could you could catch
an elbow. You know why you don't do that?

376
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,860
You ever seen Pat Barry vs Mirko Cro cop
when he kept hugging and grabbing each

377
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,800
other's nuts and shit. Yeah,
but you don't do very extreme.

378
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:39,910
That was a very extreme version of, well,
I'm just saying. That's one example.

379
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:42,010
I don't, then I had to fight
Mirko Cro cop after that.

380
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,470
Not The way you show respect man.
What do you mean like show respect?

381
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,210
I beaten him up by bringing it to them,

382
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,390
not by high five them and have them
sign your shorts inside the octagon.

383
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,140
That's what I do. I'd be
friends with everybody. You
know what I'm saying? Yeah. No,

384
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,930
I know what you're saying. You
can be friends afterwards. Yeah.

385
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:03,920
Well I think Pat Barry was actually
good friends with Mirko Cro cop. Right.

386
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,470
They trained together, but
still get it. I get it.

387
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,100
I and Andre Arlovski. You train together.
You think we're high fiving? Nah.

388
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,120
You think we're touching gloves?
Nope. Well, were you friends with her?

389
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,520
Lawsky we were good training partners,
man.

390
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,900
Did you guys ever go looking for honeys?
Hey, you are fighting for chicken heads.

391
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,350
He was, he had it. He had a
girl. You're a good person.

392
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,940
He had when when you went to touch gloves.
He goes, no, we'll do it afterwards.

393
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,930
It did. Wow. Then he woke up. I tried
shaking his hand. He didn't want to,

394
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,960
Geez. Oh pokes. God. It's the worst
fucking so what do they do about it?

395
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,500
There's nothing you can really do about
it. Did you have to change those gloves?

396
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,080
Man.
That's one thing to make all curved.

397
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Make the gloves so that it
accentuates the hand. Why curves? Yup.

398
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,120
That's a nice shot there. Oh God.
Enjoy your victory. One fricken,

399
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,580
I write in the fuck.
Oh Man.

400
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:59,210
It's such a terrible injury
that you know what I also think,

401
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,920
I think they haven't exhausted all the
possibilities as far as like covering the

402
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,650
tips of the fingers. Everybody says
you have to have the fingers open.

403
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,840
What about covering the tips was like a
very thin sort of like a piece of tough

404
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:15,590
leather or grappling, bro. Well, this is
what I'm thinking. Wouldn't it actually,

405
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:17,780
if it was like Suede or
something along those lines,

406
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,240
what did it actually probably give you
just a little more grounded, right?

407
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,410
They would come off. No, no,
I'm not saying it's thimbles.

408
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm saying the front end of the glove,
the way it's constructed.

409
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,890
Some sorta like lambskin
or some sort of pliable.

410
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,430
Something's flyable little not,
not like kangaroo

411
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:40,430
kangaroo
lambskin.

412
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,990
I've never tried one. Yeah,
no. Yeah, I have. They make
clothes out of it too though.

413
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,330
They make. They make sauce.
Smells like it. Smells like soup.

414
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,090
You've tried it didn't break off.

415
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,260
I'm a little confused on what he's
talking about. Condoms. Lambskin condoms.

416
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,380
Have you ever tried them? I have
never heard of him. I have never heard

417
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,410
any more because they have
microscopic holes. Get HIV,

418
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:10,370
can get through it.
In Africa it was the original condom.

419
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,770
The original condoms are made out of
animal like in depth sense. Yeah, totally.

420
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,730
Yeah.
I mean that's what they use.

421
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:20,450
You guys have bang in animal intestines
actually feel way better apparently.

422
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,830
Yeah. I'm all set on that Bro.
I'm all set. That's why the Lens,

423
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,850
another podcast [inaudible]

424
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,960
tried out a real doll. They went, they
took turns on the real doll on the shop.

425
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,020
Had the real dawn in another
room like like in that room,

426
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:44,130
whatever and were miked and

427
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,390
they took turns on the real though. I
don't think, I think Howard got the mouth.

428
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,250
I think that's all he was like,
I'll do it,

429
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,580
but you got to carry you the mouth.
Everybody gets a different,

430
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,250
I'd love to hear Brian.
Good fight. Yeah. Got,

431
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,060
sorry man.
Sorry guys.

432
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,850
There's guys out there that hang
out and doubled team real dollars.

433
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,230
You gotta get your own Bro. You
know what? They're too expensive.

434
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,370
I guarantee there's two dudes have
right now. Listen to this podcast.

435
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,250
Double teaming. Some dogs all
jacked up on bulletproof coffee.

436
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,650
I got to be right. There's gotta be
dudes in a parties with it. Like fuck it.

437
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,590
Let's do it like one dude.
He could afford like a real good one.

438
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,670
I'll tell you what my post fight
party is right now. Well they have

439
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,070
these websites where these guys take
the real dolls and dress him up and a,

440
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,810
I'm mocked it and this
is how I know I used to,

441
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:39,230
I just think it was funny to make fun of
real dolls. But then this dude told me,

442
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,400
oh he get poked to no, he's
blowing his nose. They told me, um,

443
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,700
this guy sent me an email like angry at
me and then I sent him an email back.

444
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:51,320
Like, Hey, you know, look,
I'm just trying to be funny.

445
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,600
I'm sorry if it hurt your feelings,
you know,

446
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,690
but you realize it's kind
of funny like the people,

447
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:59,180
cause he was like in love with it. Well
he has, it's his girlfriend, you know,

448
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:02,090
and these guys they draw, treat these
things like they're the girlfriend.

449
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,750
So then he explained to me that he's
who's disfigured when he was young and his

450
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,760
whole life has been like lonely and
sad women find him disgusting and that

451
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,920
that's a lot of the
guys in this community.

452
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,960
Oh Shit. That's kind of heartbreaking.
It's totally a different point of view.

453
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,470
I would definitely have a doll. I was
fucked up and cause he really interesting.

454
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,560
I think I was taking it.
Yeah.

455
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,430
In terms of, you know, like
some crazy dude cause angst.

456
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,530
That's a girl and that it's some,
it's you're a madman.

457
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,450
If you think that's a girl.

458
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,990
Well that's a different situation.
I was,

459
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,960
I was thinking if you're a regular duty
of your shit together and you're going

460
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,990
home taking out a doll, you need
a fucking motivational talk, man.

461
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,080
Send me a text and I'll give
you a motivational talk.

462
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,760
What's the whole fucking movie where
a dude fell in love with Ryan Gosling

463
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,900
called Lars and the real
girl as I don't know, but uh,

464
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,860
that movie her where she fought,
where he falls in love with the,

465
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,500
I love that movie.
It was so good.

466
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,560
There's got to be 70 of them.

467
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,630
He's like a pimp. He has them all
out in his living room and shit.

468
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,140
He comes out with a fucking smoking
jacket and he's got all these real dogs.

469
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,310
He sleeps with like 10 of them and shit.
Oh for sure.

470
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:16,370
It was going to be the oldest one,
at least one did.

471
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,130
And all the guys in his community there
like jealous of them and shit. Fuck.

472
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:22,070
He's got so many shit.

473
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,390
Those things are expensive. There's
got to be guys out there they want,

474
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
they just can't afford one.

475
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:34,430
They just $10,000 for their
10 g's or something like that.

476
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:37,790
Five G's. 10 genes. That's a lot of money.
Yeah. They're probably pretty expensive.

477
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,960
We weren't even paying
attention a little bit. I'll do

478
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,560
worse than the fucking judges in
Vegas if you try to judge that.

479
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,140
I was actually watching.
I got to know Jason. I got
Jason. You would not watch it.

480
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:55,141
I was to be other people's real dolls
off like breaking in and stealing and

481
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:56,980
shit.
Like give me back my real dog.

482
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,680
They break in while he's at
work, they break in flower. Real

483
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,300
brands have a tenant. They
just, my friends have to
evict this tenant from their,

484
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,070
from their apartment because the
guy was breaking the other tenants,

485
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,590
uh,
spit it out.

486
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,400
Apartments the other women and stealing
their clothes and all those women who

487
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,700
are going, I'm missing my
clothes. What's going on?

488
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,360
So one girl put up video cameras and
the guy was breaking in during the day,

489
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:28,900
stealing. So they get to his
place and these guys just bins,

490
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,990
bins full of women's stuff and he dresses
up in his house and walks around and

491
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,500
Oh my God, that's what he's into. And
now, now the cops, you know, you're crazy.

492
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,720
If you don't take an order,
a doll,

493
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,460
it looks like Joe Rogan and
guys are fucking it. I'm crazy.

494
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,580
Even crazier than that.

495
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,650
How about the fact that they're going
to have artificial robot bodies that you

496
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:49,760
can fuck right there that's
going to happen. Where

497
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,500
can we find out where they're at? Are
they close, slow? With synthetic biology,

498
00:30:56,501 --> 00:31:00,630
they might be able to make great.
That's very real feeling robots.

499
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,060
It could be a person. I mean, you could
essentially be an artificial person,

500
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,040
so you're going to be able
to fuck a Brendan Schaub.

501
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:11,041
You'll be able to fuck big foot
Silva [inaudible] gay dudes.

502
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,380
They just maybe so just want to get
savaged by my bad ass dude. Yeah,

503
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,010
yeah, yeah. I bet.

504
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,390
I bet you could probably order real dolls
that looked like scarlet Johanson and

505
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:32,800
show. Yeah, well, yeah,

506
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,160
but I think you're going to be able
to order an exact duplicate of scarlet

507
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,440
Johannson. I mean, it's going
to be so strange. Stupid.

508
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,690
That's the world's going to be stupid.

509
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,360
I would order one if it was
affordable and reasonable.

510
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:48,420
If you talk to someone who lived in the
14 hundreds about Internet porn on your

511
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:53,020
phone, they would look at you. Look, you
were completely raw. He Won. Peralto. Wow,

512
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,910
that doesn't make sense. Big Win. Well,

513
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:57,020
I don't know if you were to really
truly paying attention there.

514
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,040
We were talking about definitely not
watching it enough to accurately judge a

515
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:06,600
fight. What is high a Bussa it's a company
that makes clothes closing gear. Yeah.

516
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,570
Boxing gloves and shit. Good
gear down. Yeah. I don't know.

517
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,570
Did they pay you Brian to
say that he has say $10,000.

518
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,260
Here's a random, here's a, I don't
know how to sit and see this,

519
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,780
but you weren't really, totally none
of that landed that move of the night.

520
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,870
None of those landed. Nope. Nope. Nope.

521
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,650
He's going against. So that couldn't
have hurt you made the I didn't hurt.

522
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,513
It didn't me.

523
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,430
It was a good fight. It was a really
good point. Did anyone watch the uh,

524
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,830
the fridge and groves boxing match? No,
but I watched the knockout. Good flight.

525
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:52,380
Yeah. I didn't use case. Biggest
boxing match all tiny thousand people.

526
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,340
[inaudible] stadium. Crazy man. The
biggest of all time. Isn't that funny?

527
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:59,390
That Kroll fraud is so big over
in England, but people in America,

528
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:01,650
the average sports fan is no idea.
I don't know.

529
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,590
I'll tell you who knows who he is.
His girl,

530
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,940
she is dime piece of the girl and he won
that belt, but his girl jumped in there.

531
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:12,430
Everyone was like, Dang.
Dang. Lang Lang a frosh.

532
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:16,430
His girlfriend, she's, he's
winning. He is winning everybody.

533
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,790
Yes. God is real strange.
You know I was on the,

534
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,560
on a plane with Vladimir Klitschko and
nobody bothered him at all. Insane. Right?

535
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:28,580
He walked in, he sat down, nobody knew
who he was and I was like, Holy Shit.

536
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,630
And so I'm like watching to see if
people tweak and start pointing at him

537
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,090
nothing and go, Holy Shit. That's the
heavyweight champion of the world. Nope.

538
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,750
Not a single person who was white, but
in Europe all over, he can't go anywhere.

539
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,540
He's like, Tom Cruise here. He could
deliver your pizza. You're like, oh,

540
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:45,200
what's up dog? Well, he lives in
Germany and him and his brother,

541
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,670
they did a lot of time in Germany.

542
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,410
They lived in Germany
for a long time and they,

543
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,210
they speak German and they were like
beloved in Germany. Smart Dude. Yeah.

544
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,730
Really smart. They're fucking PhDs. Yeah.

545
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,260
It's kind of crazy that guys with super
high education would be the hazy on the

546
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:03,830
eyes. Too easy on the eyes. Perfect
genetics. No big deal. Yeah.

547
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,150
But you know, he lost a bunch of
times. He's an interesting case man.

548
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,050
He lost a bunch of times and uh,
another eye gouge man.

549
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,630
What do you know at a
certain point time man,

550
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,800
someone's got to do something about
these guys. Part of the sport. Right.

551
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,520
Is it though? I mean he can this like
people getting kicked in the nuts.

552
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:25,420
You'd be like, man, we have to stop ice
or take it out. A way to do it though.

553
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:27,350
If you ever tried one
of those a diamond cups,

554
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:29,720
those diamond and my makeup's nope.
You told me about it last time.

555
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:31,620
I thought I was going to get
one in the mail. I get you one.

556
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm going to every techstars,

557
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,530
these diamond directly in the
balls every single time. Dude goes,

558
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:39,420
hold on a second. Hold on.
Hold on one second. Yeah.

559
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,100
Off the top of my head. Oh, there we go.
Two matches that ended with ball shots.

560
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,280
Oh yeah. Underlay Gilbert.
Ival remember that pride 11,

561
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,090
he kicked him in the balls and he just
couldn't recover cause his ball got

562
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,600
caught and guys were never the same man.
Kind of have to kick him.

563
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,960
Most of the time though in MMA from,
from what I remember,

564
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,500
you get kicked in the balls. That doesn't
end. The fight might, they might be true.

565
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,860
You get five minutes to recover
Gilbert idol. It was done in one that,

566
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,060
and I didn't recover from that when his
ball was sticking out. Oh, got crushed.

567
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,610
And that's the only one I remembered.

568
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,740
You guys remember any fight
ended because of a bunker shot.

569
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,900
I don't fight fights end
because of I got this right.

570
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,290
How many invented and you can detach.
We'll get them out.

571
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,690
Anthony Johnson ended because of the eye
gouge. The Anthony Johnson fight was,

572
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,920
it was a bad one. Phil Davis, uh,
fought that one dude. Brazil. Yeah,

573
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:38,550
that's what they stopped
the fight veto. Uh,

574
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,120
who has a [inaudible] against a grand
tour, but that was a different thing.

575
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,500
That was actually a good lunch slice.

576
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:47,850
The upper eyelid like his eyelid was open,

577
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,000
like you could like could
keep his eyes closed.

578
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:54,330
You could see his eyeball through
us. Yeah. And it was from a punch,

579
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,900
like the grazing of the uh,
side of the glove did that,

580
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,650
I think you just got to chalk it up,
man. Part of the sport. You say that,

581
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,590
but have they looked at all the options?

582
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,910
Because I feel like people can
figure something out. First of all,

583
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,870
Tim Kennedy said they should use the pride
gloves. Jamie, go, go grab some there.

584
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,950
They're in the back. I had
him. I just for this, uh,

585
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,470
for this discussion they cover the
fingers a little more, a little more,

586
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,420
but they accentuate the curve.

587
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:25,740
Apparently according to Jackie
Kennedy keep you in this position,

588
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:28,680
whereas the UFC gloves, you actually
have to stress to close your hand.

589
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,020
Here it is right here. This is the,
this is the official Prague love.

590
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,340
This is from Brian London.
Real what? That makes sense,

591
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,790
right on real curve. If you
want to straighten it, you can,

592
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:46,190
but you've got to force it.
Yes, that's a very good, well,

593
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,430
and then Everlast recently developed
a glove for Bella tour that they're

594
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:53,850
allowing the UFC to use. There's
definitely more covering the fingers.

595
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,610
Everlast the rapper,

596
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,040
like my man is a bad
motherfucker entrepreneur. Um,

597
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,990
he um, they developed a, a a glove,

598
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,940
the Bella towards using where it covers
like it makes the hand bend more.

599
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,590
I get some more formed like a
fist and Allen and yeah. But yeah,

600
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:17,910
I think even more so maybe even
better than the pride one. But the uh,

601
00:37:17,911 --> 00:37:20,670
the pride when our like the fingers
don't spread apart as much. Like look,

602
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,330
when you open your hand, put Po, hold
your hand up like that. See it seems like,

603
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,070
it seems like there's a little more
coverage of the fingers a little bit more,

604
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:33,720
a little longer, a little longer.
Damien Maia, Alexander Jako Lev,

605
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,580
who is him? What his big so
beautiful. I don't know. I don't,

606
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:43,170
I'm not aware. Um, I'll look it
up real quick. But this a real,

607
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,150
the struggle is real to get this glove on.
But

608
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,090
is there more padding on these though
then in UFC gloves and look three tickets

609
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:53,170
and they go on.
I want to just start walking around and

610
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,920
thinking of the same way.
What is it

611
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,820
legit. I box today with Wayne McCullough.
You, I've been boxing a lot this week.

612
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:07,520
Yes I have. They do have a little more
patent on the front. Like you said,

613
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,420
your hands are curved.
You want to hear something random,

614
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:13,590
you know the nods commercial with the,
uh,

615
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,870
the guy with the Mohawk who
gets knocked out and the guy,

616
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,240
I took a lesson at revolution MMA in a,

617
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:24,500
in Toronto from that guy who
knocks him out the Moitai lesson.

618
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,900
It was really cool. Yeah.
And you know Joe Gerson,

619
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:30,080
Joe the Guy [inaudible]
Satoh you're that guy.

620
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,390
You're steering. Your
stories are hurting, bro.

621
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,280
I'm trying to,
when

622
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,750
we talked about it last night when we
talked about last out of the instructors

623
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,190
and the guy is the guy, you're
the good, listen, listen,

624
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:54,160
there's a million guys out there who
train and we're tap out shirts that look

625
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:57,700
exactly. That was him. He was him. Well
that's what he told you like I have no,

626
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:00,860
we talked about it.
That's a claim to fame.

627
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,430
People get mad when you call it like
there's people aligned to get mad when we

628
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:10,570
do fun. Brian. Oh, I know bullying.

629
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,960
You're bullying Brian. I know
you guys bully Brian. There's a,

630
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,020
you have a reputation
for that. Yes, we did

631
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,040
podcasts.
We did.

632
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,970
We actually got tweets that were accusing
us of people don't understand ball

633
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:27,210
busting. Like I don't know if
you guys don't have to. Yeah,

634
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,160
but you guys who are freaking out
because we bust each other's balls. Yeah,

635
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,050
go get some friends. Also also also very
sensitive if you haven't noticed. Yeah,

636
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,000
well you don't understand.

637
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:39,210
He likes it like half of the
reason why he acts retarded,

638
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,590
so they will call them on it. It's
not so subtle. It's not very subtle,

639
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:47,760
ladies and gentlemen, if you're freaking
out and attaching that much to do too,

640
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,980
obviously like hanging out
with each other. I don't know.

641
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:53,070
Maybe you have friends at home that you
don't really like and we'll try. I mean,

642
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:54,000
I do go home and cry,

643
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,610
but that's not the case.
Brian cries at night.

644
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,300
I do in my hands or you can
come down to abot. Kenny,

645
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,550
you're down there. Let you feel like
Brian Killen. You'll show me around.

646
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,360
Mr Kellan can have some of that
delicious one. I friend. I,

647
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:08,280
that's what I brought it for.
Eddie. Do you want some wine?

648
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:12,060
Because somebody is training right
now so they can't have it. Mr a man.

649
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:15,330
I'll tell ya Brandon shop don't
get his way when he's hungry. Oh,

650
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:20,100

go time go time. How you a baby? Good man.

651
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
Ready to go.
I've never been more excited for a flight.

652
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,700
Get some why Eddie go get a
glass right in to solve the, uh,

653
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,850
the trailer to see the trailer
that Lincoln Park release
where you'll see one 74.

654
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,230
No, I watched that. And you will be amped.
Really. Lincoln Park did. They can park.

655
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,880
Yeah. Holy Shit. It's dope.
Dana white tweeted out. Yeah,

656
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,440
they played it on the wall.
You're obviously working,

657
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:44,940
but they played it on a UFC one 73 and
I was watching it with some buddies and

658
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:48,840
um, I don't know. Things got
real. It's like, Oh shit,

659
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,540
we're two weeks away here, boy. Ready
Baby. Wow. Your main card, right? Yeah,

660
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,800
of course. Just like asking
dumb questions. Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:58,530
Why don't you play it and have you
found it? I mean, he'd go Lincoln Park,

662
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:02,400
UFC one 74 standard. Lincoln busted
a, an acoustic set. Not going to lie.

663
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:06,420
It wasn't who I love.
Lincoln Park Acoustic.

664
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,060
Anyways, they played
this promo and a, yeah,

665
00:41:09,061 --> 00:41:11,670
I didn't say a word for this and
I kind of went never back down.

666
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:14,800
MMA motivation feature in
Lincoln Park. Is that it? Nah.

667
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,870

called Lincoln Park Wasteland. Okay.

671
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,860
Slap that bitch on. Okay,

and then you see out stack.
This card is one 74 that it is.

674
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,950
Anyway, back to my story about taking

675
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,703

It was the second one.

678

Yeah, that's it. Wait, hold on.

679

Okay, here we go. Yeah,

Where am I hearing that?

682
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,000
You got to hear the music, man. This
isn't it. Why is this your truck?

683
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:31,420
Can I shut this off?
I'm gonna shut the Ustream off.

684
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,900

Okay. Let me play this for you

Drives me nuts.

The volume is down on that
youtube browser to, Oh, is it?

691
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,180
Well, let's play this when the
fights out on good call. Cause I'm,

692
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:08,140
I'm a mess here.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

693
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,690
Nah,
y'all come on Damien Maia.

694
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,260
It's gotta be a big weight cut for
a Damien Maia said it's easier bro.

695
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:19,000
He just fucking one day. How's they
get sash? He's got some tits on.

696
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,591
Yeah,
he gave him,

697
00:43:20,591 --> 00:43:23,620
I went on that losing streak because
for whatever reason you have this

698
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,280
worldclass Jujitsu and they're like,
you know what I like striking.

699
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:30,400
I'm not going to take guys down. I just
want to strike. Yeah. It's crazy to me.

700
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,240
I get on these rugs tag Mark
Munoz and hurt him, you know,

701
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:37,840
and I think he fall in love with it,
getting better at it,

702
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,680
but he still uses it.
You just feel like now he is.

703
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,450
Now he's at one sandwich
store 85 he wasn't. Yeah,

704
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,930
the Rick story fight was incredible.

705
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,770
I remember when he toss chill Sona
and landed in that mounted triangle.

706
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,360
I was so sick.
Yeah.

707
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:58,100
I think it's so scary for
a lot of Brazilian Jujitsu
practitioners to get in to

708
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:03,940
MMA and all of a sudden some dude's
trying to fucking knock them out.

709
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,740
It's scary.
So when,

710
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,800
when they get to the point where they
actually can do it and they're getting hit

711
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:11,260
and they're like, fuck, there's
nothing to be scared of.

712
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,180
And even though they lose
decisions, I think they, I
think they like it. You know,

713
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:19,390
I think like Georgia Shell, he's
losing decisions, but he's like, fuck,

714
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm not afraid of this shit. I'm a
fucking savage. He's getting hit,

715
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:25,150
he's getting cut up and he
just keeps going forward.

716
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,150
I think that it feels good to them.
He's got [inaudible] feels good or not.

717
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,160
It's got some powder and he
seems to, uh, and especially

718
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,990
when you're awake,
guy like Damien,

719
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:38,190
Mike gets knocked out inside the octagon
and now we could do it to people. Yeah.

720
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah. So I think they, even though they
lose a decision, they just liked it.

721
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,490
They liked throwing. Here we
go. But it's also, you know,

722
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:47,880
you got to realize that a guy like Damien
Maia got so fucking good at Jujitsu

723
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:51,690
because he becomes obsessed
and he probably just assumes
he's going to get that

724
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:52,490
good at striking.

725
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,230
He was saying that would be his home
base threatening everybody everywhere.

726
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,400
Oh yeah. He has got out there with
his hands like way better, way better,

727
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:03,180
way better. He's moving. He looks
much more like a striker. Yup.

728
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,690
There's that weird way that grapplers
move when you know they can't strike it

729
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,000
all. It's real awkward. Very stiff. Yeah.

730
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,130
But when you see a guy get that certain
fluidity to them and it's, it's weird.

731
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:18,060
Like it doesn't always translate that
way cause some guys look kinda awkward,

732
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:21,120
but they're really good strikers.
I Love Damien Maia because, uh,

733
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,710
I was at a real low point in my life
when I was fighting in Brazil and I was

734
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,270
again, asa yet like two in
the morning after I fought
Nogueira and uh, he came up,

735
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:33,210
give me a big hug in front of all these
people. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, man.

736
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,400
That's cool. Really cool.
Yeah. It's a very nice guy,

737
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,640
but certain stuff you don't forget, you
know? Yeah. No, that's very cool, man.

738
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,430
So He's doing rolled his Jab,
popping that jab out there,

739
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:44,660
but he hasn't been able
to get ahold of this.

740
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,480
Russian dude is a master
of sport in both sides.

741
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:54,060
Mastering, sporting what? Master's son.

742
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,630
It's over master of sport and
Sabo and Jujitsu or it's awesome.

743
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,630
Although that's over big elbow. Good
luck in him off of Mount. Yeah. Yeah.

744
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,590
Two and a half minutes to build sales
mountain is sick. It's a building.

745
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,530
Oof.

746
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,490
Damien Maia said tax book.
She just tell you right now time,

747
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,490
what are the odds that this guy
survives this round? What are the odds?

748
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,380
I'd say they're 50% because our sport
and Sambo and a master sport and

749
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:27,180
wrestling, I say less than 30% if you
think there's going to be over, yes.

750
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:31,180
You got to bet money. Yes. I
like that guy. He's a, he's
been, this is a confidence.

751
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:35,550
10 Bucks, 10 bucks right now that he'll
survive. Okay, I'll take that. But Hey,

752
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,420
10 bucks.
I say nope.

753
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,420
Oh, Damien, I'll bet both of
you. So, okay. I'm saying,

754
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,340
I'm saying he's going to survive. How do
I say the homeboy totally survived? Yeah.

755
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,480
I say survive. Survive. He
looks fresh right now. Look,

756
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:53,910
you always got to do is he's going to
take Joe's Alamos. He's definitely,

757
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,230
he could get stopped but I think it's a
little bit better than 50% of make it.

758
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,280
It's got a minute 30.
He's going to say he's going to survive.

759
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,140
You guys come on days session
dues are tough as shit son.

760
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,490
I'm still as hard Tom, you got 20 bucks.
Shit, 20 bucks on the line. Yeah, I do.

761
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,270
Yeah. There's so many of these
cats that are Yossi and in um,

762
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,310
there's also guys,
it's a belt or too,

763
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,170
there's some sick Russians
over there as well.

764
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,320
I'll tell you right now when this dude
was getting ready for the game plan for

765
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:25,710
Damien Maia, they said he's a first round.
Do not let him get on top of you all.

766
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,740
It did set the fan, but it's still,
he's got a minute and got caught. He got

767
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,760
plenty of time for a sick ass arm bar
and he said he might corners and go 30

768
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:40,360
seconds. You like that though? Up against
the cage. Like that makes it tough. Yeah,

769
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,480
it makes it tough. I have a win win
situation because if I lose your money,

770
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:48,340
that means Damien Maia. One second
to go on in the wind. So come on.

771
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,511
Damon's gonna win,

772
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:52,420
but he's going to win in the second
and third is not going to finish.

773
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,860
Dude is too far. He's scared
to tell you that man. Oh,

774
00:47:56,861 --> 00:48:01,290
big elbows. Elbows are ferocious. Oh,

775
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,800
missed him. Estimates that s grip
was pretty triangle coming up.

776
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:10,480
Sun Hot Triangle coming up.
Hoss Triangle. You got him down.

777
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,990
He guys got it down though.
He's creeping up on the case.

778
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,090
He's going to try to get that is going
to try to get his leg under his head. Oh,

779
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,800
right on man. He's trying
for that. Right? All right.

780
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,680
I thought he had it looked like he
was going to set up front. Triangle.

781
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,930
Elbows are ferocious. I'm a slow
triangle, right? That slow triangle, right

782
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,870
triangle, right. That
bloom. Damien Maia. Damn.

783
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,070
You can't spin to the,
to the [inaudible]. No,

784
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,370
he can't save it. Save it. We're going to,

785
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,650
we're going to get a ride.

786
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,130
I was America fresh 20 point.

787
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,270
I want to take more of your money. Flux
ain't gonna do shit on my life. God,

788
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:52,900
Eddie Bravo was on fire. He's on fire,
man. It's the Indian one sip of wine.

789
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,580
Indians fucking crashed out right now.
By the way,

790
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:02,640
I the Instagram picture
of you and Brendan,

791
00:49:02,641 --> 00:49:07,180
you're head is about twice as big as
the heavyweights over here. Yeah. My,

792
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,980
my uncle used to call me moon head.

793
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:11,680
I always had a big head and
that really like hurt me.

794
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,870
Why you gotta you gotta you
gotta heavyweights head.

795
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:18,280
So now I call all my head instructors
moon heads cause they're like moons.

796
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,370
So now I turn moon head into
something positive. Changed it.

797
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,530
I regret how training moons in the 10th
Planet System. Where do you teach at?

798
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:30,700
He's still downtown. It's too far from
me. A lot of seminars to it's too far.

799
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,830
Do you live Monday through Thursday?
Eight 30 to five eight 30

800
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,240
it's too far. I go there. I
just got some Sandiego. Yeah.

801
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:44,490
How could you say it's too far? I got too
much. Come on down. Come down, man. I got,

802
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,180
I got shot at writing guys.
Between Kung Fu and my step class.

803
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,280
We'll dedicate that glass just to make an,

804
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,580
making sure you leave with something
that you can use in your career.

805
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:59,560
I will definitely take you up on
that. This is Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.

806
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:03,070
Monday to Thursday, eight 30 at night.
No traffic. Boom. He hit downtown.

807
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,450
I got people come on the traffic. Brendan
shrubs or professional. God dammit,

808
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,900
Brian Callen. If you make them walk
across the street to get it, he's too far.

809
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:13,810
It's too far. I couldn't even go to her
for doing. It was like I could walk there,

810
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:17,590
make it there. I can't make it. I can't.
I can't guys too far. It's too far.

811
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,940
Hey, you have your invitation.
Remar right? Eddie tomorrow. Yes.

812
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,250
Tomorrow I have a Jujitsu tournament.

813
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,890
I put together a submission only Jujitsu
tournament called Eddie invitational.

814
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,010
It's at the Florentine
Gardens in Hollywood.

815
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:32,750
If you're anywhere in southern California,

816
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,430
the doors open at 4:30
PM first match goes a at,

817
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,480
it starts at six and we have a one
45 60 men bracket and a one 70 uh,

818
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,940
16 men bracket man.
And we got Gary Tone in at one 70.

819
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:50,120
Remember the match we talked about him
and Kron Gracie Gary Tone and is the

820
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:54,170
number one seat at 70 and at one
45, Jeff Glover, he's like, Oh shit,

821
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,550
he's number one at one 45.
So basically he's a beast.

822
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:02,180
I got some 10 plan of black belts that
are basically going to probably end up in

823
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:03,290
the finals.
Surprise.

824
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,330
It's going to be Gary or Gary
Tonin against Boogie maybe.

825
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,110
Or uh, if Gary Tone and even gets by
Nathan Orchard, one of my black belts.

826
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,170
Who knows what happens,
but it's, it's going to be

827
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:20,080
either way and grant match, by the way,
Damien [inaudible] boy pat situation,

828
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,580
you got him down with diem now.
Now let's see. Let's see, mountain,

829
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:29,500
anyone in the division, he gets
down. No one wants to take it back.

830
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,520
I love the guy doesn't get
out of this round guys.

831
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:35,380
I say he finishes him right here. No,
I agree. I think he's going to fit.

832
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:37,600
It's going to finish. What do you think
he's gonna Finish them or survive?

833
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:40,060
He three minutes. No, no.
He's going to finish him.

834
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:43,510
I think he's going to finish him. I'm a
contrarian is not going to finish him.

835
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:47,560
Do it. Rushed out. This guy cannot get
out from under the mountain. Brian.

836
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,800
This is like watching a blue belt
versus a black to that situation.

837
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:52,330
And I'm not saying that
this guy's a blue belt,

838
00:51:52,331 --> 00:51:56,380
but I'm saying Damien Maia would do the
same to so many black belts, right? Yes,

839
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,520
he's, he's so God damn good. Don't
anything helping. This guy is the cage.

840
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,570
If the cage wasn't there,

841
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:04,420
Maya would be doing some serious work
if they were in the center. Yeah.

842
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,430
Frank Mir told me that he you like,

843
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:08,680
this is like Frank Mir is
God damn black belt, right?

844
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,500
Everybody says Frank Mir was buck,

845
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,940
but he told me after he rolled
with with Damien, mind goes,

846
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:14,950
I'm not really a black vote cause
I'm like a brown belt chase.

847
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,310
It's really said that, wow, you can't
believe how good this guy come on.

848
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:23,500
And he said he's a 1% or does he tap
frank Mir though? I don't know he,

849
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,310
I didn't ask that. That's disrespectful.
How dare you. Right. But frank is a,

850
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,960
you know,
he's a super smart dude.

851
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:31,960
Like if you've never had a conversation
with Frank Mir, he's very smart,

852
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:35,830
very well read,
very well read guy and very honest too.

853
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:38,410
Like he's not a bullshit artist.
So like when he's,

854
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:41,460
he's telling you about how good Maya is.
It's come from a

855
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,830
good, he's a good, easily he trapped
that. Did you sweat that? That, that,

856
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,880
that move with the guard was trying to
hip escape and how beautifully Maya made

857
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:54,490
that transition back to full
mount like this inevitable.

858
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,811
Now he's got him in the middle.

859
00:52:55,811 --> 00:52:59,620
He's got an Mlo who put everything into
trying to get out of that fucking mouth.

860
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,950
Look how good Maya's mount is. This
hooks. He's just controlling his legs,

861
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:08,260
his knees when he throws the exploding.
Just taking it all. I've got that arm.

862
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:09,230
See he's not going to,

863
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:13,030
you can't get out of that shit like you
can with another guy's arm triangle.

864
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,960
Damien Maia has wicked positioning like,
look how good he's close position.

865
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,140
Taking the back. Taking
the back hook. Oh Damn.

866
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,320
I lost it. Oh, shocked. Okay.

867
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:26,190
He makes it out of this round

868
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,040
now. The guy's going to make it
out or argue with me guys. Yeah,

869
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:32,040
he's got to make it out there
about me. I know. Fighting. Um,

870
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,840
he's going to take them
down. Maya's rustling. It's
pretty on point now. Now. Oh,

871
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:40,890
look at this knee attack is this
guy's game. Oh Damn. He's got a name.

872
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:44,850
He's got a good team. Yeah. He's got an
arm in. Oh No, no. He doesn't have shit.

873
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,440
I mean, the only that's not going
to work on, got an order over.

874
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:52,350
He might switch a dark. He's got to
be just exhausted, I think. Yeah.

875
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,970
Mine was exhausted. I mean, he really got,

876
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,490
has a submitting Maya's if this
guy is no fucking joke, man. His,

877
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,120
his Jujitsu is no joke though man.
It's good defense. Good defense.

878
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:05,780
Get in and out of that arm triangle.
You know he,

879
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:08,700
I mean he couldn't get out of Damien's
mouth, but look, he's still here.

880
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,360
He surviving. He's going to
get swept here. Let's see.

881
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,180
Double under hooks with full guard though.

882
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:18,150
He's not trying to sweep and we just
hanging on. He tried to his body.

883
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:21,060
It never makes sense to me. The MMA,
when guys triangle the body from the,

884
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,230
not from the ground, from the back,
from the back of the Mat. Totally.

885
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:27,420
But from guard, what are you
trying to get? Trying to hang on.

886
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,880
That's what I think he's trying to do.
I think he's trying to decide the rest.

887
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,060
Yeah. If you go for a body,
like he's letting it loose here,

888
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,710
but if you go for a body
triangle and full guard,

889
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,090
you're not trying to set up a submission.
Do you literally can't do anything.

890
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,630
You could start any to stall.
You could let it go yourself show.

891
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,080
The thing about it is you could let
it go yourself like so say yeah.

892
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,420
So say if like a,
if a gay teen presented itself,

893
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,160
you could always get back to full guard,
right?

894
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,500
You could use the real full guard if
somehow or another you could catch some

895
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,130
pain or sickness to do
that. A lot. He was,

896
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,430
he is at the most wholesome strikers are
just like, you ain't passing this guard.

897
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,090
Never and you just cross your ankles
and the guy has a good knee slice.

898
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,560
He could open that shit up.

899
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,820
But when you were putting on the triangle
you're saying, I ain't trying to shit,

900
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,410
I'm just going to hold you and
sometimes you need to do that.

901
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:12,970
If one of my fighters as well,

902
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,480
it's mostly a striker and his Jujitsu
with just coming along and he,

903
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,920
he was in some amateur MMA fight, I'd
say. Yeah figure for his fucking body.

904
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:23,400
You know, you don't try no triangles
or I think as a pass your guard,

905
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:27,810
if you fuck up, you'll see high level
guys own the UFC in the first round,

906
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,350
the do somebody triangles, which
is, it's always crazy me, is all,

907
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:34,170
they'll be losing the fight and they'd
be like second round, third round,

908
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,980
and they do body triangles. [inaudible]
tobacco from the guard, from the guard,

909
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:41,730
from the guards, weird from the band.
Same from the back is going to happen.

910
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:44,850
In other words, you know you're losing
the fight, right? It's so critical.

911
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:47,340
It's like stolen and you're taking
away two of your weapons anyway,

912
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,900
but really he's losing
the fight and he's like,

913
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:51,480
and this shit's looking really
bad. I'm on my back. I'm very,

914
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:54,770
I'm not very good on my back.
I'm not going to let it get worse.

915
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,720
I'm going to put on a triangle.
That's what they're thinking.

916
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,180
I'm not going to let it get any worse.
It's getting really bad right now.

917
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,090
Rather survive with the guy and the guard.

918
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,200
Then have the guy pass a mountain and
then really take them out to see loved

919
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,720
guy's tough man. Let's see if he comes on
to third round. He said just hit Damien.

920
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:13,170
Maia would a hard fucking leg kick
I think. Stop forgetting six three.

921
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,710
What the hell happened there?
Wow.

922
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,530
It's just tough feedback. Damien
Maia is uh, he's tired man.

923
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,280
He exerted a lot of energy

924
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,840
trying to finish in that side and I think
the one 70 cuts tough form and we've

925
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,810
seen them have us. Uh, what's your
walk around 200 pounds or something?

926
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:35,890
He's a big boy. Yeah, he
really love, love. Just nailed.

927
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:40,840
Why walks one 90? He's tired. He's tired.

928
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:45,190
Holy Shit. No doubt y'all gloves trying
to wear him out. That's why too. Wow.

929
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:49,810
He's pushing them right now. Yaka
level looks way more. Way more fresh.

930
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,680
You got to get the first two rounds of
Damien. Oh no doubt. He has to finish.

931
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,100
He's going to lose this fight.
If he just asked you leg kicks though.

932
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:59,140
He hit him with three hard
leg kicks in this round.

933
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:00,850
Okay,

934
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,840
let's see if he can land some
strikes is kind of interesting, man.

935
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,380
I love shifts. You know, that's
what makes fight so interesting.

936
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:14,920
When you see a guy pull,
pull victory out of the jaws of defeat,

937
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:17,680
figure out a way to get out of a hole
like you thought homeboys just can get

938
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,740
dominated that those get finished in
the first round. Yeah, look at him.

939
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:21,910
Here he is and the third.

940
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,570
Okay,

941
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:27,830
and Damien Maia can't touch him
and he hits him again. Boom.

942
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,840
Know Maya's these hurt dude.

943
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:34,460
I got my leg massage today and I
almost tapped out getting a massage.

944
00:57:34,461 --> 00:57:38,750
I a woman on your idea of a
guide on the side of your leg.

945
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,650
My calves on a lady who knows how
to use her elbows. Right. She's,

946
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:48,190
she's really knowledgeable,
really knowledgeable in to Damien.

947
00:57:48,191 --> 00:57:52,640
Maia is getting fucked up with
his leg and eat up. I mean,

948
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,740
I don't know how many of these
he's going to be able to do what?

949
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:57,910
He can't feel them right now,
but it's definitely taken a toll on,

950
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:01,100
but you really can't feel him. You won't
be able to walk tomorrow. I bet. Yeah.

951
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,930
I think you're probably right.
Look at this time again son.

952
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh my God. This is going to
win him the fight for sure.

953
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,100
No doubt he's not getting up.

954
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,970
The only way this guy's ever getting out
of this position of Zip Maya goes for

955
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:14,630
an arm bar.

956
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,330
And why would he go for an arm bar if
he's dominated the first two rounds?

957
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,990
If he's this tired, he's tired. No,

958
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,410
but I feel like in that first round he
should've went for something man. Yeah.

959
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:27,980
I got an arm bar from here.
I mean by the web transition methodically.

960
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,760
I'm out. Yup. Well why isn't he
doing it? Because he doesn't want to.

961
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:34,760
He wants to right now to just punch
this guy cause he's tired too hard cause

962
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,510
there are a,

963
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:39,140
or if he just doesn't mean he wants to
be able to get enough energy for a burst

964
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,680
and he wants to be able
to get into big issue.

965
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:44,390
Lori's reasonably convinced that he's
going to be able to finish it. Right.

966
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,031
You know,

967
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,450
he just doesn't want to exert everything
and wind up in the bottom getting

968
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:49,190
grounded,
pounded when the bell wants out.

969
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,530
Cause that's what happened in
that one round. Right. He got,

970
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:56,140
he got reversed and you know, that's
forgot like that. That fucking sucks. No,

971
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:59,420
he doesn't want to feel that he's
a dominant ground fighter. That's,

972
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:02,300
that's a terrible feeling that he fucked
up and wound up on the bottom that it

973
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:07,040
could have cost him the round. You
know, that kind of feeling. But look,

974
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:11,420
his mount is like a goddamn
building on your chest. So good.

975
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,900
So good. I love seeing it, man. I
know some people at home are like, oh,

976
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:16,880
this is so boring.
I literally,

977
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:20,650
there's nothing more I like to see when
you see a guy who a mount is that God is,

978
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,150
you can't see what he's doing. Like he
just looks like you look at his feet.

979
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,620
It looks like he controls when he goes
to explode, he takes one of them away.

980
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:32,480
It's also is his balance and his position.
It's what it is,

981
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:37,310
is a lot of it is on knowledge of Jujitsu
first knowing what to do in any given

982
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:41,360
circumstance and then thousands of hours.
I thought that guy just tapped.

983
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,910
What did he just do?
It really is just like a wild bull.

984
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:52,080
Exact same thing. The same muscles you
see. You see guys lose mount all the time.

985
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,610
USC All the time, but world class
black belts like Damien Maia,

986
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:58,700
they have that next level type mouse
got bucked off because they've been on

987
00:59:58,701 --> 01:00:01,520
longer. He's been doing, he's
been in this position, you know,

988
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,110
since he was thousands of
hours since he was sick.

989
01:00:04,111 --> 01:00:07,610
So to him this is home and you're
saying watch his feet, watch his feet.

990
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:10,090
When this guy goes to explode, he's going
to take away one of his hooks. Yeah,

991
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,800
look at,
look how beautifully transitions,

992
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,850
but no, no, no. Look,

993
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:20,540
the guy gets the half guard and boom
right into side control and he's going to

994
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:25,130
take us back again. Man.
He's got to have medicine.

995
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,043
He's got to do something.

996
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,250
Is either going to take us back
like he gave him the options.

997
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,610
He gave him two options. Either you
take us back right? Mount you. Yeah,

998
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:35,060
the dude's Coke [inaudible] triangle.
He's stepping over right now.

999
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,970
He's 20 seconds to go. Let's
see if it could pull it. Oh,

1000
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:38,480
he's got both arms in though.
Man Does.

1001
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,780
He might do it on a bar and he's going
for an arm bar. He lost the arm. Wow.

1002
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:45,250
He's still trying to set it up.
Switch you still? Yeah, to look at us.

1003
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,070
He's still spitting on him. I wish you
had done then the first round Damien Maia,

1004
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:52,800
you owe me $20 the juice is running.
You ever see that video?

1005
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:57,080
Oh the guys back up on his feet
kicked him right.

1006
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,740
Oh Shit.
I was it.

1007
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,040
Damn the Russian guys she
got it has to be frustrated.

1008
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,480
Mounted for basically nine minutes.
The 15 minute fight.

1009
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:12,230
It's fucking that guys do do it
through. So God damn good. I love it.

1010
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,960
But I love the fact that Russian
dude made it to the end. Yup.

1011
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,970
Very interesting stuff.
This is Steve and these dudes coming over,

1012
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:23,810
man. I was talking about this with Henna.
I don't people when guys get to mount,

1013
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,870
some people freak out like
all the fights over. It's,

1014
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,150
it's typically not these
days because there's not,

1015
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,990
there's not a high level Jujitsu
going on a lot of the times.

1016
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,000
So guys get to mountain, they lose it.
They just think it's over. Cause they,

1017
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,160
it's two guys who don't know Jujitsu and
there's a big heavy guy and mount and

1018
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:41,390
he's gonna Punch his face then.

1019
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,940
But in most cases guys are
getting out these days.

1020
01:01:43,941 --> 01:01:45,770
I don't think this is dangerous
to everyone thinks look,

1021
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:50,360
can you just see y'all keep that Russian
guy out of the sun in please. Yeah.

1022
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:53,950
What burning it starts smoking
to say you needs a spray Tan.

1023
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:56,090
You see Michael Kesa and um,

1024
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,140
and train Aldo that that last fight
I did not dude. Michael Key. Yes.

1025
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:02,540
Has got a Goddamn ground game.
Holy Shit.

1026
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:07,070
Turn all those obese dude cancer was
mountain cam and it was really hard for

1027
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:09,570
that dude to get them off of them.
As soon as he got him down on the ground.

1028
01:02:09,571 --> 01:02:12,140
I mean it was just, she asked
the ring, the guy adjusting,

1029
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,600
constantly adjusting suck.
Yes. And ultimate fighter.

1030
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:18,350
I thought that guy was going to last
one second and he ends up winning it.

1031
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,980
How about Tony Ferguson?
Did

1032
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,280
you see that cocoon and beat the shit out?
You know what he told me?

1033
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:27,430
You know what Tony told me? I don't, you
know, he's a 10th planet Purple Belt,

1034
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:30,300
so we talk a lot and he comes
to Hbcu every Thursday night.

1035
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,130
So He's a training at 10th
Planet Costa Mesa with Casey.

1036
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,510
And it comes to rain too. I see
him. Yeah, he comes, he, yes.

1037
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:42,930
He goes the range as well. He, you know,
he says, what do you think about cocoon?

1038
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,570
I go,
my advice was I suggest shit.

1039
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:49,140
I'm not going to tell a fighter of my
what to do. I'm just going to suggestion.

1040
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,160
I said, the only way he's
going to beat you is standing.

1041
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,790
He's fucking everybody up. He goes
after the liver, you know, cocooned. Oh,

1042
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,840
a weird dude in his karate style
I've ever seen in the UFC. He just,

1043
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,050
all he does is drop dudes with liver
kicks and he's fucking people up.

1044
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:08,550
It worked in Japan so well that
he got into the UFC and I said,

1045
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,640
don't fuck around with that. Take his
ass down. Tony wrestled in college.

1046
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:15,090
I go take him down.
Tony's Jujitsu is insane.

1047
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,900
It's very suited to his judges.
Transitions or sick.

1048
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,420
I was most impressed with cocoon. Oh,
that notches. He took those punches,

1049
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:24,450
but he got out of that Doris. Then I
talked to Tony afterwards. He was like,

1050
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:27,330
I don't, it wasn't, he wasn't squeezing.
Right. You just want to get, I'm tired.

1051
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,390
His heart rate up. Right, so
this is what he told me. I said,

1052
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,240
I would take them down. Go, what do
you want it? I just don't fuck around.

1053
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,900
Don't give them a shot. Take them
down. And he said, you know what?

1054
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,140
I'm going to dot them up a
little bit and I think, you know,

1055
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,360
play with them a little bit. Then I'm
going to take him down and some metal.

1056
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,990
I said, that's what you want to do.
Go for it. I'm like, you're going to,

1057
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,620
you're going to dance around with this
guy who's dropping fool after full with

1058
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,930
liver shots. You're going to give
them a shot. I go, go for it.

1059
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:56,460
That's how he's fucking like Conan the
barbarian. Yeah. He does exactly that.

1060
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:59,520
He dots among exactly where they took
him down, owned them on the ground,

1061
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:04,380
and then stood up a shock them the fucking
out with a big right hand and then he

1062
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:07,290
got tagged in the first round.
It cuno tagged them cocoon.

1063
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,680
I was one of those guys. You can get
one shot to try and find them right.

1064
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,630
And you're not going to duplicate
that in the training room.

1065
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:16,380
You get one live shot at this
dude. Honestly, I gotta be honest.

1066
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,040
I was laughing at him. You could
go, you could get a guy. I cocooned.

1067
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,100
There's his fighting style.
There's Saint Japan homie.

1068
01:04:23,101 --> 01:04:27,660
You get punched right in the face.
Tony, Tony Ferguson and Tony Ferguson.

1069
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:32,020
Tony is a monster. I've been
in, I've been in the end,

1070
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,390
the main industry since I've been getting
paid working in the MMA history since

1071
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:38,720
2000 yeah,
I seen a lot of motherfuckers come and go.

1072
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:41,970
I seen fighters coming to go fight
camps, come and go. Apparel, MMA,

1073
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:46,020
apparel companies coming. I seen working
backstage at the UFC for eight years.

1074
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:48,450
You see them come and go and
see him coming down. Seriously.

1075
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,370
I've never met anybody like Tony Ferguson.

1076
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:56,110
I never met anybody like him is he really
is like an operation 40 secret aside,

1077
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,080
he was born to do this.
He's doing in the game.

1078
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,650
I've never seen anybody studied
the game. Man, cat dude.

1079
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,630
He just breaks shit down and puts,

1080
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,500
he is learning Jujitsu
at such a rapid pace.

1081
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:14,430
He's got all these transitions that him
and Casey are putting together and they

1082
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:17,200
just, they come up on Thursdays and they
show me what they've been working with.

1083
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,250
I'm like,
they're putting

1084
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,640
insane stuff together. There's,
there's not too many guys.

1085
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:24,370
I'll stop and watch spar.
Right, because I have an ego.

1086
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:28,690
There's not to cause that
to me guys who you are.

1087
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,090
Stop and watch spar, but tone.
It wouldn't. Tony spires.

1088
01:05:31,091 --> 01:05:34,910
I'll watch to see Jack's dudes are really,
yeah.

1089
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,570
I like your when kick comes a
gym I can we fight to get me.

1090
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:40,810
He's like too and I'm like, Oh, who
spoiled with Tony? I'm like, excellent.

1091
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,820
I'll you're my rounds and
just watch it destroys these.

1092
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:48,340
Then I'm going to dot this dude
up a little brash as a killing.

1093
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:52,960
Everybody might, even if the
guys who it is, I'm going to go,

1094
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:55,040
hey bro, just say, you
know, I'm going to die.

1095
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:00,070
He was,
he got his back,

1096
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,300
hit them up and one of those like
Kevin Randleman Fay door slam.

1097
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:09,980
It was an epic before I die or I
die. Hey Bro, just say, you know,

1098
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:15,510
can do it like that.
You're going to be like that whole,

1099
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,040
that the new standard.

1100
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:21,250
It gets knocked out by some young cause
you would think life is a fucking movie.

1101
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:25,080
I want to try that out by the way,
just so everyone knows what I, the way,

1102
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,120
when I hit 55, I'm going
on the juice. Good again.

1103
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,470
I'm going to shave down. Go on the
juice, get a second hair trend.

1104
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,790
They say they say that could
Pluto has a successful uh,

1105
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,390
MMA apparel. Uh, yes. Store in Japan.

1106
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,680
I bet people are going in there and
be like, hey bro, you think that, uh,

1107
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:48,340
is there any styles? The best way to go?
It's good in Japan. He's right. Kill him.

1108
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:53,110
Karuna Japan killing guys.
But it's all about levels.

1109
01:06:53,111 --> 01:06:56,380
Like there's dudes who were killing guys
in other organizations and then they

1110
01:06:56,381 --> 01:06:58,200
get into the UFC and you
realize that your friend,

1111
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,840
and you look really good when
you're fighting B level fighters.

1112
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:04,510
But when you get in there with an a level
fighter, you're going to get fucked up.

1113
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:08,020
You got to have all your fucking
t's crossed, all your I's dotted.

1114
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:09,040
And some guys just don't.

1115
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:12,280
And when your hands are down by your Dick
and you moving around like you're in a

1116
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:14,800
karate movie, you're really,
you don't have to, you know,

1117
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:17,370
you have a unique thing you're doing.
And it was super,

1118
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,350
literally my brothers call me, we
were laughing, we laughed at him.

1119
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,450
He tagged Tony in the first [inaudible].
That's what I'm saying for Tony,

1120
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:29,590
it's such a dangerous fight because you
only get one life shot at then and the

1121
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,510
dude hits hard as hell.
He does.

1122
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:35,020
So it's like so you better bring your a
game or you can get drunk. But Tony was,

1123
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,580
once Tony got comfortable,

1124
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:40,900
Tony started lighting them up and once
you figured out that stance like, oh,

1125
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:42,530
this is in the style of really done.

1126
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:47,130
That's when I hit that swim move
off the back, got him into spider.

1127
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:51,600
Spiderweb was fuck, got to see this. It's
an amazing, nice, nice. How long did,

1128
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:55,500
how long ago? I really see he
switched around it first of Oh,

1129
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:58,300
very end of the first round. That's right.
I really wish you would have finished.

1130
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:03,450
I believe we're going to see Tony Ferguson
versus like Anthony Pettis and Ben

1131
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,640
Henderson. Gilbert Melendez. I
think he's that fucking good.

1132
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:13,030
He's a lot bigger than those too and
his though at the rate he's getting his

1133
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:17,020
Jujitsu. I mean his Jitsu
is like, do you guys roll?

1134
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:19,400
Did you teach Casey and all the attention
to what the fuck are you saying?

1135
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,770
Earlier I was explaining with the
Tony [inaudible] every Thursday I was

1136
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,780
explaining you weren't paying
attention to right now Brian.

1137
01:08:26,781 --> 01:08:29,930
He was waiting as well. Chuck
Ladell. That's what I was
watching, waiting for his,

1138
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:30,920
his time to talk.

1139
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:35,560
Chuck Chuck Norris right there.

1140
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:40,370
He's the real chuck Norris
Dude. Great. A great commercial

1141
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,480
and he's wearing toenail polish
the whole time. Oh, fantastic

1142
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:50,000
test.
That was like a zone.

1143
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,880
The dos Equis most interesting
man on the highest level.

1144
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,510
That was interesting when you're
talking about levels though,

1145
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:58,550
and when you get to the higher level,
shop.in fundamentals,

1146
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:03,590
fundamentals where everything
was not impressed with the
Chuck Norris Commercial.

1147
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:06,170
Brendan Schaub duck breast,
you didn't like that commercial.

1148
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:12,350
Get bigger than that.
It was like the biggest,

1149
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:15,110
you can get that kid, but that's
not what it's all about. He's like,

1150
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:16,070
that shit is ridiculous.

1151
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,970
We're going to give you $1 million.
We got this concept for this commercial.

1152
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:24,620
You wouldn't be trying to
argue with the director.

1153
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:26,710
You would just fucking dad
be doing some bull shit.

1154
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:31,560
I be fucking [inaudible].

1155
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,970
I don't have a problem.

1156
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:35,590
It all because it's so unrealistic,
you know,

1157
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:39,540
slamming your head into a wrecking ball.
It's so over the top. You get the point.

1158
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:44,130
Yeah. The car stops in the midair and he
just steps out kind of like, you know,

1159
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:48,750
you got your shorts branding up real dog.
That'd be dope.

1160
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,450
With a silhouette of a real dog.

1161
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:56,850
I thought about getting a guy real
doll and using them as a Jujitsu dummy.

1162
01:09:56,851 --> 01:09:59,790
I'm like, what would be a better thing
to use? But you'd have to explain.

1163
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,100
Do you have to call it factory?
I don't want to know.

1164
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:06,690
[inaudible] Dick [inaudible]
additional income.

1165
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,510
You rent it out. But guys want to
give you just cause you owned it,

1166
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,960
it was your real dot. Now,
$10,000. Just a session.

1167
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:20,330
Find my DNA cash.

1168
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,010
You call back and you go, I one hall.
But that's where I draw the line.

1169
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:28,844
Just one off.

1170
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:33,860
If a dude let me give you $1 million
to borrow your cash, you would do it.

1171
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,870
What fucker guy and hard to [inaudible].

1172
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,440
You kidding me? A mill. What are you
going to do? I'll take some value.

1173
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:48,030
That's not what I was
asking. You didn't. Uh,

1174
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:52,920
he was saying if someone used your
real doll would, if someone said,

1175
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,810
if he had a real doll,
a male one,

1176
01:10:54,811 --> 01:10:59,370
and some guy gay offered him $1 million to
bone it. Oh, this is the piece. Hold on.

1177
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:01,050
Turn the volume up on this.
Jamie. I want to hear.

1178
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:04,110
This is a piece on the
alieve bag routine off dude,

1179
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,770
who's whose names are harder to remember?
The Russians or the Japanese?

1180
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:12,510
Which ones? I think it's even
as a kid is such a beast. Yeah,

1181
01:11:12,511 --> 01:11:14,160
he's gonna Fight Demetrius Mighty

1182
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,760
Mouse Johnson though.
Dude Johnson some next level shit.

1183
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:22,550
But he's training with John Dodson in
that picture. They just showed them. Yeah,

1184
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:28,080
he trains at Jackson's, right?
Yeah. He's won for 11 straight.

1185
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:32,340
He's the best little Russian. Oh, he's a
man. He's a beast. He's a legit contender.

1186
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:32,761
No doubt.

1187
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:36,800
But I think if you want to talk about
number one pound for pound guys to meet

1188
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,690
you. Gotta you gotta fucking include
this guy. No one's including them.

1189
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:43,290
I include them in every list.
All I hear is John Jones,

1190
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:46,020
who spectacular Joe say Aldo,
who's amazing,

1191
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,320
but you've got to include this
dude in your pound for pound list.

1192
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:53,130
He does everything perfect. He's
fucking takedowns are lightening fast.

1193
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:57,660
His submissions, he knocked out Benevidez
with one punch. He's, he's wicked bro.

1194
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,840
He finished fucking Baraga in a war of
four round war and then he finishes him

1195
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:05,640
with an arm bar. He's the most
well rounded fighter in the sport.

1196
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,190
He's the most dust. Everything
black belt level. Yes.

1197
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,910
Everything black belt level and his
technique and everything is flawless.

1198
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:15,050
Everything is by the book. There's
no wasted energy, you know?

1199
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:18,360
But Bagua teen off is a fucking
beast, man. He's a big dude.

1200
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:22,230
He's strong as shit for 125 pounds too.
I mean,

1201
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:26,670
I don't know what he weighs
when he actually gets into
that octagon at that boom.

1202
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,000
I feel like the little guys are way more
happier to get in the octagon and fight.

1203
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:33,920
Right. Well thanks. So you
think they're more happy? Yeah.

1204
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:36,990
Were they finally get one of
the Hindu decision you to death?

1205
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,190
You know what I'm saying?
These little guys,

1206
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:42,030
chances you getting finished aren't
very good really. You? You're amazing.

1207
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,770
He is not.
He knocked out morale.

1208
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,800
I mean he submitted Moraga with an arm
bar and saying it's different overall.

1209
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,140
I gotta agree with Brenden [inaudible]
smaller guys and those guys.

1210
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,810
And you can get knocked out with a jab
if you're a heavy heavyweight division.

1211
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:59,490
Much nicer. I know what you're saying.
I feel you. I mean, I can I get,

1212
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:02,490
can I get check out that card though?
I was going to say Rory Macdonald,

1213
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:06,270
Tyron Woodley, I can't wait. Craziness.
Are you nuts? That fights craziness.

1214
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:13,070
Andre Alaska Brennan and John Tyron
Woodley down 14 number of how big.

1215
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:17,960
It can get a lot shorter than uh,

1216
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,500
then. Then, um, who's like
a big Demetrius Johnson.

1217
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:26,280
He's like a big Demetrius Johnson
without Jujitsu Woodley. Woodley,

1218
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,510
strays. Wrestling's explosive.
But he said one what sky

1219
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,920
Tyrone Woodley is getting better
every fight and he's going to,

1220
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,650
he's definitely gonna mix
it up with all the top guys.

1221
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,670
I know you don't make calls on this iron
zinc, you have to put your money on one.

1222
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,540
One guy in that fight. Right.
On what? And Rory Macdonald,

1223
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,780
I would never put money on this. Saved if
I, if I would not put money on a fight,

1224
01:13:51,781 --> 01:13:54,960
would be totally private.
I would never admit who I'd bet on,

1225
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,370
but I will tell you this
possible scenarios of that
fight with Rory Mcdonald is

1226
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:03,270
very skillful and he's very good at
using angles and footwork and he's got a

1227
01:14:03,271 --> 01:14:06,260
very educated jab and if you're
not used to that jab you take,

1228
01:14:06,261 --> 01:14:09,750
you take a couple of them in the face
like Jake Ellenberger is and you go into a

1229
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,310
defensive shell cause you're like, okay,
this guy is tuning me up with his jazz.

1230
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,260
You can do a whole night. Yeah. And
every time I closed the distance,

1231
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:21,100
his jab is wicked, his footwork
is wicked and moves very well.

1232
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:22,720
And if you get him on the
ground is no god damn.

1233
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:26,470
Pick what is no goddamn picnic
at Pickwick. Pickwick. His,

1234
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,200
his guard is very good.
It's very good offensively.

1235
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:32,860
Defensively he's got wicked butterfly
guards. He keeps your hips elevated.

1236
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,900
He's fucking good man.
Real good.

1237
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:38,380
The real question with that guy and
that fight is can he get past that first

1238
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:42,580
storm? Cause Woodley's first
dorm is a motherfucker. It's
like a man versus a boy.

1239
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,840
It's like he's, he's so God damn,
physically strong and fast and skilled.

1240
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:51,790
On top of that, you know he, he
runs a weird race. That race of the,

1241
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,500
the cutting extreme cut of weight,

1242
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,800
extreme muscle density for 170 pounds.

1243
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,290
But somebody had a real good point
about it on the underground though.

1244
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,580
They were like, yeah, that cost him,

1245
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,550
but would he be a better
fighter if he didn't have that?

1246
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,300
That's the question you can't really
answer because he's got very special

1247
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:11,110
abilities because of that build. He could
have been a leaner guy if he chose to,

1248
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,840
if he chose to not lift weights.
If you chose to not eat as much.

1249
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,990
If he chose to do more cardio,
he could probably get smaller.

1250
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,360
But would he be better as a fighter?

1251
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:23,080
That's an interesting because he presents
a lot of unique problems because the

1252
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:24,910
fact that he's so God
damn physically strong,

1253
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:30,460
85 if you stayed at 85 to [inaudible]
70 [inaudible] 85 he's too small.

1254
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:31,271
He's too short.
Well,

1255
01:15:31,271 --> 01:15:33,970
I think that comes back to what I
talked about with Tim Kennedy too,

1256
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:36,310
which is there should be more
fucking weight classes, period.

1257
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:40,600
There should one f one seven
eight one 85 his god damn crazy.

1258
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:44,960
Oh, that's crazy. Crazy. I was,

1259
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:49,390
fuck we doing any more weight classes?
I think it's fine.

1260
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:51,940
I mean you just got to find
your spot and you can't

1261
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,650
until you too diluted
until you're 235 pounds.

1262
01:15:56,651 --> 01:16:01,520
Lavar Johnson's roid it up
at two 65 again. You guys,

1263
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,910
you guys are crazy. Well, he's an animal.

1264
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,760
No,
I disagree with Mr Bravo.

1265
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,900
I don't think we need to grow. I think
we did a two 25 there's already a lot of,

1266
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:13,250
you have to like,
we can barely keep up with the UFC now.

1267
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,680
Like you're going to add another way.
That's for the APP.

1268
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:20,040
More chick weights before you add
more guy or chick. Chick chick.

1269
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,180
Awesome. Are you kidding?
I agree. I agree.

1270
01:16:23,181 --> 01:16:26,760
It's fascinating watching women
with good technique fight.

1271
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,490
When there's one Ronda Rousey,
there's a cup.

1272
01:16:31,491 --> 01:16:35,860
Just legit black belt. Right? Look,
aside about Cyborg, Cyborg, Cyborg.

1273
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:40,130
Whoa, whoa. Rhonda. Hold about.
We're talking about the UFC.

1274
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:41,660
I'm not talking of
these bullshit amateurs.

1275
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:45,500
We're getting knocked out and boy tie
events on freaking access TV nine I'm

1276
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:47,240
talking about,
I'm talking about Seibel.

1277
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:50,870
She's not coming to the UFC and there's
no one 45 category and you can't,

1278
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:54,730
she's going to 35, dude. She's going to
have to Rhonda, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No,

1279
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,380
you're good. You're good. No,
she can come after Rhonda.

1280
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,960
You're going to have to pass a lot of
steroid tests and no one's trying to see

1281
01:16:59,961 --> 01:17:02,460
that bullshit. Well, I
mean you're, I favor.

1282
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:04,610
Might as well get a Tan and jump
in there and get a boob job.

1283
01:17:04,611 --> 01:17:05,800
You know what I'm saying?
What are we doing,

1284
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,140
Ron with a blue Ronda

1285
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:14,840
versus Cyborg is going to be the
biggest MMA fight and fucking history.

1286
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,320
Everyone's, everyone's going to
want to watch it. Yeah. Every,

1287
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:19,870
every element that's going.

1288
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,630
Plus their grandmas and their aunts
and their little girl cousins,

1289
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,190
they're all going to watch that one. Do
you remember when, when, uh, Cyborg fod.

1290
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:32,480
Gina de that odd. The audience that the
screen sound like a Beatles concert.

1291
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:36,980
Here's the pro whole different animal
she was cycling versus Rhonda is going to

1292
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:40,410
be the biggest fight ever. Trust
a Cyborg. He has some work to do.

1293
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,720
There's a bunch of problems is going
to happen. She's been testing side one.

1294
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,650
I just want to see the fight. That's the
great. Rhonda is fucking everybody up.

1295
01:17:48,651 --> 01:17:52,640
She needs some competition and Cyborg
is very confident. She wants her.

1296
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,700
That makes a great store. She
wants Mr upstairs. She wants,

1297
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:58,980
it's like playing grab ass in the
minor league. Tell you us she wants to.

1298
01:17:58,981 --> 01:18:02,570
That's the payday. If I'm a girl,
of course. Of course. That's

1299
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,430
you think there's an
issue. If a, if a woman is,

1300
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,050
let's say she was really taking
male steroids, I don't know.

1301
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:15,520
She tested positive give accident.
She says it was something

1302
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,240
very different.
Very different.

1303
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:24,950
Very different ones to a man
taking a testosterone supplement.

1304
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:29,030
When he takes his body has testosterone.
A man's supposed to have testosterone.

1305
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,680
When a woman takes testosterone,

1306
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:35,750
there's physiological changes there that
are first. Cyborg has male genitalia.

1307
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,990
No, it's irreversible. They
get stronger, they get thicker.

1308
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:43,040
They get higher bone density to get wider.
Their face structure changes, their,

1309
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,470
their musculature changes.
I know all that.

1310
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,540
I know that and I know just like Drago.

1311
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:50,810
Everybody knew Drago was on roids
but they still wanted rocky for,

1312
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,620
you know what I mean? Like
I had a script. Good point.

1313
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,200
You're saying it's bad
for this or whatever.

1314
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:59,840
I think it's bad for the weekend and
how are we going to pretend that like a

1315
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:03,110
large percentage of, I mean what
are we supposed to do on the show?

1316
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,740
A large percentage of these
fighters are on some ships.

1317
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:10,400
Don't you think there's a difference
between a guy taking guy stuff in a girl

1318
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:13,580
taking guy stuff? You know what
else taking male hormones. She's,

1319
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:17,030
she's changing her gender.
You are probably correct.

1320
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:20,060
I'm not even thinking about that shit.
I'm thinking about, I would love to see.

1321
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:23,930
I want to, I want to see Drago
versus rocky. I agreed on these.

1322
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:27,320
Rocky Drago is Cybil.
I agree with you and I agree with shop.

1323
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,090
I agree with Shab as an athlete.

1324
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:33,260
I think Rhonda shouldn't have to deal
with someone who may or may not have

1325
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:37,130
altered their body in a way that's
irreversible and gives them an advantage.

1326
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,740
I'm obviously no doctor,
so I don't know if that's the case,

1327
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:43,880
but what I've read is that there's,
they've showed permanent results,

1328
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:46,370
like permanent changes to people
who've done things like this.

1329
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,420
But if Cyborg can suck
down 35 that'd be a very,

1330
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:55,280
very tough weight cut. Wait, God. Yeah,
she's very, I mean, she's very big, so,

1331
01:19:55,281 --> 01:19:59,480
so it might even the score and that. Now
let me ask you something now of someone,

1332
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,920
a woman who,
uh,

1333
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:06,110
it grows up doing vigorous
exercise and gets into judo,

1334
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:09,570
judo to the point she goes to
the Olympics while she's growing,

1335
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:13,650
does all that exercise do something
to increase your testosterone?

1336
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:16,020
It's a very good question. I don't know.
Does it? It's a very good question.

1337
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:20,520
I would say it's not artificial
though. No, still. Yes, yes.

1338
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:26,280
I know what you're saying. And of
course, Cyborg, suspicious sideboards,

1339
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:29,610
a monster. Cyborgs mark, very
skilled for sure. No doubt.

1340
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:33,900
100% no, she's very skilled. Black.

1341
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,070
I think she's a black man on the
ground. Correct? Jujitsu Brown.

1342
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,300
She's a monster.
Hell of a fighter.

1343
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,290
I'm just saying there's certain things
that need to happen as a fan, as a fan.

1344
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:49,910
Do you want to see that? I don't want
to see it. Can I get some color on this?

1345
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:54,150
That's fine. Just not a fan of uh,
sideboards. Once you fight other girls.

1346
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:57,920
It's hard for me to watch like when she
fought Gina Brown Cyborg as a brown belt.

1347
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:02,250
No, I know. It just looks like
two different levels in there.

1348
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:03,084
You know what I'm saying?

1349
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:07,670
It looks like almost like a strong
ass girl versus a normal girl. Con.

1350
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,330
I don't like to see her
just bullying him around.

1351
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:13,740
But Rhonda as strong as fuck
I think is technique though.

1352
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:18,230
Strong road there plenty of
times. Meat, chicken, strong.

1353
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,210
She's pretty strong for sure.
But Sarah McMahon was more strong.

1354
01:21:21,211 --> 01:21:23,160
Look what happened to her.
Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

1355
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,970
Can I get some comps saying I want to
satisfy cyborgs number father girl,

1356
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:30,570
who's stronger than Rhonda has. That's
what I'm saying did, but she just joined.

1357
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:35,100
She destroys them with technique. I
want to see it. That would be awesome.

1358
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,080
I think everyone, everybody wants
to see that. Are you kidding?

1359
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:40,960
That's where I sat for me. I don't want
to see it. I don't care for it. Yeah,

1360
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:45,120
we'll look. I see both of your points
of view. I'm just wanting to see it.

1361
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,470
I want to see it as a fan.

1362
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,960
But I'd rather watch Meesha and
Ronda fight nine times about that.

1363
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:55,380
If the doctors are correct,
if the doctors,

1364
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:59,400
if the doctors are correct and
anything that she did take, you know,

1365
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:03,140
it gives her a permanent advantages.
How crazy would it be? A volunteer.

1366
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,780
That would be amazing. Right?
It comes on real weird.

1367
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:11,890
I think she beats her to cyber has a
real weird discussion. I agree. But when,

1368
01:22:11,891 --> 01:22:14,940
when you allowed to do that, like what
are you allowed to do to your body?

1369
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,380
And I think, oh no, he caught him
behind the ear. That was a big shot.

1370
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:26,170
This dude is, this is a gut dash. Yeah.
These guys were revved up. Good. Hit.

1371
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:30,780
Go off. Yeah. Good half guard there. Um,
it's an interesting conversation Eddie,

1372
01:22:30,781 --> 01:22:33,210
cause I see your point of
view as a fan and Brendan,

1373
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:36,630
I see what you're saying too. I mean,
and I see both of them because as a fan,

1374
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:41,010
if it was on fuck for sure.
Um, I would call that fight.

1375
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,450
I would hope there'd be a pay per view
fight and I would get to call it because

1376
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:48,290
obviously you would, I'm, I'm just
saying Cyborg fan me to listen. I'm,

1377
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,480
I'm sure I'm gonna get some hate for this.
There's no disrespect to Cyborg.

1378
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,433
However,

1379
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:57,240
I just don't like to see here bullied
these little girls that Rhonda Rhonda

1380
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,550
problem. There's no problem. Did you see
her kickboxing bout Dorina bars? Yes,

1381
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:07,210
I did. Great. She got knocked out. Well
she got dropped. Mars is a bad bitch.

1382
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,110
You're well people, they like go
cyborg glass and she fought a very,

1383
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:15,460
very high level striker in her
world in kickboxing, Muay Thai,

1384
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,980
lost goods like a post nine, like, Hey,
I'm just in here. Just get for sure. Yeah,

1385
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,280
she know. She knows sideboards a month.
Just practicing. It was, it was great.

1386
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,910
I don't know, man. Look. It's
interesting man. I would like to see it.

1387
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:32,270
It's interesting. It's very
interesting. But you know the, the,

1388
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:33,640
there's a real discussion.

1389
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:37,160
How about what people should be able to
get away with and not get away with far

1390
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,140
they take,

1391
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,980
what do you think about Gabby Garcia
fight and I'm just fighting and MMA.

1392
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,830
Gabby Garcia used to be a very heavy,

1393
01:23:47,831 --> 01:23:52,831
she used to be a gigantic shoot yet
to check six foot four 200 gigantic,

1394
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:59,140
250 pounds. She's like a giant
dude, like a six foot three,

1395
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:02,140
six foot four. He's
giant. And she would cry.

1396
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,700
She would just enter
absolute cause that was,

1397
01:24:03,701 --> 01:24:07,600
no one ever goes to absolute and there's
going to be an opposite and she just

1398
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:09,640
smashes everybody.
I was watched,

1399
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,990
I ran into her Abu Dhabi
and Beijing. I didn't, she,

1400
01:24:13,991 --> 01:24:17,680
I don't think he speaks any English so
we were like in the elevator together and

1401
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:18,130
match.

1402
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:23,130
It was like a giant mafioso hit man
like right next to me going home and she

1403
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:25,210
just smashes everybody.

1404
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:29,500
But that was a Russian leg lock check on
the other side about one 80 and she was

1405
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:32,620
leg lock in the shit out of everybody on
the other side of the bracket and I go,

1406
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,090
Oh shit,
this might,

1407
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,600
this might be trouble for Gabby who
knocked this gap was just smothering

1408
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:42,010
everybody and they met I think
in the finals or the semifinals.

1409
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:46,390
Gabby just fucked a steroid or
Russian chick was sad.

1410
01:24:46,391 --> 01:24:51,190
She was sitting on the side by
herself, by herself. But Gabby,

1411
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:55,280
since then, she decided to get in
the best shape of her. God Damn Luck.

1412
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:58,930
She's shot ready.
She looks like frank shamrock.

1413
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,420
She lost all that weight.
She's actually working on a machine.

1414
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:05,560
That's a good question.

1415
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:10,450
What does Gabby Garcia
fights way fighting in Japan?

1416
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:14,920
In Japan. They don't care. They
don't bring a little chat box guys.

1417
01:25:14,921 --> 01:25:17,750
Try not to talk over each other.
My bad. Sorry. Both of you just,

1418
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:22,460
I agree, but it's super hard to listen
to what people are complaining about.

1419
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,760
Cox. No, no, no, no. Let's
call these fights. I slow down.

1420
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:33,220
Nothing wrong with calling shredded shot.
That's her now.

1421
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,660
I wish you would,

1422
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:38,740
you would've found a picture of her fat
before she tested positive for fertility

1423
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:43,450
drug. I Dunno what the fuck did that,
but it's not of fertility. Drugs do that.

1424
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:48,310
Gimme Fabric Garcia test positive for
fertility drugs stripped of her 2013

1425
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:51,520
world's title one's
Brazilian Jujitsu powerhouse.

1426
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:55,240
Gabby Garcia failed a
drug test from the IB.

1427
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:58,960
J E F F 2013 worlds has
been stripped of her metals,

1428
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,840
but it might not be what you think.
Hmm.

1429
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,840
Test Pause for being jack
for a fertility drug.

1430
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:10,150
Wonder would a fertility drug
would do for you dude drugs,

1431
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:15,940
I dunno man. For like dragon fertility
or something. She doesn't have gargoyles.

1432
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:17,750
Can you imagine having a kid with her?

1433
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:21,410
I would like to impregnate her and
see what happens is a, that is a,

1434
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:24,050
you know what I mean? Just as
an experiment, I'll, I'll just,

1435
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:27,390
I'll pay some child support. But
true. That's phenomenal. That is.

1436
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:30,590
Look at that bottom. Come on. Gabby
is in tremendous. So she goes,

1437
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:32,610
she's going to fight pitches.
God,

1438
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:36,860
so you're talking about Cyborg
Cyborg turns 10 Brian's turned on.

1439
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,980
I'm a little turned off.
I'm actually producing estrogen.

1440
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,970
Look at her body fucking bleaks.
Theirs are better than mine.

1441
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,800
The greatest fight of all time.
You're so hilarious.

1442
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:50,500
It's going to be Rhonda versus
Rhonda.

1443
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:54,350
You haven't seen him lately.
I'm sure there I haven't.

1444
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,210
You ever seen me in that outfit,
dude,

1445
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,330
so before you actually do
me in that outfit and I'll,

1446
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:03,140
and see how I look compared to
that. Wow. Come on. Jump into MMA.

1447
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,470
She's fighting on the same card is
chrome. Gracie was. Is that what it is?

1448
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,330
That's incredible. Wow. That's amazing.
That's nuts, man. You know what?

1449
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,820
My hats go off to her.
Look at what great shape she's in.

1450
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,280
She's in phenomenal shape, right?
I don't care. She's a chicken.

1451
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,950
She's not supposed to look like that.
That's a lot of hard work right there.

1452
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:22,850
That's a serious diet and has a lot of
hard training. Your yeah. Behind you.

1453
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,790
Like that's what she used to look
like. That's, yeah. That's incredible.

1454
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:28,860
I'm looking at that. Yeah, but
it's better. Larger. Come on.

1455
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:33,200
That's hard work right there.
And fertility drugs apparently.

1456
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:38,060
I'd imagine there's some hormone will
help involved in that, I would imagine.

1457
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,950
I'm not saying, Oh guys, look nice.

1458
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:43,930
Remember I told you that about
that story if you got down. Yeah.

1459
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:47,390
If you got down to like what is her
body? Her right there. Holy Shit.

1460
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:51,810
Put that over there. Oh my
gosh. Recently she was coaching.

1461
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:59,210
Morphing Vandelay big. She is
families. Vandalism. The sauce. Rice.

1462
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,190
What is he six feet tall.
Do you think

1463
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:07,490
Jack Bentley's biceps. Holy
Shit. She's bigger up dude. Yeah,

1464
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,980
I got her while we haven't
called this fight all over.

1465
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:16,910
People are gonna hate
Marcio. E. X. A. N. D. R.

1466
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:21,490
E I would imagine. Zhan
dre and uh, Warley. Elvis.

1467
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,140
Elvis, I think it's called.
Yeah, Dude. It's Alexandra here.

1468
01:28:26,141 --> 01:28:31,070
Like a l. E. X. Alexandra.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1469
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:35,060
Is it a oh well,
they don't have it on those site.

1470
01:28:35,061 --> 01:28:39,050
His head is in front of his fucking
letter in his name. How stupid is that?

1471
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:42,380
Oh goodness. Oh God. It's so
far that that's so John Gray,

1472
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:46,430
who's the dumb Alexandra? Who's the
fucking most don't know what it says.

1473
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:49,580
Who's the mommy that does that?
That's so stupid. I never did that.

1474
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:53,170
And a w the UFC site.
That's so dumb. Texts Dana,

1475
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,280
he'll get right to it and
then cover 90 seconds.

1476
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,990
How could you cover a guy name with it?
Right? What did you run out of space?

1477
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:02,040
You file.
This has been taken it to this

1478
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,340
guy and I'm sure the guy
who designs our website,

1479
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:06,900
a very nice guy you don't want
to fear is he just fucked up.

1480
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:11,590
He has been taking it to got the underhook
and half wash. He goes to full guash.

1481
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:17,190
They're saying they're saying chill out.
There's a freaking superstar now.

1482
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:21,510
They love him. Isn't that hilarious? Yeah.
They love him. They love him in Brazil.

1483
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:26,490
After all the shit he talked
about Anderson and all the
shit that the people are

1484
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:30,510
so mad they wanted to fuck him up
from Brazil did. He doesn't know.

1485
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,360
And the scenes that I saw from that,
I've only seen a couple of times.

1486
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,860
He looks like really like
he's not nonconfrontational.

1487
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:40,170
He's that Vander Vandelay get mad so bad.

1488
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,420
She also, and as Jack Armstrong,
all American, they do on the show.

1489
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:48,330
He was the hook and he started a fight
with him. He just looked like an asshole,

1490
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:49,650
a chill set.

1491
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:53,190
Every time he'd walk into
any room Vandelay it'd be
there with a mouth piece and

1492
01:29:53,191 --> 01:29:56,700
trying to fight him and chill.
It's like bro, listen behind
scenes. He's like, dude,

1493
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:59,640
I'm not going to fight you every
time. This is stressful, man.

1494
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:02,910
This is for the show. We're doing this
forest show. We're going to fight.

1495
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:06,720
You don't have to do this every time.
Vandelay [inaudible] was not having it.

1496
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,530
So I was on UFC tonight,
last Wednesday and chill.

1497
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:14,030
We were sitting there and you just got
the text that he's fighting a chill

1498
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,290
vittores sorry.
Fighting that

1499
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,650
tail said it exactly how everyone
was thinking. He goes, well one guy,

1500
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:26,430
you're kind of like, I can beat him.
They knew when changes. You're like,

1501
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:31,320
ah shit. Yeah. Cause I mean beat doorman.
You're talking to a different game now.

1502
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:36,840
South Pole. No, I mean like
tricky ass, ridiculous striking.

1503
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,800
I said anyways,
let's be as honest as possible.

1504
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:44,790
Hard as fuck to take desk to be
honest as possible here post TRT.

1505
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:49,780
How is that possible?
How is it guy go from what Vito was doing?

1506
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,610
UFC, the way he looked,
how dominant he was.

1507
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:58,611
Three fights in a row knocks how Bisbing
knocks out Luke Rockhold with a wheel

1508
01:30:59,341 --> 01:31:02,600
kick to the head, knocks out
Henderson in the first round saying,

1509
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:06,510
looks like a destroyer
on TRT the entire time.

1510
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,980
What do you chalk that up to us
at his age? Question, but, well,

1511
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,010
here's the big question.

1512
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,970
How do you get off of that stuff and then
get your testosterone to a level where

1513
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:19,930
you can fight? Well, when you have a, uh,

1514
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:25,010
TRT exemption [inaudible] I think
maybe they can be on TRT 24,

1515
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:29,070
seven and they don't have to worry
about shit that got the exemption.

1516
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:31,980
But now that they're being
stricter, no, you don't understand.

1517
01:31:31,981 --> 01:31:36,000
There's no exemptions. No,
there was a lot. There's,
they're done. There's no, no,

1518
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:38,760
I know, I know. No, no, no. I know.
I know. No, no, no. They're done.

1519
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,960
Now that they're done,

1520
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:43,590
does it make the guys go back to the
old school way and just say, okay,

1521
01:31:43,591 --> 01:31:46,370
we've got a cycle and it's
going to be all black? Yeah,

1522
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,530
it's cause we already know about the
stricter rules and steroids and then get

1523
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:54,300
Vanair lays on him. He just got hot blue.
We don't know. No, he didn't get popped.

1524
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:57,990
He just refused to take his
test. We don't know. He,

1525
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,130
they came to office or Dick

1526
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,710
came to his gym and they
said, you know, they,

1527
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,110
they need a random drug test from him.
And he was like,

1528
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:07,880
you don't have any identification.
Who are you? I don't,

1529
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,760
I need to get my lawyer to look at this.

1530
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,840
And he said that he always submits his
drug results and submits his blood tests

1531
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:16,300
at the proper time. If you've got
to give the guys fair day in court,

1532
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,550
I know what you're saying for that.
Now you can, that's not a good exam.

1533
01:32:19,551 --> 01:32:24,080
Weirdo could show up and pretend that
he's some fucking UFC representative or a

1534
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:28,470
Nevada state athletic
commission representative with
no id or no, uh, you know,

1535
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:33,340
no credential example.
But, uh, nonetheless, uh,

1536
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:36,130
does that,
do MMA fighters?

1537
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:41,131
Do UFC fighters get tested more
often than football players do that?

1538
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,500
Yes,
we can test it without questioning.

1539
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:48,040
Let's get tested usually once a year
unless you fail it and then you get put

1540
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:52,840
into a program or you're randomly tested
throughout the season a few months

1541
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,390
before. I can help you out
with this. It's real simple.

1542
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:58,450
Combat Sport athletes in general get
tested more than any other sport.

1543
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:01,870
UFC fighters get tested more
than any other combat athletes.

1544
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,530
It was just until recently that
they started testing drugs,

1545
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,760
a drug testing boxers and it was a lot
of it is Floyd Mayweather sand a lot of

1546
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:12,480
shit about guys like um,
pack Yao.

1547
01:33:12,481 --> 01:33:16,510
So he submitted to these
random, you know, uh,

1548
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:19,930
Olympic style drug tests, random. They
show up at your house at any time.

1549
01:33:19,931 --> 01:33:21,140
They take blood tests from him.

1550
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:24,460
He submitted to those and he sorta
changing boxing because of that.

1551
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,410
And he kept saying while he's
doing it with cleaning it up,

1552
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:30,610
boxing still a lot of guys who were like
kind of perturbed about Manny Pacquiao.

1553
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:33,550
That was the big rumors at patio.
Yeah, he's destroying everybody.

1554
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,390
But look what happened.
I keep,

1555
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:38,710
the guy's gone through eight God damn
weight classes and everybody's saying that

1556
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:40,930
he's on steroids.
I don't know if he's on steroids,

1557
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:44,410
but I know that Floyd Mayweather believed
he's on steroids and a lot of other

1558
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:45,580
people believed he's on steroids.

1559
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,670
So they just started testing
people on like super regular basis.

1560
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,700
Can they test you shit like this,
but I'm sorry.

1561
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:55,390
Shit like this where they did with what?
They caught a Alistair Overeem,

1562
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,900
random drug tests where they
wanted to do this to, to uh,

1563
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:00,340
Vandelay random drug tests.

1564
01:34:00,341 --> 01:34:04,690
They did it to veto random drug test and
Vito was on testosterone and that was

1565
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:06,850
the reason why testosterone
got banned in the first place.

1566
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:11,140
The whole thing went down when they
tested pause, when Vito tested positive,

1567
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:13,330
the Vata State Athletic Commission.
After that.

1568
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,070
Before that they were considering him for
a testosterone exemption and there was

1569
01:34:18,071 --> 01:34:21,310
a lot of talk whether or not he would
be up for a testosterone exemption.

1570
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:24,520
But because when they tested him,
he tested positive.

1571
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:29,340
They scrapped the whole testosterone
program with v toward stuff. Man,

1572
01:34:29,341 --> 01:34:32,380
cause you talk to him. I'm gone.
This tour. He was hurting dudes, man.

1573
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,070
Oh Yang's eyes. Can you, can you
test for human growth hormone?

1574
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,190
Yes you can.
Yes you can.

1575
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:43,630
But I don't think they're doing that
only through blood and it has to be like

1576
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:46,810
you'd have to inject in,
they have to test like right away.

1577
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:49,390
Elvis tagged him with a right
and then got off the ground.

1578
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:53,730
He's got an arm and gay teens. That's
it. It's over. It's done. He's going up.

1579
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:57,790
He's out. Al called Eddie. What
do you think about this? Um,

1580
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,950
about a lot of guys don't
even go up high on the neck.

1581
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:02,240
Like he didn't go high on the neck there.

1582
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:03,950
He just pulled back like a regular gates.
Him.

1583
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:09,110
It's okay if you've got a deep grip. No,
no, no. Deep grip is one kind of gear.

1584
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:12,530
Teen Shallow Grip. That's another kind
of getting, that's more of a net crank,

1585
01:35:12,531 --> 01:35:15,520
shallow grave. But what he did right there
where he leaned back, I see that again.

1586
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,550
Well, he leaned back. They'll show it in
the, in the replay. We just straight back,

1587
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:24,370
right? Yeah. He leans
back there. Slept money.

1588
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,900
Statistically when you got an arm in,

1589
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:31,370
usually the right technique is to go up
high on the neck and put weight on the

1590
01:35:31,371 --> 01:35:34,020
neck and crushing and crushed the victim.

1591
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:39,590
It's more of an angle angle
and bend them doing leg curls.

1592
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:42,170
Smash.
He just pulled back like a regular duty.

1593
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,910
But obviously he puts you to sleep. Let's
see here. Let's see. It was crazy. Yeah,

1594
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:50,330
so Alvez tagging right hand.
Oh,

1595
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:54,590
welcome to Queer Street on
population. You all right. So here,

1596
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:58,460
look how he's doing this. He's got
it. And look, that's a good regular,

1597
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,920
he's doing like bending.
He's betting the, yeah,

1598
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,040
it's just a regular arm and
getting done, right? Yeah,

1599
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,370
a little bit of that side of himself.
He's doing leg curls. He's not pulling,

1600
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:12,490
he's actually bending down and don't
watch like was right and then bending that

1601
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:17,330
thing and
it's a perfect good.

1602
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:23,090
What he's doing with an angle is what
you would do if you were head on by going

1603
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:23,924
up high in the neck.

1604
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:27,680
So it all depends on what his grip was
doing to some people like to go ball and

1605
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:31,550
socket some like the Pretzel Grip and all.
Depends what he's doing underneath.

1606
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:32,181
Yeah.

1607
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:35,690
Isn't that interesting how some guys just
have that fucking guilty and like when

1608
01:36:35,691 --> 01:36:36,860
you saw um,

1609
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:41,480
Joseph Benevidez get that mounted
guillotine on Tim Elliot has like,

1610
01:36:41,481 --> 01:36:45,320
there's some dudes if they just get that
arm in there and it doesn't matter what

1611
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:47,390
happens next or one way or another,

1612
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:50,630
they're going to find a way to finish
that bitch off that looks like Dunkin.

1613
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,950
I dug it out of the fucking mountains.
That is Dunkin. When Harley talk,

1614
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:57,140
if you could have a Harley,
if he lives in North Carolina,

1615
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:00,770
if he went back to Asheville,
where he's from, dude,

1616
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,800
you ever been the most more beautiful
place in Asheville, North Carolina?

1617
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:05,330
You ever been there?
No Dude,

1618
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,830
we did a Raleigh and then we did raw,
were always beautiful.

1619
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:13,430
But after we did Raleigh, but we're take
a drive into the mountains to Asheville.

1620
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:16,790
It's like a utopian community in the
middle of the North Carolina mountains.

1621
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:18,320
It's still crazy shit of all time.

1622
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:20,930
I have a friend who lives up there and
he's telling me how amazing it was,

1623
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:24,650
but I couldn't, I couldn't believe it
until I got there. Beautiful place.

1624
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:29,000
Super Intelligent people.
It's a college town walking the streets,

1625
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:33,590
people just friendly restaurants,
bars, low population,

1626
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:36,260
Asheville,
North Carolina from north girl population.

1627
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,880
This is how crazy the town is.
There's,

1628
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:41,870
there's so many trippers in that
town that the farmers started putting

1629
01:37:41,871 --> 01:37:45,350
antifungal properties and the cows
food to make sure that they didn't grow

1630
01:37:45,351 --> 01:37:49,310
mushrooms on them because it's all rainy
up there and like silicide mushrooms

1631
01:37:49,311 --> 01:37:51,830
naturally grow on cow patties out there.

1632
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:56,400
So these kids are all tweaked
on mushrooms like all the time.

1633
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,230
So much so Caroline.

1634
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:02,640
So much so that farmers started spending
their own fucking money to make sure

1635
01:38:02,641 --> 01:38:06,240
that they didn't have psychedelic
mushrooms growing on their cow. Shit.

1636
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:06,990
You know how many,

1637
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:11,760
how many times that I call the paramedics
to get these kids passed out in their

1638
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:16,120
borrowings house like passed out.
I climb,

1639
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,473
I climb,

1640
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:23,460
I climb big whiskey mountain on mushrooms
in Wyoming. I was hugging a rock.

1641
01:38:23,461 --> 01:38:25,740
I had a long conversation with a rock.
My buddy turns around and look at me,

1642
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,560
we're hot. It is the true story.
He turns around and look and he,

1643
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:32,070
I have no clothes on, just my sneakers
and he goes, where are your clothes? I go,

1644
01:38:32,071 --> 01:38:34,470
I don't know. We couldn't find
my clothes. I came back down.

1645
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,240
I had asked Patty about this.

1646
01:38:36,241 --> 01:38:38,790
I had a blue mouth for many
blueberries and I was completely naked.

1647
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:43,410
We never found my Elvis is a
bad motherfucker. Man attacked.

1648
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:48,060
Yeah, he's, he's super bummed
out. Kids got some traps on them.

1649
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,750
It's so different for
you, isn't it? You know,

1650
01:38:49,751 --> 01:38:52,660
and the difference between a guy like
these random dudes talk shit on the

1651
01:38:52,661 --> 01:38:53,580
Internet,
you know,

1652
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:58,120
and the impact that has on a guy like you
who puts his whole fucking life on the

1653
01:38:58,121 --> 01:39:00,280
line.
What does that feel like when you,

1654
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:03,040
like when you lose a fight and
then you go on Twitter and see it?

1655
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:07,450
Just a bunch of people fucking with
you, man. It's not too bad anymore.

1656
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:09,880
And I think from doing the
podcast stuff like that,

1657
01:39:09,881 --> 01:39:13,270
people get a sense of my personality and
these things. I was just like this Dick,

1658
01:39:13,271 --> 01:39:15,600
like cocky Dick, you know? But,

1659
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:18,580
but doing podcasts and doing more
interviews and getting out there,

1660
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:22,540
I get to show a little bit of personality.
But marijuana when I lost to, uh,

1661
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:24,260
I think,
uh,

1662
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:28,930
Rothwell one time when I've lost a
Rothwell my Twitter was so negative,

1663
01:39:28,931 --> 01:39:31,750
it was insane. And then before I
was gonna Fight Lavard Johnson,

1664
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,360
huge fight in my career. Right.
You lose that one. You know,

1665
01:39:34,450 --> 01:39:39,360
who knows what happened to tour
playing grab ass can $500. So, um,

1666
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:41,950
you know,
before that one I stayed off social media.

1667
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,610
I'd make a post by went reading anything
they post, don't read anything good.

1668
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:49,840
And then, uh, even even
before the [inaudible],

1669
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:52,480
it started to get a little bad.
The week of the fight.

1670
01:39:52,481 --> 01:39:53,830
I don't look at social media at all.

1671
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,660
I make a post and I don't look at it
at smart, but, but now man out there,

1672
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:02,110
there is, but I gotta be honest now
it's like I got a lot of support.

1673
01:40:02,111 --> 01:40:04,210
It's really cool man. Well,
when you do a podcast,

1674
01:40:04,211 --> 01:40:07,360
people get to know who the fuck you
really are. It's so easy to write you off.

1675
01:40:07,361 --> 01:40:11,680
You're confident. Big
looking at a big hog. Yeah.

1676
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:12,850
See you

1677
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:16,940
big old dude. That guy. I want him to
suck. I wanted it to be an asshole.

1678
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,680
There's a lot of dudes that
I read on the underground.

1679
01:40:18,681 --> 01:40:19,790
I don't know if you go on the underground,

1680
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:24,410
but a lot of dudes love you now because
of your podcast and because of the

1681
01:40:24,411 --> 01:40:28,220
podcast you guys did with us.

1682
01:40:28,221 --> 01:40:31,040

were like, you guys have great chemistry.

1683
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:34,720
It's all right. It's funny. Brandon is
Brent. Brendan had you laughing harder?

1684
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,890
I've ever seen your laugh.

1685
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:41,010
I wish he could tell
all the stories I wish.

1686
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:44,270
I wish I could tell him. I'll tell
you what, ladies and gentlemen,

French. His Dad couldn't look
more native American by the way.

1695
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:21,310
Couldn't look more native American. A lot
of Italians that are basically monkeys.

1696
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:23,560
Yeah, that's what it is. Shop guys.

01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:44,830
four years at University of Colorado and
then a short stint with buffalo bills.

1702
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,160
They keep showing this one
right hand over and over again.

1703
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,980
But that was very loud. Yeah. Tony
Gonzalez. Since you didn't miss that.

1704
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:57,760
Tony gets off of in this big, Aaron
Hernandez. Are you working on the book?

1705

Look more like bring up our Aaron
Hernandez and take a look at [inaudible].

1706

I know Pete. Hola. Hannah's.
Oh, okay. That's a white dot.

1707
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:11,230
I was in, uh, I was in Ralph's
and these guys behind me, I like,

1708
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,000

fucker right now. No, he posted bail son.

it's Aaron fucking her name.

1711
01:42:21,311 --> 01:42:22,420
Dez. I'm like, Bro,

1712
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:27,190
it's not him so much like him to bring
him up and then when I jumped in my

1713
01:42:27,191 --> 01:42:28,660
Prius, Nah, that ain't him.

1714
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:35,770
My first black belt. Denny percopo six
exact little bit. Brandon, by the way,

1715
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:41,200
look, look at this. Wait, hold on. Hey,
that's a good looking murderer though.

1716
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:44,770
Let's be honest, Danny. I find Danny,
he looks more like a big Denny.

1717
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,640
He has a Greek look like
you could be a Greek statue,

1718
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,540
but there are other pictures where
he looks a lot more like Aaron. No,

1719
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:54,710
he doesn't look like Eric. I'm sorry.
Sorry. I, you know what I get? Oh No, no,

1720
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,160
he does. Eddie. That's just a bad image.

1721
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:02,530
Just go images on Denny.
Come on.

1722
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:08,350
Come on dude. I rolled with him in
San Francisco, uh, like a month ago.

1723
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:14,040
I told him to stay away from big guys.
You know he was dope man.

1724
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:18,680
Now he was dope. No, you so
much fun to roll. Yeah, no,
he's awesome. All right. I,

1725
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:22,120
we'll go back to Aaron Hernandez and he
does the 10th planet in San Francisco

1726
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:25,580
Right before he runs. Yeah, he came
down to empowers with that. Tarek,

1727
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:29,820
let's get some pictures of
a, Oh, hey, there he is.

1728
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:34,970
[inaudible] you guys could
definitely be related.

1729
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:44,190
How crazy this dude is in the NFL
and shot allegedly three people.

1730
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:49,240
Three people is 24. He's
24. He shot two people.

1731
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:52,010
James Gang related shit.
What?

1732
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,460
He's in the pros and he's an,
again,

1733
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:58,260
the best tight ends on the
Patriots on the one that SBC bats.

1734
01:43:58,261 --> 01:44:01,490
He signed a 42 wait a minute.
$42 million deal.

1735
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:05,720
Did he grow up in La Right now?
Connecticut,

1736
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:09,970
Connecticut. There's a Mexican gangs and
Connecticut reportedly having Oh nuts.

1737
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:14,660
Not Mexicans. Puerto Rican having a
tough time paying his defense team.

1738
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,980
They don't give a fuck. That's
sucking you dry cow. They don't care.

1739
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:21,560
They don't give a fuck.
How much money does he have?

1740
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:25,020
You know I heard he has a big old
hug by the way. A big old hog.

1741
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:28,280
Dang.
What are you thinking though?

1742
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:32,600
Don't you wish you could talk to like
your 24 millions in the bank? I mean,

1743
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:36,380
pride was going to be one of the best
times ever in the NFL. If freak man,

1744
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:39,860
freak out. Look at this. Look at this.
Ridiculous. It got busted selling weed.

1745
01:44:39,861 --> 01:44:43,040
He was running back for the
Cleveland browns. Look at that.

1746
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:46,490
A portion of his 12 point $5 million
bonus was supposed to be guaranteed to

1747
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:51,200
Hernandez when he signed a contract
extension in 2012 is in dispute son,

1748
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:54,810
and it's one point $3 million home is
a subject of a restraining order there.

1749
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:59,330
Present prevents him from selling it or
using it for anything other than paying

1750
01:44:59,331 --> 01:45:04,331
a future judgment in a civil lawsuit
filed by the family of one of the men that

1751
01:45:04,491 --> 01:45:07,430
he's accused of killing. This dude is
accused of killing three fucking peep.

1752
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,150
POW bullets. Just how did it go
down? Is that a cloud or no, no.

1753
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:16,940
The one he just got indicted on is he
pulled up there saying he pulled up in a

1754
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:19,670
SUV, just shot up the
SUV, killed two dudes.

1755
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:22,430
And this is before he
shot this other dude.

1756
01:45:22,431 --> 01:45:26,030
They only found out that he did it after
he got busted for killing this other

1757
01:45:26,031 --> 01:45:27,680
dude. And they're saying
he killed the other dude.

1758
01:45:27,681 --> 01:45:31,490
Cause that dude knew stuff
about another murder he did.

1759
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:34,820
And so then all these other witnesses
that you got, well you kill one person.

1760
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:38,000
He's like, well, you know
something that's a to more people.

1761
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:41,810
You're a murderer. Good
football player, handsome dude.

1762
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:46,390
[inaudible]

1763
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:50,120
are handsome dude and he's only
24 that's what's crazy. You know,

1764
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:54,140
when you take a dude who's a big super
athlete and he's living in some sort of a

1765
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:58,310
bad situation and he's just fucking,
just a huge,

1766
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,070
just aggressive savage dude and that's
why he's so God damn good at football.

1767
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:07,130
And then you expect them to keep his
shit together because he got an NFL

1768
01:46:07,131 --> 01:46:07,630
contract.

1769
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:10,940
There's $25 million know you're from the
hood and you bring all your entourage

1770
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:14,590
with you that's going to
work out gray. Oh Geez. No,

1771
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:18,110
we're here on the phone, the
bottom now, the whole team.

1772
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:25,070
And they just, they also want to prove
that they're still a jet. You know,

1773
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,440
they're always trying to prove
like they're still tough. Like, Oh,

1774
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:31,820
I'm not out the hood. There's still hood.
Maybe he wanted out trying to get out,

1775
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:34,810
but he had done so much shit that
there was still some unknowns,

1776
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:39,740
but he probably didn't want to do it.
You know what? I'm blowing up now.

1777
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:40,850
I got to fucking kill this dude.

1778
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:45,851
He's going to fucking ruin all guys
got killed him to save his career.

1779
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,160
That's what you say. I believe him. I

1780
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,620
don't know why, but I
do, but I don't know why,

1781
01:46:52,621 --> 01:46:56,220
but I do believe I've got a
feeling Aaron got soft dog,

1782
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:01,650
soft change Sun people tell
me that you've changed.

1783
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:06,690
Oh Shit, I've changed. Yeah.
Yeah. Hell yeah. I've changed
it. Oh, since 10th grade.

1784
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:10,530
Oh really? Yeah. I've changed. I'm
rich as shit and I fight in UFC.

1785
01:47:10,531 --> 01:47:14,390
I've changed 100% and I'm like,
Shit, I'm not doing all right. I like

1786
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:18,690
that old brand here that DOL can outside.

1787
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:21,310
Do you have seen

1788
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:28,410
some shit possible sponsors? You don't
understand how much the heavyweight makes?

1789
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,710
You know what I want? Apollo was
complaining about that recently,

1790
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,220
although he was complaining
about [inaudible] pay.

1791
01:47:35,221 --> 01:47:38,250
The difference in pay between
the heavyweights and the
lighter well have people,

1792
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:41,430
I mean heavyweights run when you
get like 55 will show what's up.

1793
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:48,780
This is not my new contracts.
Will is the last,

1794
01:47:48,781 --> 01:47:50,370
the oldest one I was
on the ultimate fighter

1795
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:55,380
Mirko Cro cop for 10 and 10 like this.
Okay,

1796
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:57,630
so you didn't make that much money before,
but now you're many.

1797
01:47:57,631 --> 01:47:59,910
We got here by spots,
got here and he's helicopter.

1798
01:47:59,911 --> 01:48:03,420
That's all he metafarm they got here on a,
on a wings of a peg.

1799
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:09,540
Horseback can't as his actual numbers.
So on the podcast I refuse,

1800
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:13,500
I refuse to allow it because you're asking
him a question that he might not want

1801
01:48:13,501 --> 01:48:16,920
to answer and you saying it live
and if you do that, like, you know,

1802
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:18,600
you're not giving them a chance
to say like, I don't like,

1803
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:21,870
I don't like to talk about that shit.
How much does UFC pay you? Exactly.

1804
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:24,450
That's what I'm saying.
Damn your quick as fuck.

1805
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:29,010
That was a serious question. Look at
Gilbert Melendez doing a little, uh,

1806
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:34,650
Gilbert's doing good. Awesome. I
love that comment. Tim Kenny's.

1807
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:38,050
Here's all jacked up.
Give him a Gnocchi before he got on there.

1808
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:40,390
He did a great job on my fight.
He's in the 1950.

1809
01:48:40,391 --> 01:48:43,230
[inaudible] grapple can eat by the way,
is a close here.

1810
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:46,940
Do a great job at minimum wage. Gay.
Where's Karen? Where's the boy club?

1811
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:52,050
And Glover did good too.
Although he did fuck up a few told hold.

1812
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:54,150
He could use a couple of,
what do you mean? Well,

1813
01:48:54,151 --> 01:48:58,500
I just mean like you could use it like
pause, like pause, hold, talk too much.

1814
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:02,790
No, no. He can eat. He
needs a couple more reps.

1815
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,810
It dude commentate. It's
tough. It's super tough.

1816
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:08,430
Everyone thinks they can compensate
because they could talk shit while they

1817
01:49:08,431 --> 01:49:09,330
watched the UFC.

1818
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,210
You know when they're drunk and they're
comfortable when the camera's in front

1819
01:49:12,211 --> 01:49:17,190
of you. Sanely tough. Can you be
yourself when the pressure's on? Shit,

1820
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:18,030
anybody can catch up.

1821
01:49:18,110 --> 01:49:21,540
God Damn football high school
wide receivers have great hands.

1822
01:49:21,541 --> 01:49:25,530
But the difference between a high school
football player and a pro football flat

1823
01:49:25,531 --> 01:49:28,690
player, can you hold on to that bar when
there's pressure? That's the difference.

1824
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:30,730
Do it under pressure.
What?

1825
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:34,170
The other thing I can't might've heard
them a little bit is he's an ex Kenny

1826
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:38,200
Florian who does it for? Yes,
Kenny was cool and there was a,

1827
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:40,470
there was a couple things
that Jeff had wrong.

1828
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:42,810
He thought it was setting him up
for a triangle the whole time,

1829
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,480
like in the beginning and never
thinking about a triangle.

1830
01:49:45,481 --> 01:49:46,620
So he kind of fucked up there.

1831
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:50,830
But overall I thought Jeff did a great
job for his first show every doing color.

1832
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,120
Damn. You gotta just didn't get to
bring in your game. Totally. Yeah,

1833
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:57,730
and he was on his own moves. He was
honest. When I wrote for the vaporizer,

1834
01:49:57,731 --> 01:49:58,564
he says,

1835
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:02,950
I like to consider myself an expert in
Jujitsu and I'm confused right now. Kenny.

1836
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:06,540
He said that he goes, what
is going on here? It's crazy.

1837
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:11,170
People were doing tutorials
of the vaporizer the next
day, the next week wrong.

1838
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,670
They had no idea what they were doing.

1839
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:17,340
They thought you were talking about
and then the move at the very end,

1840
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:19,870
I don't know. I'm not, I'm not qualified,

1841
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:22,520
but I have to say you were doing
stuff and Joe is screaming cause he,

1842
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,150
he saw you were getting positioned but
I have no idea that you had position

1843
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:27,280
before you did it. And it was, Joe
knew what I was doing the whole time.

1844
01:50:27,281 --> 01:50:30,770
I knew I was going bananas.
As soon as Eddie Bravo gets a lock down,

1845
01:50:30,771 --> 01:50:34,960
everybody got crazy crazy when you went
from quarter guard locked. That is crazy.

1846
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:37,790
And I got crazy when the Hoya got
the under hook, people wouldn't,

1847
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:41,890
all the Gracies called Ya cause for six
minutes he was fighting for the underdog.

1848
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:46,200
He finally gets it and they fucking
make noise for the under hook. Yeah. But

1849
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:50,320
he didn't have, he
didn't have, by the way,

1850
01:50:50,321 --> 01:50:53,230
for the record and from my vantage point,
he never even was in the,

1851
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:58,080
in the game with you. But I'll do over
due respect of course toilet. But, but um,

1852
01:50:58,330 --> 01:50:59,163
did you get,

1853
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:03,220
did you get acknowledged for that from
the Gracie camper or how did that work?

1854
01:51:03,450 --> 01:51:04,283
You didn't pay attention?

1855
01:51:04,770 --> 01:51:07,540
I'll, I'll answer it because it's
difficult for him to answer. Yeah.

1856
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:08,690
It was embarrassing.

1857
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:13,930
There was there their portrayal of the
actual events where it was embarrassing.

1858
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:18,200
It's like a cover up government cover up,
embarrassed for them for all of them.

1859
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:22,580
That and not one of them did an accurate
assessment of it post fight until they

1860
01:51:22,581 --> 01:51:24,290
experience criticism.
Okay.

1861
01:51:24,330 --> 01:51:28,400
When the experience criticism then people
started giving him credit for being

1862
01:51:28,401 --> 01:51:30,620
loyal for, no, no, no, no, no.

1863
01:51:30,621 --> 01:51:35,240
They were being ridiculous and biased
and it was sad as a someone who's a huge

1864
01:51:35,241 --> 01:51:39,170
fan of the Gracies and a
huge fan of Jujitsu and um,

1865
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:44,420
in massively in debt, my own personal
life for what their family's accomplished,

1866
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:48,800
I'm in debt to all the Gracies
Elio, Gracie without a doubt, his,

1867
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:50,540
his accomplishments and his,

1868
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:54,140
his art changed my life because
it changed Eddie's life.

1869
01:51:54,141 --> 01:51:56,780
Eddie's life changed my life.
John Jacques Machado,

1870
01:51:56,781 --> 01:51:59,090
his life who changed Eddie's life.
I mean,

1871
01:51:59,091 --> 01:52:03,440
all of us are directly chained back
to Elios work that said, their,

1872
01:52:03,441 --> 01:52:05,870
their depiction of that
fight was an embarrassment.

1873
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,620
It was an embarrassment to the greatest
martial arts family of all time.

1874
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:12,830
Like they weren't accurate in
their assessment of what happened.

1875
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:15,920
What happened was horrible or didn't
know what to do with at his game.

1876
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,020
He got wrapped up,
he got,

1877
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:22,010
he got swept on multiple occasions and
he got threatened twice and he got his

1878
01:52:22,011 --> 01:52:25,280
knee fucked up.
His knee popped in a crazy position.

1879
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,950
Most people on the planet
would attempt to that.

1880
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:32,480
Most people boiler decided not to tap
to it and they also agreed to ridiculous

1881
01:52:32,481 --> 01:52:33,200
rules or they never,

1882
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:36,200
they never addressed the fact that the
only reason why he's able to survive was

1883
01:52:36,201 --> 01:52:37,970
he was allowed to grab Eddie's clothes,

1884
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:40,040
but Eddie wasn't allowed to
grab his clothes. It was,

1885
01:52:40,041 --> 01:52:43,520
there were the most ridiculous rules.
Those rules were an embarrassment.

1886
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:48,440
I was embarrassed by those
because you tried to change it.

1887
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:50,210
They threatened you. They
were like, no, no, no.

1888
01:52:50,211 --> 01:52:53,600
You have to wear the pants if you don't
wear the pants were pulling out. He the,

1889
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:57,470
the deal was Eddie wears the pants
and he can grab addies pants,

1890
01:52:57,471 --> 01:53:00,470
but Eddie crank grab his shorts.
It's ridiculous.

1891
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:03,560
That doesn't make any sense that
someone who's fighting scared.

1892
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:06,710
So Eddie agreed to that.
Anyway, goes in there,

1893
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:10,290
still dominates a fight in the one
thing that's saved toilers I mean,

1894
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:15,050
coilers leg was in a terrible position,
but it wasn't in the worst position.

1895
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:17,690
The worst position is one step later.
And if Eddie,

1896
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:21,080
if that guy wasn't able to grab Eddie's
clothes and he wasn't able to hold on

1897
01:53:21,081 --> 01:53:23,780
for dear life on Eddie's
the collar of his pants,

1898
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:27,650
Eddie would have switched and if he
switched to putting his foot on his other

1899
01:53:27,651 --> 01:53:32,030
foot, if you went to that, that
the dark position. After that,

1900
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:35,090
there's the vaporizer and then there's
that one step where you take the

1901
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:39,530
vaporizer. Did def con 10 it's ugly.
You're leg is getting ripped apart,

1902
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:44,240
your legs getting ripped apart. He's,
and I saw three I was like, that need is,

1903
01:53:44,241 --> 01:53:47,510
that doesn't look natural,
but that's only seven out of 10 bro.

1904
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:51,620
That's seven out of 10 that the next
three steps are the ugliest shit you've

1905
01:53:51,621 --> 01:53:56,230
ever seen in your life and you see guys
scream in agony. God, that's horrible guy.

1906
01:53:56,231 --> 01:53:58,910
I hate that.
But they didn't address any of that.

1907
01:53:58,911 --> 01:54:00,470
When they put it on their Instagram,

1908
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:05,471
their Instagram was all about how great
heuler looked and all about heuler

1909
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:09,380
getting through to submission
attempts and smiling like,

1910
01:54:09,381 --> 01:54:12,980
what are you talking about? How about it?
At the end of that Gracie, the end of it,

1911
01:54:12,981 --> 01:54:16,560
Gracie in all caps and exclamation
points. Preposterous. Right?

1912
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:21,610
So I was embarrassed by it because I
think that we all have an obligation to be

1913
01:54:22,371 --> 01:54:25,730
as honest and as open as possible.
When we're assessing our friends,

1914
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:29,570
our loved ones, our brothers and sisters
performances, there's a, and there's,

1915
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:32,750
there's this weird thing that people do
when they start getting biased and they

1916
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:34,970
start disregarding the
accomplishments of others.

1917
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,280
If the fight was completely reversed,

1918
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:42,530
I would absolutely say men boiler
Gracie dominated. Eddie Bravo was crazy.

1919
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:46,130
He just, he just knew how to sweep
them. He got them into bad positions.

1920
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:49,520
He fucked up Eddie's leg. Me. Very brave
of Eddie that he didn't tap. But man,

1921
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:51,710
I was super impressed with Euler.
Hey,

1922
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:52,910
I don't know if they're
going to do it again.

1923
01:54:52,911 --> 01:54:56,270
Maybe Eddie would like to reconsider.
Knowing that Oilers game is so tricky.

1924
01:54:56,390 --> 01:55:01,100
If they were totally opposite, but there
weren't opposite. So when I look at it,

1925
01:55:01,101 --> 01:55:05,870
I have to look at it. Yeah, I'm on
my biased. Absolutely. You know,

1926
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:09,860
I, I look, I love the Gracies but Eddie's
one of my best friends on the planet.

1927
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:13,610
You know, you're, you're probably top
two human beings that I love more.

1928
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:16,180
I love you buddy.
But a fairly decent,

1929
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:20,500
my two friends that need to
put in a disclaimer, like
I just gotta tell you now,

1930
01:55:20,501 --> 01:55:23,900
it's all, these are my two best friends
of all times, so I'm, I'm sure I'm biased,

1931
01:55:23,901 --> 01:55:27,050
but even being biased
objectively looking at it,

1932
01:55:27,051 --> 01:55:30,050
I get sad because I think that
what they did was an embarrassment.

1933
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:34,330
That's what I think I want
to know is where the fuck
are the pickles, bro. I know.

1934
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:36,620
I think we ate them all.
We've got to call up Grillo's pickle.

1935
01:55:36,621 --> 01:55:38,780
I personally love the,
I love how you started that.

1936
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,000
I think it was great for
one hand goes on the mat,

1937
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,310
you slap the mat and the other
hand goes up and you start waving.

1938
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:49,470
That was a wrestling and I
never wrestle and I thought,

1939
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:53,130
I thought for sure he's going to
think I'm going to pull guard,

1940
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:57,480
but let me give a wrestling look for a
second to freak them out and then I'll,

1941
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:01,180
I didn't even know you were doing it
was so great. Bam out there. It's hard.

1942
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:03,570
It's hard when people get
emotionally attached to results.

1943
01:56:03,571 --> 01:56:05,850
It's hard when people get
emotionally attached to fight,

1944
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:10,420
you know you've made a great case. You
just need does that, this guy every fight.

1945
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:16,320
Of course. It's a great,
a great assessment.

1946
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:18,360
Well that's what it is.
You know what I mean? Even

1947
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:24,150
you know and that that head who I love,
you know his,

1948
01:56:24,151 --> 01:56:28,670
his take on it was that you didn't pass
the boiler Elio challenge or the Elio

1949
01:56:28,671 --> 01:56:33,270
test filter that your, your, your style
would be ineffective in a street fight,

1950
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:34,780
which is,
it's,

1951
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:39,090
it's unfortunately ignorant because if
they knew that if punches were involved,

1952
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:40,230
your style works better,

1953
01:56:40,530 --> 01:56:43,800
your style's more effective when the is
trying to punch because if a guy on top

1954
01:56:43,801 --> 01:56:46,680
was trying to punch, he's given up
under hooks. He's given up over hooks,

1955
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:48,750
giving up a lot of shit when you
start throwing your arms around.

1956
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:49,780
And the only reason I'm in court,

1957
01:56:49,781 --> 01:56:53,130
a guard is because there's not
punching exactly that was punching.

1958
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:54,810
I would get in deeper
right away because that,

1959
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:59,900
since you could use your hands on top
100% for to keep me away and rape,

1960
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,310
choke me and do all this
stuff that people do,

1961
01:57:02,311 --> 01:57:06,780
but it's because you're not punching.
Have you ever fought MMA?

1962
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:07,740
Never.

1963
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:11,520
What'd you ever met will not tell them
when you're telling a story about how

1964
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:12,840
they were trying to set you up.

1965
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:15,290
Tell that story because that's
a crazy story I've told.

1966
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,440
I've told that story before.

1967
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,270
You don't even have to say
the name of the organization.

1968
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:20,280
You don't have to say the
name of the organization.

1969
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,620
I'll say I'll set it up so you don't have
to know the name of the fighter or the

1970
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:26,420
organization.
Uh,

1971
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:30,510
a prominent Japanese organization that
may or may not still be in business came

1972
01:57:30,511 --> 01:57:31,344
up

1973
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:37,250
general in Los Angeles and they
wanted to talk to him about having a,

1974
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:41,240
a, an MMA. There's no, there's no, uh,
there's no blind in there. Is there some,

1975
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:42,300
you guys liked that wine though?

1976
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:47,330
They wanted to talk to him about
having a UFC fight and they told us no,

1977
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:52,190
no, no, it wasn't MMA grappling
match. They go, no, no, no,
no, no, no. But there was the,

1978
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,870
oh, that's the [inaudible]
was a grappling match.

1979
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:58,080
That's the only reason I sat down and
talked to them because I wasn't trying to

1980
01:57:58,081 --> 01:58:02,540
do MMA, but they go, oh, we
want to get you to find a, uh,

1981
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:07,260
a super fight, grappling match. We're
going to mix it in to our MMA show.

1982
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:12,680
And I met them at the Beverly
Wilshire radice hotel and La.

1983
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:18,450
I met him there and the in the lobby and
a representative of this organization.

1984
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,200
And I said, okay, I'll do it, you know,
and they go, well, how about if we, uh,

1985
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:26,790
we made it a MMA fighter. So
I said, well, I don't do it.

1986
01:58:26,791 --> 01:58:29,880
Then they know it will,
but we'll make it so that you win.

1987
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:34,200
And then the guy who brought me there,
I looked over at the guy who brought me,

1988
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:36,600
looked it all up.
I looked at him and I said,

1989
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:41,620
what the fuck is going on here? What do
you mean? What? What do you say that?

1990
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:42,070
What can

1991
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,460
you possibly say that?
What did we make it so they can?

1992
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:47,050
There's a lot of setting on you there
that sounds like they're setting up.

1993
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,150
They're setting you up to go there.

1994
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:52,440
You're going to win and then you get in
there and they got beats the fuck out of

1995
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:57,100
here. I would've never, I would've
never done your dishonorable anyway.

1996
01:58:57,101 --> 01:58:59,260
Why should they do that for you?
This is Jap.

1997
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:01,840
Japanese culture is very
different than American culture.

1998
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:06,160
If they set you up and you go over there,
you ain't suing. You're not saying, hey,

1999
01:59:06,161 --> 01:59:10,060
we had an agreement to a fixed fight
going to be in Japan. This was the Yakuza.

2000
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:14,260
I'm excited for this fight. Yeah,
heavyweights. Tough finale. Heavyweights.

2001
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:19,440
Vito or Miranda and a Antonio.
Carlos junior is his nickname.

2002
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:22,070
Antonio only house. Oh,
Antonio only has four or five.

2003
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,570
Very similar to me with only four
fights on the ultimate fighter finale.

2004
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,560
Interesting. Next, Luther
is his nickname. That's us.

2005
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:33,580
That's what happened in [inaudible] name
is Brandon shop. Cut them some slack.

2006
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:37,510
I forget man. It's hard to keep up.
I lost the finale to Roy Nelson,

2007
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:41,440
but I only had four fights of Roy
Head, whatever, 25 former world champ.

2008
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:44,080
But the thing that helped me,
and I've never told you this show,

2009
01:59:44,081 --> 01:59:46,960
the thing that helped me, um,
I was in a dark place after.

2010
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:48,610
I've never lost any right.
A fight.

2011
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:53,550
I lost that fight and I watched the replay
back and uh, during my walked out, uh,

2012
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:56,440
Joe on the broadcast goes,
listen,

2013
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:00,820
Brendan has a very tall order.
Roy Nelson is a hell of a fighter.

2014
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:03,070
He could jump in division
right now and beat anyone.

2015
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:06,280
Brendan will has four fights no
matter what happens in this fight.

2016
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:08,950
Brendan is going to go on and have
a great career. And honestly, man,

2017
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:11,430
that helped me out so much. That's
awesome dude. I'm so glad that help.

2018
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:15,190
That was totally true.
You know there's a thing about those,

2019
02:00:15,191 --> 02:00:16,330
those ultimate fighters,

2020
02:00:16,331 --> 02:00:19,030
situations like that where you
get a guy who's gotten mad,

2021
02:00:19,031 --> 02:00:23,760
mad fucking fights behind
him and Roy Roy was fuck,

2022
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:26,740
he was real good and wasn't known for.
It was weird.

2023
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:30,190
The show made him known for
being a knockout puncher. Yeah,

2024
02:00:30,191 --> 02:00:32,680
but before that he fought.
He fought Andre or loss you.

2025
02:00:32,730 --> 02:00:35,070
He came in the house got robbed.
You fight.

2026
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:37,300
That was when they were doing
that bullshit. That elite Xc,

2027
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:39,850
they would stand you up. You'd be
like in the ground for 15 minutes.

2028
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,280
He was inside control working
on a Kamora locked the, Yup.

2029
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:49,270
Double wrist lock. However, either
way you paint it Orlowski Tko Odom.

2030
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:51,640
He did the only guy to ever do it.

2031
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:56,430
But I think that he was like
more uncomfortable about
taking shots back down to

2032
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:59,770
different writing. But it's
interesting when you think about that,

2033
02:00:59,771 --> 02:01:03,970
the fact that he got [inaudible] and since
then he's been invulnerable to shots.

2034
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:07,480
I agree. But look at Verdugo for
doom. Hit Him with everything.

2035
02:01:07,481 --> 02:01:10,030
But the goddamn kitchen sink.
Not really a heavy hitter though,

2036
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:13,090
is he need the fucking shit out
of his face. It's true. You know,

2037
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:16,720
and he's taking bombs from you
name. It took bombs from Cro. Cop.

2038
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:19,150
He took bombs from everybody and Chubb.
Julie,

2039
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:23,890
how about for landed some career don't
Santos Sto Santos. I tell you what.

2040
02:01:23,891 --> 02:01:26,430
They just announced Roy. Mark Hunt. Yeah.

2041
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:28,540
Back to back to the
ultimate fighter finale.

2042
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:32,490
There's a lot of fights like most most uh,

2043
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:34,060
commissions went st you in that fight,
right?

2044
02:01:34,061 --> 02:01:38,920
Guy With four and the guy was third right
here. Going back a way. Good. Exactly.

2045
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:41,850
But because it's the show, I didn't
know it hasn't been part of a cautions.

2046
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:45,680
Took those things into account.
I really dare you do fight ever.

2047
02:01:45,681 --> 02:01:50,150
If you don't know that I'm
learning, man. I, this is my,

2048
02:01:50,151 --> 02:01:52,100
this is my education. Oh, don't do it.

2049
02:01:54,060 --> 02:01:57,290
Nice mix in boxing.

2050
02:01:57,291 --> 02:02:01,310
If a guy has an extensive
amateur background, if a
guy's like world champion,

2051
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:03,460
amateur boxer and you know,
he's fighting in Cuban,

2052
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,880
then all sudden needs in America.
And they,

2053
02:02:04,881 --> 02:02:07,430
one of the challenge for the title of
his third fight, that's not unheard.

2054
02:02:07,431 --> 02:02:10,160
That Cuban program is amazing.
Well brushing as well.

2055
02:02:10,161 --> 02:02:13,730
There's a Russian guy recently challenged
for a title and you'd only been boxing

2056
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
professionally for very
short period of time. Well,

2057
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:19,220
I went from fighting Billy
McGee and Denver. You know,

2058
02:02:19,221 --> 02:02:20,810
where he was scared and you know,

2059
02:02:20,811 --> 02:02:24,590
I could tell I was beating the more
ready at the weigh ins to fight and Roy

2060
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:25,880
Nelson in Las Vegas. I was like, what?

2061
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:30,880
The vine fire baptism by fire did you
just got to deceptives knew about him when

2062
02:02:32,271 --> 02:02:33,104
you went in there?
I mean,

2063
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:36,100
I thought 100% I was getting knocked
him out in the first round. I was very,

2064
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:40,860
I was very naive. Roy has got deceptive
time. I wouldn't change it for anything.

2065
02:02:40,861 --> 02:02:43,190
No Man. What? He dropped
that bomb on Nogueira.

2066
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:47,410
That was one of the saddest knockouts
of all time stiff. Dude. That was scary.

2067
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,870
Sick,
sick fight,

2068
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:54,440
but ruin Roy knocked out Nogueira it
was a career ender. It was like, whoa.

2069
02:02:54,441 --> 02:02:58,370
That was a sign that the fucking wheels
have come off the wagon. This is over.

2070
02:02:58,850 --> 02:03:01,370
That was reassured that she had
thought he killed. Just measure it,

2071
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:05,030
wrote it and money killed. When he hit
Congo. I was like, oh no. Oh my God,

2072
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:08,480
you killed Congo. You know what's crazy?
He didn't even start. You Killed Kenny.

2073
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:09,590
Oh my God.
You Killed Congo.

2074
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:15,410
He didn't even start striking until
2009 yeah. Roids a special special.

2075
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:18,410
That's crazy animal. You
know he hit me. He didn't.

2076
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:21,360
People think hit me in the jawline. Oh,
show up. You got a weak ass John Grant.

2077
02:03:21,361 --> 02:03:25,010
These 265 pounds, shit happens. We in the
face. It's weird. Your brain shuts off.

2078
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:28,180
However, he hit me behind the
air directly behind the outage,

2079
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,560
right behind the air.
He threw a double jab.

2080
02:03:30,561 --> 02:03:34,150
I slipped the first one and my head was
out of position. Right hand, right plan.

2081
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:38,510
The year before that though, I was putting
on a clinic fight me now what's up,

2082
02:03:38,511 --> 02:03:43,180
son? Don't have four fights
anymore. What's up? You want
it to archive? You know,

2083
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:46,490
I don't care. I don't that I'd
rather fight, uh, other people.

2084
02:03:46,491 --> 02:03:49,940
But if it were to happen, yeah, it'd be a
totally different story. You know, Eddie,

2085
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:51,600
what we were saying about,
um,

2086
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:55,160
how the Gracies were saying what
you did didn't pass the Elio filter.

2087
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:58,850
What was fucked up about that was what
we were talking about earlier about when

2088
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,410
here on fought Andre Galvao and he had
that match with Andre Galvao and just,

2089
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:07,370
he was showing his defense. He let him
pass his guard and let them mount him.

2090
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:10,610
He led them out.
You gotta yell or respect that.

2091
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:13,720
That's some gangster shit out.

2092
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:19,470
Look that criticism though. The
criticism. I'll be honest, the OPS team,

2093
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:21,650
right? Henna and heat on
her, like my brother's band,

2094
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:24,350
but I haven't seen any of this stuff.
I watched the match.

2095
02:04:24,351 --> 02:04:27,930
I don't see any of that stuff.
They've done nothing. I know that.

2096
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:31,640
I know they like you. I have [inaudible]
me about you. I don't matter.

2097
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:35,330
You know what? I don't see any of it.
So I that's why people that go shops,

2098
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:38,070
we didn't quite cause he's teamed
Gracie. No, I'm not on it. I

2099
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,950
don't know. I haven't seen any of that.
I watched metamorris. I was like, damn,

2100
02:04:40,951 --> 02:04:42,060
that was dope for Jujitsu.

2101
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:45,780
It was the most talked about Jujitsu
match since Brenden's shop Cyborg, not

2102
02:04:46,970 --> 02:04:51,970
[inaudible].

2103
02:04:55,940 --> 02:04:56,020
It was

2104
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:59,710
very talked about. And you know, I'm
just not that I'm anti Metamorris,

2105
02:04:59,711 --> 02:05:02,830
I'm a hundred percent pro. I'll
promote that show to the day it stops.

2106
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,990
He's just fucking Christ.
I love that.

2107
02:05:07,991 --> 02:05:10,150
He can't go five minutes
without talking freaks out.

2108
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:13,210
I love that they're doing it.
I love that they're doing it.

2109
02:05:13,211 --> 02:05:15,040
But I think you gotta be,

2110
02:05:15,310 --> 02:05:20,310
you gotta be really careful with your
assessments of a situation if the UFC did

2111
02:05:20,771 --> 02:05:22,180
that,
save the UFC,

2112
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:27,300
talked about Tj Dillashaw and Hanan Barao
and painted it all about Hanan Barao

2113
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:31,240
being tough and amazing how he got through
that fight and it was incredible. Oh,

2114
02:05:31,241 --> 02:05:32,560
you're saying after the fact they did,

2115
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:36,250
it was a little bit of that before a
fight. Well, that was before the fight.

2116
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:40,090
No one thought that was going to happen
the way. I mean, I guess maybe Tj did,

2117
02:05:40,091 --> 02:05:43,120
but I didn't think,
I don't know Tj,

2118
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:45,340
but thought it was gonna
be a really tough fight.

2119
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:48,250
I thought Tj has chances to win
because he's got great endurance.

2120
02:05:48,251 --> 02:05:49,270
If you could take it into third,

2121
02:05:49,271 --> 02:05:53,230
fourth and fifth round and
push a tremendous matchups
when you get in the top 10

2122
02:05:53,231 --> 02:05:56,800
it's about matching. Number nine can be
a horror metric, number one. But anyway,

2123
02:05:56,801 --> 02:05:59,770
if the UFC painted it in an
incredibly inaccurate way,

2124
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:04,270
so imagine after the fact [inaudible]
professional or unprofessional.

2125
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,380
That's what it felt.
If they,

2126
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,700
if they talked about the Tj Dillashaw
Hanan Barao fi and obviously that is a

2127
02:06:09,701 --> 02:06:14,230
more dominant example because Tj just
lit hand and brow on fires, even a fight.

2128
02:06:14,231 --> 02:06:17,260
It was reduced. It was amazing. It
was the best performance of ever seen.

2129
02:06:17,261 --> 02:06:22,000
It's I agree and biggest upset because
everyone's like Matt Serra GSP cause this

2130
02:06:22,001 --> 02:06:25,630
was five rounds of a straight
ass whooping clinic son.

2131
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:29,830
There was nothing wound clinic and then
stops him in the fifth with a fucking

2132
02:06:29,831 --> 02:06:33,460
head kick. I mean the shit was off the
charts. Ass Kid was off the charts.

2133
02:06:33,610 --> 02:06:36,260
But what Eddie did,
toiler was Hoyle.

2134
02:06:36,261 --> 02:06:39,640
Lou was never once in a dominant position,

2135
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:43,090
never once in a position where he was
threatening Eddie and Eddie without a

2136
02:06:43,091 --> 02:06:47,620
doubt, fucked his leg up. So for them
to paint this inaccurate picture of it,

2137
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:49,960
and then in their credit corrected it.

2138
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:53,650
Once they experience criticism and
actually took the original post down from

2139
02:06:53,651 --> 02:06:55,750
Instagram,
they deleted it from Instagram,

2140
02:06:55,751 --> 02:06:59,020
which is essentially admitting that
you fucked up. Right, right. I mean,

2141
02:06:59,021 --> 02:06:59,920
that's what it is.
It did.

2142
02:06:59,921 --> 02:07:04,630
Heuler did you talk to another after
the fight at the post fight? Uh,

2143
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:08,440
conference, right? We have a cool look.
It's there. Cool. Right afterwards.

2144
02:07:08,441 --> 02:07:11,710
They were cool before it. Sure. Here's
the deal, man. This is the Internet.

2145
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:15,040
This is a different world. You can't
get by just on your name anymore.

2146
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,860
You gotta be cool across the board.
You don't get any free passes.

2147
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:21,240
You didn't win the lottery.
Everything is what it is. And every,

2148
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:23,290
and if you pretend it's not what it is,

2149
02:07:23,291 --> 02:07:26,100
and everybody can see that they
think you're a con. That's just,

2150
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:29,110
that's just how it goes today. It's
a different world. And you know,

2151
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:33,250
I appreciate what [inaudible] Lt. Wow.
His beautiful mountain. This fucking dude,

2152
02:07:33,251 --> 02:07:37,240
this kid is in a ps four. No two. I'll
tell you right now, both of these guys,

2153
02:07:37,241 --> 02:07:40,120
well they're both can have a career in
the UFC. Whoever wins or loses obviously.

2154
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:42,220
However,
neither Wilms find that heavyweight,

2155
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,970
I think one way to at two 14 one way
to get to 12 or something like that.

2156
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:50,400
Two 30 and two 18 Miranda on the
bottoms to 30. And that's apparent.

2157
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:53,270
That's on his bio in the UFC. That
might not be accurate. You might, uh,

2158
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:56,800
he might be preparing for two oh five
after this. Eddie, is there a guy,

2159
02:07:56,890 --> 02:08:00,120
a Jujitsu guy just to guy that you
would really like to fight, that you're,

2160
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:03,370
that that is a huge challenge to you
that we can kind of get that fucking card

2161
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:07,930
pass sick. Ooh, he was trying to get
back. He was trying to get back to,

2162
02:08:07,931 --> 02:08:08,470
um,

2163
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:11,680
he was trying to hip escape and the dude
pass his garden got into side control

2164
02:08:11,681 --> 02:08:16,600
like a wizard. But look at
this. Yeah, man. Antonio,

2165
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:20,980
Carlos junior is a bad motherfucker.
No, you know what I think, um,

2166
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:28,620
I mean I think that match
was super important. I was
thinking of shooting poor.

2167
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:29,670
Important for you.

2168
02:08:29,850 --> 02:08:33,420
I think it was super important for
Jujitsu and I think that it showed that

2169
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:37,680
Jujitsu matches can be super fucking
exciting and I think it opens up the door

2170
02:08:37,681 --> 02:08:41,370
to a possible future in having
some sort of a professional,

2171
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:46,800
oh, but Ooh, that's attacking
the, he's attacking.

2172
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:49,880
Would you change anything?

2173
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:53,130
Would you change the rules of metamorris
though as in is something they can do

2174
02:08:53,131 --> 02:08:55,100
to make it, I dunno. Well,

2175
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:58,500
submission only submission only for sure.

2176
02:08:58,501 --> 02:09:03,170
But since Metamorris isn't a
tournament matches, they should,

2177
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:05,130
they should.
They should.

2178
02:09:05,131 --> 02:09:10,131
It should be more a winner take all or
serious difference between show money and

2179
02:09:10,531 --> 02:09:15,360
submission money. Like it should
be, uh, 1000 bucks to show for you.

2180
02:09:15,361 --> 02:09:19,980
No, right. Or 7,000. If you
sell it, it's gotta be right.

2181
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:23,460
Go for this. And you have to, you
have to, it's gotta be like that.

2182
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:25,620
If you're going to have
single matches the money,

2183
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:29,460
we'll create the urgency that
creates the cause, a entertained.

2184
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:35,240
Otherwise you get, otherwise you get this
weird kind of stalemate. 20 minutes, man,

2185
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:39,030
you've got to make it worth it.
That's what we're trying to do in my,

2186
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:42,070
my tournament is all about fixing the,

2187
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:45,630
the boringness of Jujitsu.
That's what I'm trying to do.

2188
02:09:45,631 --> 02:09:47,640
I'm not trying to make money
putting together this tournament.

2189
02:09:47,641 --> 02:09:50,010
Money is not a goal at all.
I'm not,

2190
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:52,860
I'm losing money on my first tournament.

2191
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:57,260
We're just trying to put
together Jujitsu for TV. Can we?

2192
02:09:57,330 --> 02:10:00,900
It should be on TV already,
but it's not on teams triangle.

2193
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,570
Oh, so close. Beautiful Pass. He's he,

2194
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:11,280
he's San Antonio kid is nasty man. I
like, he hesitated on that cinch, man.

2195
02:10:11,281 --> 02:10:13,530
He had that triangle
there for fucking obese

2196
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:16,790
too, man. Look, but look at
Antonio's back to his half guard.

2197
02:10:16,791 --> 02:10:20,630
Sneaking up the back door on them. Is
there a guy you'd like to do this crazy.

2198
02:10:20,631 --> 02:10:23,510
They're stopping him from throwing
those elbows. That is so ridiculous.

2199
02:10:23,511 --> 02:10:26,180
They stopped the thigh. Why?
Because they're illegal.

2200
02:10:26,181 --> 02:10:29,810
The 12 to six elbows and
legal on your thought. Why?

2201
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,950
It's so stupid because it's a rule that
was at 12 to six elbows are illegal

2202
02:10:33,951 --> 02:10:34,400
anywhere.

2203
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,730
It was created when they were worried
about people killing people and way back

2204
02:10:37,731 --> 02:10:41,730
in the day in the back of the head,
no, no, no, no. He's hitting the five.

2205
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:43,790
No it was from I,

2206
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:46,770
I've explained it a million times and
you've never paid attention once cause you

2207
02:10:46,771 --> 02:10:50,540
not a real MMA fan.
So I'll do it one last time on,

2208
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:51,740
there are other people that aren't big.

2209
02:10:51,741 --> 02:10:56,120
John McCarthy was first talking to the
athletic commissions trying to get the

2210
02:10:56,121 --> 02:11:00,950
UFC legal. They wouldn't let the downward
elbow in because they saw those karate

2211
02:11:00,951 --> 02:11:02,570
demonstrations at two
o'clock in the morning.

2212
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:06,620
We're dudes would break bricks with,
they're not bullshit. So stupid.

2213
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,660
It's amazing the dumbest shit ever.

2214
02:11:08,661 --> 02:11:12,900
And it proves that you're not a real MMA
fan cause you don't know that. So now,

2215
02:11:12,901 --> 02:11:14,140
now that we've established that,

2216
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:19,140
don't ever say a guy can hit a guy
with a right hand. Again man, the club,

2217
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:22,920
I want to be in a club. And who do you
want? Who is there? A guy out there,

2218
02:11:22,921 --> 02:11:25,250
a Jujitsu guy that you
would love to fight,

2219
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:27,290
who you think would be
a huge challenge to you,

2220
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:31,940
whoever would generate the biggest
pay day. Wait, hold on. Okay,

2221
02:11:31,941 --> 02:11:33,710
so let me give it, let me tell
you, I don't hate anybody.

2222
02:11:33,711 --> 02:11:37,730
I'm not trying to challenge hold.
Let me throw like Floyd Mayweather,

2223
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:43,070
throw a name out. I'm not going
to call it. Listen, listen.

2224
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:47,410
Just to preparing for that
match was very stressful, okay?

2225
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:52,310
It took me away from my family all day.
I'm thinking about training. It just,

2226
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:55,010
it just put my life on hold is stressful.

2227
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:58,920
I had to do it and I did it a hundred
percent trained like a fucking Olympian

2228
02:11:58,921 --> 02:12:02,150
you proved yourself after.
After that match.

2229
02:12:02,210 --> 02:12:06,290
I don't want to put any names out there.
I'm not going to challenge anybody.

2230
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:09,260
I'm going to rest for a
while and when I come back,

2231
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:11,540
the only names I'm going to bring up,

2232
02:12:11,570 --> 02:12:14,690
I'm not going to bring up any names now
on names that are going to generate the

2233
02:12:14,691 --> 02:12:17,420
most money. At the end of this
page. You have nothing to prove.

2234
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:22,940
Nothing to prove you did it. Yeah.
When it gets Marcella Garcia,

2235
02:12:22,941 --> 02:12:26,150
he would fucking smash.
Don't move the official.

2236
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:30,530
He's a really good friend of mine.
Garcia is fucking amazing.

2237
02:12:31,790 --> 02:12:35,540
He bet his head as he was taking
them down as he was taking Marcel.

2238
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:38,540
Like I said it that he said he already
had them submit it. On a side note,

2239
02:12:38,541 --> 02:12:40,510
this fight is dope. Brian, would you

2240
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:45,340
ship your upper for two
seconds about digit time?

2241
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:48,980
I find a hard time believing you really
want to know the answer to that question.

2242
02:12:49,050 --> 02:12:50,150
I think you just wanted to talk.

2243
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:57,140
This is to win the ultimate
fighter heavyweight,

2244
02:12:57,141 --> 02:13:01,540
Brazil Skype chat and not talk over
people. Man, you're really bad at it.

2245
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:04,490
I am not talking over this.
It was just talking to San Antonio.

2246
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:07,670
Carlos junior is a beast. Man.
I'm super impressed by this kid.

2247
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:13,000
Are you talking about this fight we're
talking about Eddie Bravo. Bravo.

2248
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:16,910
What about Metamorris? Yeah. You
guys now tune into the fights.

2249
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:20,120
You and Joe finally tuning into
the fights and scolding me.

2250
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:25,190
One thing I want to make clear before we
end. Henzel Gracie, I love you to death.

2251
02:13:25,610 --> 02:13:29,450
The Gracies are a giant family.
There's so many awesome Gracie's in there.

2252
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:32,910
There's only a couple that you know I'm
not particularly interested in hanging

2253
02:13:32,911 --> 02:13:35,250
out with, but there's a lot
of graces that are awesome.

2254
02:13:35,251 --> 02:13:39,010
Clark Gracie Hoes Gracie's, one of them
arose grace, I'm sorry, hose Rosemary's.

2255
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:43,140
He's one of the coolest chicks on the
planet. So Henner heroes. There's people,

2256
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:45,510
there's people in my family
that I don't want to talk to.

2257
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:48,960
You know what I'm saying?
So the Gracies are giant.

2258
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:51,310
So Hansa is one of my
favorite people of all time.

2259
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:56,170
Be Real clear. I love here
on, I love Henner. I love
luck. I love all those dudes.

2260
02:13:56,380 --> 02:13:58,150
I do.
I think they're awesome.

2261
02:13:58,180 --> 02:14:01,480
I just think the way that the situation
was handled, Ooh good. I'm done.

2262
02:14:01,481 --> 02:14:04,150
Way Better. And if they were
having a debate with someone,

2263
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:06,850
if they had to have a debate with a,
say a guy like Jeff Glover,

2264
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:10,680
an impartial observer, I
guarantee you there, Jeff Glover,

2265
02:14:10,681 --> 02:14:13,810
his point of view and their point of view,
it would be vastly different.

2266
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:16,700
I just don't think that they handled
it well either way. Good for Jujitsu.

2267
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:18,210
We're talking [inaudible] happen

2268
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:23,130
that way. Mother of Jujitsu.

2269
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:25,630
Joe Him the money.
Hi Brian.

2270
02:14:28,470 --> 02:14:32,610
I'm going to shut down my life
again and train and do swim sprints,

2271
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:37,380
which are jumping. That freezer
swims friends, you know,

2272
02:14:37,381 --> 02:14:40,980
it's like sprinting and a pool out.
You're just swimming as fast as you can.

2273
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:45,090
Just die, dude. Fucking you
said water swim sprints.

2274
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:48,330
That's crazy. Hey, sorry. I'm
not a suppression on last week.

2275
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:51,330
That's where I figured it was.

2276
02:14:51,331 --> 02:14:56,331
But a week from now on podcast
talking about how he does swim sprint,

2277
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:02,880
you know I will. No, I
will do stuff. I go, I go.

2278
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:06,840
Especially if we have as a chicken,
I need my, I need my sprint.

2279
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:09,060
I gotta get my spreadsheet.
He has a chest off the chicken to be like,

2280
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:12,240
I find it's swim sprints.
I helped me the most,

2281
02:15:12,241 --> 02:15:15,000
you know when I was training for
the worlds, I guess whatever.

2282
02:15:15,370 --> 02:15:16,380
I never wanted to fight.

2283
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:21,480
Gets busy with other stuff or bought a
film project clock stop really close with

2284
02:15:21,481 --> 02:15:23,310
Marky mark.
It was a time

2285
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:30,390
I liked that. When Martin how to
vote strength and conditioning.

2286
02:15:30,391 --> 02:15:32,400
I was just naturally supple.
Believe me,

2287
02:15:32,401 --> 02:15:36,490
I like good friends with Leonardo
Dicaprio. You had a Frank Young. Okay.

2288
02:15:36,491 --> 02:15:37,281
That's right.
It wasn't,

2289
02:15:37,281 --> 02:15:40,590
you know I played pickup basketball
with him once he was wearing a burette.

2290
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:43,900
Did he dunk on you put it in your face?
No,

2291
02:15:44,110 --> 02:15:48,270
I was more athletic than he is.
Tie your hair up.

2292
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,910
You very specific. If you're a dude
and you have like one of those,

2293
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:54,560
remember when Hickson Gracie had that?
I think going with that. That's fine.

2294
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:58,890
That's fine. Brian's, you have like
rubber bands but which you can't have.

2295
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:01,830
You can't have a Beretta can have
a Brett. Nope. CanNot allow it.

2296
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,160
And he had chuck Ladell can if you want
it to. If you're leaning on Keppra,

2297
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:11,260
you can do whatever you want. Probably.
No you can't. It's 100% super nice guy.

2298
02:16:11,310 --> 02:16:13,880
Enough money that he really doesn't
give a fuck. And like the girl,

2299
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:17,790
he drives a Prius girls that wouldn't
fuck him because he was wearing a burette.

2300
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:20,490
You don't want those girls,
you know? That's right.

2301
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:25,020
He was swearing a burette
to keep chicks away.

2302
02:16:25,021 --> 02:16:27,750
He's like I told you when Carlos got
the back here, this is the, by the way,

2303
02:16:27,751 --> 02:16:30,310
this good is a monster,
least fight heavy

2304
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:35,180
fight companion podcast of all
time. Yeah. Apologize to every,

2305
02:16:35,210 --> 02:16:40,210
for everybody. For these guys. I apologize
for Brian for nutshell nub about, sorry,

2306
02:16:40,211 --> 02:16:42,790
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Jujitsu
freak bro. So he's a freak bro.

2307
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:44,410
He's going to train eventually.

2308
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:48,220
I lived one of these days if he could
just get a place to move closer to his

2309
02:16:48,221 --> 02:16:48,551
house.

2310
02:16:48,551 --> 02:16:52,760
So he has an open invitation to train
with Eddie Bravo or where Henna and here

2311
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:57,520
on Gracie has never been to it for so
long. Launch a on drive too far away.

2312
02:16:57,730 --> 02:17:01,360
Too Far. What's the best as far as
the biggest coolest Jujitsu Gym?

2313
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:05,920
Is it Gracie in um, torrents
be? It's amazing. Right? Salt.

2314
02:17:05,921 --> 02:17:07,420
So many students for me to train with.

2315
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:10,150
Is that the biggest place you've ever
been to? Because I've seen it online.

2316
02:17:10,151 --> 02:17:13,790
They have like extra rooms and shit.
Bunch of private rooms and big old mat.

2317
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:14,980
The Mat space,

2318
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:18,790
it's like a custom made Jamey right where
they have like a tarp over like some

2319
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:22,570
maps that are underneath the does that
Matt get does that. Matt gets slippery.

2320
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:23,321
It does.

2321
02:17:23,321 --> 02:17:26,350
When you get sweaty it's very slippery
cause it's not like as good as like a

2322
02:17:26,380 --> 02:17:30,370
Tommy. Those flat ones, those
are the best. Right? Yeah.

2323
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:34,030
They have the wanes. I brought up
the header one time. He told me,

2324
02:17:34,031 --> 02:17:37,290
I forget the reason I ask when
it's slippery, your bowel,

2325
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:39,790
you need more balance actually lets you,
when you're winning you're sweaty.

2326
02:17:39,791 --> 02:17:42,790
It's super slippery. Yeah. You've got
to get used to that. So is it better?

2327
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:46,990
It's better to be on a slippery
surface surface for a three technique.

2328
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:52,320
I don't know. Probably that make sense
to you. Right on ice. That's a bad pass.

2329
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:57,980
Imagine if you could pass on ice. No, it
totally makes sense. The one thing though,

2330
02:17:58,030 --> 02:18:00,640
sucks up fat bag of Dicks for cause.

2331
02:18:00,641 --> 02:18:03,400
If you're doing any kind of
striking train wrestling, oh yeah.

2332
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:05,980
Either one of those.
You're going to hurt your ACL.

2333
02:18:08,270 --> 02:18:08,710
He can't.

2334
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:12,370
You can't get your foot in the good
position if you don't have traction.

2335
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:15,910
You can't choose where your feet go when
you're scrambling. They just give out.

2336
02:18:15,911 --> 02:18:18,880
Tear out their needs because of traction.
Bolles especially, you're right.

2337
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:23,800
Damn football with artificial hearts,
astro turf. What are we doing?

2338
02:18:24,010 --> 02:18:27,520
Who's idea was that? Those
see meant that was green. God,

2339
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:34,300
God. Oh yeah. My high school football
field was astro turf. Way To go,

2340
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:39,860
but it gives you an
unrealistic environment to
kind of Denver, they can. Oh,

2341
02:18:39,861 --> 02:18:44,010
with new technologies. Grass, special
seats were good seasons there.

2342
02:18:44,011 --> 02:18:47,230
It's fricking greenish shit. Everything's
green. Just have to heat the frown.

2343
02:18:47,270 --> 02:18:50,080
The ground's too hard when they
throw astroturf when it's just,

2344
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:54,790
it's just not fucking worth it.
It's just cheaper to,

2345
02:18:54,791 --> 02:18:56,080
you got to think high
schools. They're like, oh,

2346
02:18:56,081 --> 02:18:58,600
we don't have to pay anyone and
take care of you. They do that now.

2347
02:18:58,601 --> 02:19:02,950
Is it still astroturfing different? That's
a combo net and hold now it's like a,

2348
02:19:02,951 --> 02:19:04,060
it's like a fake grass.

2349
02:19:04,061 --> 02:19:07,490
It has the feel of the grass has these
little rubber pellets in it like uh,

2350
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:12,020
a lot of football fields or that
now that's the latest ship graph.

2351
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:16,120
Rubber graphing, rubber grass with these
rubber pellets. I'm going to Google it.

2352
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:20,590
Rip Apart. When you run on it with
cleats, know that like these you'll,

2353
02:19:20,591 --> 02:19:22,120
you'll like when you take off your cleats,

2354
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:25,920
you have these little black balls are
rubber and it, but it's like, it's soft.

2355
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:27,980
Like grass,
Eco Turf.

2356
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,750
Is that what it is? Sure. Why not? Hmm.

2357
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,800
Back to this shit.
It looks fucking really shit man.

2358
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:40,100
There you go. That's crazy. I
have it. I have it in my garage.

2359
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:43,970
That looks real as shit.
That's weird. It's amazing.

2360
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:49,500
It's pretty cool. That's feel
great. It can be plasticky. No,

2361
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:54,780
it's made of lamb skin feels good.
Another lamps feels natural.

2362
02:19:55,590 --> 02:20:00,560
Alaskan company. It's called field
field turf. There you go. Yeah.

2363
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:03,170
That would be the ultimate.
If it was made from lambskin,

2364
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:07,510
then grass would tear off like
natural grass, you know word.

2365
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:12,830
Hmm. Interesting. Yeah.
This is what it's called.

2366
02:20:12,831 --> 02:20:16,760
Field Turf. It's pretty cool.
That's bad ass man. Field Turf. Huh?

2367
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:21,680
His Antonio Carlos Junior. Definitely
one. That kid gets a bright future.

2368
02:20:21,681 --> 02:20:24,770
He's a bad ass. Anyways,
back down the NFL.

2369
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:28,700
How many stadiums and off the top of
your head do you think I have this shit?

2370
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:32,720
I would say is there a hybrid? Like
there's some that's kind of like that,

2371
02:20:32,721 --> 02:20:37,010
but there's real grass grown and they
got like some crazy hydro buckeyes stone,

2372
02:20:37,011 --> 02:20:40,670
like super high tech where they're growing
grass. This shit out. The sunlight,

2373
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:41,810
the real,
that shit man.

2374
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:47,630
It's more predominant in colleges I'd say
in the NFL, not, I mean not even half,

2375
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,160
not even half of them are.

2376
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:54,190
I want to know what the latest is
in the NFL with that shit field turf

2377
02:20:55,070 --> 02:20:57,650
revolution.
I'm getting that stuff from my garden.

2378
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:01,040
Why would you do the Super Lane?
You could actually have ground fucking,

2379
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:02,300
I don't want it.
I want,

2380
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:06,170
I want it to look green and I don't want
to deal with that because we live in

2381
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:10,820
California. Bugs here though. You
guys all in a nature on a regular day,

2382
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:15,040
five or six bucks, whatever. I'm not
using, I'm not using Miranda around.

2383
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:17,990
I've never seen the, you
gotta be honest. Jungle.

2384
02:21:17,991 --> 02:21:21,990
At one point in your life you
had to like in Asia, right?

2385
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:24,680
I was in Indonesia and then in the right,
how did you deal with bugs?

2386
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:26,750
You heard them coming from,
oh,

2387
02:21:27,010 --> 02:21:30,950
well it's as loud as grand
central station. The jungle.

2388
02:21:31,130 --> 02:21:32,930
There are bugs that are so crazy.
First of all,

2389
02:21:32,931 --> 02:21:37,100
you have to worry about the soldier
ants. So you, when you slept the,

2390
02:21:38,310 --> 02:21:42,740
uh, no, you had to worry about soldier
ants that would come in and when they were

2391
02:21:42,741 --> 02:21:46,010
hunting, they did everything in their
path. And it's for whatever reason,

2392
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:48,110
when they climb on you,
they bite you in unison.

2393
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:51,080
They like as a signal or something,
you go into shock and then you get heat.

2394
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:54,720
So what you do is you will get eaten by
ants in the jungle all the time. Yeah.

2395
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:56,900
So what you want to do is when you sleep,

2396
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:58,400
you want to make sure it
was the hunt at night.

2397
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:03,290
You see you have a raised platform, it's
on posts and you have to dip the posts.

2398
02:22:03,291 --> 02:22:07,520
You have to paint the posts in Turpentine
Cause Turpentine, we'll stop them.

2399
02:22:07,521 --> 02:22:08,600
If you don't do that,

2400
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:12,410
they will come up the posts and it will
come into your place and they will kill

2401
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:16,820
you. Now sometimes you can wake
up covering a Nance soldier, ants.

2402
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:21,170
You won't die because they're foraging.
They're not hunting. So you sit there,

2403
02:22:21,171 --> 02:22:24,560
you don't move, don't move. And
they'll coat over you and, and not,

2404
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:28,210
not of you kill one. I don't know.
You fucked up, but you don't move.

2405
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:32,660
Don't move.
They will go over you and pass over you.

2406
02:22:32,661 --> 02:22:34,560
So millions of ants will pass over you.

2407
02:22:35,250 --> 02:22:38,790
But that's why in the rain
forest you use a hammock.

2408
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,390
You put it between two trees,
sleep and you,

2409
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:46,740
the ropes that hold the hammock are
also dipped in Turpentine. So and Oh,

2410
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:47,940
and when you're in the rain forest,

2411
02:22:47,970 --> 02:22:52,380
I had to carry you think you think
off works for this. Mosquitoes off.

2412
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:55,410
Get the fuck Outta here.
They laugh at that shit.

2413
02:22:55,800 --> 02:23:00,240
You carry a sulfur coil,
a sulfur coil that you,

2414
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:03,480
that you burn and it's burning
sulfur in front of you.

2415
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:06,450
That's how you have to hang out in the
rain for us because otherwise bugs will

2416
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:11,730
eat you alive. Lot of
people, man. Elephants people
like go into an elephants.

2417
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,910
Because I was studying, I was
studying orangutans. I thought,

2418
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:18,960
I thought I wanted to be a natural.
I'm 20, I want to be a naturalist,

2419
02:23:18,961 --> 02:23:21,960
I want to live in the jungle. And
I was studying orangutans. So you,

2420
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:25,290
you track orangutans all day.
Uh, do you know what that means?

2421
02:23:25,290 --> 02:23:27,690
Collect their feces and sift through
it and figure out what they're eating.

2422
02:23:27,691 --> 02:23:31,200
So Jane Goodall,
you think she went through a lot of,

2423
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:33,510
cause they never talked
about Jane Goodall. Yeah.

2424
02:23:33,511 --> 02:23:36,090
Jane Goodall was a different thing
cause she'd dealt with chimps.

2425
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:38,790
Now when you deal with chimps versus
orangutans, Orangutans are fine.

2426
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:39,653
They're not going to kill you.

2427
02:23:39,930 --> 02:23:44,400
Chimps are our live in groups or I can't
tell it's a, what about the bugs though?

2428
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:47,730
Had I it that's in that first
butts in the Congo. So yeah,

2429
02:23:47,731 --> 02:23:51,580
you're dealing with major bugs. So they
just never talked about them movies.

2430
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:57,050
They never talk about how she got attacked
by bugs. Uh, I love that transition.

2431
02:23:57,051 --> 02:24:01,140
And if you guys saw that, sorry.
Anyways, no bed bugs. Bugs.

2432
02:24:01,150 --> 02:24:04,980
And the biggest thing in the
rant this Antonio kids bugs.
Yeah. He's a beast, man.

2433
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:08,710
I had an experience and you can wait
in like whatever he decides to do is,

2434
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:12,850
you mean I had an experience,
the worst vacation of my life.

2435
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:15,580
I had friends go do this, go to
Costa Rica. We're going to party.

2436
02:24:15,581 --> 02:24:17,920
I thought costs streak was like
Cancun. Yeah. They'd be like, yeah,

2437
02:24:17,921 --> 02:24:20,890
we're going to party it. Ed
Clay. He goes, dude, it's just,

2438
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:23,830
it's me and like 10 people,
chicks. We've gotta fuck.

2439
02:24:23,831 --> 02:24:27,940
We got this man Shin on in Costa
Rica that we're going to party.

2440
02:24:27,941 --> 02:24:32,680
And I'm like thinking mansion, Cancun
Party beach. So I said, fuck it.

2441
02:24:32,681 --> 02:24:35,260
Let's go. We land in Costa Rica. Um,

2442
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:38,740
I thought we were in the city where
we're going to party in San Pedro or San

2443
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:41,200
Jose or something. They go, oh no,
we're just staying here for the tonight,

2444
02:24:41,290 --> 02:24:45,010
the mansions. We got another take another
plane to get to the mansion. I'm like,

2445
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:48,610
Oh shit. We get into this prop plane.
There's like six of us in there going,

2446
02:24:48,611 --> 02:24:52,780
Holy Shit. Go. We'd be
like, go into Jurassic Park,

2447
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:57,640
land on the outskirts of Costa
Rica in this jungle town.
Wow. And I'm thinking, I,

2448
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:02,110
I hate the jungle. I'm not trying to go
to the jungle. I don't like bugs at all.

2449
02:25:02,111 --> 02:25:04,960
I can't deal with that shit.
That's a phobia of mine.

2450
02:25:05,020 --> 02:25:07,630
I don't want to go scuba diamond.
Right. Joss fucked that up from,

2451
02:25:07,631 --> 02:25:10,000
I don't want to go into a jungle.
I don't want to fuck with bugs.

2452
02:25:10,210 --> 02:25:13,410
I'll go snowboarding all day,
but I can go in and throw a damn jungle,

2453
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:17,910
see a DVD of it. That's
it. So I got tricked. Uh,

2454
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:20,800
they didn't do it on purpose,
but really I fucked up.

2455
02:25:20,801 --> 02:25:22,810
I thought it was like can't coon.
I didn't know where going into a,

2456
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:27,190
we get to the mansion. I'm
fucking freaking out inside.
I don't want to spoil.

2457
02:25:27,191 --> 02:25:30,220
I don't want to seem like a big, seem
like a big pussy. I'm like, fuck,

2458
02:25:30,221 --> 02:25:33,250
I got to hold it inside. It's daytime
and go, Shit. What happens at night?

2459
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:36,850
We're in a jungle. There's a mansion
in a jungle. It's cool, but holy fuck,

2460
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:40,180
we're going to get killed by these bugs.
I walk into my room,

2461
02:25:40,181 --> 02:25:44,140
there's the ceiling doesn't connect to
the sidewalls cause if you don't have

2462
02:25:44,141 --> 02:25:46,330
bugs, don't bother you. You
don't. You just open the shit up.

2463
02:25:46,331 --> 02:25:49,030
You want that breeze coming through
your house. I walk into my room,

2464
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:52,450
there's 50 bees in my room.
I put my bags down,

2465
02:25:52,451 --> 02:25:55,340
I go downstairs and there's a
guy that do to own the houses.

2466
02:25:55,390 --> 02:26:00,220
Uncle stays there all the time ago.
There's bees in my room,

2467
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:03,010
should I? I'm trying to keep
my pussy penis under control.

2468
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:06,370
I don't let anybody see the fear, but I'm
thinking about when the sun goes down,

2469
02:26:06,371 --> 02:26:09,130
what's going to happen? So what's going
to happen? One of the jungle, oh shit,

2470
02:26:09,131 --> 02:26:13,450
it's summertime. Turn on the ceiling
fan, but don't turn it on on blast.

2471
02:26:13,451 --> 02:26:16,930
Just bear it. Put it on low. It'll
make them uncomfortable in the flyaway.

2472
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:21,310
Damn. You don't want to make them
uncomfortable, right? Yeah, I go,

2473
02:26:21,311 --> 02:26:24,550
I got to sleep in that motherfucker.
So I turned on the fan on, on low,

2474
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:28,440
left it there. We all take off
to, uh, to go. Everyone needs,

2475
02:26:28,441 --> 02:26:33,420
you had to have your own ATC, four wheeler
ATV. You got to have your own ones.

2476
02:26:33,421 --> 02:26:35,530
So we were going to, as soon as
you get there, leave your bags.

2477
02:26:35,531 --> 02:26:37,780
We got to get our transport.
Everyone's got to have their own.

2478
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:40,510
We're in the junk because if you
don't have your own fucking ATV,

2479
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:41,920
you're going to be left behind.

2480
02:26:42,190 --> 02:26:46,140
So we get in the van to go to this
to get our ATVs. And I said, are,

2481
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:49,930
are you guys uh, worried about
the bees in your room? Oh my God.

2482
02:26:49,931 --> 02:26:52,660
There was like a playboy playmate
chick. She was there too, so yeah.

2483
02:26:52,690 --> 02:26:55,570
Did you see all the bees? What are we
gonna do about it? I'm mad at Dad. Yeah.

2484
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:59,410
And anyways when the sun, we went
into town, got an atds I bought,

2485
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:03,090
I went to the local store and bought
all their off about all their off.

2486
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:05,950
As we went back to the, we went
back to the mansion. There's a pool,

2487
02:27:05,951 --> 02:27:07,540
it looks like Jay z's mansion,
pool,

2488
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:11,580
Infinity Pool and then you see the coast
of Costa Rica. The Sun was going down.

2489
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:13,060
It was like from dusk till dawn.

2490
02:27:13,330 --> 02:27:17,830
I went in the bathroom or just drenched
my whole body. I used off like Mousse.

2491
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:21,580
I put I drenched my whole body and
we sat by the pool and I'm like,

2492
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:24,760
I'm not going to be attack. And you
know what? The bugs came out first.

2493
02:27:24,761 --> 02:27:27,670
The frogs come out and I'm like,
oh my God, what do all these frogs?

2494
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:30,520
I thought we were being attacked
by frogs and the old man goes,

2495
02:27:30,580 --> 02:27:33,380
the frogs are going to be your best
friend. Watch when the bugs come out.

2496
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:34,600
The frogs,

2497
02:27:34,601 --> 02:27:39,250
you just see just like Braveheart
of frogs and books shot.

2498
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:43,300
You never see the same bug twice.
You never see the same book twice.

2499
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:46,720
I had to go and we had to get an,
we had to go six miles,

2500
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:51,310
six hours upstream to where the,
where the nature preserve was. The,

2501
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:53,060
we get into this rickety boat,
Rick,

2502
02:27:53,061 --> 02:27:58,030
and he like a raft and there are
saltwater crocodiles everywhere. So,

2503
02:27:58,490 --> 02:28:02,320
and there are accidents all the time
when people crashing out of boats because

2504
02:28:02,321 --> 02:28:05,690
they're drunk or they're whatever. And
people, you know, getting and right.

2505
02:28:05,850 --> 02:28:09,880
Two weeks before this, uh, they, they,
they had to shoot this crocodile is huge.

2506
02:28:09,881 --> 02:28:11,290
Salt water crocodile killed a kid.

2507
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:16,620
They shot it with an m 16 like
15 times and then it didn't die.

2508
02:28:16,631 --> 02:28:20,950
So they put electrical cables into the
water and electric heater to death. Right.

2509
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:22,160
There's no more.
So then there's

2510
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:24,350
that. We get there. My
sister the first day,

2511
02:28:24,351 --> 02:28:29,030
puts her foot in her sandal and
goes in her inner clog and goes,

2512
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:32,870
my foot's on fire. My Foot's on
fire poles, her foot. It's a,

2513
02:28:32,871 --> 02:28:37,310
it's a fire and it's one of those ants.
Any other vacation storage,

2514
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:42,290
Dad, it, man, that's
[inaudible] for too long.

2515
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:45,500
You gotta jump in. No, he
finished his story and I was just,

2516
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:49,220
I was and I was halfway through
his piggy back. Nowhere near done,

2517
02:28:49,221 --> 02:28:52,100
but I'm going to end it. Joe, you think
fabulous can win this fight at all?

2518
02:28:52,510 --> 02:28:53,020
Well,

2519
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:57,310
it's a crazy fight when you think that
meal chick is number seven heavyweight in

2520
02:28:57,311 --> 02:28:57,670
the world.

2521
02:28:57,670 --> 02:29:01,210
Fabio Maldonado not even ranked as a
heavyweight light has a light heavyweight,

2522
02:29:01,240 --> 02:29:03,480
not ranked light heavyweight. He's,
yeah, he's a light heavyweight.

2523
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:04,750
Not ranked as the light heavyweight.

2524
02:29:05,140 --> 02:29:09,160
Probably somebody that one 85 no one is
a guy who carries body fat fighting as a

2525
02:29:09,161 --> 02:29:09,994
light heavyweight,

2526
02:29:10,270 --> 02:29:15,270
but no one has also been an incredibly
durable guy and undefeated as a pro

2527
02:29:15,461 --> 02:29:19,720
boxer. Yeah, but it's deep. It's
deep. It was a train partner of mine.

2528
02:29:20,410 --> 02:29:23,770
Homeboy can wrestle, man, I think. I think
we'll see some of his wrestling tonight.

2529
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:26,680
I wonder. He's a smart fighter and
one of us are going to try and do

2530
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:32,830
Fabio Maldonado. He is a, he's a
fucking blood and guts fighter man.

2531
02:29:32,831 --> 02:29:34,630
He is the epitome of a
blood and guts fighter.

2532
02:29:35,290 --> 02:29:38,260
That guy can take a
fucking beating that hair.

2533
02:29:38,350 --> 02:29:40,720
Very few guys can take a
beating like Maldonado, Ken,

2534
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:45,400
and he's got vicious body shots. His
left hook to the body is fucking nasty,

2535
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:47,470
but he's going to be so outsized.

2536
02:29:48,820 --> 02:29:51,260
I mean he's nowhere near the same size.

2537
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:52,990
Like when the two of them
get inside the octagon,

2538
02:29:52,991 --> 02:29:55,630
I think you're going to see a big size
of security for stupid meal check.

2539
02:29:55,660 --> 02:29:58,600
How much? How much more?
How much heavier Steve Bay?

2540
02:29:58,630 --> 02:30:02,620
Well Maldonado waste two oh five when
I weighed in at two 12 tonight I think

2541
02:30:02,621 --> 02:30:05,650
ma'am and then Steve Bay
was around two 30 God, look,

2542
02:30:05,970 --> 02:30:08,860
that's not that bad when you consider
the fact that cane regular fights guys

2543
02:30:08,861 --> 02:30:13,090
that are much heavier than that, but we
gotta you gotta think he looks small,

2544
02:30:13,091 --> 02:30:13,390
right?

2545
02:30:13,390 --> 02:30:18,390
The Nanos a small light heavyweight
and he's not exactly a shredded,

2546
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:22,600
uh, to 12 great boxing. No ma'am.
It was nominal bonds. Really sweet.

2547
02:30:26,140 --> 02:30:27,250
It becomes really interesting.

2548
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:31,930
Are they fighting and heavyweight short
notice because junior dos Santos in

2549
02:30:31,931 --> 02:30:35,320
steep, it was supposed to
be the headliner. Junior
got hurt. Had to pull out.

2550
02:30:35,350 --> 02:30:38,290
They broke his hand. Yeah. You look,

2551
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:41,920
what's interesting about it is because
so much is on the line for Steve Bay,

2552
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:44,890
so it's, it's really a,
it's not real. It's a lose.

2553
02:30:44,891 --> 02:30:48,790
Lose a steeper if you don't destroy
this guy. People are like, Dang man,

2554
02:30:48,791 --> 02:30:49,690
what the hell happened?

2555
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:53,140
Even if he puts up some sort of fight
and he's essentially saving the card.

2556
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:57,250
It's really interesting
to know heavyweights were
prominent enough to take that

2557
02:30:57,251 --> 02:31:01,150
position. You know? Thinking about how
this is a short, I didn't get a call.

2558
02:31:01,151 --> 02:31:04,060
I would have took the fight. What'd you're
talking about? What? It took the fight.

2559
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:08,080
I was in shape. I could've fought Andre
Arlovski three weeks ago. Mom, my,

2560
02:31:08,210 --> 02:31:13,210
my resting heart rate on
Friday was 37 Whoa. Holy Shit.

2561
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:18,040
That's ridiculous. That's crazy. Mine
65 damn man. I got to start training.

2562
02:31:18,070 --> 02:31:20,170
I'm going to do some call spreads yours.

2563
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:25,440
Yours is 112 specs. Brian, back to Brian.
He brought it back. I'm just saying,

2564
02:31:25,441 --> 02:31:28,020
dude, I got to start taking my training
more seriously. It's crazy. Yeah.

2565
02:31:28,021 --> 02:31:28,960
You keep bringing it back to yourself,

2566
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:31,590
but I'm going to videotape it so of
course I'm going to bring it back in the

2567
02:31:31,591 --> 02:31:36,150
conversation. We'll look at this
getting all these sensitive girl.

2568
02:31:36,151 --> 02:31:40,860
You're getting bullied, bullied
online quickly. Seriously.
Guys, online attack. Joe,

2569
02:31:42,530 --> 02:31:44,040
stand up for me and everybody.

2570
02:31:47,370 --> 02:31:49,920
Was it good fucking, I'm
actually, I have a lot of Jon.

2571
02:31:49,921 --> 02:31:53,350
Anik was telling me he was surprised they
didn't call me to step in for this way.

2572
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:55,920
It's interesting. I would've thought,
well, you know, I guess they will.

2573
02:31:55,950 --> 02:31:59,010
You were originally scheduled to fight
hunt. What happened in that fight?

2574
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:02,430
He kept saying he was hurt and then
we're supposed to fight in June.

2575
02:32:02,431 --> 02:32:05,100
They said it wouldn't be ready
to fight in June in New Zealand.

2576
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:07,080
So then I was like, dude, I had a fight.

2577
02:32:07,081 --> 02:32:10,920
I can't wait to go like that if you're
gonna eat, it helps. It sounds so cool.

2578
02:32:10,921 --> 02:32:15,900
How loud? So loud. It sounds cool to
you because your heart sounds so cool.

2579
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:20,700
Then I choose snacks like Mark Hunt.
He kept getting prolonged, prolonged,

2580
02:32:20,701 --> 02:32:22,580
and then I was like, dude,
I have to have a fight. I,

2581
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:24,010
I don't want to sit out that year.

2582
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:27,390
And then they called me the Andrei
Arlovski so I didn't want to wait and now

2583
02:32:27,391 --> 02:32:30,090
he's fighting Roy, which be like,
oh, shop. Are You mad? Hell No.

2584
02:32:30,091 --> 02:32:33,060
That's an epic fight. I can't wait to
see that fight. That's a great fight.

2585
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,870
Believe me, my time will come.
Oh Shit. That was a fucking,

2586
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:41,820
he just threw down a
declaration. Mark Hunt's time
will come. Dodged a bullet son.

2587
02:32:41,850 --> 02:32:46,710
Uncle Dana saved Ya. Whoa.
See that? Everybody pause.

2588
02:32:46,711 --> 02:32:48,420
Just pause. Let that sit. Yeah.

2589
02:32:48,421 --> 02:32:51,480
I think Fabio Maldonado got the
call because he's Brazilian as well,

2590
02:32:52,290 --> 02:32:56,190
but I know I heard he texts Joe Silva
was like, Yo, I want this fight now.

2591
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:57,610
Probably wanting to fight in Brazil.

2592
02:32:57,640 --> 02:33:01,270
Fabio Maldonado is an example of never
looking at a guy with his shirt off and

2593
02:33:01,271 --> 02:33:02,110
think he's a pussy.

2594
02:33:02,111 --> 02:33:05,740
Just by the way he looks like they
fade or kind of everyone knows that.

2595
02:33:06,430 --> 02:33:10,900
Well thanks. Thanks for taking
any other brain under guys.

2596
02:33:10,901 --> 02:33:12,860
I guess it's shit.
I'm Brian [inaudible].

2597
02:33:13,010 --> 02:33:17,740
Brian [inaudible] guys apparently
shit on Brian Saturday,

2598
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:22,600
I can't think. Well, Billy Madison quote
for how about fucking mark? But seriously,

2599
02:33:22,601 --> 02:33:26,440
we were talking about Mark Hunt who
looks like deceiving more than mark.

2600
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:28,280
Hi Roy Nelson,
and they're fine.

2601
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:33,850
They're like professional
athlete to up my ass.

2602
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:37,270
I grew up with island people and I would
look at Mark Hunt and not fuck with

2603
02:33:37,271 --> 02:33:41,230
them. I don't care what you wrote. What I
to fuck with market. I grew up in Tahiti.

2604
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:46,470
That's what I thought you couldn't look
you could you remind me of Tahiti and

2605
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:49,510
the funny, Brian's a bit of the heat.
He told the story. Brian, good question.

2606
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:50,673
Why don't you talk to him?

2607
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:56,270
When you went on vacation and all the
incidents you saw [inaudible] this is

2608
02:33:58,821 --> 02:34:02,530
Tahiti. I had my shirt,
shirt. I watched it. Question.

2609
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:05,170
Thank you for asking a question actually.
When I was in Tahiti,

2610
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:08,980
have you ever seen the snakes in Tahiti?
Oh, they're great snacks. Well, Hey,

2611
02:34:08,981 --> 02:34:11,980
I was playing with a snake and Indonesia.
That is six minutes of my life.

2612
02:34:11,981 --> 02:34:12,940
I'll never get back

2613
02:34:16,350 --> 02:34:19,360
playing with the with a stick, but what
they call the cost comes up and goes,

2614
02:34:19,361 --> 02:34:20,620
young man,
that snake bites you.

2615
02:34:20,621 --> 02:34:25,270
You will be dead in a half hour and we
are six hours from any hospital and I

2616
02:34:25,271 --> 02:34:28,470
went, okay, I'll stop playing with that
snake. Good stories. Stop the animal.

2617
02:34:28,670 --> 02:34:30,550
Good story.
Good story about snakes guys.

2618
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:36,820
That was funny. I bet. Right? I
see Eddie and he's got my back.

2619
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:41,200
You to shit around Karen.
When your back's against the wall,

2620
02:34:41,201 --> 02:34:43,960
you learn how to turn it around.
Look at Steve by chewing gum.

2621
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:48,560
He looks pretty calm areas,
lady and gentlemen. Steve Bay.

2622
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:52,120
He looks hard.
You can work that in you does your act.

2623
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:56,370
You could be like anybody knows
a lot about MMA but he just,

2624
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:59,530
has anybody ever walked to the
oxygen? I'm looking at higher. God,

2625
02:34:59,531 --> 02:35:02,530
he looks ready to as high as fuck.
He does look super,

2626
02:35:02,531 --> 02:35:07,150
super high also as a full time job as
a firefighter. Is that right? Yeah.

2627
02:35:07,151 --> 02:35:09,600
I just said that doesn't look good.
Why are you throwing them under the bus?

2628
02:35:09,620 --> 02:35:12,700
It doesn't look like he's even remotely
warmed up. He looks like he's just like,

2629
02:35:12,701 --> 02:35:15,580
well here we go. By the way, if
you have a job as a firefighter,

2630
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:18,790
it's one of the best jobs to do other
shit cause you have four days on,

2631
02:35:18,791 --> 02:35:20,650
four days off, two days on, four days off,

2632
02:35:20,651 --> 02:35:25,340
something like 24 hour shifts and
the um, you know, a fire house of,

2633
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:28,930
it's a good firehouse is a great place to
work. Obviously. It's a very dangerous,

2634
02:35:28,931 --> 02:35:30,490
obviously there's a lot of responsibility.

2635
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:33,960
My friend Ray back in New York was a
firefighter. We used to call him ray,

2636
02:35:33,961 --> 02:35:37,660
the fireman and he fucking loved it
because he could do all kinds of shit.

2637
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:38,494
While I was at work,

2638
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:41,290
he learned how to be a cook because they
would have times where they didn't have

2639
02:35:41,291 --> 02:35:45,880
to do anything. The fireman, you call them
natural creators, it was at a pool hall.

2640
02:35:47,310 --> 02:35:50,720
Why Things Charlie? Where's he from?
White plains. You know, I love it.

2641
02:35:50,721 --> 02:35:53,860
And Tommy Bell, Tommy's from
Malvern. Martial arts studios.

2642
02:35:53,861 --> 02:35:56,920
Have that to my friend Brendan the
fighter. Yeah, there was Deli Steve. Yup.

2643
02:35:57,100 --> 02:36:01,000
Cause he worked at the Deli. How
they can't leave the firehouse? No,

2644
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:03,490
when they're on they cannot,
won't go to the store.

2645
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:04,570
Maybe they can go to the store.

2646
02:36:04,571 --> 02:36:09,210
They do shifts and shit like that and I'm
sure they have to stay at the station.

2647
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:10,480
You might be right out of the deal.

2648
02:36:10,481 --> 02:36:12,790
You can't be driving
around just you get a call,

2649
02:36:12,791 --> 02:36:17,470
you got to chill and firehouses to have
such a cool like chief the let's dude.

2650
02:36:17,530 --> 02:36:20,230
But he has, I'm on call. It goes dude,
you got to meet us at the fucking,

2651
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:23,020
well I'm sure they covered our basis.
I'm sure they cover their bases.

2652
02:36:23,021 --> 02:36:24,730
You know like when a guy is scheduled on,

2653
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:27,120
you know it was probably another guy
that's scheduled to go shopping for them.

2654
02:36:27,121 --> 02:36:29,020
You can do push ups all day.
That's the thing.

2655
02:36:29,170 --> 02:36:32,890
You can do a lot of training and a lot
of those gyms in firehouses are pretty

2656
02:36:33,220 --> 02:36:37,300
stocked up. And they did Jujitsu.
Heavy bag. Steve Bay played baseball.

2657
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:40,170
Play baseball. Yeah. Pro
Hours. He was drafted.

2658
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:44,080
Never played complete baseball
at Cleveland State and
wrestled. Good athlete, man.

2659
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:48,190
Great Athlete. Who Deep
Bass Guy. Oh, he's American.

2660
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:52,480
He's just weird creatures and stuff,
I think. Yeah, Croatian descent.

2661
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:56,680
He would wear the cro cop shorts every
day when we trained. It was weird.

2662
02:36:57,210 --> 02:37:01,750
He speaks perfect English. Oh yeah. He
doesn't speak any notion. Yeah. Pick six,

2663
02:37:01,751 --> 02:37:04,270
four, two 30. [inaudible].
These are heavy waves.

2664
02:37:05,550 --> 02:37:08,860
Six 14 so a little bit bigger than you,
Bro. I don't know about that. I haven't.

2665
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:12,910
I mean just cause I got training right
now because if I do eight issue after

2666
02:37:12,911 --> 02:37:17,390
pool sprints, Bro, I hear
that whole spread luck. You

2667
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:25,440
pressing my hands
as long as you,

2668
02:37:25,890 --> 02:37:27,800
as long as you don't hit me back.
I can fucking move

2669
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:41,640
about your jab. Jab, Jab,

2670
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:45,290
jab is lightening. It's viper quick.
They call me the viper and the job.

2671
02:37:46,090 --> 02:37:50,700
Am I right? Yeah, he has to. He's got to
stop with the heart thing kills me. I'll,

2672
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:53,240
I told Eddie to stop chewing in front
of the thing I'm showing in front of it.

2673
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:58,250
Mows your cards. Password. Brian.
My guard passing is, is a, um,

2674
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:02,870
they call me slick and did you Jujitsu
to circles. That's what I heard honestly.

2675
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:05,630
But I caught myself with oil.
If you were a referee,

2676
02:38:05,631 --> 02:38:08,630
would you do a heart or would you call
it with your own mood? What would it be?

2677
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:13,130
I do a Haka dance. Could you do just a
ball crater a ball and hold the shaft?

2678
02:38:14,090 --> 02:38:15,950
No movement. No. Instead of this,

2679
02:38:18,210 --> 02:38:20,610
know what I was doing.

2680
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:24,120
Do you do that for me? I'm like, this,

2681
02:38:26,030 --> 02:38:29,390
could you do that? There's
no way. He was a fighter.

2682
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:34,160
Like if you lost the big batch job,
you remember when?

2683
02:38:34,161 --> 02:38:37,670
When I'm a fucking Dennis Hallman
lost that bet and he wore those little

2684
02:38:37,671 --> 02:38:42,500
skivvies fired. Then they get
fired, but he got in trouble.

2685
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:46,400
He wore like the shortest old
school valley. Today's top.

2686
02:38:47,010 --> 02:38:51,890
That was Marco [inaudible]. He used to,
we used to wear those speedo karate.

2687
02:38:51,891 --> 02:38:54,710
They do this thing instead of doing
that one like that with the fist over.

2688
02:38:54,711 --> 02:38:55,580
If you just do like this,

2689
02:38:56,150 --> 02:38:59,210
it's basically you're saying to the
balls and hold the shaft. There you go.

2690
02:39:02,570 --> 02:39:04,890
Oh Dude,
wait.

2691
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:09,040
[inaudible] the difference inside,
but people

2692
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:15,590
don't see that much of a difference.
I do. Oh my God. Optical illusion.

2693
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:18,350
I want to call it out like that.
I wouldn't call it out like that.

2694
02:39:18,830 --> 02:39:23,700
Let me see when they're
moving. He's a foot tall. No,
he's so much bigger. Come on.

2695
02:39:23,730 --> 02:39:28,130
Fat. Does Fabio look like the owner
of crossfit? A little bit. Little bit.

2696
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:30,260
It's not a big deal though.
I can throw down.

2697
02:39:30,740 --> 02:39:34,640
I'm going to go with Fabiano
of Malden. Ira. No. Oh,

2698
02:39:34,650 --> 02:39:38,710
snaps hit him right away in the face.
Fox Care from me.

2699
02:39:38,770 --> 02:39:43,700
There's not that big of a
difference. The steep. Oh No,

2700
02:39:43,701 --> 02:39:45,300
no, no. Five survive.

2701
02:39:46,250 --> 02:39:48,770
STP backed off control.

2702
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:51,290
He's going to come back home
because it comes super competent.

2703
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:54,050
Going to put this guy asleep. No,
he's not worried about it at all.

2704
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:56,840
He's so much bigger. Didn't
exactly. He heard him smart.

2705
02:39:56,890 --> 02:39:59,000
He's not rushing in and
all that's a veteran move.

2706
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:04,040
That's expanse not rushing in there. Oh
that's what's not fair. He's way too big.

2707
02:40:04,041 --> 02:40:09,020
Come on. That's it. He's waiting.
You. Oh boy. Jesus. He's telling me.

2708
02:40:09,030 --> 02:40:13,230
Oh check way to hit way too hard.
Nobody ever did that, that fight.

2709
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:15,690
Let's be honest.
What's absolutely be honest.

2710
02:40:15,930 --> 02:40:18,120
The only reason why sanctioned
that fights cause it's in Brazil,

2711
02:40:18,150 --> 02:40:20,820
they wanted to save the call. Denato
asked for it and it'll save the card.

2712
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:23,910
You're absolutely right. In Malden. I was
such a beast. People like, you know what?

2713
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:28,580
Give him a chance, but
look at this man, boy,

2714
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:30,750
boom,
that right hand.

2715
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:35,190
That's why if it really is an 85
or fighting a elite heavyweight,

2716
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:40,380
that's exactly how it should go down.
Knock you out, Brian. That's honestly,

2717
02:40:40,381 --> 02:40:42,930
I would have rode that shot.
He called it an 80 fiver.

2718
02:40:42,970 --> 02:40:46,920
He could have been 95 and he wasn't
even really elite at light heavyweight.

2719
02:40:46,921 --> 02:40:50,200
It was just tough. Oh, he's just a
guy. This is a dangerous matchup.

2720
02:40:50,210 --> 02:40:54,930
It's super dangerous. It makes me sad.
Nobody ever did this to him before,

2721
02:40:54,931 --> 02:40:57,960
but you're dealing with a totally
different kind of thump and that's what

2722
02:40:57,961 --> 02:40:58,710
Brendan was talking about.

2723
02:40:58,710 --> 02:41:02,520
He's talking about the difference between
flyweights and heavyweights. This boom,

2724
02:41:02,610 --> 02:41:05,860
damn, that's hidden looking like he
punched him hard either rock hearted.

2725
02:41:05,861 --> 02:41:09,790
It looks like he punched him lunch.
How dare you say, right, right.

2726
02:41:10,660 --> 02:41:14,070
Agree with [inaudible].

2727
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:17,080
Straight ride on the
jaw from a heavy loud,

2728
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:20,760
from your vantage point. It doesn't
look like a, he like he won't wound up.

2729
02:41:20,761 --> 02:41:25,230
He just like a short jab punch.
Isn't the gems perfect.

2730
02:41:25,231 --> 02:41:30,090
Punch a short by not giving him
credit. He deserves Brian. Listen guys,

2731
02:41:30,091 --> 02:41:31,830
I think Steve Bay's uphill both ways.

2732
02:41:32,170 --> 02:41:36,400
I say hi. No route for Brian. Hey Brian,
how come you not giving them credit?

2733
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:41,310
I'm like, I thought about it. I'm like,

2734
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:45,010
I thought maybe you were doing let me how
much automatically, but did he really?

2735
02:41:45,011 --> 02:41:46,360
Did you really say that?
But that was,

2736
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:49,150
I'm just saying it was a
deceptive is short. Right?

2737
02:41:49,151 --> 02:41:50,950
Of course it's gonna Knock
'em out, but I just, it's not,

2738
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:54,060
it doesn't look like he hit an
Sro haymaker from his hip. Right?

2739
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:56,890
That's what I'm saying Brian.
It was a perfect right hand.

2740
02:41:57,300 --> 02:42:00,550
Well you haven't seen my right hand.
I've seen it all.

2741
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:05,660
We want to talk about emotion. I've seen
real kick to see here. What else do paid?

2742
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:09,940
Wildly impressed with that. What would
Joey say to Brian if he was here? Right.

2743
02:42:09,970 --> 02:42:11,680
Listen, cock. Cocksucker enough is enough.

2744
02:42:12,130 --> 02:42:14,950
And then what the fuck you talking
about? That it, that right hand hit you.

2745
02:42:14,951 --> 02:42:16,990
You'd be back in Afghanistan
looking for frogs.

2746
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:21,360
You'll be on the jungle cock sucker.

2747
02:42:21,370 --> 02:42:25,930
What your fucking Turpentine
[inaudible] Paul's fuck face.

2748
02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:28,780
That's a good Joey Diaz impersonation.

2749
02:42:29,650 --> 02:42:33,550
Get back in the fucking jungle
and we've for waters guys, I'm,

2750
02:42:33,551 --> 02:42:35,950
I'm discussing it and
fucking right hand hit you.

2751
02:42:35,951 --> 02:42:38,110
You wouldn't even know a
million ants walking over you.

2752
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,300
You'd be sleeping like a baby

2753
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:48,430
answer attacking you. You'd wake up, it'd
be fucking three days later. Skeleton,

2754
02:42:49,150 --> 02:42:52,090
no aunts, no nothing. Even the
answer. Feel sorry for you.

2755
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:55,960
This motherfucking so alcohol. We can't
even eat them. It'd be a travesty.

2756
02:42:59,460 --> 02:43:02,300
That's like jungle laws,
like some universal jungle harmony.

2757
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:06,590
Just to respect the answer,

2758
02:43:06,591 --> 02:43:10,180
we'll go around you and eat an
elephant. He was right here. Boom. Yeah.

2759
02:43:10,181 --> 02:43:11,980
Jesus' bride, the temp. I don't even

2760
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,850
understand how he went down
from this fucking perfectly
pleased. Right hand shot,

2761
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:20,100
240 pounds, super
heavyweight, all knuckles.

2762
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:22,060
That's a lot of weight behind that.

2763
02:43:22,061 --> 02:43:26,030
Find some God damn telephone
poles striking you in the
face. It's not fun guys.

2764
02:43:26,250 --> 02:43:27,430
You made a mistake, Brian? No,

2765
02:43:27,431 --> 02:43:31,020
I'm just saying there are
guys who take that car to go.

2766
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:32,620
You just realize you made a mistake.

2767
02:43:32,650 --> 02:43:36,540
You'll be waking up in a fucking
tent back up, back up, back up.

2768
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:38,790
Some of the horses run on corn flakes.

2769
02:43:41,080 --> 02:43:42,770
Brides just back up.

2770
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:50,260
He must've not written. You know
how long has junior high for anyone?

2771
02:43:50,261 --> 02:43:52,570
No broken hands, man. Broken
hands where a motherfucker,

2772
02:43:53,170 --> 02:43:54,040
you know when you get them,

2773
02:43:54,041 --> 02:43:58,300
that's the other thing you started getting
the more often. I have no shirt on.

2774
02:43:58,390 --> 02:44:01,450
Vituro has had, cause he forgot
his and he had to give it to him.

2775
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:06,550
He's ready to fight. He's
mad. You can uh, yeah,

2776
02:44:06,551 --> 02:44:07,730
they do things you can,

2777
02:44:07,770 --> 02:44:10,360
they do things to protect your
hair plates in their surgeries.

2778
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:12,940
But the bottom line is once
you start breaking your hand,

2779
02:44:12,941 --> 02:44:14,500
it's very likely going to break it again.

2780
02:44:14,501 --> 02:44:15,940
What did you put the
plate before you break?

2781
02:44:15,941 --> 02:44:19,390
It would all depends on how much time
you let it heal before you get back to

2782
02:44:19,391 --> 02:44:23,050
training. That gets a
place. Brandon. Um, shit,

2783
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:26,590
we fucking not gonna we didn't
watch the Alaska is one punch.

2784
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:30,610
We didn't watch the, uh, the
full, um, Moose saucy fight.

2785
02:44:30,690 --> 02:44:34,900
The Musashi versus a,
we didn't see the cut on your elbow.

2786
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:39,090
Can you imagine that? A right now
there, there's no laws against that.

2787
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:42,070
They should jump on it. Don't wait
for it to break. Jump on that.

2788
02:44:42,071 --> 02:44:45,060
She did like a wolverine
thing. Yeah. Why not? Let me,

2789
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:46,780
I'm going to find it here for us.

2790
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:53,400
Find it so we could watch Moose
Aussie and there's no way he goes.

2791
02:44:54,060 --> 02:44:56,710
No, unfortunately it's, it's on my,

2792
02:44:56,740 --> 02:45:00,460
we'll watch the whole thing
since we have the, uh, the time.

2793
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:05,650
Brian Stann, John and I live in
Brazil. Steve Bay. Me. Oh chick man.

2794
02:45:05,651 --> 02:45:08,110
He's a motherfucker dude.
He is a motherfucker.

2795
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:14,410
Kenny Florian and Hunada do that
scene from heat. [inaudible] no,

2796
02:45:14,890 --> 02:45:17,600
you have no mat.
Dude.

2797
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:20,670
Hit natto and Kenny Florian and do the
scene from hate where they sit in the

2798
02:45:20,710 --> 02:45:23,680
diner. Oh, that's great.
It's fucking incredible.

2799
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:29,240
Really fucking octal doing Robert De Niro.

2800
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:34,210
Oh my God. So there's a lot of
insights. Shit, they got to see that.

2801
02:45:34,211 --> 02:45:38,420
Most people wouldn't. And that on Youtube.
Yeah. Oh my God. I'm having a hard time.

2802
02:45:38,421 --> 02:45:39,254
He's got his own shop.

2803
02:45:39,520 --> 02:45:42,890
He's got his own Internet show that
there's a huge smash called the handout

2804
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:46,300
[inaudible] Andra show that's being
produced by flex point. Oh my God.

2805
02:45:46,530 --> 02:45:50,680
You go to Youtube licks point and
not the Laronza do. There's a,

2806
02:45:50,681 --> 02:45:55,420
there's a scene where he not though gives
Darth Vader at Jujitsu lesson and he

2807
02:45:55,421 --> 02:45:58,420
gives it to after the lesson,
he gives him a stripe on his white belt.

2808
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:00,033
Darth Vader.

2809
02:46:00,970 --> 02:46:05,970
For some reason this thing is not
allowing me to fast forward it.

2810
02:46:07,330 --> 02:46:11,060
I'm having a hard time figuring out how
fast needs to buffer. Yeah, it must be.

2811
02:46:11,390 --> 02:46:16,040
It must be cause loop bar not as fighting.
And he was earlier on that car. Yeah.

2812
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:17,780
Do you wanna Watch his
fight? Yeah. Go for it.

2813
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:19,400
Do you guys want to do that or
you want to get some dinner?

2814
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:22,100
Cause it's almost 10 o'clock.
Starving. Yeah. Let's just watch this.

2815
02:46:22,101 --> 02:46:25,840
Musafa goes the decision loop
by net loses sigh. Oh Shit.

2816
02:46:25,841 --> 02:46:28,680
I can't believe you just get that shot.
Now I'm trying to eat some

2817
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:35,300
type move. Oh Brian, give me
some air to heritage. Yeah,

2818
02:46:35,301 --> 02:46:39,770
it's buffering in southern California.
You want to go to my show tomorrow?

2819
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:43,430
Eddie Bravo.
invitational.com tickets are 25 bucks.

2820
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:48,860
We made it nice and cheap
tomorrow at four 30 and

2821
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:53,930
what time would end if people,
it all depends on how fast the matches go.

2822
02:46:53,931 --> 02:46:58,670
It could end in an hour or it could last
time limit. It's just submission. No, no,

2823
02:46:58,671 --> 02:46:59,090
no,
no.

2824
02:46:59,090 --> 02:47:03,600
It's submission only 10 minute rounds
and we have a submission based overtime

2825
02:47:03,650 --> 02:47:07,940
like extra innings like we go over time
I get to get on your back would double

2826
02:47:08,150 --> 02:47:11,090
over under with both leg hooks.
What it's like extra.

2827
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:16,640
It's extra innings either if I get
you then you get a chance on my back.

2828
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:20,210
If I escape then I win.
It's like extra anything that's cool.

2829
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:21,171
But if you tap me too,

2830
02:47:21,171 --> 02:47:24,750
then we go another extra that's like
overtime college football chance to,

2831
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:29,480
it's exact, we both get a chance to
attack our overtime, you know, 10 minutes,

2832
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:31,490
10 minute rounds and then a three,

2833
02:47:31,730 --> 02:47:35,900
three maximum over time innings,
extra innings.

2834
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:39,320
If we go three innings and it's still
tie like maybe the first round both got a

2835
02:47:39,321 --> 02:47:42,290
sub second round, both escaped
third round, both escape.

2836
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:45,650
So you could sub each other more than
once in a match. It's like extra innings.

2837
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:47,720
It's like,
so it's supposed to get a chance.

2838
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:51,800
We go into overtime instead of
overtime being based on wrestling.

2839
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:53,600
It's like whoever has the
best wrestling will win.

2840
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:56,090
A lot of wrestlers will stall and,
and,

2841
02:47:56,100 --> 02:47:58,760
and want to win in overtime because
they know that wrestling has dominant.

2842
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:02,000
We're trying to eliminate that. So
what is your, uh, how does it work?

2843
02:48:02,050 --> 02:48:05,090
Let's say we go 10 minutes and there's
also a mission. Let we go into overtime.

2844
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:09,200
You get to you, it's like extra innings
and baseball you get, you're the,

2845
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:11,660
you're the top half of an ending.
You get my back,

2846
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:13,610
both leg hooks with an over under.

2847
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:18,350
If you submit me now I get a
chance to get you. If you escape,

2848
02:48:18,410 --> 02:48:21,980
you win. Cause I couldn't score.
We both had a chance. You scored.

2849
02:48:22,130 --> 02:48:26,630
But if you tapped me to, they only go on
other ending. Then you get on my back.

2850
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:30,230
I escape. Then I get on your back,
you escape. We'd go another ending.

2851
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:35,390
So and then the next inning you tap me
and then when I get my shot you escape.

2852
02:48:35,391 --> 02:48:39,260
You win. That's interesting.
Basically this idea.

2853
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:44,420
Lots of cannabis, lots of
cans allegedly. Yes. Yes.

2854
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:45,620
We've uh,

2855
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:48,620
we've been doing this at the Midwest
submission challenge in the Midwest and

2856
02:48:48,621 --> 02:48:53,390
it's working out great. Uh, you
know, so we're trying it out and

2857
02:48:55,700 --> 02:48:56,150
the whole,

2858
02:48:56,150 --> 02:49:00,680
the whole format was all designed to
try to make Jujitsu exciting enough.

2859
02:49:00,740 --> 02:49:04,310
So networks would want it Eric,
cause we got dog Frisbee,

2860
02:49:04,311 --> 02:49:07,070
we got ridiculous sports.
Be An Eric. We have to have,

2861
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:09,630
there was no reason to not
have Jiu Jitsu on TV. Right.

2862
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:11,840
But the only way you're going to do it
is you've got to eliminate the points

2863
02:49:11,841 --> 02:49:13,400
system. Cause that'll never work, right?

2864
02:49:14,010 --> 02:49:17,310
We've had Jujitsu with a point system
for 20 years. We don't see any TV out.

2865
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:20,730
No one people have looked
at it and they're like, no
way. We can't put this on TV.

2866
02:49:21,150 --> 02:49:25,140
So it has to be submission only.
And um, ultimately it's gotta,

2867
02:49:25,170 --> 02:49:27,180
it's gotta be about money.
It's gotta be like a game show,

2868
02:49:27,181 --> 02:49:30,930
like a 60 man bracket and
the guy who wins it all,

2869
02:49:30,931 --> 02:49:34,500
he's the only guy who gets paid
then that'll increase the urgency,

2870
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:38,340
make it submission, only
give some mission, uh, uh,

2871
02:49:38,341 --> 02:49:39,930
submission bonuses and incentive.

2872
02:49:40,050 --> 02:49:43,050
That way you throw so much money out of
these guys are in there to make as much

2873
02:49:43,051 --> 02:49:44,640
money as possible.
Right?

2874
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:49,710
So that translates to entertainment
for the guys watching because you know,

2875
02:49:49,730 --> 02:49:52,410
that's really who important
here that the audience,

2876
02:49:52,470 --> 02:49:55,470
we want to make it to the audience
can't wait to see this shit.

2877
02:49:55,590 --> 02:49:57,540
And the only way that's
going to happen is you have,

2878
02:49:57,570 --> 02:50:02,010
you provide you Jitsu matches
that are incurred rattle
bowl. You're like, Oh shit,

2879
02:50:02,130 --> 02:50:06,390
yes, there's still going to be some boring
matches. But overall you want like 60,

2880
02:50:06,391 --> 02:50:11,391
70% of the matches to be exciting
enough so that your average UFC fan will

2881
02:50:11,581 --> 02:50:14,590
enjoy. Because right now most UFC
fans do not want to watch the moon.

2882
02:50:14,591 --> 02:50:17,790
Dealz then do not want to
watch ADCC there and the MMA,

2883
02:50:17,791 --> 02:50:20,010
they don't want to watch they dip into it.
We,

2884
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:21,990
there are so many people that in the,

2885
02:50:22,340 --> 02:50:26,130
that are fans of the UFC that would be
down for grappling and they would down be

2886
02:50:26,131 --> 02:50:28,290
down to watch it even though
they didn't do Jujitsu.

2887
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:33,480
If it was exciting enough and that's what
I'm trying to do, I may fail miserably,

2888
02:50:33,481 --> 02:50:38,130
but I'm trying, I'm trying to make
Jujitsu as entertaining as possible. Uh,

2889
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:41,600
not to make money just to, just
to make Jujitsu Cooler. That's it.

2890
02:50:41,870 --> 02:50:42,190
Okay.

2891
02:50:42,190 --> 02:50:47,080
Musashi and looking at Marcos
are fighting right now and uh,

2892
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:49,130
I started at while you were still talking,

2893
02:50:49,131 --> 02:50:52,430
so back it up so we could all
get the some marks. Game Plan.

2894
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:55,340
Here's all we worked on was
movement and be unpredictable.

2895
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:57,800
Change your levels and not only
just shoot for, take downs,

2896
02:50:57,801 --> 02:51:01,910
but set it up with your big hands.
But you can tell right away.

2897
02:51:01,911 --> 02:51:05,240
He kind of just shoots from, that's
way too far to shoot it right there.

2898
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:09,380
Especially on the gallic massage,
getting harder and harder. Look,

2899
02:51:09,381 --> 02:51:14,300
he's got ahold of her hard,
he's got 'em up and boom takes him down,

2900
02:51:14,330 --> 02:51:17,930
but lands can't control.
That's amazing. Amazing,

2901
02:51:18,230 --> 02:51:20,960
Amazing Bass by moon sauce.
So the whole camp,

2902
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:24,290
the biggest thing was level
changes and movement for mark.

2903
02:51:24,291 --> 02:51:28,700
Don't get backed up to the cage and come
over the right hand with the well over

2904
02:51:28,701 --> 02:51:29,690
a Musashi's Jab.

2905
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:34,250
It's easier said than done when you
have a vicious striker coming at you.

2906
02:51:34,251 --> 02:51:36,400
I'm just telling you that that
was the game plan dog does it.

2907
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:37,610
I'm just telling you what the, the, the,

2908
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:41,520
our plan was and then obviously you
see it come to live here, got that.

2909
02:51:42,050 --> 02:51:46,000
Have long arms of wrestlers is Munoz,

2910
02:51:46,001 --> 02:51:48,500
is he's top level in the UFC.

2911
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:52,880
He's facing a guy who didn't wrestle
in college and he's having a hard time

2912
02:51:52,881 --> 02:51:56,240
taking her down.
It's getting hard to take dudes down.

2913
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:59,770
So when you're in a situation like
this in a scenario where you're,

2914
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:01,190
you're Munoz and,
and your,

2915
02:52:01,220 --> 02:52:04,040
your sole mission is to take him
down and beat him on the ground.

2916
02:52:04,270 --> 02:52:06,040
And if you can't do that,
which

2917
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:10,780
is coming up all the time, he's forced
into a kickboxing match where he's um,

2918
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:11,830
outclassed.
Honestly,

2919
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:15,790
this is why it's hard to take them down
cause Musashi doesn't commit to his

2920
02:52:15,791 --> 02:52:19,240
punches. He just don't rush in. He's
always using his linked, you'll see me,

2921
02:52:19,241 --> 02:52:23,260
he's jabbing, jabbing, leaning
in the right hand. He never
rushes in at the waist.

2922
02:52:23,261 --> 02:52:27,700
He's got a good start.
His basis far back is basis very far back.

2923
02:52:27,790 --> 02:52:30,600
Look how low is too low.

2924
02:52:30,610 --> 02:52:34,510
He gets to the office and by pulling
back when your low like that,

2925
02:52:34,511 --> 02:52:38,880
you give yourself an extra
six inches where that dude
can't punch you. Yup. Smart.

2926
02:52:39,090 --> 02:52:41,560
It should be how low he is.

2927
02:52:45,360 --> 02:52:48,690
Musashi was really fucking impressive
in the Machida FY two man Witchita

2928
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:50,820
obviously it was more impressive,
but I was,

2929
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:54,570
I was impressed by his ability to
take a shot to Machida head kick.

2930
02:52:54,571 --> 02:52:57,890
That was a good shot by mark. That's
a good shy. There's defended it

2931
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:01,530
in the middle of that shot.

2932
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:05,460
He could have pulled half guard
and try to get on top another way.

2933
02:53:05,461 --> 02:53:06,900
Cause there's two ways
to get on top for mark.

2934
02:53:07,140 --> 02:53:10,800
Either take him down with the classic
wrestling take down that he's so good at

2935
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:15,300
or you'd take the long way to get on top.
You can't take the guy down. He's hard,

2936
02:53:15,301 --> 02:53:16,134
he's got good base.

2937
02:53:16,350 --> 02:53:21,350
It's way easy to shoot and pull half
guard and you've got to have some high

2938
02:53:21,570 --> 02:53:25,950
quality half guard sweeps.
But that's how Nogueira beat Tim silver.

2939
02:53:25,951 --> 02:53:26,580
You've got to prepare.

2940
02:53:26,580 --> 02:53:29,700
You've got to be super high level that
every fighter should be trying to get

2941
02:53:29,701 --> 02:53:31,320
super high level cause
that's how Nogueira beat Tim.

2942
02:53:31,320 --> 02:53:34,800
Silvia Nogueira cannot take Tim and
Tim Silvia was winning on his feet.

2943
02:53:34,980 --> 02:53:38,940
The weight Nogueira got the fight to the
ground as he shot. He pulled half gone,

2944
02:53:38,941 --> 02:53:42,450
wind swept, swept him. They got on
touch and then kill it. So crazy.

2945
02:53:43,050 --> 02:53:45,630
Mark doesn't have the time to do that
Jujitsu. You know what I'm saying?

2946
02:53:45,631 --> 02:53:50,631
He's too far in his career now to
learn that crazy 600 ad nasty crank.

2947
02:53:51,960 --> 02:53:52,793
He would be amazing.

2948
02:53:53,240 --> 02:53:56,610
He would be so confident where he could
pull half guard and sweep instead of

2949
02:53:56,611 --> 02:54:00,300
coming. It's just not as nature though.
You know what I'm saying? He's got a,

2950
02:54:00,310 --> 02:54:01,910
he's got to adapt because
this is going to come.

2951
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:04,980
This guy's not even a wrestler
and he can't take them
down and it's getting hard.

2952
02:54:04,981 --> 02:54:08,190
It's getting hard. I want to talk about
these. I want to talk about these elbows.

2953
02:54:08,191 --> 02:54:12,390
It's so crazy that you can do a downward
elbow as long as it's on the side.

2954
02:54:12,930 --> 02:54:16,080
As long as it's side where it makes
sense. It's totally ridiculous. Stupid.

2955
02:54:16,081 --> 02:54:19,170
It's the same exact movement as
a 12 to six. It's just common.

2956
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:22,440
It's going 12 to six like sideways.
Who made that rule?

2957
02:54:22,470 --> 02:54:25,920
The athletic look at that and
if our athletic commissioner
that amount, God damn,

2958
02:54:25,921 --> 02:54:30,630
that mountain was nice. Yeah. If
Munoz had a thick sick half guard,

2959
02:54:30,631 --> 02:54:34,180
it would look a lot different. Look at
it. He got him here. Can happen. Why not?

2960
02:54:34,410 --> 02:54:36,930
Why not? He's not as he committed
himself to that I met mark.

2961
02:54:37,010 --> 02:54:40,440
Mark is going to fire you. Well why
wouldn't he? I know mark very well.

2962
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:43,050
Mark's don't fight one more time in
the Philippines and then call it quits.

2963
02:54:43,051 --> 02:54:47,930
I bet is you've been thinking about
calling it quits anyway. Yeah. Maybe.

2964
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:52,180
Do you want to talk to about, my point
is maybe he retires after this, but uh,

2965
02:54:52,430 --> 02:54:56,120
I believe
the out of sick.

2966
02:54:56,150 --> 02:55:00,290
How old guard I would his old man,
36.

2967
02:55:01,160 --> 02:55:02,780
Is that a lot of flights to in wrestling?

2968
02:55:02,810 --> 02:55:06,520
He doesn't have the time to commit to it.
Yeah. Well he does a bunch of it. I'm,

2969
02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:08,690
I'm with you man. That'd be dope
as shit. I'm with you. Yeah.

2970
02:55:08,691 --> 02:55:09,940
You tried to take him down,
but when you,

2971
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:14,720
you can't take this guy down second
round, third round your, your corner.

2972
02:55:14,730 --> 02:55:17,030
She was saying, listen, you can't
take this motherfucker down.

2973
02:55:17,210 --> 02:55:20,100
You're going to shoot pool half guard and
sweep this month for longer. Yeah. Yeah.

2974
02:55:20,150 --> 02:55:22,150
There's so many sweeps you
could do from half guard. Yeah.

2975
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:24,590
You can get on top of that way.
Yeah. No, Gary has done it.

2976
02:55:24,591 --> 02:55:25,970
That many people have done that.

2977
02:55:25,970 --> 02:55:28,520
You just don't pay attention completely
out of time. We're four minutes.

2978
02:55:28,521 --> 02:55:32,510
This thing's going to shut off. Okay,
let's go. I gotta wrap it up. Uh,

2979
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:35,370
everybody listening.
We'll do this every time we get a chance.

2980
02:55:35,371 --> 02:55:37,490
It's fun to show you guys going to come
to my shows. I know. Here's the thing,

2981
02:55:37,530 --> 02:55:42,530
Joe can't go. Can you go?
Do you want to go? I can't.
Tomorrow. You can't. Great. Wow.

2982
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:49,000
That's amazing. Now Jamie, do you want to
go to my show tomorrow? Go Daddy. Show me.

2983
02:55:49,010 --> 02:55:53,120
Let me make show Jesus Christ you guys
for the support. Do these whenever we can.

2984
02:55:53,150 --> 02:55:55,410
Ladies and gentlemen,
we do these whenever we can go.

2985
02:55:55,510 --> 02:56:00,000
I'm going to watch a DVD with my
girlfriend. Thank you. Oh my God. Uh,

2986
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:02,870
we do these whenever we can. Um,
but uh, there are a lot of fun.

2987
02:56:02,871 --> 02:56:03,390
But here's the thing,

2988
02:56:03,390 --> 02:56:05,930
you can't expect us to call the
fights if we're hanging out.

2989
02:56:05,930 --> 02:56:08,870
You're just watching the fights with us.
If we want to talk shit, that's fine.

2990
02:56:08,871 --> 02:56:10,400
If we want to call the fights,
that's fine too.

2991
02:56:10,700 --> 02:56:13,440
But you got to just accept what it is.
You can't try to change the,

2992
02:56:13,490 --> 02:56:17,130
I don't even talk about the
fight. Exactly. I've already
got those twitters. Yeah,

2993
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:19,640
go fuck your mother. We're going
to talk about whatever we want.

2994
02:56:19,750 --> 02:56:24,160
Stop even look at Cuba. Yeah. I didn't
know he was still articulate. All right.

2995
02:56:24,290 --> 02:56:26,480
That's it. We're out of time.
Thank you everybody. Good night.

2996
02:56:26,481 --> 02:56:30,890
We'll be back next week with actual real
podcasts that a aren't fight companions,

2997
02:56:30,891 --> 02:56:34,130
but again, we'll do this
again. Eddie Bravo would do
the scan with this. Fuck. Yeah,

2998
02:56:34,131 --> 02:56:37,500
you kidding? This is one of the
funnest podcast of all time.

2999
02:56:37,501 --> 02:56:40,880
I'm not doing it again. I get made fun
of shut up. No, I'll ring you back.

3000
02:56:40,970 --> 02:56:43,970
We'll bring you back. Goodnight. Everybody
could see you soon. See you Monday.

3001
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:44,953
Big Kiss.

3002
02:56:52,950 --> 02:56:54,050
Okay.
