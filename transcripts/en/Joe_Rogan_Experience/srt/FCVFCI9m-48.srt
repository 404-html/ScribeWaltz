1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,590
Bam,

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:00,811
Bam,

3
00:00:00,811 --> 00:00:01,081
Bam,

4
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:01,500
Bam,

5
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,010
Bam,

6
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,740
Bam.

7
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,210
We live cool.

8
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,890
Beautiful.

9
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,720
We don't need no fucking stinking music.

10
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:07,891
We don't need it,

11
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:08,160
man.

12
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,970
We've got us.

13
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,803
We've got us.

14
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,410
Yeah.

15
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,500
We were just discussing referee's
letting guys get choked unconscious.

16
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,640
It's only Egypt.

17
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,860
Educate that dude from
this previous weekend.

18
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,241
Yeah.

19
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:17,410
We,

20
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,770
I think I'm some guys who
never been choked out.

21
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,730
I think that's one thing.

22
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,391
Even if you,

23
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:21,750
uh,

24
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,430
you don't,

25
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:22,800
uh,

26
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,090
have a martial arts background,

27
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,110
you can be in referee.

28
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,711
You're aware of that,

29
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,040
right?

30
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,873
You can be,

31
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,331
yes,

32
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,170
you can be a referee.

33
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,660
All you have to do is
understand what's going on.

34
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,550
You take like referee
classes and you'll learn.

35
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:37,551
You can start out taking referee
classes as a complete total novice.

36
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,120
I think you should have,

37
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,560
I think as a ref you should have at least
been choked out once and been knocked

38
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,011
out once.

39
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,460
I mean,

40
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,740
Herb Dean had a profile.

41
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,330
I think he had several profiles,

42
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,070
couple and herb dean roles all the time.

43
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,820
Herb deans,

44
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,850
a real martial artist,

45
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,130
Mario Yamasaki black belt.

46
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,590
So it was John McCarthy.

47
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,850
He's a black belt in Jujitsu.

48
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,660
All those guys that we fee just so his,

49
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,260
um,

50
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,093
uh,

51
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,040
Josh who's in jail right now.

52
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,910
Gotcha.

53
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,743
Gotcha.

54
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,923
I'm pretty sure he's out.

55
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,130
Josh has very high level brown belt.

56
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,041
He knows his shit.

57
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,860
If you're a vendor stripe white belt,

58
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,540
you know what the Hell's going on?

59
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,374
A little bit.

60
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,011
A little bit.

61
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,330
Especially on a rear naked choke.

62
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,390
I don't think it was a Doris or
something of a hit and you can't see,

63
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,460
well he was face up to,

64
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,410
it was a real naked face up.

65
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,400
So it wasn't like,

66
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:23,810
you know,

67
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,060
it like sometimes guys get choked out
and the guys on top of them and they have

68
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,880
their back and they got a belly down
and you can't see the guy's face.

69
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,580
But when the guy's face up and
you're looking at his eyes,

70
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,443
Jesus had,

71
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,590
what are you doing?

72
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,130
Yeah,

73
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,690
he was out for a couple seconds.

74
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,350
You know,

75
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,020
sometimes people just
don't make good decisions,

76
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:40,231
you know,

77
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:40,591
they just,

78
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,424
they error.

79
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,380
It's not that they're bad people,

80
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,690
it's just the earth.

81
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,511
It doesn't work.

82
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:46,650
And in that case,

83
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,161
look,

84
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,060
if I fuck up,

85
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,020
it's not good because a bunch of people
are listening and they want the show to

86
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,100
be smooth and they're attaining.

87
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:53,791
But if I fuck up,

88
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,601
it's not that big a deal.

89
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,434
No one's getting hurt.

90
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,711
Right.

91
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,850
If this guy fucks up,

92
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,770
someone's going to get choked asleep,

93
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,221
you know,

94
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,040
that wouldn't get choked asleep or
someone's going to get beaten a few extra

95
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,611
times,

96
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,560
which can make a huge difference.

97
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,090
Then the beatings for sure.

98
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,450
I mean the good thing it was in a joint
manipulation submission because then

99
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,820
you're talking about someone's arm being
broken so they're just getting choked

100
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:12,210
out.

101
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,200
Well in that situation,

102
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:13,321
no,

103
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,940
don't you let the guy fight out of it.

104
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,130
Like I let a guy fight
out of a full arm bar.

105
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,110
Cause the way I would feel is that if
his arm pops that's on him and guys have

106
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:26,250
gotten their arms popped in one fights
for Jon Jones got his fucking arm popped

107
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,090
against v true.

108
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,953
If you watched it,

109
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,590
yes.

110
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,790
Did fuck yeah,

111
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,610
he got his arm completely
hyperextended yeah.

112
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,180
By then the trans whole body.

113
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,161
Dude,

114
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,940
it was bad.

115
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,620
This is probably a of,

116
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,390
well if we play the video of the podium,

117
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,940
there's,

118
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,030
there might be a picture of it.

119
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,000
You find that an image of it,

120
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:47,001
but at full extension it was completely
hyper extended the other way and John's

121
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,900
elbows fucked up for a long time after
that because I remember he had the,

122
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:51,510
uh,

123
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:51,841
coach,

124
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:54,810
the ultimate fighter and like that's
one of the things they said like,

125
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,360
well this is good anyway because you
can't really train right now because his

126
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,890
elbows fucked up from the Vituro fight.

127
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,080
So he will you in tab one of
the closest he's been to losing.

128
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,470
Huh?

129
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,010
Pretty.

130
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,280
Besides the decision
was that was Alexander,

131
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,580
but it's definitely the closest.

132
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:06,880
Yes,

133
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,620
probably he's been in for sure.

134
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,071
For sure.

135
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,821
That was a bad,

136
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,091
bad,

137
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,421
bad,

138
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,580
bad spot vi towards nasty dude.

139
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,121
You know,

140
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:16,680
a lot of people are taking him for granted
versus Weidman because the whole TRT

141
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,500
thing,

142
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,940
I don't fucking buy it,

143
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,211
man.

144
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,080
I don't buy it looks
good and it's pictures.

145
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,660
It looks way better than he used to.

146
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,380
Like there was a period after he got off
TRT where he deflated when we saw him

147
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,220
at those Wayne's,

148
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:30,040
he looked like a straight welter weight,

149
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,041
but it looks,

150
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,470
he looks a lot thicker now.

151
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,340
It looks way better.

152
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,780
So I know he's been doing a lot of,

153
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,160
uh,

154
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,720
they say that the way you
have to jumpstart your system,

155
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:42,100
one of the big ways you do
a lot of compound exercises
like cleans and presses,

156
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,060
forces your body to produce
less testosterone and estrogen.

157
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,643
Testosterone.

158
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,490
Yeah.

159
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:48,821
Big,

160
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,070
big things like he was
doing searcher squats,

161
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,750
which is where you know you like,

162
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,690
it's almost like you do a,

163
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,660
you put your hands
together like you're in,

164
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,351
make your arms,

165
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,184
like you're curling,

166
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,450
you put the Bar,

167
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,700
you hang it from your arms
and you do your squats.

168
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,470
Like that tough man on your core.

169
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,040
Yes.

170
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,850
Yeah,

171
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,091
yeah,

172
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:04,900
I do too.

173
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,700
So he's doing all that kind of crazy shit.

174
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,810
So,

175
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,500
you know,

176
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:08,801
I'm,

177
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,030
I'm hoping this is how it,

178
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,750
uh,

179
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,170
how he,

180
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,960
this is one idea how strong Jones is.

181
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,010
He's just so weird.

182
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:15,610
Strong.

183
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,391
He's ridiculous.

184
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:19,900
He's draw but veto or
caught it at a perfect spot.

185
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,081
You know,

186
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,830
he might've,

187
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,110
he might've been able to win the
fight if he didn't let up on it,

188
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:28,111
but I think he let up on it when it a
popsicle and he said he let up on it and I

189
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,050
believe him.

190
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,730
And then he got some instinctive.

191
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,090
Yep.

192
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,160
He got come Morad John Kamora him.

193
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,900
I mean after his arm got all fucked up.

194
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:39,901
So his right arm was all blown out and
he still uses it to a Kimora him later on

195
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,240
in the fight and then he's fucked
up for a while after that fight.

196
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,140
That was one of the
reasons why he a coast,

197
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,190
the ultimate fighter right there.

198
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,020
Well,

199
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,220
Chelsea had jail so he
just wasn't training.

200
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,160
Like he'd walk by him and Shelby training
twice a day I'll follow squat and John

201
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,420
and walked by Christmas clean.

202
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Just nice and showered and like,

203
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:57,634
what is he training?

204
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,360
Maybe he wasn't.

205
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,050
It wasn't,

206
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,561
he wasn't.

207
00:04:59,561 --> 00:04:59,770
Yeah,

208
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,820
just chill.

209
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,240
Said that's when he realized that
he's just not as good as John.

210
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,850
He's asking.

211
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,683
He said he got in there,

212
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,850
he said 30 seconds in.

213
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,180
He goes,

214
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,970
I want him to come out of that ring so
fast because I just couldn't believe how

215
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,804
strong he was.

216
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,090
Jon Jones Jones a Goddamn joke.

217
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,730
Now think about him and then think about
what Anthony Rumble Johnson versus him

218
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,593
is going to be like,

219
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,810
like that's going to be the
most chaotic God damn fights.

220
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,060
I that's not my number one fight all time.

221
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,063
All time.

222
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,620
Yup.

223
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,453
Dang.

224
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,690
That really has thank God.

225
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,171
Why?

226
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,890
Because he's got such a knockout power
and time makes a mistake and I'm,

227
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,000
because I've been thinking about it,

228
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,640
I've been thinking about all the great
matchups like there's been some great

229
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,091
match ups,

230
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,920
you know for sure like um,

231
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,910
like Bj Penn versus George Saint
Pierre when it first happened.

232
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,481
God Damn,

233
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,350
that was a big build up,

234
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:47,110
big match Tito chocolate delvers deal.

235
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,741
But those,

236
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,080
I had a pretty good sense
of what was going to happen.

237
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,270
I had a pretty good
sense cause they trained,

238
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,260
ESPN was too big.

239
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,810
I think GSP is too big.

240
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:55,600
It was too hot.

241
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,740
His wrestling was too good.

242
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,741
And I knew the beach.

243
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,574
I just didn't,

244
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,020
that was before the Marinovich has,

245
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:03,560
he didn't have that work ethic that he
has for a very short period of time when

246
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,420
Bj was in just insane shape,

247
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,620
like the Sean sherk fight,

248
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,270
he was in the same shape that
was actually before that.

249
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,420
But he was in insane shape for
that fight to Diego Sanchez fight.

250
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,430
He was a destroyer.

251
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,021
Kenny Florian.

252
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:13,490
Yeah.

253
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,323
Um,

254
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,100
who else?

255
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
There was a couple of other fights that
he had one who was in like the best

256
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,000
shape ever as a lightweight,

257
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:20,901
you know,

258
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,570
but when he bought a George,

259
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,901
I was like,

260
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,920
George is just too big.

261
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,210
This is just not the right file.

262
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,290
So this is for you.

263
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,660
This is the biggest one to me.

264
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,340
This is the one where I
don't know what the fuck.

265
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:31,671
First of all,

266
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,960
I think John is the greatest light
heavyweight champ of all time ever.

267
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,480
Right.

268
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,960
I agree.

269
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,890
And I think he's also still
growing and getting better.

270
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
That's what's scary.

271
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,080
Spectacular talent.

272
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,540
Cause he,

273
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,120
he just moved his entire camp to
Albuquerque because he used to live in New

274
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,150
York.

275
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,301
Now.

276
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,750
He bought a place in Albuquerque
and he's training full time now.

277
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:50,920
Yeah.

278
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,640
He was just going to
Albuquerque for camps.

279
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,640
Huh?

280
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,441
Y'all crazy.

281
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,200
That's going to be crushing me.

282
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,890
Comes after a beats Anthony
Rumble Johnson cane.

283
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,380
That's what he's got to go.

284
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:00,740
Right.

285
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,680
That's the question is if it's not after,

286
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,010
because I don't know what the fuck is
going to happen when Anthony Rumble

287
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,843
Johnson puts myths on you.

288
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,081
I don't know.

289
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,850
I don't know who's going to
be able to withstand that.

290
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,840
I don't see the problem is is John is so
much longer and the reach is a factor.

291
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,020
So I listen,

292
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,600
I thought Glover was going
to be an issue for unboxing.

293
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,150
Offered nothing because of that length.

294
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:23,990
It's tough to deal with.

295
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,170
Man.

296
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,580
Clover is very good.

297
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,340
I said Glover is like at a,

298
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,080
at a possible like standup challengers.

299
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,060
When I was looking him
coming in against John,

300
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,631
I was like,

301
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,550
he's got like really heavy hands,

302
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:35,870
especially really experienced,

303
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,710
especially at the time.

304
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,060
Well he took a step back.

305
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,620
He's not training with,

306
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:40,340
uh,

307
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,560
he wasn't training with
Hackleman for this last fight.

308
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,760
He did it all in Connecticut.

309
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,250
A lot of yeah.

310
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,083
And his own,

311
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,780
he had his own camp that he did down
there and a lot of people thought maybe he

312
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,050
wasn't prepared as when he fought John
Though there was a ton of hype in the UFC

313
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:51,310
pitch.

314
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:51,591
I'm like,

315
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,020
this is the guy chocolate
l signed off on it.

316
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:54,651
Dana White,

317
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:54,930
you know,

318
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,701
everyone I felt,

319
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:56,150
again,

320
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,900
I felt like it,

321
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,411
I mean I felt,

322
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:01,070
I feel like guys are as good as
they are in their best performances.

323
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,371
Right.

324
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,950
So like if you look at him
like his best performance,

325
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,960
like he gets clipped by
Ryan Bader in seconds later,

326
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,890
he puts Bader away.

327
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,220
Yeah.

328
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,460
You know,

329
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,540
you look at the way he,

330
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:08,720
uh,

331
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,770
beat up Kyle Kingsbury.

332
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:10,610
That was a scary guy.

333
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:11,310
Damn fight.

334
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,920
The Kyle Kingsbury fight was scary.

335
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,500
He just came out and he shows
you what the fuck he can do.

336
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,000
What you're like,

337
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:17,300
whoa.

338
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,691
And you know,

339
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:21,110
the Kyle Kingsbury who's a very
good athlete and a really cool guy,

340
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,370
wasn't at the best of the best.

341
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:23,330
He wasn't at that level.

342
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:23,780
You know,

343
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,740
he was dominated by,

344
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,574
um,

345
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,290
um,

346
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:26,990
uh,

347
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,760
Pat Cummings had come into play recently.

348
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,390
Recently.

349
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,010
Yeah.

350
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,840
So it's,

351
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,460
you know,

352
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,380
there's levels and then,

353
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,890
you know,

354
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,020
Rumble Johnson as bad times at one 70.

355
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,380
But you got to think that a lot of that
had to do with him starving himself.

356
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:38,990
Sure.

357
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,090
And when you're looking at
him as a light heavyweight,

358
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,051
you know,

359
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:46,550
the way he fucking destroyed Nogueira I
was just like Jesus and then taken out

360
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,110
Gustafson like that in the first round.

361
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,490
Well that although I wonder,

362
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,960
because he did Headbutt Gusta
Synagis and fell to his knees.

363
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,710
Roof slate looks like
you're wonder at that point.

364
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,970
Cause I,

365
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,820
I mean Gustin is still killer and I don't,

366
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,330
I don't know,

367
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,890
we just didn't get a
chance to really see it,

368
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:02,261
you know?

369
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah,

370
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
definitely a factor.

371
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,710
But she'll be effective for both men.

372
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,010
Right?

373
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,220
I mean they're hitting
each other with their head,

374
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,510
but I feel like every time John has a,

375
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,450
a new opponent,

376
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,900
it's like,

377
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,051
oh,

378
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,740
this is it.

379
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,050
This is the one looking at DC.

380
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,270
I thought D I legitimately thought DC
was probably going to beat them in a

381
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,560
decision three to two.

382
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:16,800
That's,

383
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,900
I thought he had the perfect setup,

384
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,120
the perfect pedigree to beat Jon Jones.

385
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,230
And then,

386
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,620
I mean,

387
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,730
John Destroy Him,

388
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,930
took him up by the hips.

389
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,491
It really wasn't,

390
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,450
that really wasn't that close of a fight.

391
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,680
So then now it's like,

392
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,070
oh,

393
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,040
here's Anthony Johnson who,

394
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,990
and I love Anthony,

395
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,830
he's a monster.

396
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,470
But I feel like we go through
this every time until,

397
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,180
until he fights cane.

398
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,930
I think once he,

399
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,490
once he does and that's going to happen.

400
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,800
I bet when he fights cane
now we're talking well,

401
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,540
I think Kane has to stay healthy,

402
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:42,901
you know?

403
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:43,770
I mean that's one of the,

404
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:44,760
I think he beats Cain.

405
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,733
He wow.

406
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,460
He might.

407
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,800
I do.

408
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,580
You never know man.

409
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,060
Look,

410
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,893
he looked,

411
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,270
he might very well beat Johnson.

412
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,590
It might be very well,

413
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,131
one of those things,

414
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,470
you look back on it in
hindsight and you said,

415
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:55,771
well,

416
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,161
you know,

417
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:56,994
maybe I should have,

418
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,480
you know,

419
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,600
figured that this could have happened or
that John would have an advantage here.

420
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,590
But Dude,

421
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:05,700
when I watched that too late mid Sandhya
people always tell hardest hitter at

422
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:09,690
two oh five by Shane happen
when that guy's hitting you.

423
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,230
That's,

424
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,410
I don't think that Anthony Rome,

425
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,060
that Jon Jones is here on a peep
out of him wrestling wise though.

426
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,100
I think Jon Jones will dominate.

427
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:17,970
I mean if he grabs him,

428
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:18,541
hold on him,

429
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,310
he seems to just shut the fuck up.

430
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,750
Did you see him fight Phil Davis?

431
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,110
Yeah,

432
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,380
Phil.

433
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,430
He the sprawls.

434
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:26,030
He hit Phil Davis with ferocious spa.

435
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,190
Did you see what he does
with different Time Olympian?

436
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,190
Phil Davis is a very high
level restaurant close to it.

437
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,320
Not not like Dan Courtenay,

438
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,600
Dan [inaudible] Olympian and that's true.

439
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:38,551
Sure.

440
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,600
But Jones literally,

441
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,090
I couldn't believe he
picked him up by the hips.

442
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:42,991
Boom,

443
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:43,740
dumped him,

444
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,880
dumped him again just out
wrestled them and and me.

445
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:47,580
I said,

446
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,460
this guy is so much bigger than
you think when he's hanging on you,

447
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,870
whether it's leverage or whatever.

448
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:55,980
And Daniel Cormier is a guy who picks up
heavy weights and throws them on their

449
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:56,791
head like a,

450
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,480
what's his name?

451
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,530
Josh Barnett.

452
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,300
No doubt.

453
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,860
I don't know if you guys look call me.

454
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,220
It wasn't a good matchup for him.

455
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,730
John figured it out right away that he
could take them down once he took him

456
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,790
down the first round.

457
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,160
So was like,

458
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,981
oh yeah,

459
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,260
once that happened that
you're like holy shit.

460
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,530
Yeah that's a,

461
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,410
that's a damn wake up
all anybody who was it,

462
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:16,590
who knew a lot about wrestling said is
there's no question that Jones is going

463
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,210
to be on his back when
Courtenay grabs him.

464
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,800
See what you know what,

465
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,150
when you got a guy who's super fucking
talented and his big derailment is a

466
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:24,930
family.

467
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,763
I mean that's what happened.

468
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,230
He had a kid and then he,

469
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:29,580
we got out of competitive wrestling
cause he had to feed his family.

470
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,250
But if he had gone on the wheat,

471
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,630
what I'm seeing out of this guy,

472
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:34,980
like wrestling with people,

473
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,641
but he would've been,

474
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,230
he was a dare go national champ.

475
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,570
Juco,

476
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,400
national champions.

477
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,233
Not punk man.

478
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,750
And no,

479
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,231
not at all.

480
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,580
What does Juco actually college,

481
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,900
the junior college national champion.

482
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,270
But I think like he would have given feet.

483
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,010
People fits as a,

484
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:47,880
as a wrestler.

485
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,151
I mean,

486
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,850
anybody in the world who
would have given them fit,

487
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,980
I think it would have all been
dedicated or like how much,

488
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,290
how much time you dedicated to
it and how much energy he did.

489
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,260
But if he was in a situation where he
could train 100% of the enough to support

490
00:11:59,261 --> 00:11:59,980
his family,

491
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,800
he would have been all I call
seriously world class amateur wrestler,

492
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,890
if not the best slush in his weight class.

493
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,150
You look at what he's doing in the UFC,

494
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,860
if he decided to focus on wrestling,

495
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,723
you'd be the best.

496
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,590
He's a fucking with this mentality,

497
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:11,800
man.

498
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,640
And then you know,

499
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,130
you look at what Johnson has been
able to do when he hits people.

500
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,880
Man,

501
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,050
John doesn't do that.

502
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,900
There's a difference between
the way John Hits people.

503
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,281
John,

504
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,310
it fucks people up.

505
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:21,911
Make no mistake,

506
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:22,151
John.

507
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,230
Spot tougher guys though.

508
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,093
Fuck yeah.

509
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,971
Hundred percent.

510
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:25,390
Yes,

511
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,571
he's,

512
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,560
John's fought everybody.

513
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:26,840
John,

514
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,670
John,

515
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,840
John fights a little nog.

516
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,220
It's not going to be pretty.

517
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,461
No,

518
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,300
it'd be ugly as fuck.

519
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,170
Especially now.

520
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,210
He'll be so confident coming into it now.

521
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:34,991
But you know,

522
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,920
if you fought them back
when no Garrett gave,

523
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,033
um,

524
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,470
uh,

525
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,340
like let's think about like his
best performance in the octagon.

526
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,570
Uh,

527
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,450
Brill's Michael's Brill's shod.

528
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,590
Rashad was a good one.

529
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,740
Rashad was a good one because he shut
him down with his boxing and Rashad was

530
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,210
tentative like afraid to commit.

531
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,350
Like people don't realize like no little
nod was a like an actual champion in

532
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,500
Brazil and it's like really couldn't
box both of them killed as an amateur

533
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,240
boxer.

534
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,610
Yeah.

535
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,680
He medaled in like the Pan Am
games or something like that.

536
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,580
Now he's legit,

537
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,820
super legit bus rumble at that stage,

538
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:11,110
like rumbles coming up little nog or is
good at an older in the dressing room

539
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,440
while a little nog was warm up cause I
was corn and Pat Cummings against the

540
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:15,274
king's Bay.

541
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,600
And uh,

542
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,051
what was that?

543
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:17,621
Sacramento,

544
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:19,060
I think San Francisco.

545
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,720
Anyways,

546
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,553
um,

547
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,390
little nog was warming up and he,

548
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:23,141
I'm telling you man,

549
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:23,381
I was like,

550
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:23,920
oh no,

551
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,630
someone should stop them
from going out there.

552
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,380
He could,

553
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,490
he couldn't even hit the mitts.

554
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,080
You can hit the Mitzi so stiff.

555
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,800
He just sat back until Burt said
his name and then he started going.

556
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,581
A lot of those guys,

557
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,990
by the time they get to a certain age,

558
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,560
they've,

559
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,780
their body's gone through so much trauma,

560
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,460
like so much physical trauma,

561
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,480
so much damage.

562
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,291
Somebody kicks,

563
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,700
somebody punches somebody take downs.

564
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,370
It was just Mike Rowe and
they're not that aware.

565
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,760
No.

566
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,850
Him and his brother and not
that old they had for Roche,

567
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:53,080
especially his brother had for Rucius
was brother that fight with Bob Sapp.

568
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,710
Whoa.

569
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,640
Oh my God.

570
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,241
There's never the same.

571
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:55,811
After that fight,

572
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,290
his neck was always fine.

573
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,690
If you watch that fight,

574
00:13:58,691 --> 00:13:59,590
it's hard to believe.

575
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,490
He got through that.

576
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,710
He got pile drive by 300 plus pound
Gyri hundred 75 super athlete.

577
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,150
They offered him the fight again.

578
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,571
He was like,

579
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:07,991
no,

580
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,820
I beat him and he was like,

581
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,440
it doesn't make sense to never
fight together that big again.

582
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,271
Break his back,

583
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:13,521
man.

584
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,680
He could have broken his back.

585
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,161
Dude,

586
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,570
he piled drived him.

587
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,040
I mean,

588
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,360
and just an all natural
Bob Sapp just fresh off

589
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,390
dude.

590
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,890
You're going to get us written up.

591
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:28,000
And my main magazines,

592
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:28,271
again,

593
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:32,620
this would be printing shop
says Bob Sapp was on steroids.

594
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,710
I should probably address this fader or
thing cause people keep bringing it up

595
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,400
because we,

596
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,233
first of all,

597
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,780
um,

598
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,400
I think it's weird that we have to,

599
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,760
every time we have a podcast
and we just talk shit,

600
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
it becomes like stories getting trouble.

601
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:48,731
Yeah.

602
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:50,110
It's Larry us their stories.

603
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,070
And one of them was that I,

604
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,970
that it was probably,

605
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,040
it

606
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,400
was highly possible they'd fade or
could have been on performance enhancing

607
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,234
drugs.

608
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm not saying that because he was
cheating and everybody else wasn't.

609
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,861
And when I say that,

610
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:04,610
I'm just saying it only
based on the environment that
that guy was competing in.

611
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,440
Where do you look to the contract?

612
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:09,020
It said specifically we
do not test for steroids.

613
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,000
Does that mean in anybody's on steroids?

614
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,441
No,

615
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:12,500
it absolutely doesn't mean it.

616
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,650
But that doesn't mean
the possibility is there.

617
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,521
The positive,

618
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,280
if it comes out and he says,

619
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,390
I never took steroids.

620
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,410
This is a fact.

621
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,170
I have no reason to disbelieve him.

622
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,390
But we look at the environment that
that guy was competing in and there's no

623
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,230
doubt about it.

624
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,340
We're just brought up Bob Sapp.

625
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,660
He's the major one.

626
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,380
He's the number one
major one where there's,

627
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:34,520
there's the best evidence you ever
need that no one's testing anybody.

628
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,120
Come on you gotta Guy
hold is not even a human.

629
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,010
Three 75 three 75 with ABS,

630
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,520
6% body fat or something like that.

631
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,370
[inaudible] Jack Beat,

632
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,610
Ernesto hoost outweigh one of the
greatest kickboxers of all times.

633
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,560
Uppercuts junkie in the armed.

634
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,090
Him just smashing with muscle
and just test and d ball.

635
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,370
Whatever the fuck else was is fine.

636
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,540
But it's like you look at,

637
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,760
there was a lot of guys who
were doing stuff back then.

638
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,230
If you talk to the people that competed,

639
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,580
even people that are clean,

640
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:02,121
they'll tell you,

641
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:02,331
man,

642
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:05,600
I saw dudes that I know for
a fact we're doing shit.

643
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:07,340
I know a good percentage of went to it.

644
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,510
It might not have been fader.

645
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,940
It's not crazy to assume it's not crazy.

646
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:12,700
It's not ridiculous to assume that second.

647
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,310
So,

648
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,143
first of all,

649
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,080
the big important point,

650
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:15,914
it wasn't even cheating.

651
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,690
It's only cheating by our laws.

652
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,890
We're talking calling,

653
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,270
cheating by United States laws.

654
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,250
They didn't even have
it in their contract.

655
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,450
Like it's said in the contract.

656
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,530
We're not going to test for stories.

657
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,131
They're telling you.

658
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:25,970
It's basically says,

659
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:26,390
yeah.

660
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,630
So it's like if the look,

661
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,770
let's put it in perspective with
this whole Tour de France thing,

662
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,210
the big argument bill burr had a hilarious
segment on Conan talking about it is

663
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,460
like everybody was on juice
that it's a dirty sport.

664
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,350
The are psychopath beat your psychopaths,

665
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,930
but you're out where everyone's
cheating and he's right.

666
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,793
He's right.

667
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,180
That's the,

668
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,820
that's what if everyone just
admitted what they were doing,

669
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,090
then we would just be able to deal with
that in the fact that well to do that

670
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,810
bike race,

671
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,610
you need to have all
this shit in your system.

672
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,040
That's the only way these guys could do.

673
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,370
We can tell kids that don't feel
inadequate next to Mr this fuck guy.

674
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,060
He's got scientists cause this guy's
got EPO in his veins and we should tell

675
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:04,160
people this is the only way
they can do this and compete,

676
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:04,641
you know.

677
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:08,600
But we make sure that their levels don't
get above a safe amount and then you

678
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,680
know you let them compete that way.

679
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,030
There's a lot of people
that feel like that.

680
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,710
Like if you have like such a dirty sport.

681
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,720
Whereas like when he had to give his,

682
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,940
when Armstrong had to give a shit back
and they should go back 15 that was like

683
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,671
15 plays.

684
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,380
The guy who didn't test
positive for something.

685
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,640
So it's basically a level
playing field level.

686
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,123
They're all cheating.

687
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,810
It's just who's better
at hiding the cheating?

688
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,020
Right.

689
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,400
Who's got a better team behind them?

690
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,130
I don't think that's necessarily
the case with fighting.

691
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,761
Like I've said,

692
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,070
I would bet $1 million at
Bj Penn never took shit.

693
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,300
I bet a million degree.

694
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,253
He's the guy.

695
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,491
A lot of other guys,

696
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,680
I think if they got injured
like this is Anderson's thing.

697
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,800
He's saying that he took it because he
was injured and he was trying to heal is

698
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:46,010
like he still can't do
it because it's illegal.

699
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,983
Like you can't,

700
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,800
it's like it's not in
the rules because they,

701
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,381
first of all,

702
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,850
they've shown that if you do take it,

703
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,950
I believe that you're only
taking it to heal your leg.

704
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,813
Don't get me wrong.

705
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,360
But if you allow people
that sort of loophole,

706
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,250
there's certain stores
that you can take that in,

707
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,410
they alter your body permanently.

708
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,210
Like you're going to take steroids that
they've done tests on these and it might

709
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,750
be a small amount and that small amount
might be not even close to like the

710
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,460
advantage that someone like has John,

711
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,130
like John Jones has over
someone like Eddie Brill.

712
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,701
You know what I mean?

713
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,000
Like just insane genetics
in Saimaa athleticism.

714
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,330
Like even if you do take steroids
and you keep a little bit of a bitch,

715
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,750
still not as cheesy,

716
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,990
actually stronger than you,

717
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:27,180
like your Foxville with nothing,

718
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,720
with no,

719
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,680
with no drugs,

720
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:29,660
he's way stronger than you,

721
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,503
so you're fucked.

722
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,910
But you just can't let that,

723
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,030
he can't let that be something that
everybody does because it's not because

724
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,010
you'd have hit no cause you'd get into
what you'd have to define what an injury

725
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:41,131
is.

726
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,230
Now suddenly people
would all have injuries.

727
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,981
Well not only that,

728
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:47,480
people would do in the off season and put
on crazy Strang and Americans will use

729
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:48,314
some of it.

730
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,900
Good.

731
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,920
Hate the sport.

732
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,321
If they knew it,

733
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:51,240
everyone was cheating.

734
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:51,840
Exactly.

735
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,980
Related to the Gills.

736
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,940
It's just not pure.

737
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,080
People want assume they're,

738
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,070
they're heroes and the guys they see
on TV or gals or supplement free.

739
00:18:59,370 --> 00:18:59,701
Yeah.

740
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:03,390
And if we got to a point where
everyone is like doing like it's all,

741
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:04,380
obviously they do it.

742
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:04,771
What do you like?

743
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,030
It's listed in their stats.

744
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,451
You know,

745
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:10,340
he takes 15 milliliters of
this fucking Tamil goal.

746
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,150
I oxy Maca fate and he tells like the
whole stack that he's on and it's all

747
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:16,620
about getting the right stack.

748
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,800
Let me in a really nice,

749
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,260
I'm really important for it take.

750
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,330
But it raises a very important question,

751
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:26,331
which is as we are pushing way beyond
our biology and it's becoming exponential

752
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,180
and so you're going to
have high school kids,

753
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,190
like Ray Kurzweil says,

754
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:33,180
who can inject themselves with tiny
little robots that that that like the red

755
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,400
blood cells that basically
oxygenate your blood,

756
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,910
they can sprint for an hour.

757
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:36,971
Oh,

758
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:41,971
but Brian told me the other day that
technology to create a bulletproof flying

759
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:42,730
drag.

760
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,330
I was just saying there's
a saying synthetic biology,

761
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,380
they probably all fun.

762
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,980
But I mean we're probably a hundred
years away from them being able to create

763
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:50,814
organisms.

764
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,570
Craig venter says 25 years,

765
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,290
but the point is just smarter than me,

766
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,124
so I'll go with that guy.

767
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,370
The point is that you're getting
to a point where you can,

768
00:19:59,580 --> 00:19:59,971
where,

769
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:04,700
where biology and technology
is is just getting to it.

770
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,970
How do you deny it?

771
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,091
You're going to gene doping,

772
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:07,561
do all this stuff.

773
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:08,090
So then what,

774
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,800
what does that mean when you're
competing against another guy?

775
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,690
Is it actually like race cars?

776
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,060
Race cars have a whole team of mechanics,

777
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,931
but work on that,

778
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:16,381
Angela,

779
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,460
it's like race cars.

780
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:21,330
You have a very specific amount of
cubic inches you're allowed to have.

781
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,193
That's true.

782
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,650
Everything is a limit
to where they run into.

783
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,480
So it's all of the skill of the driver.

784
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:27,780
Huh?

785
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,150
Like the sophistication of the
team that puts it together.

786
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,710
I mean they have their justice suspension,

787
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,150
calibrate the dampers,

788
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,120
make sure that everything's correct as
far as the weight balance and all this

789
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:36,720
other jazz.

790
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
And they build a solid engine.

791
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,840
But the engine has to be like,

792
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:40,051
you know,

793
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:40,501
whatever it is,

794
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,610
500 horsepower,

795
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,190
you'd have to have a,

796
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,020
you can't.

797
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,310
And here's a little news flash.

798
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,280
If every girl in the division
at one 35 took steroids,

799
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,080
they're still not beating Rhonda.

800
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,540
You could be juice to the gills
and you're not beating Rhonda,

801
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,270
you guys at two oh five
juice all you want.

802
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,470
You're not beating John Jones.

803
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,700
He's just not going to happen now.

804
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,061
Right?

805
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:58,890
Isn't that strange?

806
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,220
This is like there's guys that,

807
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,330
and by the way,

808
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,640
that might've been fade
or it's very possible,

809
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,840
but when I say this,

810
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:05,674
I say this,

811
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,530
I have like a few all
time favorite fighters.

812
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,460
Brendan Schaub of course,

813
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,294
cause he's my friend.

814
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,630
Um,

815
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,101
you didn't,

816
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,210
you never saw me do taekwondo.

817
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,571
All right.

818
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:14,404
I Dunno.

819
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,250
National Video.

820
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,190
I guess we'll get to the but,

821
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,860
but the,

822
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,990
the top two,

823
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,130
like there's maybe like
three or four like that.

824
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,460
They're interchangeable and one of them's
Vandelay just cause every fight was

825
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,270
chaos.

826
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,630
I would job be a Vandelay
Silva Fan to the day I die.

827
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,200
You Aco was a maniac in pride when he
fought rampage and he's standing in front

828
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,350
of them,

829
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,790
like bobbing his head back and forth.

830
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,340
A fucking leave time,

831
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,780
do this fucking thing.

832
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,881
The gloves do.

833
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:49,690
I can very clearly remember Eddie
Bravo and I sitting in my living room,

834
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,160
cross legged on the couch,

835
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:52,090
hands sweaty.

836
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,250
When Vandelay was about to fight rampage,

837
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,113
it was a

838
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,480
couple of balls.

839
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,313
Investors.

840
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,321
God Damn,

841
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,100
he was good.

842
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,690
God Damn,

843
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,630
he was chaotic.

844
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,320
He was just,

845
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,610
he was just so ferocious.

846
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:05,620
So he'll always have a
special place in my heart.

847
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,450
But then when it comes to technicians,

848
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,100
there's two guys that are interchangeable.

849
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,280
It's Anderson and fader.

850
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,770
Those are my two favorite techniques.

851
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,200
Anderson fell out of my top
because of the steroids.

852
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,850
I give him a break.

853
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
You give them a break.

854
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,840
I give him a break on
his past performances.

855
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,980
I give him a break on the spectacular
knockouts like the Vitor Belfort front

856
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:26,170
kick to the face choking
out Dan Henderson.

857
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:27,670
When Dan was dropping bombs out,

858
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:28,504
people,

859
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,130
I give him a give him a break,

860
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,521
you know,

861
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,690
before it's Chin went before the,

862
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:33,491
the Weidman fight.

863
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:34,540
When Weidman caught him,

864
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,340
Weidman fucking hurt him too.

865
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,280
He hurt him bad and if you
watched that second fight,

866
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:43,150
it just does not look like he takes
his same punch that he did in the first

867
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:43,590
fight.

868
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,880
And during the clinch she gets clipped
and he goes down and I looked at him,

869
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:47,051
I go,

870
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:47,680
man,

871
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,760
here's a guy is struggling.

872
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,090
Like this is the end of the car.

873
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,070
Like he's 39 yeah,

874
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:51,671
this is what,

875
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,900
this is how we look at athletes.

876
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,710
You know what I mean?

877
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,660
There's the reality of if
you're going to be natural,

878
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:56,830
it is the reality of athletes.

879
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,030
They get to a certain point,

880
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,430
especially after a few knockouts
and they're 39 years old.

881
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,260
Like that's what you're looking at man.

882
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,090
You're looking at the,

883
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,050
the deterioration of the master.

884
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,920
And at one point in time Anderson was
the fucking master to say anything else

885
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:09,754
the best.

886
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,890
He's the best as far as everybody,

887
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,240
as far as performances.

888
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,340
I look at the way he put guys away too,

889
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:16,570
like the Stephan Bonner fight.

890
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,310
Like Jesus fucking Christ.

891
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,960
He did it like he's a magician.

892
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,551
He,

893
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:23,260
he's standing with his back
up against the wake him over,

894
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:26,350
waved him over and then when
he decides it's time to attack,

895
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,240
crushes him with one knee.

896
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,710
Flexis confidence.

897
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:30,790
You have to have to do that.

898
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,860
Huge to Donna's six
for 10 35 was on juice.

899
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:36,720
Water tested.

900
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,250
Positive.

901
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,651
Positive.

902
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:37,750
Yeah.

903
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,030
I mean obviously the bond
is not the best example.

904
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:40,211
I mean,

905
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,760
he's the best fighter that uh,

906
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,160
Andrew,

907
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,921
no disrespect,

908
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,500
but he's not the best
fire that Anderson's face.

909
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,160
But you at what he did to rich Franklin,

910
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:46,790
rich Franklin said,

911
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,650
tough motherfucker,

912
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,200
man.

913
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,610
Look at rich Franklin with chocolate dot.

914
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,510
How about Forrest Griffin?

915
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,320
Right?

916
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,250
But do you think the rich Franklin that
fought chuck Liddell was better than the

917
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:56,010
rich Franklin fight?

918
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,540
Anderson?

919
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,560
Cause I don't know.

920
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,080
There's no,

921
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,370
no.

922
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,560
So the Anderson that fought rich Franklin,

923
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,830
he fought the best rich Franklin
ever and just ran through,

924
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,660
stood in front of them,

925
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:09,260
dropped his hands and let him throw
kicks Adam and just died a fucking

926
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,540
championship fight in a
world championship fight.

927
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,170
His hands are down,

928
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,260
the guy's throwing kicks in his head and
he's bobbing and weaving like it's not

929
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:15,860
even happening.

930
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,470
So you got the Anderson over Fado
I go out to Anderson overall.

931
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,420
I have annual number one always.

932
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,081
He's your favorite.

933
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,490
He's my number one Anderson's.

934
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,510
My favorite has to be.

935
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,683
He's one.

936
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,643
Who's your favorite?

937
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:25,821
Well,

938
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,480
this is just my,

939
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,081
my opinion,

940
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,270
this is my opinion and in that mix,

941
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,370
in that mix of,

942
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:34,010
of those great guys is Anderson and
in Fader I say Anderson overall,

943
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:38,840
but I had some fantastic
enjoyment watching fade or fights.

944
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,470
What I'm saying and what I said about
it being possible that someone might've

945
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,660
done performance enhancing drugs.

946
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,740
It's not an accusation.

947
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,520
I'm just highlighting the reality of
the environment that they were competing

948
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:49,670
it.

949
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,503
That's it.

950
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,300
As far as my respect for him
as an athlete and as a fighter,

951
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:54,140
I'm a huge,

952
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,220
huge fan of that guy.

953
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,570
I've always been a huge fan.

954
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,600
There's a video of me on youtube with
that huge UFC hated because I was talking

955
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:03,410
about what a bad motherfucker he is.

956
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,210
This is what he's fighting
for the other organization.

957
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,750
It's a highlight video of me just ranting
about what a bad motherfucker he is

958
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,610
like I've always thought he was amazing.

959
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,270
Everyone's top.

960
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,640
I have to be honest.

961
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,740
I'm honest about everything
and even if it's,

962
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,890
if it could be possibly
perceived to be disrespectful,

963
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,060
it's not my intention.

964
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,130
My intention is to look at the reality.

965
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:24,860
I don't know whether or not someone
took a performance enhancing drug.

966
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:25,694
I don't know.

967
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,810
I have no idea.

968
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:28,130
I could take a wild guess,

969
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,820
but it's all bullshit unless I see it or
unless we know for sure because someone

970
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,280
tested positive traps are
ridiculously large as well.

971
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,140
Even then build as soon
that though it's not crazy.

972
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,490
No one should write a story,

973
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,430
but you exactly,

974
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,090
exactly.

975
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,140
It's like assuming I'm the only
one that tans in him on his shit.

976
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,973
You guys are white.

977
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,830
It's not ridiculous to assume I tan.

978
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,970
You Know Dimitri?

979
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,390
Yeah,

980
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,590
Dimitris Ukrainian.

981
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:51,830
Yep.

982
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,380
And he's built like a brick fucking shit.

983
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,040
This dude and I had been
friends 15 we competed together.

984
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,300
We were in the same taekwondo team.

985
00:25:59,301 --> 00:25:59,601
We try.

986
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,434
He was the heavyweight.

987
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,581
I spotted that dude.

988
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:02,240
All I know.

989
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,490
Brian,

990
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,320
you're on the same circuit.

991
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,800
I didn't,

992
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,491
I couldn't actually,

993
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:08,090
I'm what I like missed a
national tournament ones
cause he kicked my Shin and

994
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,310
snapped my fucking not the Tibia.

995
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:10,641
The fit,

996
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:11,810
which is the fibular that Timmy.

997
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,860
Timmy is the fat one.

998
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:13,640
The fibula,

999
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,490
the painful ones.

1000
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,261
He's up.

1001
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:15,911
My point is,

1002
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:19,670
is a stone that mother
fucker never did anything.

1003
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,870
I know he never did anything.

1004
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:21,704
We're friends,

1005
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,180
we're friends back when he's competing.

1006
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,640
I mean they didn't test anybody back then.

1007
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:28,400
Like they tested you if you've got to
the Olympics and taekwondo would know if

1008
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,140
he was on some though.

1009
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,200
He wasn't on Shit.

1010
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,370
I know he wasn't on Shit.

1011
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,993
Juicy.

1012
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,080
Can't do that and I wish the public could,

1013
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,450
could meet certain
athletes where it's like,

1014
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,070
no,

1015
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,510
these people are actually
born different than you.

1016
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,070
You meet Tim Tebow,

1017
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,420
you see Tim and it's just like he,

1018
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,671
he,

1019
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,180
he won't take protein powder
is worried about Ronda Rousey.

1020
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:49,014
You hangout with Rhonda?

1021
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,590
No,

1022
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,880
she does nothing.

1023
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,190
And she's just built different than us.

1024
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,090
He's just a freak.

1025
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,710
Brock was at the UFC this weekend and I
shook his hands and he picked me up in

1026
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:00,120
the air with a handshake.

1027
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,530
What do you mean I'm not bullshitting?

1028
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,380
Dude picked me up in the air
with a fucking handshake.

1029
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:04,861
I go,

1030
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,850
what's up big man.

1031
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,730
I clapped hands with
him and all of a sudden,

1032
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,340
C'mon Dude,

1033
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:12,180
I'm not fucking around.

1034
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,190
He's a monster.

1035
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,551
I mean,

1036
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,020
he kind of touched me with his
left hand while he picked me up.

1037
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,140
That was just him.

1038
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:20,450
Sack of potato industry.

1039
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,200
Giant has giant his,

1040
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,640
my hand disappeared.

1041
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,780
It was like a laptop.

1042
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:25,051
It was like,

1043
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:25,141
oh,

1044
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:25,711
shaking hands.

1045
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,230
A little shame.

1046
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,490
Carlin who picked me up
and started to squeeze me.

1047
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,450
You were there and I was like,

1048
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,860
oh,

1049
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,370
it's happening.

1050
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:31,570
He,

1051
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,130
that's,

1052
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,120
I just hear him night year,

1053
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,340
that's 20% bro to Shay's
squeeze my body and Shane,

1054
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,360
we'd be on his boat,

1055
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,320
his hands so big.

1056
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,150
We'd be on his boat and I'd be like,

1057
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,310
Hey Shane and the other berries,

1058
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,860
like I got one brother appeals handbag.

1059
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,771
I like,

1060
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:47,910
Damn Bro,

1061
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,410
can't fuck with doc kind of genetics.

1062
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,340
You can't fuck with that kind of genetics
are just too big and I wish people

1063
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,640
could hang around with athletes
of this caliber gets like,

1064
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,241
no,

1065
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,140
I'm telling you,

1066
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,310
they're just built different.

1067
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,870
No matter what you ever do,

1068
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,530
you're never going to be on the sanctuary
gain equal Mike Tyson in his prime.

1069
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,970
You mean just get the fuck outta here.

1070
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,440
He didn't even do shit and all he was
doing with working out who's getting up.

1071
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,330
I run at five 30 in the
morning because it's dark.

1072
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:18,270
I don't know what the film that my
opponent feel sleeping and that gives me

1073
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:19,230
extra strength.

1074
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,750
I feel confident and just fucking
running just to just fucking diesel.

1075
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,930
Diesel's square headed,

1076
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:29,580
destroying machine,

1077
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,091
credible,

1078
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:30,871
fast twitch,

1079
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,950
muscle fiber,

1080
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:32,550
an anchor,

1081
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,350
and finally in his life he's become
special after years of neglect and that

1082
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:38,940
special talent is knocking.

1083
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:41,760
Motherfuckers out was a
hundred mil in the bank.

1084
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,360
And can you imagine him in his heyday he
had 400 million at one point then loss

1085
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,070
at all.

1086
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,720
Why don't think y'all
had it all at one point?

1087
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:49,280
No,

1088
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,370
we had 400 million,

1089
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:53,280
but I think that's like it's total
that he pissed away over his life.

1090
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,540
Oh yeah.

1091
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:54,880
Yeah.

1092
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,100
Hey,

1093
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,520
how he had tigers.

1094
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,610
Charlie Murphy was on my podcast
and told the story about Mike Tyson.

1095
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,530
Fucking tiger.

1096
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,790
Just a video of it.

1097
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,930
Pull the video of it.

1098
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:04,890
Somebody made a video.

1099
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,420
Find out who the video is made by.

1100
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:07,620
Some fan did it.

1101
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:11,760
He did an animation of Mike Tyson
in his fucking tiger got tight.

1102
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:14,340
Charlie Murphy pulls up and no one
wants to get out of the limousine.

1103
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,383
They're all sitting there.

1104
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,433
Tyson's house.

1105
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,680
This is when his brother Eddie
Murphy was fucking gigantic.

1106
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:19,981
You know,

1107
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:20,521
he's still is.

1108
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,800
But when Charlie and people
didn't know Charlie was,

1109
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,060
Charlie was hanging out with his brother,

1110
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,421
who?

1111
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:24,811
His friends,

1112
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:25,351
I'm not close.

1113
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:26,110
They're pretty close.

1114
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,330
Yeah,

1115
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,491
yeah,

1116
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:26,731
yeah.

1117
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:27,480
They're clothes.

1118
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,090
I ran to them just
totally randomly in Maui.

1119
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,070
It was the coolest shit out both of them.

1120
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,580
Yeah.

1121
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,413
I was at the,

1122
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,080
I was at the counter
checking into a hotel and uh,

1123
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,790
his cousin rich was there.

1124
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,151
I was like,

1125
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:39,801
what's up bridge?

1126
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:40,441
What are you doing man?

1127
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:41,470
Cause we went on that together,

1128
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:42,220
the Maxim conduct,

1129
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,700
right?

1130
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,030
He goes,

1131
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,900
Oh shit man,

1132
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:44,231
what's up?

1133
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:45,220
You just Charlie's here.

1134
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:45,641
Eddie's here.

1135
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:45,791
I go,

1136
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,624
no way.

1137
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,620
So I went and hung out
with Charlie and I had,

1138
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,350
I sat down with Eddie Murphy.

1139
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:52,300
I was like sitting down with
Eddie Murphy having lunch.

1140
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,163
Cool Dude.

1141
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,780
Funny,

1142
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,581
Nice Guy,

1143
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:54,911
man.

1144
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:57,250
He's so nice because
Charlie's a standup guy,

1145
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:57,441
right?

1146
00:29:57,441 --> 00:30:00,790
It's Charlie is a fucking
prince of a human being.

1147
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,120
Really.

1148
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,990
He's a gem.

1149
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:02,741
I love that.

1150
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,430
That's good to hear.

1151
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,110
He's such a good dude.

1152
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,130
Like I had,

1153
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,060
I hung out with that dude.

1154
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:10,060
We did 22 shows together and
I liked him more every night.

1155
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,450
He's as just a solid stand up dude.

1156
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:16,330
Charlie Murphy is from those to New York.

1157
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,040
Charlie Murphy,

1158
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,280
a legit martial artists too.

1159
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,820
Oh really?

1160
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,600
Oh yeah.

1161
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,141
Oh yeah.

1162
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:22,030
He's legit black belt in karate.

1163
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,750
Yeah.

1164
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:22,901
Yeah.

1165
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:23,441
He fought in like,

1166
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:25,540
well his dad was a [inaudible]
shit back in the day.

1167
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,090
But he's well immersed in martial arts.

1168
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:31,000
Like you talked to them about martial
arts and he just recently got pretty

1169
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:31,391
popular.

1170
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:31,601
Right?

1171
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:31,751
Cause,

1172
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:32,531
well not recently,

1173
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,200
but because the Dave
Chappelle show was on there,

1174
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,190
but that's where then it's like,

1175
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,611
oh cool.

1176
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:38,540
Charlie Murphy or I think,

1177
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,420
I think his dad was a boxer
and Eddie Murphy Works Out Bay.

1178
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,251
That's he boxes,

1179
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:42,421
you know,

1180
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:43,254
I don't know if he's,

1181
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,930
yeah,

1182
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,763
but his dad was like,

1183
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,120
no,

1184
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,941
I don't think it was a pro,

1185
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:47,320
but I think his dad was pretty close.

1186
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,591
Well,

1187
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:47,891
I don't know,

1188
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:50,340
but I know that Charlie has been
doing martial arts since he was young.

1189
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,060
We had some great conversations about it,

1190
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,230
but just about everything,

1191
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:53,620
man.

1192
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:53,981
He's just,

1193
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:54,430
uh,

1194
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,460
he's just one of those dudes that you
listen to him like you want to hear him

1195
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:57,990
talk.

1196
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,050
He has great stories.

1197
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,430
Could there be anyone bigger than Eddie
Murphy at the time in his Hay Day?

1198
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,830
Eddie Murphy was so big.

1199
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,341
Yeah,

1200
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:07,540
that donkey on,

1201
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,050
what is the Israel trek?

1202
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,830
I think he made the movie made

1203
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,270
rag

1204
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,060
the voice of terrorist.

1205
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,331
No,

1206
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:20,290
he's the Shrek and he's a donkey.

1207
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,420
The donkey where you live in Saudi
Arabia when all this shit was going on.

1208
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,170
I know who he is but no ma'am.

1209
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,180
No,

1210
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,013
hold on.

1211
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,030
The donkey is where he made a ton to me.

1212
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,370
$13 90 hit the brakes real quick.

1213
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,810
One of Eddie Murphy,

1214
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,510
standup comedy specials raw,

1215
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:38,710
which I saw live.

1216
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,720
You saw like you were in the audience.

1217
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,930
I know that's a minor tickets.

1218
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,460
My friend bought him for us.

1219
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:52,750
It was a surprise for her brother's
birthday and it was incredible.

1220
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:57,751
Greg Belasco and his sister Amy
and we went there and I had,

1221
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,370
I was so I was probably,

1222
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:00,611
what,

1223
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:03,430
1819 when it comes out
in his leather suit.

1224
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,090
Oh my God.

1225
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,750
And I,

1226
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,690
these are seminal moments cause you
could see them on the screen too and his

1227
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,790
acting and the things he did was shocking.

1228
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,121
How good.

1229
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,420
He was shocking and they were all going
crazy and he went to one side of the

1230
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,590
room and he put his hand.

1231
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:14,921
It was here.

1232
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:16,570
Then the next is here and I was like,

1233
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,890
well that's the coolest
dude on the planet.

1234
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,320
The idea that I do that I lot in a
small way that I'm a comic is still

1235
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,154
incredible to me.

1236
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,700
Washers highlighted his career's
not trek being the donkey.

1237
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,730
You didn't let me finish what I'm saying.

1238
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,600
They were talking about how
much he made for university.

1239
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,090
Definitely fucked up right man.

1240
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,130
Guys won.

1241
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,500
You won with Shrek guys.

1242
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,720
You don't think he fucked up guys.

1243
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:38,120
Hold on.

1244
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,890
I'm sure he made a lot
of money but guess what?

1245
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,250
It was already rich as fuck
kitty Murphy come on site

1246
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,471
for a while though.

1247
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:47,330
Did listen dude,

1248
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:48,021
settle down.

1249
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:48,771
What is dry spell?

1250
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:51,770
What are you sitting back
counting how much money he had.

1251
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:52,604
He got done.

1252
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,840
He probably counted about a thousand
dollars a day and he got bored after a

1253
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:56,840
while and then he said,

1254
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,021
oh,

1255
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:57,950
let me start doing movies again.

1256
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,360
And he did that movie with Steve Martin.

1257
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,870
Everybody goes,

1258
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,620
Oh shit,

1259
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,720
I forgot Eddie Murphy is one
of the funniest guys ever.

1260
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,203
Ever.

1261
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,290
Brian's like the donkey
and what'd you say,

1262
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,124
Jamie?

1263
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:07,731
Yeah,

1264
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:08,690
doctor Doolittle.

1265
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,080
No,

1266
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,850
the dogs are like little kids' movies.

1267
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:14,590
I got to go back to like trading
places and could know like 48 hours,

1268
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,443
eight hours,

1269
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,630
48 hours is the big Beverly hills cop.

1270
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,550
Three nicknames come on.

1271
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,750
Him and Nick Nolte said,

1272
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,593
Shrek man,

1273
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,310
you didn't let me finish [inaudible] him.

1274
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,273
I was saying,

1275
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,540
he said he effortless.

1276
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:33,370
He made some insane amount of money just
being a donkey and was telling you kind

1277
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:34,280
of 13 million.

1278
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,114
He didn't need it.

1279
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,690
I know it went in a pile somewhere.

1280
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:39,080
Right.

1281
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,250
He doesn't even feel that.

1282
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,150
Have you seen this girl?

1283
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,090
No.

1284
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,110
Have you seen his girls domestic?

1285
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:44,990
I'm over on the planet.

1286
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:45,381
Sure.

1287
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,370
He was still beautiful.

1288
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,830
I saw him at the beach or like,

1289
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,673
it looks great.

1290
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,210
He doesn't look like whatever old he is.

1291
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:50,911
He's older than he is.

1292
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:51,230
Great.

1293
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,100
But I look older than him.

1294
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,810
He is also a Germaphobe.

1295
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:53,991
He,

1296
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,150
he'll use a bar soap once thrown away.

1297
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,490
Rich.

1298
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,780
That's our sneakers.

1299
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,010
Charlie get sneakers.

1300
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,170
W they're in a box before
a show puts him on,

1301
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,460
throws those bitches to that.

1302
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,181
I'm rich.

1303
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,020
I'm gonna wear socks.

1304
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:06,854
One son,

1305
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,923
I don't wear socks.

1306
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Was the video of Charlie at Mike Tyson's
house cause this is how fucking Goddamn

1307
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,440
Funny Charlie Murphy goes.

1308
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,800
I bet he has such good stories.

1309
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:19,870
Jason,

1310
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,820
that Tyson document,

1311
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:21,930
is it just called Tyson?

1312
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,211
You see a man,

1313
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:28,890
it is fucking incredible when
he reflects on parts of his leg.

1314
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,440
Strong man like that.

1315
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,000
You got to realize that
whatever was on it was no joke.

1316
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,720
Yeah,

1317
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,590
it's incredible.

1318
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,500
That's a man.

1319
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,200
One time I went to his house and it was
five or six limos and nobody would get

1320
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,970
out the limo and I said,

1321
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:43,230
how come nobody's getting out the car?

1322
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,030
They said you don't see it.

1323
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,460
Lane standing behind tasteless lane,

1324
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,480
his front yard like hang over starts.

1325
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,500
The only man who's house
I haven't went over.

1326
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,990
There was a lane in the front yard.

1327
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,110
He was on the steps.

1328
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,140
They district heavyweight
belt [inaudible] Kit Kat.

1329
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,680
That's fucking real tasting in the lane.

1330
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,220
A male or female.

1331
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,511
The main,

1332
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,070
the lane in his front yard.

1333
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,330
Loose Shit.

1334
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,770
He was at the end of the yard.

1335
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,180
Oh my God.

1336
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,380
They came out and started
wrestling with him.

1337
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,660
Jog.

1338
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,493
Damn.

1339
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:29,990
He ran.

1340
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,630
So how big was the lion?

1341
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,610
It was big man.

1342
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:33,460
It was

1343
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,420
grabbing him and started tussling them
and all this stuff and everybody was in

1344
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:40,410
the limits to the land.

1345
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,020
Could come up to the limousine and
buster window open and come in here.

1346
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,100
Oh sorry.

1347
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,670
Easy.

1348
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,520
He can just go out and
get a booth and come and

1349
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,080
everybody was in a car.

1350
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,450
You couldn't back out cause
it was all like five limos.

1351
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,590
It's everybody's in the car.

1352
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,390
Her fat thinking it makes
me get me to be eaten.

1353
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,300
He plays with them and he'd put,

1354
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,240
takes him in the back.

1355
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,340
I back out and that was like,

1356
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:03,174
you know what,

1357
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,510
I'm never going to be
around another man in life.

1358
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,380
That's going to do that.

1359
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,873
I'm saying

1360
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,501
that's incredible.

1361
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:13,334
Who is the animation?

1362
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,270
Telepath slane at telepathic void.

1363
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:22,810
That's the the line back in Lima Sla.

1364
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:24,560
I N at,

1365
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,394
what is it again?

1366
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,050
That's the way.

1367
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:26,510
Ah,

1368
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:26,990
ah,

1369
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,840
shit that she could just say,

1370
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,720
just say booth.

1371
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,100
I just want to give these guys credit.

1372
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,880
What does,

1373
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,380
what does it,

1374
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,500
what did it say at the very end there?

1375
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,363
Just want to give the guy,

1376
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,480
cause it's really cool.

1377
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,321
It's funny.

1378
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,160
Animation to telepath void.

1379
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,670
So slain at telepathic void.

1380
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,200
Yep.

1381
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,033
Okay.

1382
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,680
Thanks buddy.

1383
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,513
Thanks for making that.

1384
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,643
But

1385
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,843
I've never,

1386
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,310
I never heard anybody use that expression.

1387
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,310
Elian heavyweight belt.

1388
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,100
Every windmill as the first time.

1389
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,890
I'd never seen something
like this again in my life.

1390
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,730
Imagined seeing him sitting
there with a heavyweight belt.

1391
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,710
Imagine of the experiences Mike Tyson
hand in his hay day and Eddie Murphy and

1392
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,170
his heyday.

1393
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,150
God.

1394
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,031
Yeah.

1395
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:06,870
Excess in Santa Damn.

1396
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,763
Yeah.

1397
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,340
That kind of celebrity
brings out the aphrodisiac.

1398
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,193
Damn.

1399
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,340
Oops.

1400
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,810
There's so many crazy fucking dudes in
this world that have competed in MMA so

1401
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:20,340
many crazy worlds that have fought
so many crazy dudes that have fought.

1402
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,440
And boxing there.

1403
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,300
Their whole life stories.

1404
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,310
If you had to like accumulate the wildness
of like a Roberto Duran Tappia you're

1405
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,220
seeing the Johnny watched the
documentary on Johnny tap.

1406
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Really meet a loca drug
addict fight world champion,

1407
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,551
Aaron Pryor,

1408
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:38,300
same things.

1409
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,133
Pillow.

1410
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,910
So many of these great fighters.

1411
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:41,631
Just crazy,

1412
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:42,860
wild lives.

1413
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:43,880
So much nuts,

1414
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:47,550
chaos and ending sometimes like
Arturo got to getting shot and killed.

1415
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:47,851
Kill it.

1416
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,051
No,

1417
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:48,940
he got strangled.

1418
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,880
It's fucking girl.

1419
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,200
His girl killed them.

1420
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,030
Send them out off in Brazil.

1421
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,170
It was all in Brazil.

1422
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,220
Set them up for the insurance.

1423
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:55,460
Right.

1424
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,830
She apparently he was hit
on the head and choked.

1425
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,300
Yeah,

1426
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,860
and they're saying he did it to himself.

1427
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,650
Come on.

1428
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,130
Yeah,

1429
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,250
it's his family thinks she fucking killed.

1430
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,133
Yeah,

1431
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,100
they got a picture of
her getting out of jail.

1432
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:10,100
She's laughing and smiling like
that's not how you may feel.

1433
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,211
That's if you,

1434
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:12,530
if that is really your husband,

1435
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,030
you miss him and he's gone.

1436
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:14,181
You,

1437
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:14,601
first of all,

1438
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,060
you feel horrible that someone
put you in jail for that.

1439
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,900
When you miss him so much and
killed himself and second of home,

1440
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:20,750
when you come out,

1441
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,470
you don't,

1442
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,670
you're not smiling.

1443
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,540
You're like a celebration for this.

1444
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,460
In his celebration,

1445
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,000
you're still depressed because your
husband is dead because he killed himself

1446
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:31,940
and you were just accused of doing it
and people still suspect you have it.

1447
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,200
You should be depressed.

1448
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,550
You should feel terrible.

1449
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,960
She felt at the whole world is calling
bullshit on you and saying that you

1450
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:38,321
killed him.

1451
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,154
You should be like,

1452
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,420
you should be under pressure.

1453
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,621
I says liquid.

1454
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:42,454
She's under pressure at all.

1455
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,070
I saw statistic today that said in Mexico,

1456
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:46,210
if you commit a murder,

1457
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,600
there's less than 5% chance
that you'll do any jail time.

1458
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,470
Oh,

1459
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,920
it did.

1460
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,481
That's awesome.

1461
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:53,230
Because of how insane is that?

1462
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,040
The people doing the murder are a lot
of times so well connected and you're

1463
00:38:56,041 --> 00:39:00,410
talking about cartel violence now
the cops are involved and everyone.

1464
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,160
So I keep my ass and yeah.

1465
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:03,581
You know what,

1466
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,030
man,

1467
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,410
I have a real,

1468
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,930
real terrible feeling about the way our,

1469
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,440
our worlds connected.

1470
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,370
We'd like these borders of countries
and we won't let people in and we keep

1471
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:17,950
people out like on in some sense,

1472
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,630
I kind of understand what
people are trying to do,

1473
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,420
trying to manage what we
can with our own space.

1474
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,290
But if you're not managing your
fucking next door neighbor,

1475
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,191
if you're not helping,

1476
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:27,371
you know,

1477
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:31,910
like say if you live next to a crazy
broken down trailer and there's some fuck

1478
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,710
and you can't move,

1479
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,251
this is like you're,

1480
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,720
you have a permanent permanent house.

1481
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,530
Yeah.

1482
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,221
This is your neighbor,

1483
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:36,850
man.

1484
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,271
What are you gonna do?

1485
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,104
You're gonna help Matt.

1486
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:38,531
You know,

1487
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:39,820
his kids need some food.

1488
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,770
Maybe it needs a little money for gas.

1489
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:42,051
Like,

1490
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:42,441
yeah,

1491
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:43,720
you're doing a lot better than him.

1492
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,020
Just give him a little every now and then
just to sued this motherfucker's life.

1493
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:52,030
This Mexico's issue is not that Mexico's
the issue though is institutions and

1494
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,740
the integrity of those institutions.

1495
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,540
Professor Cowen add it again.

1496
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,530
It's really true though.

1497
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:56,771
Okay.

1498
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,250
But I was,

1499
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:57,941
I was making a point.

1500
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:58,601
You fuck no,

1501
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,990
but what I was trying
to say is these people,

1502
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:02,540
we should,

1503
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,270
they shouldn't be like another country.

1504
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,230
They're right there.

1505
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,020
They should be people that we consider,

1506
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:08,351
you know,

1507
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,330
to be in a bad situation
and try to help them,

1508
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,550
whether it's help him
politically help him financially,

1509
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,230
but the idea that we're just,

1510
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:15,280
we're separate from them.

1511
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,851
Like there's,

1512
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:19,390
this should be like a lot of emphasis
on trying to fix Mexico and a less

1513
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:21,880
emphasis on fucking with countries that
are on the other side of the planet.

1514
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,031
Well,

1515
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:22,870
you want to fix him.

1516
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,890
You legalize marijuana overall in the
United States because the cartel drug

1517
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:27,251
wars,

1518
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:28,810
what's feeding all this chaos?

1519
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,130
That's part of it.

1520
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,510
That's a big part of it for sure.

1521
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,290
You know,

1522
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:37,240
and there's a big part of it is
probably going to be like a lot of the

1523
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:38,860
corruption that you're saying like Pr.

1524
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,350
Probably a lot of that's going to go
away when things become more and more

1525
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:44,560
transparent because of the Internet is
going to be harder and harder for people

1526
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:45,700
to pull off the kind
of shit they're doing.

1527
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:49,510
Her Russia right now where you see Putin's
number one enemy got just got whacked

1528
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,820
level shot right in public
with his girlfriend.

1529
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,310
So someone just came up here.

1530
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,203
Good.

1531
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,330
He's so much homeboys 55 and he's
got this smoking Russian girlfriend.

1532
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,290
She's 23 he's been with
her for three years.

1533
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,460
Well hello honey.

1534
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,730
He's walking down the
students totally love.

1535
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,750
They're very compatible.

1536
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:21,340
He's walking down the street with her
and fucking car pulls up but just unloads

1537
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:22,174
on him.

1538
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,310
Kills her two or nothing.

1539
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,591
No,

1540
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:24,221
didn't shoot her.

1541
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:26,170
I think more than one guy shot her,

1542
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,840
shot him rather he was the head
and she's just standing there.

1543
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,760
Why they just shoot him
in front of her like bang,

1544
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:30,941
Bang,

1545
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:31,151
Bang.

1546
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:31,930
It's horrifying.

1547
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,950
It's dead and you know,

1548
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,290
and now they just left her,

1549
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,080
let her leave and go back to their
country and they allowed her to think she

1550
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:39,831
cried or she's like,

1551
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,430
Damn.

1552
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,630
She probably was freaked out.

1553
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,050
I mean,

1554
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,190
that's a terrible thing to say.

1555
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,600
It's probably completely freaked out.

1556
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,041
I mean,

1557
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:45,874
as you imagine,

1558
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,010
you're dating this dude and he gets
assassinated because it's probably loved

1559
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:49,101
them.

1560
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:50,300
He was a really charismatic,

1561
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,230
awesome guy from,

1562
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:51,800
you know,

1563
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,880
he was all about reforms.

1564
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:53,750
He was a big critic of the,

1565
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,820
I'm sure that's why she was with them.

1566
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,240
Well,

1567
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,701
back then.

1568
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:56,920
You know,

1569
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,530
who knows what.

1570
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,190
It's cultural.

1571
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,500
Everybody's got a different
way of looking at things.

1572
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,060
Please question girlfriend,

1573
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,870
what are you doing Jimmy?

1574
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,350
She is ready.

1575
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,411
That's what I'm saying.

1576
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:06,921
That's crazy.

1577
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:07,090
He's,

1578
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,060
I've ever seen hit red
hot murdered Putin critic.

1579
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,550
That's the murdered Putin critic.

1580
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,440
Magic.

1581
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,220
Imagine if that's like your
title after you're dead,

1582
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,400
you're the murdered Putin critic because
that's all people are going to remember

1583
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,310
about that cat when we'll
on CNN stuff on American.

1584
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,080
When I was doing the ice bucket challenge,

1585
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,170
I did it out there.

1586
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,930
You're benching 315 pounds,

1587
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:27,380
right?

1588
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,090
You did the ice bucket
challenge while benching count.

1589
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:34,530
Pour the water on me and the only thing
I was concerned with is I said if it

1590
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:35,750
slips like it cut,

1591
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,670
falls off and hits me
in the neck and I die.

1592
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,620
Will it be on CNN will be like,

1593
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,690
guy tries ice bucket challenge dies.

1594
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,520
That's the only thing I was worried about.

1595
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,070
I'm going to die from 315 pounds.

1596
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,710
I want to track and drop it
on Monday to totally drop it.

1597
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,020
Like your arm's going to stop
working well with the water.

1598
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,050
Let's say it slips off yet.

1599
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:54,020
Have you seen that the
USC football player,

1600
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,690
it's not going to be good either way.

1601
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,000
That guy was benching some
stupid amount of weight,

1602
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,200
like 600 plus pounds,

1603
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:00,480
right?

1604
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,313
Wasn't he?

1605
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:01,851
No.

1606
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:02,300
This dude,

1607
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,770
the homeboy had I think maybe 400 300
something and it slipped because the way

1608
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:07,604
they would do it,

1609
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,410
they went wrap their
fingers around the bar.

1610
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,550
They're just like this.

1611
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,460
Oh and his arms failed and it fell.

1612
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,510
It just slipped off.

1613
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,351
No,

1614
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:16,460
and he dives off the bar.

1615
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,091
No,

1616
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:17,370
he was,

1617
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:17,570
uh,

1618
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,340
he's supposed to be a
pretty high draft pick.

1619
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,590
Fell on him off season.

1620
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:23,030
I really can't do anything.

1621
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:24,930
And it was just like Jack the McMahon.

1622
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,510
Freddy can't talk anymore.

1623
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,400
Broke,

1624
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,233
broke his neck,

1625
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,060
trachea,

1626
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,391
everything.

1627
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,080
Can't speak.

1628
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,913
Fuck.

1629
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,820
I've started different one.

1630
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:32,101
I saw it.

1631
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:32,721
It was a white guy.

1632
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:33,680
It was a power lifter dude.

1633
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:33,810
Well,

1634
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,643
I've seen that.

1635
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:35,480
He was so fat.

1636
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,270
I think he's good.

1637
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,103
You know,

1638
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,390
there's an advantage to be in that thick.

1639
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:44,631
Well,

1640
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:47,520
a lot of guys get punched in the belly
when they're fat and the punch and

1641
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:48,440
everyone reaches them.

1642
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,010
I mean,

1643
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,140
they've got fucking five inches of layer.

1644
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,651
It's crazy.

1645
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:53,580
Like if somebody punches
you legitimately Sony,

1646
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,960
like you could fuck somebody up at one
of those taekwondo body protectors on,

1647
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:57,141
you know,

1648
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:59,150
I've seen people get kicked
and go to the hospital,

1649
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,103
to the body.

1650
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,640
But if you're a fat guy,

1651
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,240
you've got to,

1652
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,040
you're walking around through
life with a Jak one body,

1653
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,790
you ain't,

1654
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,760
and Roy Nelson was a liver shot.

1655
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,330
Roy's going laugh.

1656
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,230
You hit him to the body.

1657
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,353
Especially to this,

1658
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,240
the front of the body.

1659
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:13,391
Yeah.

1660
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:13,760
You.

1661
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,240
No one is ever going to
the front roundhouse kicked
that dude in the stomach and

1662
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:17,811
really fuck.

1663
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,850
He's the biggest mystery
fights over him next.

1664
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,050
That's a good fight.

1665
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,160
So that's in Dallas.

1666
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,820
Dallas.

1667
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,111
That's going.

1668
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:23,900
It's a big card.

1669
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,590
That's a good car.

1670
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,371
What are you doing that weekend?

1671
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,360
You're around what?

1672
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:31,361
We kind of March 13th
and 14th I will be in

1673
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,970
Chicago at the Schomburg Improv
and this weekend for you,

1674
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,290
but will I be this weekend?

1675
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,681
I don't know.

1676
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:38,161
You tell me.

1677
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:38,900
Come on man.

1678
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,110
It's just do my advertisement.

1679
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,553
Blacks,

1680
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,121
Brian,

1681
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:44,580
Callan off Broadway comedy.

1682
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:44,941
Oh,

1683
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:45,774
is that the name of the place?

1684
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,171
Thursday,

1685
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:47,010
Friday,

1686
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,100
Saturday.

1687
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,570
I'll songwriting Kentucky.

1688
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,370
Ryan Collins really off.

1689
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,790
It's very off Broadway by the way.

1690
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,930
Talky far a shit away from Broadway.

1691
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,210
Next want to do comedy
on Broadway and less.

1692
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,590
It's only you and you open with
the exact same shit every night.

1693
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,480
Can you do it as a performance piece?

1694
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,120
You'd have to do a
performance was a box of wigs.

1695
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:06,361
Yeah,

1696
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:06,991
it's for them.

1697
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:07,850
It's very important.

1698
00:45:07,851 --> 00:45:10,590
If you're going to do a one
man show performance piece,

1699
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,300
like guys just stand up like this.

1700
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:15,840
There's guys that have made a career
off of doing stand up as a one man show

1701
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,340
like that defending the caveman.

1702
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,430
He's made a fuck load of money also.

1703
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,470
You might be a redneck.

1704
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,810
He did the same thing over and over.

1705
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:25,090
Yeah,

1706
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,000
man show he did that.

1707
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:27,750
Uh,

1708
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,580
you're talking about Larry the cable guy?

1709
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,001
No,

1710
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:30,331
no.

1711
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:31,164
Larry.

1712
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:31,981
Jeff Foxworthy.

1713
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:32,430
Oh,

1714
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,630
you didn't even know you got damn fella.

1715
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,513
He,

1716
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,221
he know.

1717
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:36,690
He was always the Katana by thing.

1718
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:38,570
Wasn't he Foxworthy your show for a while.

1719
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:39,410
He's still a standup.

1720
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:40,400
He was part of the is he still,

1721
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,610
is he still doing stand?

1722
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,240
Fuck yeah.

1723
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,073
Kill News.

1724
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,090
I'll never stop dude.

1725
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:45,301
Well,

1726
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:45,991
fucking Larry,

1727
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:46,824
the cable guy killed.

1728
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,760
Nobody talks about Larry.

1729
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,100
The cable flies under the
weather under the weather.

1730
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,210
Under the radar of the way,

1731
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:51,390
right?

1732
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,020
He's gotta.

1733
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,681
He's gotta fucking,

1734
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:53,341
there's a picture of that.

1735
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:57,780
Josh will showed me Josh Wolfe and
him did a tour together and they did a

1736
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,640
goddamn football arena.

1737
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,720
God and it's him.

1738
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,360
It's him standing on stage.

1739
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,440
Josh Wolfe took a Selfie of him
standing on stage in front of who?

1740
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,240
Hundred thousand fucking people,

1741
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,480
whatever the fuck it is.

1742
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,350
One of those 90% let's say it's 50,000
how many they get one of those hundred

1743
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,180
thousand okay.

1744
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,320
Eh?

1745
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,370
Held for Larry the cable guy.

1746
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,233
What

1747
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:22,791
is it?

1748
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,510
2004 look at that.

1749
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,344
Look what you're looking at.

1750
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,480
That's the crazy.

1751
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,323
When you're looking at,

1752
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,501
that's Nebraska.

1753
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:31,020
That's up to the gas state
and you shit and big red.

1754
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,510
Look at the size of that fucking crowd.

1755
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Is that from a Josh Wolfe's
Twitter feed or something?

1756
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:37,890
Okay,

1757
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,300
dude,

1758
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,133
you get that?

1759
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,620
Look at that dude.

1760
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:41,570
That's a sea of shoes.

1761
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,450
That's an army.

1762
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,320
He could start a war.

1763
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,460
He could take those Larry,

1764
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:47,850
the cable guy a [inaudible]
and send them overseas.

1765
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,470
They can conquer countries.

1766
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,970
One of his crowds.

1767
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,843
I didn't know.

1768
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,920
I gotta be honest.

1769
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,970
I thought he was dead.

1770
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,211
Yo,

1771
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,070
that's the entire dare you.

1772
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,380
That's the entire population of Boulder,

1773
00:46:58,381 --> 00:46:59,214
Colorado.

1774
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,210
Yeah,

1775
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,500
that is for real.

1776
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:02,730
It's 100,000 it,

1777
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:03,300
I don't even know.

1778
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,631
Honestly,

1779
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:03,931
I didn't know.

1780
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:06,240
He's still doing standards
that all the time.

1781
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,190
If he does that all over the country.

1782
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:08,610
Yep.

1783
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,380
He doesn't do that like once a year.

1784
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,340
That's not like the once a year.

1785
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:12,270
Larry the cable guy.

1786
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:12,511
No,

1787
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:14,130
he's dude.

1788
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,300
Do you think he's that redneck
when you just hang out with them?

1789
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:18,421
No,

1790
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,790
it's not even who he is now.

1791
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:20,700
[inaudible] Whitney,

1792
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,410
he's,

1793
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,290
he's a real look.

1794
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,100
Pull the video.

1795
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,670
There's a video of him doing
stand up and you have to watch it.

1796
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:26,011
It's him.

1797
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:26,970
Before he did the Larry,

1798
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:27,571
first of all,

1799
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:28,320
he's a great guy.

1800
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,170
Not dissing him at all.

1801
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,310
He's a super

1802
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:30,910
nice guy.

1803
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,750
Always cool.

1804
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,740
Very down to earth.

1805
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,820
Always has been.

1806
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:37,000
I met him like way back in the day in
Montreal before he was ever famous.

1807
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,380
He was cool as fuck back.

1808
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,290
I've heard that we had some drinks
together and hung out at the comedy works.

1809
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,400
Just very,

1810
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,234
very cool guy.

1811
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,070
He might have a line at his front door,

1812
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,933
but he had a,

1813
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,900
Oh,

1814
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,270
he's killing my game.

1815
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,370
Fuck he's married and having
family and all that shit now.

1816
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,151
But if he wanted to,

1817
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:52,331
yeah,

1818
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,050
he could.

1819
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,190
But my point being is that this guy like
create a character and was doing it on

1820
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:02,110
the radio and then that character became
super successful and that's just like

1821
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:03,550
who people think of him as.

1822
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:03,680
Right,

1823
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:03,781
right,

1824
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:04,120
right.

1825
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,900
But it's a kid like him.

1826
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,590
This is him.

1827
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,510
This is him doing stand up here.

1828
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,580
I'll tell you what you don't mind.

1829
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,930
I just went to visit my grandma.

1830
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,790
She's got Alzheimer's disease
trying to put her in a home.

1831
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:13,780
It's a nice place.

1832
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,680
It's called the pack.

1833
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,183
Wow.

1834
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:22,350
So I've let it just born pure redneck.

1835
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,693
No.

1836
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:24,200
Well,

1837
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,920
it's just like nobody gets
along with their jeans.

1838
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:26,340
You just like,

1839
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,173
see,

1840
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,350
just for that reason,

1841
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,610
not fair to him to play
this whole material.

1842
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,530
So let's just cut it
right there at the point.

1843
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,480
Nobody wants a scene.

1844
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,860
Anybody's material from 1987 I,

1845
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,030
it's still doing comedy today.

1846
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,600
When you started at like two years in
and you're on some terrible TV about when

1847
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:45,160
he's having a bad day and just
has to play a redneck dogs,

1848
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:45,740
a kite.

1849
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,170
Rip The fucking snaps off.

1850
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,370
Gimme this Mollison
that dude's having fun.

1851
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,233
He's having before this happened.

1852
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,860
You don't really get sick
of playing a redneck.

1853
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,490
No,

1854
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:53,150
because he's,

1855
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:53,900
he's farming.

1856
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,200
He's,

1857
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,040
he's a character.

1858
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,570
It's a really funny character.

1859
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:57,140
Super Funny.

1860
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,830
And he's,

1861
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,820
he's got good jokes.

1862
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,290
He's always writing new stuff for it.

1863
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,180
I can't believe he's selling
out in Nebraska stadium.

1864
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,530
He makes over $20 million a year.

1865
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,040
Easy.

1866
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,221
Yeah.

1867
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:08,240
He's a Jack for sure.

1868
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,310
He's gigantic just doing standup and he,

1869
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:10,581
you know,

1870
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,301
he's his own boss.

1871
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:12,200
He does whatever he wants.

1872
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:15,360
The goal now is to get a
line in my front yard that's,

1873
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,800
and you won't go in and on.

1874
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,330
I do go halvsies on w apex.

1875
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,260
I'll have it.

1876
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,550
I'll have it Monday through Friday.

1877
00:49:22,551 --> 00:49:23,151
You get it Saturday,

1878
00:49:23,151 --> 00:49:24,320
Sunday you go around,

1879
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:25,460
the kids got kidnapped.

1880
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,140
Cat's going to have some fucking problems.

1881
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:30,080
It's gonna feel weird and not know where
it's real houses the guy in the New

1882
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,310
York City and have to dens.

1883
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,550
It's true now the dude in New York
City who had a tiger in his apartment,

1884
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,780
he had a crocodile too.

1885
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:36,640
Did he?

1886
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,473
Yeah.

1887
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,170
Alligators and shit.

1888
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,090
Meeting it wholesale.

1889
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,770
What did you think was going to happen?

1890
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,390
We'll go with a best case scenario
with this giant alligator in your town.

1891
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,440
You might want to plan,

1892
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:49,700
you might want to plan for it.

1893
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:50,840
You got to call the cops.

1894
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:51,790
He had to cough carves,

1895
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,360
man.

1896
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,091
Blood to tiger.

1897
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:53,924
Fucked him up.

1898
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,040
The tire scratched him.

1899
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:55,290
Yeah.

1900
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:55,911
Tiger was like,

1901
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:56,330
bitch,

1902
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:56,631
I'm out.

1903
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:57,740
I'm living in a fucking apartment.

1904
00:49:57,741 --> 00:49:58,521
I need some exercise.

1905
00:49:58,521 --> 00:49:59,390
It was being a tiger.

1906
00:49:59,570 --> 00:49:59,990
Yeah,

1907
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,990
you can't have a tiger and you got
damn apartment in Harlem is one bedroom

1908
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:05,620
studio.

1909
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:05,900
Yeah,

1910
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,530
the line.

1911
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,090
The Tiger freaked out sun.

1912
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,230
You could fucking run.

1913
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,910
See some like crazy dude who like thinks
he's neo in the matrix and he's got

1914
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,930
some long coat on and he
doesn't want anybody to know.

1915
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:18,680
He's got like extra bolts in his door
and he'd go inside and he's got a

1916
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,270
menagerie of fucking animals.

1917
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,000
They're tigers and lions
and shit and it's apartment.

1918
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,190
I told you I got a tag in my house.

1919
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,671
He's like,

1920
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:27,830
his mother fucker really
has a tiger department.

1921
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,750
His dark cloud over
his head is constantly,

1922
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,070
I when nobody knows.

1923
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:31,461
But I,

1924
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,140
when I have the best pet,

1925
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,240
I have the strongest pet.

1926
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,730
I don't even know that he's the
fucking neighborhood mystery.

1927
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,391
You know,

1928
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:38,891
nobody wants to be,

1929
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:39,310
he has,

1930
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,340
he has zero friends.

1931
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:43,490
If you have an alligator in your
bathtub and your best friend's a tiger,

1932
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:44,121
a pet tiger,

1933
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,690
you have zero k.

1934
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,060
But let me look at it
from his point of view.

1935
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,570
What would you rather have an alarm
system that you know no one's gonna give a

1936
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:52,550
fuck cause the cops are never
going to answer it anyway.

1937
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:53,170
Like you're,

1938
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,110
they kicking your door,

1939
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:54,950
your alarm goes off,

1940
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,770
whatever the fuck your dad is.

1941
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:58,190
Fuck.

1942
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:58,581
Okay.

1943
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:00,860
If someone's going to try to harm
you and you're in the Harlem,

1944
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,170
they're going to the cops.

1945
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,910
You got to stand outside until the dust
settles and then move in and they're not

1946
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:06,380
there for crime prevention through.

1947
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,030
They're there to write tickets and shit.

1948
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:08,690
Okay,

1949
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,220
so would you want an alarm system that
everybody knows is bullshit or a fucking

1950
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:14,180
tiger in your house?

1951
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,180
I'm going to say,

1952
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:15,920
oh,

1953
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,230
how confident are you with a pistol?

1954
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,440
You can walk out with a stereo while
you're holding off a tiger bitch,

1955
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:22,274
bro.

1956
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,660
It's on Q was trained.

1957
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,201
It's like,

1958
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:24,501
all right,

1959
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:25,131
someone's breaking.

1960
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,970
I better at this tiger out that
tigers fucking the robber up and you,

1961
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,500
no one's getting out alive.

1962
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,920
Well would probably once it realizes
how fun it is to fuck the robber off,

1963
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:35,560
it'll just want to fuck you up to man.

1964
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,490
It'd be like,

1965
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,090
wow,

1966
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,980
if this motherfucker to crack
open a can a handle for me.

1967
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,350
They just decide fuck him up right now.

1968
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,610
I want you stupid chicken base and
they just decide what they want to kill

1969
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,360
things.

1970
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,710
That's what we ignore them.

1971
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:49,550
We put them in zoos.

1972
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:51,200
The most tortuous aspect of zoos.

1973
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,970
It's like taking a man in his prime
when he's just unbelievably attracted to

1974
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:56,420
women.

1975
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:56,691
Right.

1976
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:01,670
And then putting him in like a glass
zoo and closure and parading naked women

1977
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:03,350
around him back and forth.

1978
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,550
And some people say that that's not,

1979
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:05,870
that's an unfair example,

1980
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:10,480
but it's not because nature has reward
systems and the cans are the cleanup

1981
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,150
crew.

1982
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,760
When you get a limp and you
fucked your design didn't work.

1983
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:14,511
Well guess what?

1984
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:15,500
People would thicker anchors.

1985
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,400
They survive.

1986
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:16,630
Yeah,

1987
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,230
but thicker ankle people survive.

1988
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,220
You thin ankles.

1989
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,390
Motherfuckers gotta go,

1990
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:20,840
okay,

1991
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,590
can't go fishing.

1992
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,423
I heard

1993
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,110
fucking Samoan babies that can run fast.

1994
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,270
I mean that's what's going to survive.

1995
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,300
Tigers are everywhere.

1996
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,111
And the San Diego Zoo,

1997
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:34,680
there was a Jaguar and the woman who tends
to the cats was there and I said that

1998
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:38,120
if I walked in that cage with that thing
a attack me and she said it would kill

1999
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:38,770
you.

2000
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,603
And I said,

2001
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,770
you didn't seem to hesitate.

2002
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,031
She goes,

2003
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:41,300
nope,

2004
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,350
it's a Predator will kill you.

2005
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,573
And I said,

2006
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,180
what are the chances you think of a
human fighting or something like that.

2007
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:46,521
But she goes,

2008
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:47,030
well,

2009
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,510
she said what it would do is it would
bite you and it would keep adjusting its

2010
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,160
grip because it's,

2011
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,390
it's canines,

2012
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:53,871
whatever you call them,

2013
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,150
have nerves where they can
sense when the juggler is.

2014
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,030
So just keep adjusting and then get
on your juggler and you'd go to sleep.

2015
00:52:59,031 --> 00:52:59,331
My boy,

2016
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:01,080
Cody Donald and worked at the,

2017
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:05,000
he was like in the morgue in the hospital
where they put the bodies in and then

2018
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,230
at the Denver Zoo,

2019
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:10,580
the lady at night who would feed
the Tigers and all that shit,

2020
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,230
she didn't lock the,

2021
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,790
she didn't lock it good enough.

2022
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,450
Like she whatever through in the fucking
t bones or whatever they give them and

2023
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:20,570
then she thought it would
automatically locks and it didn't,

2024
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:23,180
something messed up the door from closing.

2025
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,360
So she's wheeling the car is five can
jaguars sneaks out from behind the home

2026
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,630
and they said she died instantly cause
it's big ass canine went all the way

2027
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:35,460
through or scroll through
the back of her neck.

2028
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,260
Boom,

2029
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,780
got a coat wool Cody at to get the body
and he said they had to look and it's

2030
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:41,610
just like this giant hole from,

2031
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:45,020
from the cat's canine
straight through Jaguar too.

2032
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,610
I mean that's not even a particularly
well or they're pretty big.

2033
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,630
They're a couple hundred pounds.

2034
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,613
Did I lie?

2035
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,330
No Jackson.

2036
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,163
Not huge though.

2037
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,010
Tiger.

2038
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,240
They're bigger than a leopards
and they're very powerful.

2039
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:54,931
They think that that,

2040
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,231
yeah.

2041
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,050
Le Jaguars are way bigger than
they are in South America too.

2042
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,310
Yes,

2043
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:58,770
they're gonna creep.

2044
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,220
What you know about sleeping
the most pound for pound.

2045
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:04,140
I believe a Jaguar is
the most powerful cat.

2046
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,810
I think the multiple cat
cow for pounds a house cat.

2047
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,420
I think they said have
house cats were big.

2048
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,100
If they were big like a lion or tiger,

2049
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:12,720
we will be fuck yes.

2050
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,440
Are you serious?

2051
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,681
Yes.

2052
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:14,610
You never attain them.

2053
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:15,450
You never domesticate them.

2054
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:15,741
They they,

2055
00:54:15,741 --> 00:54:16,021
they,

2056
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:18,180
they still have all the
same traits as a jungle cat.

2057
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,014
They're just smaller.

2058
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,070
They're very powerful.

2059
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,000
Like when you see that,

2060
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,020
how far a house cat can
leap for its body style.

2061
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,511
Well,

2062
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,900
if you've seen that video with the tiger
that jumps like 12 feet in the air to

2063
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:28,734
get a piece of meat,

2064
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,820
there's a video of they're holding this
meat like above this truck for this

2065
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:33,181
tiger.

2066
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:35,820
This tiger leaps through
the air to get the meat.

2067
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,700
We'll look at how high the wall was in
San Francisco and the kids are shooting

2068
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:41,220
that tiger was miss rockets
were throwing pine cones.

2069
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,551
That what?

2070
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:42,040
It was an entire,

2071
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,331
it was like,

2072
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:42,700
I'm going to,

2073
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,170
I'm going to,

2074
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,180
I thought that what they were
shooting with risk rockets?

2075
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:45,541
No,

2076
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,190
they were throwing pine
cones on it supposedly.

2077
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:47,690
Yeah.

2078
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:50,660
I mean it was a bit and from my
act and he got had to get about it.

2079
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:55,180
Tiger getting out and look in the guy's
face when the pause at the topic level.

2080
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,283
That's right.

2081
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,380
Like you can't and you
don't know who you are.

2082
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:00,780
Daniel Day Lewis.

2083
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,620
I don't care who the fuck you are like
you like I would have loved to seen that

2084
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:09,090
guy's face because no one can pretend
that killed one guy fucked up.

2085
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:10,140
Another one guy.

2086
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,130
I think one guy,

2087
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,740
I don't know if the guy tried to
help his friend or what happened,

2088
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:14,850
but the second guy got killed.

2089
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,770
Not the first guy that got attacked and
these were the guys throwing the punk

2090
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,010
thing jumped the fence.

2091
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,050
Apparently they can jump 14 feet,

2092
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,681
but this,

2093
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:26,730
this fence was only 12 feet and there
was a big lawsuit because our suppo

2094
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,790
threatened to big lawsuits.

2095
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:28,680
I don't know if it was settled,

2096
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,080
but because they're fucking
fence was too short.

2097
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:31,620
Man.

2098
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,120
The tiger just had never jumped before.

2099
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,620
He never gave him a shot for sure.

2100
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:35,990
So needs to map that out.

2101
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:40,680
Back my bit was if you got a monster
in a box in the middle of the city,

2102
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,630
put a top to the box.

2103
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,560
Be like you went through all this trouble
to build all this shit this way and

2104
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:46,890
you're like,

2105
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:47,723
is that high enough?

2106
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:48,451
Yeah,

2107
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:49,284
let's get out of here.

2108
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,590
Like at least someone,

2109
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,430
someone decided to 12 why
don't put a fucking top on it?

2110
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,660
You got to fake rocks.

2111
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:55,051
It's true.

2112
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,790
You got to fucking pooling their forum.

2113
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,803
How about a roof?

2114
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,080
Fuck heads so it could jump out.

2115
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,940
That's so ridiculous.

2116
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,650
That's the dumbest fucking thing ever.

2117
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,180
Zoos are laymen general though,

2118
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:06,391
man.

2119
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:07,470
What's the last name with the zoo?

2120
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,640
I went to San Diego Zoo.

2121
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,850
That line was pissing on everybody.

2122
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,060
Piss ant man.

2123
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,360
Walking back to a,

2124
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,300
as a zoo can get back.

2125
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:15,810
I don't like,

2126
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,940
that was the most exciting part by far.

2127
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,130
It's good for little kids.

2128
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:20,730
I like,

2129
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,370
I take my kids that makes sense.

2130
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,201
Like to look the animals,

2131
00:56:23,201 --> 00:56:25,630
but it's depressing if you go bums,

2132
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,321
bums me out,

2133
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:26,471
man.

2134
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:26,790
Yeah,

2135
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:27,140
the press,

2136
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,180
especially the primates,

2137
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,020
it's very depressing.

2138
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,853
I was surprised at what,

2139
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,660
how poorly they actually eat.

2140
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:32,610
Especially the primates.

2141
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,280
They're not fed the kind of food and
that it's very hard to feed them their

2142
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,150
natural diet,

2143
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:38,410
especially in certain ratios.

2144
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,590
I don't think they feed the chimps.

2145
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,350
Um,

2146
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,270
like the first of all to give
them mostly like vegetables.

2147
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:44,940
Right?

2148
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,773
They don't allow,

2149
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,400
a lot of them developed diabetes
in captivity because they,

2150
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,220
there's no real set standard
for how to feed a chimp.

2151
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,870
Like as far as national zoo,

2152
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,291
you know,

2153
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,124
and what do they eat?

2154
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,003
All of those different,

2155
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:55,720
I read,

2156
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,920
I remember reading about,

2157
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:59,740
I was so shocked at how
they fed these chimps.

2158
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:01,060
It was not good food.

2159
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:01,960
It was not,

2160
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,160
you know what they'd really like to eat,

2161
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:03,490
man,

2162
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,020
they really love to eat monkeys.

2163
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:05,640
That's right.

2164
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,450
A little monkeys too.

2165
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,350
It's hard to watch.

2166
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:08,831
You know,

2167
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:12,130
they didn't know it until the
1990s I think there was a guy,

2168
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,120
David Attenborough,

2169
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:13,870
is that who it was,

2170
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:18,190
did a a nature documentary in the Congo
or some shit and they follow these

2171
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:18,940
chimps and they,

2172
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,140
they had this hunting party,

2173
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:22,540
they took down this monkey and they're
ripping the monkey apart and eat and

2174
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:23,110
it'll lie.

2175
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,690
We'll call this monkey the
see the thing screaming,

2176
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:26,620
the look on his face.

2177
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,521
What's eating it?

2178
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:29,920
Like asked first chewing on this thing,

2179
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:30,671
pulling it apart.

2180
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:33,640
Like that part the monkeys screaming like,

2181
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,990
I can't believe it's getting even is one
of the most fucked up disturbing videos

2182
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:38,711
I've ever seen.

2183
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:42,040
Even like I can't hand you see
them looking up in the trees,

2184
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,580
you know the main one looking up
in the trees and they're there,

2185
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:49,180
they're mapping where these monkeys
are going and they cut off as a group.

2186
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:49,920
They want they,

2187
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,101
they,

2188
00:57:50,101 --> 00:57:51,040
they cut them off,

2189
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,260
they funnel them,

2190
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,970
they be it trees and they'd get them to
go in a certain direction and then they,

2191
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,450
they box them in west side story and
then they just take it on pause for,

2192
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,640
they also found that monkey chimp,

2193
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:07,860
young male chimps will band together and
go kill other chimps from other trucks.

2194
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,733
Like your mother.

2195
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:09,540
Yeah,

2196
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:09,880
the league.

2197
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,350
And occasionally cannibalize.

2198
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,930
They'll cannibalize people
from other George chimps.

2199
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:14,764
From other tribes.

2200
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,110
Yeah.

2201
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:17,530
Our ancestors are assholes,

2202
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,060
you know,

2203
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,680
and so are people on
times they do a lot worse.

2204
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,371
Well of course,

2205
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,510
but I mean bipolar ape,

2206
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,180
we're not killing eating
people though really?

2207
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,571
Well.

2208
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:26,140
We are,

2209
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,540
but so many are in lunch.

2210
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,930
But if you look at the numbers,

2211
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,930
see how many fucking chimps there are in
the wild and they're doing this fucked

2212
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,261
up shit.

2213
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:32,980
The monkeys.

2214
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,270
And then look at how
many people there are.

2215
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,370
If there was as many people or chimps,

2216
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:37,061
is that where people,

2217
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:38,560
it would be chaos.

2218
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:41,150
You wouldn't be able to leave your
house if there's this many champions.

2219
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,300
There were people you would
never be able to get to your car.

2220
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,860
They would mug you.

2221
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:45,971
They got,

2222
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:49,420
they would rip your fucking
feed off and fuck your ass.

2223
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,630
They'll do whatever they want to do,

2224
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,211
whatever they want to.

2225
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:53,440
I think that would be the one animal.

2226
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:53,681
Actually.

2227
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:57,610
You definitely don't
want to have a counter.

2228
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,920
You May as well choose a crock
because I'll kill you right away.

2229
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:02,650
A chimp will just take your face
off and do the genitals off.

2230
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,440
Yeah,

2231
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,110
it was a less likely to attack you.

2232
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:05,480
Yeah,

2233
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,460
they're fake.

2234
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:09,910
You don't fake charge you and
you have to stay in charge.

2235
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,710
I want you to get the fuck out of here.

2236
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,340
Just get the fuck out
of you staring at me.

2237
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,350
You crazy ass chimps.

2238
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:15,510
Gonna rip your Dick and faith,

2239
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:16,870
but were so soft.

2240
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:19,510
We think it's okay to look
at a wild animal in its eyes.

2241
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,351
That's so stupid.

2242
00:59:20,351 --> 00:59:20,830
We are.

2243
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:21,663
Hi

2244
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,893
Challenge.

2245
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,020
We're cool man.

2246
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,261
Well,

2247
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,300
from National Geographic Society,

2248
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,980
we just come to make
sure your baby's okay.

2249
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,530
Fucking crazy.

2250
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:31,370
800 pounds,

2251
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:33,420
silver backyard long through the trees,

2252
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:35,803
right in your face.

2253
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,090
He's got bangs and only eat vegetables,

2254
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,610
only designed to fuck you up and you
couldn't even imagine what an 800 pound

2255
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:44,331
gorillas strength.

2256
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:44,810
It's like,

2257
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,760
because you would think of
it as like an 800 pound man,

2258
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,140
but it would really be more like a 3000
pounds to twist your head off like this

2259
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:51,411
man.

2260
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:52,850
Like she'll repeat a pieces,

2261
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,050
probably more than 3000 probably like a
5,000 pounds or some ridiculous number.

2262
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,150
Look at the muscles on
a 200 pound chimp man,

2263
00:59:59,151 --> 00:59:59,451
when they,

2264
00:59:59,451 --> 01:00:00,770
when they have one of those their hair.

2265
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,240
Aw troll looking fall,

2266
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,250
I'm beast stared at those muscles forever.

2267
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,440
If we had as many chips
as there were people,

2268
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,030
everybody's always down for chimps and I,

2269
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,430
and I'm,

2270
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,721
I look,

2271
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,280
I'm not saying we should
exterminate the chimps,

2272
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,383
don't get me wrong,

2273
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:15,800
but let's just be realistic.

2274
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,140
If chimps were everywhere
and they had full freedom,

2275
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:18,990
the way people do what,

2276
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,250
you got serious problems.

2277
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:21,800
Yes.

2278
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,310
Yeah.

2279
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:25,190
Well the first problem with so and
said that was okay for those chimps to

2280
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:26,360
fucking hang out with us.

2281
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,350
And if you don't think chimps,

2282
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:28,520
we'll steal babies and eat them.

2283
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,440
You haven't been paying
attention to the literature.

2284
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:31,150
That's Grad Center.

2285
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,360
I haven't been paid attention.

2286
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,540
They will still babies.

2287
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,970
Baboons will still be fun that Jones.

2288
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,520
I knew baboons are wild as fuck and evil.

2289
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,610
Evil country on your back.

2290
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:44,480
It's not a good idea.

2291
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,310
Baboons are creepy dog
fucking monkey things.

2292
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,770
Nobody's got a pet bat.

2293
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,121
Boom.

2294
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:50,540
Now,

2295
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,170
some people do they?

2296
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:52,660
Yes,

2297
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,020
I did.

2298
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,920
He brought about nearly two in Africa.

2299
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:55,191
I know.

2300
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:56,930
There's like baboons with fucking masks.

2301
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,780
I'm terrified.

2302
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,773
I know.

2303
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,681
Every time.

2304
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:02,110
Last time I left his volcano,

2305
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,260
he's like,

2306
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,490
you're gonna die any minute.

2307
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,340
Keep away from volcanoes.

2308
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,050
Don't run for office in Russia.

2309
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,063
It makes,

2310
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,730
makes you get that book because
it will challenge you eventually.

2311
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:15,830
We keep the chip population to a minimum.

2312
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,220
Yeah.

2313
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,350
Everybody was down for chimps
have chips Ahoy squirrels.

2314
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,220
You'd be fucked.

2315
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:19,440
Yeah,

2316
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,840
you won't be fucked of.

2317
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:23,760
Chimps were one and through
the fucking muscles look good.

2318
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,613
This is my favorite.

2319
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,090
Look at that thing.

2320
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:27,140
Look at the muscles.

2321
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,071
Oh my God.

2322
01:01:28,071 --> 01:01:30,530
They're so strong where
there's a male where,

2323
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,040
look at that.

2324
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,180
Look at that and what's really,

2325
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,260
that's the same chimp I,

2326
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:34,580
yeah,

2327
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,670
but what's really fucked
is later balls on it.

2328
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,650
He's got some balls and that's
what they all look like.

2329
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,530
We just usually see them covered
in hair and we don't realize it.

2330
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:42,891
That's right.

2331
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:46,580
It's got some thick wrists on that guy
and those hands built for brutality is

2332
01:01:46,581 --> 01:01:51,581
not built to pull your eyes out of their
head with no Dick for she has a dick.

2333
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,230
He's probably playing with it,

2334
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:54,740
man.

2335
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,690
He's probably holding it up
with his extra long fingers.

2336
01:01:56,691 --> 01:01:58,160
You're not putting them
in a rear naked choke.

2337
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,420
We are not doing anything to him.

2338
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:00,500
Oh my God.

2339
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,370
He would laugh at you.

2340
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:01,820
Oh,

2341
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:06,820
look at that Gorilla and Oh my God,

2342
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,353
so big.

2343
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,711
Oh my God,

2344
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,410
it looks so big.

2345
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,700
Six foot 600 pounds.

2346
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,121
Again,

2347
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:15,790
not messing with a very big piece though.

2348
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:16,341
Oh no,

2349
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,240
they have tiny dicks.

2350
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,110
It's not a matter of fact.

2351
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,321
Does it?

2352
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:18,891
Difference in,

2353
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:20,490
notice how he says a tiny balls too.

2354
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,540
Here's what's interesting.

2355
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,374
Can you a little science?

2356
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,990
There's the dessert with primates.

2357
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,870
There's a direct relationship with the
size of the testicles and the permissive

2358
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:30,330
ewas ness of the surrounding women.

2359
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,440
So the more the women are just fucking
everything buck wild up in here,

2360
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,060
the more the dude's balls
get big and that's it.

2361
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,060
That existed cultures as well.

2362
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:39,691
For sure.

2363
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:40,750
I live in La and my best

2364
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,830
humans have the largest Dick's
though of all the primates.

2365
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:51,060
Port per capita,

2366
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:51,481
you know,

2367
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:52,560
poor per size.

2368
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,650
Probably measure if you
measure this pound for pound.

2369
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:57,660
Our dicks are the biggest
cause we're the biggest hose.

2370
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,590
Yup.

2371
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,630
Not necessarily like us and Bonobos.

2372
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:01,740
Fuck a lot on.

2373
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,580
But our dicks are bigger.

2374
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,690
The thing about gorillas,

2375
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:08,370
dicks and balls is the grills are so
fucking unchallengeable they could have a

2376
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:11,280
little tiny puds and they
still get all the pussy does.

2377
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:12,330
No one call.

2378
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,180
There's no giant gorilla just stroking it,

2379
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,340
sitting by the side of the fucking pond.

2380
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,980
Eating bamboo shoots with a giant show.

2381
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:24,981
Lailey gorillas know like
Lingham get over overflow.

2382
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,290
This one inch killer you've been fucking
with cause it grills have one inch.

2383
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:28,711
Dick's.

2384
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:30,450
It's so disappointing.

2385
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:31,960
But if you look at it in a grills way,

2386
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:33,510
a big Dick is a big target.

2387
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,140
You want me to dig bit by a snake might
be the difference between survival and

2388
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:37,531
death.

2389
01:03:37,531 --> 01:03:39,300
When you're out there living
in the fucking jungle.

2390
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,050
Okay?

2391
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,390
You want a tiny Dick
with a pee hole so small,

2392
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:46,080
the one of those little ball eaten fish
can't swim up there and eat your ball

2393
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:48,070
sack out from the inside
like they're known to do.

2394
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,990
I heard back in the day,

2395
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,670
like in the Roman times,

2396
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:50,940
uh,

2397
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,730
a big Dick.

2398
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:52,950
You were made fun of.

2399
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:54,060
It's like look down upon.

2400
01:03:54,061 --> 01:03:54,894
Is that true?

2401
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,130
Same today.

2402
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:56,881
It's like the Internet.

2403
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:57,714
It's like the Internet.

2404
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,100
The Roman days were like Twitter.

2405
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,960
If you have a big Dick on Twitter here,

2406
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,490
but you fucking the blood goes.

2407
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:03,570
Do you become a retard

2408
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,700
proven the body can't support a dick.

2409
01:04:06,701 --> 01:04:11,701
That big statues request to keep the
penis small cause it took away from the

2410
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:16,560
body and how hard it was to chisel like
that realistic body and foot and all

2411
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,580
that out of the marble.

2412
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,190
So you kept that area [inaudible] story.

2413
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:24,840
I bet there's a bunch of dudes Jackin
off on a statue of a giant cock took the

2414
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:28,080
cock and they were but fucking the
statue in the middle of the square,

2415
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,240
like backing each other up
on the statue of this giant.

2416
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,260
I just heard back in the day,

2417
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:32,970
if you had a big old
Dick in the Roman times,

2418
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,380
like they made fun of you.

2419
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,370
Like you're an outcast.

2420
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:35,880
No,

2421
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,620
that's hilarious.

2422
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,320
I don't think it's fun.

2423
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,011
Make Fun boys.

2424
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:38,560
Go ahead.

2425
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,000
Oh,

2426
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,140
real funny fellas.

2427
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:41,863
Funny Man.

2428
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,303
Dick,

2429
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,813
did you imagine if that,

2430
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:48,420
that is the one that's the one group of
humans that will never get sympathy if

2431
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:49,254
you mock them.

2432
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,460
Cause Dude's a big dicks.

2433
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,180
I know what,

2434
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:51,780
no matter what.

2435
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,120
I mean,

2436
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,730
just different races,

2437
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,020
different nationalities,

2438
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:55,890
different genders.

2439
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:58,450
There's all sorts of
categories where you are,

2440
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:58,590
uh,

2441
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:58,871
you're,

2442
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:01,530
you're not allowed to mock
people because that's a rude,

2443
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,670
even white people.

2444
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,220
There's people get mad that
you're mocking white people like,

2445
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:05,821
man much fuck,

2446
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,050
leave us white people alone.

2447
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,820
You know all the privilege
that white people have,

2448
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,800
it's still not enough for
you to be able to mock them.

2449
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,000
Take it for judge [inaudible].

2450
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,160
Dude's a giant dicks.

2451
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,090
You got a green light.

2452
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,430
You could find something about
that guy that you can make fun of.

2453
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:19,840
You can make fun of that dude.

2454
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:21,130
Nobody's going to back them up.

2455
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:23,110
We did know that he was
going to come along and say,

2456
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:23,651
hey dude,

2457
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:24,880
with the female Dick,

2458
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:25,871
you know man,

2459
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:26,830
I feel your pain.

2460
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:27,910
It's a bullshit.

2461
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:30,760
They're mocking your giant
super fucking Alpha Hog.

2462
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,320
That giant Dick at all.

2463
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:37,060
The women want that huge veiny monster
of destruction that you're swinging your

2464
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:37,451
pants,

2465
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:38,021
your giant,

2466
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:38,830
your giant pool.

2467
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:41,320
The one thing that a
dude cannot own up to,

2468
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,280
I mean we just can't.

2469
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:42,520
No,

2470
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:42,880
no guy.

2471
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,713
No matter what you do,

2472
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,740
you make all the money in the world.

2473
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:47,230
The guys get a giant Dick and if he,

2474
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,940
if he bangs or she's going to remember,

2475
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:49,570
we did.

2476
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:49,901
We did.

2477
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:53,350
I remember that thing and
you can't pay for it either.

2478
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,490
I do.

2479
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,040
We did love line and the open
forum was does size matter.

2480
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,150
It literally every girl,

2481
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:01,650
but one was like absolutely do
to tell you it doesn't matter.

2482
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,490
It's wishful thinking,

2483
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,460
but everything matters.

2484
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,150
Dr Drew is like now it doesn't
matter how silly boy or like,

2485
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:07,984
well,

2486
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,441
no,

2487
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:09,490
he said it does matter.

2488
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:09,701
Well,

2489
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:11,080
he's got a piece on him apparently.

2490
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,490
Well that's what they told us,

2491
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,750
but at the end of the
day it was funny proof.

2492
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,020
I need a dick pic dot piece.

2493
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:17,580
Yeah.

2494
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,191
It was like guys,

2495
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:19,450
I took karate in high school.

2496
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:19,970
Okay.

2497
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,770
Define peace.

2498
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:22,510
Well,

2499
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,040
I've been doing martial
arts since I was a kid.

2500
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:24,620
What'd you do?

2501
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,040
You and your brother hit a brick with
a fucking flashlight and your backyard.

2502
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,520
Every guy exactly.

2503
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:32,110
The bench and how fast
to run or they were.

2504
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:34,210
I ran a four or five 40 mm.

2505
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:34,901
Well,

2506
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:35,734
the NFL,

2507
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:36,850
how much your friend goes?

2508
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:37,031
Yeah,

2509
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:38,620
I ran a four six in the
40 [inaudible] well,

2510
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:38,780
no,

2511
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,160
you Dan.

2512
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,140
And he goes,

2513
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:40,671
oh,

2514
01:06:40,671 --> 01:06:41,980
I benched three 85 though.

2515
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:44,080
Three times in high school though.

2516
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,460
Why would he say that though?

2517
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,530
The Z admitting the first one was a lot.

2518
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:48,821
That was bullshit,

2519
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,600
but I'm an eagle scout scout.

2520
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,030
I made that shit.

2521
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,410
I didn't make Eagle Scout.

2522
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,400
I got a badge.

2523
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:59,490
I saw grown man who was an eagle scout
at the airport and he was pushing 45 and

2524
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,451
he was an eagle.

2525
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:02,560
So using the full getup.

2526
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:02,801
Sure.

2527
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:04,270
Well he's molesting kids here.

2528
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,550
Well he's a scout master.

2529
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:06,601
He,

2530
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:07,150
is that what it is?

2531
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:07,420
Yeah.

2532
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,720
I mean he might have earned
the rank of eagle scouts,

2533
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,530
boy scouts anymore.

2534
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,270
He's like running these scout trips.

2535
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,570
He can make it can make the
fire out of two sticky shit.

2536
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,171
Oh Dude,

2537
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,730
weird guy joined the military.

2538
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,020
I remember I was a kid,

2539
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,370
I was a kid and I was in the boy scouts,

2540
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,450
so I was probably like between,

2541
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,470
I would guess it's between,

2542
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,420
so when I was living in Boston,

2543
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:29,900
so I think I was probably like 13
that was when I was in the boy scouts.

2544
01:07:29,901 --> 01:07:31,180
So it was only in it for like one year,

2545
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,700
whatever it was 13 I was a
week living in Jamaica Plain.

2546
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,640
And my mom took me to the boy
scout thing in this fucking dude.

2547
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:37,391
He was a scout master.

2548
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:42,391
Was he hitting on my mom like hard and
my mom was like blushing and she was

2549
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:43,750
trying to be polite about it,

2550
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:44,321
but I remember like,

2551
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:45,310
this is creepy.

2552
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,950
This dude's hitting on my mom in front
of me and I've got to go camping with

2553
01:07:47,951 --> 01:07:48,784
this asshole.

2554
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,271
And he was like,

2555
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:49,421
Hey,

2556
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:50,201
what's up with your mom?

2557
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:51,220
Like she's married to my dad.

2558
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,660
Fuck off,

2559
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,290
get getting extra marshmallows and shit.

2560
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,610
I didn't get any extra modules.

2561
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,740
I went to camp with a
bunch of fucking hoodlums.

2562
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,970
It was a scary camp.

2563
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:00,550
I didn't do any of the
shit we're supposed to do.

2564
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,330
I hid during the day like we're supposed
to do all these different activities

2565
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,980
and took my fishing rod,

2566
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,380
went down to the lake
or I checked out early,

2567
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,720
show the individual check out right away.

2568
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,060
Well,

2569
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,750
with the two doors ricochets okay.

2570
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,440
Dudes were,

2571
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,350
he gave kids twos and they're shooting
at rocks or hanging out there,

2572
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,820
but there was like an archery range.

2573
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,030
And while we're hanging out by the
archery range out here and I go,

2574
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:24,080
what the fuck is that?

2575
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,591
And someone goes,

2576
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:25,424
it's a ricochet.

2577
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:25,731
I go,

2578
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:26,870
what do you mean until ricochet?

2579
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,290
They're like someone over by the
rifle range probably hit a rock.

2580
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:30,621
I go,

2581
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:31,281
it goes all the way.

2582
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,330
The fuck over here.

2583
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,940
Like what are you talking about man?

2584
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:34,641
Just keep fishing,

2585
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:34,860
bro.

2586
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,680
Is the boy scouts in New Hampshire.

2587
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:36,981
Okay.

2588
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:37,440
Listen,

2589
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,750
it's survival of the fittest.

2590
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,613
They would take kids,

2591
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,820
pull them out of their cots,

2592
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:41,211
like pick,

2593
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:45,110
pick their concept and tie them up and
leave him in the middle of the woods and

2594
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:46,100
it was pitch dark.

2595
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:47,120
You couldn't see your hand.

2596
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,560
I went to camp out there.

2597
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,453
I got molested.

2598
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:50,570
Did you?

2599
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,170
Yes.

2600
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:51,710
What happened?

2601
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:51,831
Oh,

2602
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:52,620
you talked about that.

2603
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,380
She doesn't tell a story on the podcast.

2604
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,273
I don't know.

2605
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,211
It doesn't matter.

2606
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:56,970
It wasn't done.

2607
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:57,411
The lesson.

2608
01:08:57,411 --> 01:08:58,310
When you look girl,

2609
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,300
you're going to tell us the story.

2610
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,490
Tell the story though,

2611
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,140
Denise.

2612
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:02,460
Well,

2613
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:02,940
yeah,

2614
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,800
I'll say Greg,

2615
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:04,341
suck your Dick.

2616
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:05,174
So well no,

2617
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:07,340
I woke up with Dan.

2618
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:08,160
His name was,

2619
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:08,770
uh,

2620
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,890
with a felt full of my dog and uh,

2621
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,320
and I own this fall.

2622
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:13,810
I had,

2623
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:15,650
I had a morning boy
hard on and I was like,

2624
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,221
what's going on?

2625
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:16,671
And he was like,

2626
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:16,971
doing this.

2627
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:17,420
I was like,

2628
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:17,961
I do this.

2629
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:18,231
You just say,

2630
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:18,890
why is he doing this?

2631
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:19,640
I remember going,

2632
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,241
I do this.

2633
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:20,691
Why is he,

2634
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:21,291
I didn't even,

2635
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,124
it didn't occur to me.

2636
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,410
So I go to my buddy Danny,

2637
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,560
I go probably 11 and I go,

2638
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:28,700
I've got my buddy down and go,

2639
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,653
hey man,

2640
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,141
this guy,

2641
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:30,630
he don't me.

2642
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:31,190
I'm like,

2643
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,300
this guy did,

2644
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,390
was playing with my Dick
and my buddy John goes,

2645
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,560
he's playing with my Dick too.

2646
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:37,251
And Donnie goes,

2647
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:39,500
he sucked mine and I go,

2648
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,060
I'm telling my mom.

2649
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,340
So I waited like a little
tiger in the tall grass.

2650
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,330
Mine.

2651
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:44,570
Yup.

2652
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:44,961
Donny.

2653
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:45,231
Yes.

2654
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:47,210
Dick Sucking ass done repeatedly.

2655
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,500
He wasn't like real quick island.

2656
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:50,000
Helen got molested as a kid.

2657
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,863
Sure did.

2658
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,160
I wasn't a violent guy.

2659
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:52,411
He was like,

2660
01:09:52,411 --> 01:09:53,570
he was probably a guy who,

2661
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:54,141
he had a beard.

2662
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:55,100
I remember with Baldhead,

2663
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,023
terribly athletic.

2664
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:56,811
Not Athletic at all.

2665
01:09:56,811 --> 01:09:57,441
I threw a ball at,

2666
01:09:57,441 --> 01:10:00,820
I mean he and he clapped like he
was clapping at a bug and then he,

2667
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:04,640
he just loved boys and
I went and told my mom.

2668
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,050
What would you tell your mom?

2669
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:06,983
How'd you tell your mom?

2670
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,760
Well,

2671
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,980
my mom wasn't there so she
didn't come for about two weeks.

2672
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:14,870
He kept asking me why I wasn't going
on more trips cause I was just taken,

2673
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:17,020
I was like not sign up
from any more canoes.

2674
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,200
It just that one time,

2675
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,700
because you were there for two weeks.

2676
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,860
It was just great for longer than that.

2677
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,600
I was in camp for two months.

2678
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,880
I believe I can suck your Dick.

2679
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:25,430
No,

2680
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,263
he never suck my Dick.

2681
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:28,793
And he just,

2682
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,500
he just had it.

2683
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:29,780
Well,

2684
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,650
he was hard.

2685
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,730
We were all in the tent.

2686
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:34,790
It was probably me and like a couple
of years and he had his hand in my,

2687
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,250
in my sleeping bag playing with my little
wiener gimme like Jujitsu position.

2688
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,450
Does he have you inside control?

2689
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:41,750
Nope.

2690
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,680
I'm lying next to him.

2691
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:44,650
He's looking,

2692
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:45,590
he tit,

2693
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,190
tense or small pill.

2694
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,110
There's three kids.

2695
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:49,560
He's probably like this too.

2696
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:51,800
May sucking done and you off.

2697
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:52,150
Well,

2698
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,800
I know that I was looking
at threesome with Dani.

2699
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,311
I was looking,

2700
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:56,330
I will feel up like this.

2701
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,100
I wasn't a threesome properly.

2702
01:10:58,670 --> 01:10:59,503
And uh,

2703
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,880
this explains so much.

2704
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,773
I know

2705
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,080
why you fucking rubbing your head.

2706
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,820
It's gotta be an Internet meme.

2707
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,110
This explains so much,

2708
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,663
so much.

2709
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,003
I was molested.

2710
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,950
It's fucked up to laugh laughing at that.

2711
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:17,510
It's so,

2712
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:21,180
there's a big going to be the
lesson and NBN fucked and so for me,

2713
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:22,380
and I just knew minor league millennia.

2714
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:22,801
Crazy.

2715
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:24,990
If you don't think Dani
was fucking them too.

2716
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:25,591
No,

2717
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:26,424
I think Donny,

2718
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,520
Donny didn't want me to
tell anybody and I was like,

2719
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:30,810
I'm telling my mom,

2720
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,370
I almost got molested by a girl.

2721
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:33,503
Came real close.

2722
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,300
It didn't realize that the guy was
creeping on me until the very end he did.

2723
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,320
I thought it was nice.

2724
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,290
I thought it was nine
but he was getting weird.

2725
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,730
It was getting weird and
was showing up drunk.

2726
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:46,290
I used to go fishing near this place
called Jamaica pond and Jamaica pond.

2727
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:50,340
Was this a place in Jamaica plain where
I live that had really good fishing.

2728
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,310
Like I could walk to it.

2729
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,440
It seems weird,

2730
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:52,801
but that's,

2731
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:52,981
you know,

2732
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:56,670
Boston and rains lot of like ponds
and lakes and shit like sometimes near

2733
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,390
cities.

2734
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,820
And this was a real legitimate trout pond.

2735
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,140
And we'd go fishing there all the time.

2736
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:01,831
He'd catch bass,

2737
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:02,640
they're trout,

2738
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,230
but they would stock
it with Rainbow Trout.

2739
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:05,630
And I loved fishing back then.

2740
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,473
I fish all the time,

2741
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,700
the fish everyday afterschool.

2742
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,311
So much fun.

2743
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:10,860
It was just peaceful and
it's fun catching fish,

2744
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:11,071
you know,

2745
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:12,810
it's like one of those
things that kids love it.

2746
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:13,440
You know,

2747
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,120
when I caught my first trout,

2748
01:12:15,121 --> 01:12:15,361
I was like,

2749
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:16,111
Holy Shit.

2750
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:18,390
Like I brought it in and I
picked it up and you know,

2751
01:12:18,391 --> 01:12:19,470
I took it home and I cooked it.

2752
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:21,360
I couldn't believe I
caught a fucking trout.

2753
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,160
And then it,

2754
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,310
it was very exciting to me.

2755
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:23,850
Anyway,

2756
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,630
this dude used to jog by and he used
to talk to me and my friend Josh,

2757
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,550
Brendan can't stop laughing.

2758
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,711
We used to go,

2759
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:32,070
uh,

2760
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,560
we used to go fishing at
this place all the time.

2761
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,140
Dudes probably dead now because I was,

2762
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,080
it was before I moved to Newton.

2763
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,350
I moved to Newton when I was 14,

2764
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:41,430
so I was living in Jamaica Plain.

2765
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:42,420
I was probably 13 ish,

2766
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,493
somewhere around that.

2767
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,870
And he's probably in
his like late fifties.

2768
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,000
So it comes around and um,

2769
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,411
you know,

2770
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:50,370
he'd ask us about a fishing,

2771
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:50,551
like,

2772
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:51,121
what do you catch?

2773
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:53,310
Like sit down with us for a
little bit and talk with us.

2774
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,210
Very friendly and they take off and he
kept doing it like over and over again.

2775
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:57,870
Come by.

2776
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:58,570
Very friendly,

2777
01:12:58,570 --> 01:12:59,403
softening,

2778
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:00,570
softening us up.

2779
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,350
Feelers.

2780
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,640
He would offer us some food.

2781
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:03,720
He would give us some food like,

2782
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:04,710
or like a cake or something.

2783
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:05,900
We'll probably like rub his balls.

2784
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,560
I have no idea.

2785
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:08,250
Right.

2786
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,390
Probably give you like a cookie.

2787
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:10,800
It just had deep in his ass.

2788
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,413
No idea.

2789
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,250
I ran it over my crack.

2790
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,181
Who knows what he did.

2791
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:15,840
Right.

2792
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,770
But I didn't know any better,

2793
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:17,041
man.

2794
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:17,731
I was 13.

2795
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:18,660
I just didn't know any better.

2796
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:20,460
I had one experience when I was younger,

2797
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,530
when I was like seven years old.

2798
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,390
I was at a library in
San Francisco and uh,

2799
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,720
I was looking at his books and I was,

2800
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:28,610
look at these monster books.

2801
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,640
This guy came up to me like,

2802
01:13:29,641 --> 01:13:30,570
you like monster books?

2803
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:30,871
And I go,

2804
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:31,480
yeah.

2805
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,111
And he was like a month,

2806
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:33,220
two books out of my car and go,

2807
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:34,054
Oh really?

2808
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,060
And I start going out to this guy's car.

2809
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,140
And um,

2810
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,940
the lady who's the librarian screams out,

2811
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:39,451
Joseph,

2812
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:41,040
you get away from that man.

2813
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,083
Dan.

2814
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,320
Dan just got out of jail.

2815
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:44,280
So I run away.

2816
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,193
Damn Brian,

2817
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,103
probably going to,

2818
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:49,140
who knows who the fuck knows
most likely molest man,

2819
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:50,023
I dodged.

2820
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:50,500
If,

2821
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,740
if it's a good bark,

2822
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:55,110
could be killed me like seven at the most.

2823
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,031
Most made you,

2824
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:56,270
I don't know.

2825
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,330
I'm a little kid anymore.

2826
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,140
Scary Shit.

2827
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:58,890
So I had,

2828
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,360
I had that in my past.

2829
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:01,194
Like I remembered that,

2830
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:01,741
that a dodge,

2831
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:02,574
that bullet.

2832
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,391
So this dude,

2833
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,760
man,

2834
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,650
I'm so stupid,

2835
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:04,920
man.

2836
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,480
I had lunch over this guy's house before.

2837
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:07,314
Just me and him.

2838
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,430
Uh,

2839
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:08,970
I,

2840
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,170
this is the word started getting weird.

2841
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:11,890
I peed in his bathroom.

2842
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,660
And one of the things he said to me,

2843
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:14,494
he goes,

2844
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,463
he goes,

2845
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,050
you're very developed.

2846
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,131
And I said,

2847
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:18,964
what?

2848
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,870
And he goes,

2849
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,860
you your penis,

2850
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:23,560
your penis is very developed
for a boy your age.

2851
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:23,891
That's a,

2852
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:24,820
that's a very good thing.

2853
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:25,151
I was like,

2854
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,361
oh,

2855
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:25,930
okay.

2856
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,100
But he didn't get creepy with me.

2857
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:27,371
I mean,

2858
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:28,220
I was top,

2859
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:29,291
it was creepy,

2860
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:29,861
but you know what I'm saying?

2861
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:30,491
Like you'd be as fuck.

2862
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:31,450
He didn't try to fuck me.

2863
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,720
He didn't want it to whatever it was.

2864
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:35,560
It was real.

2865
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,330
It got real weird after that.

2866
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:41,260
So that was the probably the
beginning of the weirdness.

2867
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:41,571
Yeah.

2868
01:14:41,571 --> 01:14:42,011
So,

2869
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:42,341
yeah,

2870
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:43,180
so I,

2871
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:43,580
uh,

2872
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:43,740
I,

2873
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,770
I definitely told Josh,

2874
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,071
I was like,

2875
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:45,491
dude,

2876
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:45,821
he say,

2877
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:46,391
he said that,

2878
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:48,670
not like my dick was developed
and he's looking at my Dick.

2879
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:49,271
And Josh was like,

2880
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,104
whoa.

2881
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,180
And Josh was an interesting character too.

2882
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:52,920
Like he,

2883
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,171
he,

2884
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:56,650
that kid knew a lot of shit he
knew about like weird sexual shit,

2885
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,300
like way early.

2886
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,110
Um,

2887
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,591
because,

2888
01:14:59,591 --> 01:14:59,860
uh,

2889
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,300
his mom was a lesbian.

2890
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,180
There's always one of them live with this
woman who looked like a truck driver.

2891
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:04,930
It was,

2892
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:05,760
it was hilarious.

2893
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,101
Like he,

2894
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:06,790
he knew,

2895
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,770
he knew he was a sharp kid.

2896
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:09,401
He's like,

2897
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:09,671
dude,

2898
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,510
he's trying to fuck you.

2899
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:11,920
This is going to get ugly.

2900
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:12,791
And you know,

2901
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,720
we were talking about it like,

2902
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:14,950
do you think he's a pedophile?

2903
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,120
Like it was like some weird shit.

2904
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,163
So anyway,

2905
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:18,310
I started avoiding and dude,

2906
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:20,530
and then one time I'm fishing.

2907
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,460
And um,

2908
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,360
there was two areas.

2909
01:15:22,361 --> 01:15:23,760
There was one error which make a pond,

2910
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:23,930
was,

2911
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:24,820
was the big area.

2912
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:27,940
And then there's this other
smaller pond that was off like,

2913
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,660
you know,

2914
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,010
like a few blocks to the left.

2915
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,580
Sometimes we would go to that pond because
if no one ever went there and it did

2916
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:34,720
have some good fish in there.

2917
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,610
And every now and then like
get a different kind of
fish that had like pick role

2918
01:15:37,611 --> 01:15:38,470
and most difficult fish.

2919
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,970
So he shows up.

2920
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:40,721
It's just me and him.

2921
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:42,400
And this is a kind of an isolated area.

2922
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,960
There's a lot of trees and shit.

2923
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:44,890
It's not like Jamaica pond,

2924
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:47,010
which has this big running track sweats.

2925
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:47,923
So sketch,

2926
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,890
this is a sketch and he
tells me that he loves me.

2927
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:52,360
Yeah,

2928
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:52,900
yeah.

2929
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,381
And uh,

2930
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,430
I don't know what to do.

2931
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:56,260
Like I'm sitting there
fishing and I'm like,

2932
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:56,771
okay,

2933
01:15:56,771 --> 01:15:57,310
well,

2934
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:57,670
you know,

2935
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:58,600
I like you too man.

2936
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,470
And he goes,

2937
01:15:59,470 --> 01:15:59,741
no,

2938
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:00,090
no,

2939
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:00,940
I love you.

2940
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:02,740
And there cannot be no true love.

2941
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:04,690
There can be no true love without sex.

2942
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,440
Holy.

2943
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,140
I remember him saying that
and I remember going what,

2944
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:09,820
like what and I remember how to knife.

2945
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:10,650
Uh,

2946
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,780
I had a Swiss army knife when those little
red plastic handle Swiss army knives

2947
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:16,840
and I had it in my pocket and I put my
hand on the knife and I didn't want to

2948
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:18,720
pull it out but I I,

2949
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,110
but I wanted to have it on me,

2950
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:20,710
you know,

2951
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,560
and I remember thinking I might
have to fucking stab this guy shot.

2952
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:24,250
I did go.

2953
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:24,730
I Dunno.

2954
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,500
I mean first of all I'm
probably going to get killed.

2955
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,520
I'm 13.

2956
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,930
I then know how to fight
back and he's a big,

2957
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:29,620
it wasn't big.

2958
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,370
He was bigger than me.

2959
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,190
He was an old guy,

2960
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:31,960
grown ass,

2961
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,610
grown ass man,

2962
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:33,010
a sweat.

2963
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,330
And if he knew how to fight it off,

2964
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:35,140
I was fucked.

2965
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,720
I didn't have any martial arts experience
back then is one of the reasons why I

2966
01:16:37,721 --> 01:16:40,870
started getting into martial
arts is after this I just,

2967
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,000
I figured I have to know
something like this guy,

2968
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:45,890
if he beats me up and fuck
fucking kills me and stabs me,

2969
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,500
like no one's going to hear me.

2970
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:47,831
I'm out.

2971
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:49,570
I'm in this like really
kind of wooded area.

2972
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:50,561
And so,

2973
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:51,394
uh,

2974
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:51,851
I told him,

2975
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:53,680
you better fucking leave me
alone or something like that,

2976
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:53,951
you know,

2977
01:16:53,951 --> 01:16:55,660
whatever words I was able to muster,

2978
01:16:55,661 --> 01:16:57,370
being scared of my mind at 13.

2979
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:58,570
And then,

2980
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:58,901
uh,

2981
01:16:58,901 --> 01:17:01,460
years later after I had moved,

2982
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,620
this is where it got really creepy.

2983
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:06,250
He sent a letter to my house and I was
like 16 or 17 or something like that.

2984
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,881
Yeah.

2985
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:08,080
He sent a letter to my house many,

2986
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,100
many years later he found where I moved to

2987
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,330
found out where my house was.

2988
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,610
I could never told him
my house the first place.

2989
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,290
And this guy sent me a letter.

2990
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,240
It was really creepy,

2991
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:17,660
man.

2992
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,830
I read this long.

2993
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:20,180
It was almost like a love letter to me.

2994
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:20,720
Oof.

2995
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,770
It was really creepy.

2996
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,230
And I just think if I see this guy,

2997
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:25,280
Jesus Christ,

2998
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,050
he was truly and red alert.

2999
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,541
I might,

3000
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:30,230
me and my buddy Michael and Saudi
Arabia in love with that Dick,

3001
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,630
he saw my juicy deck.

3002
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,450
That's what it was.

3003
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,340
That's the turning point.

3004
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:35,174
That's

3005
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,480
one of the most traumatic
experience for me.

3006
01:17:38,481 --> 01:17:39,740
I was in Saudi Arabia,

3007
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,390
my buddy Michael and it started,

3008
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:42,141
there was nowhere to place.

3009
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:45,440
He would just go play in these
like abandoned lots and you know,

3010
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:45,711
whatever.

3011
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:47,180
We find cars that were all,

3012
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:52,181
but he'd bring them up as you doing
with 13 year olds do 1413 and I'll never

3013
01:17:53,151 --> 01:17:53,541
forget,

3014
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:54,530
I see a guy,

3015
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,880
I couldn't understand
what the guy was doing it,

3016
01:17:56,890 --> 01:17:57,860
the trunk of his car.

3017
01:17:58,190 --> 01:17:58,461
I was like,

3018
01:17:58,461 --> 01:17:59,720
what is that guy doing?

3019
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,180
And I realized as I got closer,

3020
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,860
it was the most bizarre thing.

3021
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:08,330
There was a guy in the trunk of the
car with his ass out of the car.

3022
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,600
So he had his ass sticking
out of the trunk of the car,

3023
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,130
this giant hairy ass.

3024
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:17,990
And another guy had his robe lifted
up and he was standing there,

3025
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:21,830
Saudi Arabia fucking the guy in his ass,

3026
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:22,971
so I couldn't,

3027
01:18:22,971 --> 01:18:25,970
I could just see an ass sticking
out of a trunk and he had his,

3028
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,660
I was 13 and my friend
Michael and he was jamming.

3029
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,030
He was fucking him
standing up and I was like,

3030
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:32,953
and I go there.

3031
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,530
I go,

3032
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:33,691
oh,

3033
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:34,940
it's called cold either of us too.

3034
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:35,690
And I go,

3035
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:36,523
I see it.

3036
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,450
He looks at me and he didn't say anything.

3037
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:42,240
He just looks at me with
a blank expression as he's
just drilling some poor GIM

3038
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:45,160
in the in in some Cadillacs and hyper.

3039
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:45,501
I go,

3040
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:45,981
Michael,

3041
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:47,000
let's run away.

3042
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,133
I just,

3043
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,430
I've never run faster.

3044
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,271
You know what?

3045
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:51,590
You can't feel your legs.

3046
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:53,780
I was just like scared man.

3047
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:54,643
Yeah,

3048
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:55,101
Dude.

3049
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:57,410
I don't have any molest story then I do.

3050
01:18:57,411 --> 01:18:58,340
I have another one.

3051
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,470
I was in crazy one though to that guy.

3052
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,470
What did he do when he saw you running
away from not try to finish her fence?

3053
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,420
Just looked at me with heavy eyes.

3054
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,830
I kept banging.

3055
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:08,720
The dude kept thrusting.

3056
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,340
What do you think would have
happened if you just stood there?

3057
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:11,170
Like unimpressed,

3058
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:12,003
like

3059
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:15,163
style.

3060
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,433
Still dumb down.

3061
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:18,890
Let me know when you're done.

3062
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,300
I'll show you how it's done.

3063
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,260
Let me know when you're finished.

3064
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:23,030
Audience member ever at a comedy club.

3065
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:24,103
These guys.

3066
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,160
Oh,

3067
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,180
that's like the last thing you'd ever
want to see you doing that to him while

3068
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,890
he's fucking the guy
in the ass and a trunk.

3069
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,230
See better molested again.

3070
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:34,700
Broke.

3071
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:34,881
Well,

3072
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:35,091
no,

3073
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:35,871
I remember I was,

3074
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,430
I met an older dude and we were,

3075
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:37,910
we were,

3076
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:38,721
he was cool guy.

3077
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:39,554
We hung out.

3078
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,260
I always starts with a older dude.

3079
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,100
We were in Wisconsin sweatsuit,

3080
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:45,050
we're in Wisconsin.

3081
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:47,390
The Northwoods of Wisconsin
didn't summertimes.

3082
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,510
And I remember I meet this
guy and there was this girl,

3083
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:53,420
they're all two girls
older and we were like,

3084
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:53,781
oh,

3085
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:54,320
we were there.

3086
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:54,771
I don't know,

3087
01:19:54,771 --> 01:19:55,340
who cares?

3088
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,390
Let's say 14,

3089
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,770
13 or 14 it was so hot and I was 11,

3090
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:02,780
10 something even younger,

3091
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:03,410
younger.

3092
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,161
Cause I'll tell you why.

3093
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:06,230
I know I was younger so I,

3094
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,940
I'm hanging out with this and uh,

3095
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:09,331
can we,

3096
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:10,051
can we keep,

3097
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:10,860
we keep and I'm,

3098
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,000
I was such a little pervert.

3099
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,863
How old is he?

3100
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:13,820
Well,

3101
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,170
I'll tell you,

3102
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:14,581
I don't know,

3103
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:16,530
but I'm going to tell you how
I know he was a lot older.

3104
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:16,801
Ready?

3105
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:17,580
This is how you,

3106
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,000
this is,

3107
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,833
this is why I'm going,

3108
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,680
this is the point.

3109
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,540
So we start,

3110
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,330
I actually say we should
try sex with those girls.

3111
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,710
I'm trying to conspire,

3112
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:27,510
I don't know how old I was
on or at least I was like,

3113
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,460
we should try to see their boobs.

3114
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:30,211
I don't know what I was saying to him.

3115
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:30,391
He goes,

3116
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:30,601
yes,

3117
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:31,500
that's a great plan.

3118
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,460
So,

3119
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,020
so we're talking to come,

3120
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,030
we have to go to the woods
and come up with a plan.

3121
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,190
So No.

3122
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:37,331
Yeah.

3123
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:37,910
So I'm like,

3124
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:38,610
alright.

3125
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,790
So we go to the woods,

3126
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:43,800
have Devin and no wonder
you've been molested several.

3127
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,140
The next thing I know I,

3128
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,770
this is coming through me now.

3129
01:20:46,771 --> 01:20:47,221
The next thing I know,

3130
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:49,600
he pulls his pants down and
I notice how Harry is acid.

3131
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:50,521
So I go,

3132
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:51,310
that's weird.

3133
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:51,811
If there is,

3134
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:56,811
there's this dick and his ass and
he and he lies down and he goes,

3135
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:59,100
do you want her to want
to rub on top of me or no?

3136
01:20:59,400 --> 01:20:59,821
And I go,

3137
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,500
I don't think so.

3138
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:02,550
I was like,

3139
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,650
I was like rub on me or no,

3140
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,261
and I was young.

3141
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:06,094
I was young.

3142
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:08,650
I was young enough to
have to think about how,

3143
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:09,541
imagine if that's,

3144
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,160
he's like fucking go too long.

3145
01:21:11,161 --> 01:21:12,030
I swear to God.

3146
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,190
How do you get these
kids to fuck you dude.

3147
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,150
This is all you have to do.

3148
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,890
You lie down and you go,

3149
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:18,020
do you want to rub on top of me?

3150
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:18,660
No.

3151
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:20,280
I saw it was just start fucking you.

3152
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:25,630
Couple of kids go spit on your
ass and start pounding away.

3153
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:26,490
They all do it.

3154
01:21:26,491 --> 01:21:27,390
It's like hypnosis.

3155
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:30,540
What he laid down with her place straight
when he wasn't like he was bent lakes.

3156
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:32,250
They don't you want to
rub on top of me or no,

3157
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:32,850
and I go,

3158
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,620
I don't think I was just hearing ass.

3159
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:35,130
Yeah,

3160
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,120
I saw the crack and I was like,

3161
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:36,630
and I was like,

3162
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:37,560
do I say yes?

3163
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:38,071
I was like,

3164
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:39,330
this is vaguely sexual.

3165
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:39,930
And I go,

3166
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:40,471
no,

3167
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:40,981
I don't think so.

3168
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:43,380
So then he gets up and he goes,

3169
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:43,771
all right,

3170
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:45,600
we'll just hold off for
a second and he starts,

3171
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:46,411
I'm going to show you something.

3172
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:46,711
And I go,

3173
01:21:46,711 --> 01:21:47,040
all right.

3174
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,050
He starts jerking off and I go,

3175
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:50,310
Oh,

3176
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:50,970
I've done.

3177
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:51,940
I take all my two,

3178
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:52,110
two,

3179
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:52,300
two.

3180
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,260
I used to rub it on the bed to
test when my mother called it.

3181
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,050
So I go,

3182
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,471
so he's,

3183
01:21:57,471 --> 01:21:57,781
he's,

3184
01:21:57,781 --> 01:22:00,300
he's winking off and that
was the first time he goes,

3185
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:00,571
hold on,

3186
01:22:00,571 --> 01:22:00,930
ready,

3187
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,350
ready?

3188
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,950
And I go,

3189
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,430
yeah,

3190
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:04,410
and he comes on you,

3191
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:05,660
he busted in your face.

3192
01:22:05,661 --> 01:22:06,211
Not on my face.

3193
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:07,110
He just shoot.

3194
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:07,621
And I go,

3195
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:08,520
what the fuck?

3196
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:09,240
I go,

3197
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,021
what's that white?

3198
01:22:10,021 --> 01:22:12,870
I couldn't believe as soon seeing white
stuff is the first time I saw somebody,

3199
01:22:12,871 --> 01:22:13,500
a jacket.

3200
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,330
Hold on.

3201
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:14,940
Jeez.

3202
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,570
You were watching this dude jack off
in the woods for a solid four minutes.

3203
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:19,463
Hey Man,

3204
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,240
what were you saying to him?

3205
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,470
I don't remember.

3206
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:23,131
It was so long ago.

3207
01:22:23,131 --> 01:22:25,350
He goes to Jim on,

3208
01:22:25,351 --> 01:22:25,780
hold on.

3209
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,290
You called this Mr. Yeah,

3210
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,020
hold on.

3211
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:28,321
He was like,

3212
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:28,711
watch this,

3213
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:29,310
wait for it.

3214
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:29,731
Wait a minute,

3215
01:22:29,731 --> 01:22:30,090
hold on.

3216
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:30,860
Wait for it.

3217
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:31,693
Yeah.

3218
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:32,920
And then we went,

3219
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,770
then we left and we went
and spied on those girls.

3220
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,540
You hung out with him after that?

3221
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:40,320
I did a shirt that you watched a
grown man Jack off bus near you.

3222
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,220
Not on your face.

3223
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:42,570
Then you went to go find chicks.

3224
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,621
So you know what man,

3225
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:45,000
when you were 11 years old,

3226
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,440
Weird Shit can happen to
this 11 year old hockey.

3227
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,171
Hell No.

3228
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:49,861
You got lucky.

3229
01:22:49,861 --> 01:22:51,300
But I'm not saying that
would have happened.

3230
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:52,860
You would've stood around
while the guy jerked off.

3231
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:57,300
But I am saying it's possible that a guy
when you were 11 could have lied down

3232
01:22:57,301 --> 01:22:57,571
and say,

3233
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:57,841
Hey,

3234
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:59,160
you want to rub on top of me or no?

3235
01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,971
And you would have been like,

3236
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:02,040
what the fuck you would have said no.

3237
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:06,520
100% no I didn't say no for sure.

3238
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:06,851
No,

3239
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:10,010
I don't thought about it cause I
thought that looks like pure Breslin.

3240
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:10,960
The guide be down there.

3241
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:11,890
You might be surprised.

3242
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:15,670
I was surprised.

3243
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,640
10 that's a girl I could rub against that.

3244
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:19,990
If it's a girl,

3245
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:20,410
what?

3246
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:20,621
Wait,

3247
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,454
hold on.

3248
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,470
You revealing.

3249
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:24,110
Just like,

3250
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:25,080
is this a confession?

3251
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:30,500
You want it to last a little bit of it
out and we were talking about funny shit.

3252
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:30,761
You're like,

3253
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:30,811
no,

3254
01:23:30,811 --> 01:23:30,901
no,

3255
01:23:30,901 --> 01:23:30,951
no,

3256
01:23:30,951 --> 01:23:31,031
no.

3257
01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:32,740
I still have to add some stuff that I did.

3258
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,390
That was because I was thinking about

3259
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:41,650
this just last week guys and I looked
like the iron sheik in his prime

3260
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:44,320
gets fuck

3261
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,080
monster hairy asshole smells like woods.

3262
01:23:49,081 --> 01:23:53,800
Another fucking bothers me about the
story is you watched him for several

3263
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:53,801
minutes,

3264
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:54,634
Jack.

3265
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:55,643
Sure did.

3266
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,553
I didn't know.

3267
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,720
I just didn't know what was
found a video of the guy.

3268
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:00,790
We have the guy pull up that video of my,

3269
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:01,150
uh,

3270
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:04,870
on my Twitter feed of the Russian dude
doing kettle bells in the snow with no

3271
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:05,704
shirt on.

3272
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,990
This is why you shouldn't
fuck with Russians.

3273
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,170
There are different kinds of human and
everybody's freaking out about this Putin

3274
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:15,280
stuff like Putin assassinate or allegedly
Putin is actually investigating it and

3275
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:16,510
he's quite upset that he's,

3276
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,250
and he wrote a letter to the guy's mother.

3277
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,540
So anyway,

3278
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,770
bottom line is to,

3279
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,090
Russia is a different fucking,

3280
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,070
it's a different beast.

3281
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:23,860
He's,

3282
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,530
he's still stuck on the
jacking off this dude.

3283
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,050
There's a video.

3284
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:27,491
This dude,

3285
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:31,990
he's in the fucking snow in Russia
and he's doing the man maker.

3286
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,370
It's on the Keith level.

3287
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,011
Weber,

3288
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:36,100
a Kettlebell cardio workout series.

3289
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,360
He does the entire,

3290
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:37,720
uh,

3291
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,860
the entire man maker.

3292
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,780
No fucking shirt on.

3293
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,490
Run the winter.

3294
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,890
Hard to tell how much that
kettlebell ways it's he,

3295
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:46,300
it depends on the construction of it.

3296
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:48,550
It's either 35 pounds or 50 pounds.

3297
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,510
That honored bill.

3298
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,050
No,

3299
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:50,321
no.

3300
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:51,940
This is the motherland.

3301
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,110
They don't want on it up there.

3302
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:53,973
It's probably about,

3303
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:54,281
it's probably,

3304
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:56,470
it looks about 50 pounds
right in shape too.

3305
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:56,740
Yeah.

3306
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,221
Oh fuck.

3307
01:24:57,221 --> 01:24:57,361
Yeah.

3308
01:24:57,361 --> 01:24:57,581
He is.

3309
01:24:57,581 --> 01:24:58,391
Watch them do this shit,

3310
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:59,224
man.

3311
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,340
The dude's stacked.

3312
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,740
He does this with no shirt on.

3313
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,800
He ain't fucking Russia in the winter.

3314
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:09,310
And he talks Russian to
his dog who waits for him.

3315
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:10,623
You know why?

3316
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:10,901
You know,

3317
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:11,890
why different briefs?

3318
01:25:11,891 --> 01:25:14,560
That's guys throwing this fucking
50 pound kettlebell round.

3319
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:15,371
Like it ain't shit.

3320
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,450
And he's doing it over and over again.

3321
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:18,400
Switch hands and neck size.

3322
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:19,234
Russian history.

3323
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,590
That's was a distillation process.

3324
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,290
Deep.

3325
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:24,850
Some warrior genetics
you're looking at here.

3326
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:26,680
This guy's all fucking stud.

3327
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:27,311
Oh by the way,

3328
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:30,700
he might be 70 on both of you are lucky
this then the guy who's trying to fuck

3329
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:31,534
both of you.

3330
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:32,980
Damn right about that.

3331
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,050
Well he listened to like a tall fellow.

3332
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,790
He's not a very big phony short for sure.

3333
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:40,930
But this guy's a tank cause
he's rattling these fucking,

3334
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,280
I mean I don't know how much that weighs.

3335
01:25:42,281 --> 01:25:43,720
It might only be 35 pounds

3336
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:46,540
heavier.

3337
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,650
Looks like a 50 to me.

3338
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:48,481
I looked like a sound.

3339
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:49,240
How fever?

3340
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:49,541
No,

3341
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:50,830
it would be 72 I think.

3342
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:52,690
70 or 72 heavy Joe.

3343
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,411
I don't know.

3344
01:25:53,411 --> 01:25:54,850
It might be the size of his head.

3345
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,091
Yeah,

3346
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:57,400
but there's some ones that they
make that are really light.

3347
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,540
It looked like that,

3348
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,920
but they're really light.

3349
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:00,910
I'm going to say that's heavy.

3350
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:02,500
Like if you see those colored ones,

3351
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:03,590
he ever see the that are colored

3352
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:04,810
light.

3353
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:06,860
It's fun and they're big.

3354
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,641
They look like you're,

3355
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:10,640
you're using superhuman strength
and it's like 30 pounds.

3356
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:11,401
But that same,

3357
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:12,410
that thing is as big as that.

3358
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:13,160
His Russian hat,

3359
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,090
he's got a Russian hat that looks like a,

3360
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,821
like a real,

3361
01:26:15,821 --> 01:26:18,240
a dragon door style or
one of the Onnit ones.

3362
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,370
It's all cast iron.

3363
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:20,091
If that's the case,

3364
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:22,640
that's probably 50 pounds is just
way tough for them to look at this

3365
01:26:22,641 --> 01:26:23,390
motherfucker.

3366
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,650
He's just switching hands clean press
the whole entire time we've been talking.

3367
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:28,880
This guy has never taken a break.

3368
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:31,490
It's just thrown around this 50
pound Kettlebell kinda awesome.

3369
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,840
I gotta I gotta take my Kettlebell
workouts way more serious.

3370
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,050
Those ankle weights and fucking
let's get physical socks.

3371
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:42,820
The people behind them freezing
a lot of raw live there.

3372
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:43,693
Better wins.

3373
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,810
That's a good time to live there.

3374
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:45,260
Huh?

3375
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,190
This guy's an animal.

3376
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,640
This is the best way to
stay warm in the winter.

3377
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:50,630
Just keep doing this.

3378
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,970
Maybe this is a strategy.

3379
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:56,450
You know how you go to those cryotherapy
places and they keep the inflammation

3380
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:57,200
down?

3381
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,200
Maybe if you do like fucking
heavy workouts like this
while you in the middle of

3382
01:27:02,691 --> 01:27:03,524
a snowstorm,

3383
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,270
it might actually aid your performance.

3384
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,200
Bad idea.

3385
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,071
You know what I'm saying?

3386
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:08,690
Because like you know
what this guy's doing,

3387
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,250
this is all about the burnout.

3388
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:12,200
These are all like high rep exercises.

3389
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:13,730
He's doing everything flowing,

3390
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:14,690
had blood's flowing,

3391
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,690
pushing the inflammation out.

3392
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,210
He's doing one arm presses
and then full deep squats.

3393
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,520
So this guy in the course
of us watching him,

3394
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:24,020
we're assuming that's about 50 pounds,

3395
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,250
has probably done like what?

3396
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:30,020
30 or 40 deep squats with that 50
pound kettle bell over his head and he

3397
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:31,010
continues to do it.

3398
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:32,023
He's an animal.

3399
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:32,330
Yeah,

3400
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:32,691
he's in there.

3401
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:33,520
I look at them,

3402
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,550
but doing it like this,

3403
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,301
watts freezing,

3404
01:27:35,301 --> 01:27:36,200
I would no shirt on it.

3405
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:36,980
Also,

3406
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,150
it makes you keep the pace up.

3407
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:39,260
You don't want to get cold.

3408
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,070
Those socks.

3409
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:40,440
Chow.

3410
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,091
That's a child.

3411
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:42,350
The dog is a child that isn't gentle.

3412
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:43,310
Socks are perfect.

3413
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:44,900
He's got Olivia Newton,

3414
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:47,240
John Blair and his Russian built car,

3415
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,291
I think their ankles,

3416
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,610
my Funko windmills,

3417
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,240
son,

3418
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:50,870
windmills.

3419
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,640
After all this with that 50 pounds,

3420
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,590
that shit is not easy.

3421
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,990
I guess that's a challenge.

3422
01:27:55,991 --> 01:27:56,824
It's one of those,

3423
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:57,141
yeah,

3424
01:27:57,141 --> 01:27:59,270
that's what we're pushing
dog and that's a chow.

3425
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,040
It's 100% chow.

3426
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:02,030
100% chat.

3427
01:28:02,031 --> 01:28:02,540
By the way,

3428
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:03,610
are they rushing to say,

3429
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:03,840
oh,

3430
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,521
there they are.

3431
01:28:04,521 --> 01:28:05,360
Chinese.

3432
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:05,951
Yeah,

3433
01:28:05,951 --> 01:28:06,980
he's right next to Russia.

3434
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:07,933
A good point.

3435
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,780
All right,

3436
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,410
motherfucker.

3437
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,180
Dead thing wandered into his yard one day.

3438
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,291
Come with me,

3439
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:12,861
your friend.

3440
01:28:12,861 --> 01:28:13,694
Comrade.

3441
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,211
Comrade.

3442
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:15,320
You live with me.

3443
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,540
I give your scripts.

3444
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:17,330
Get little bells.

3445
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,390
You Bark when people come to me and die.

3446
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,120
Kill a little bit on this.

3447
01:28:22,121 --> 01:28:22,791
I see as this one.

3448
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:23,870
The fuckers working hard.

3449
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,250
That's a hundred reps deep though.

3450
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:25,521
Yeah,

3451
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:26,360
he's working hard,

3452
01:28:26,361 --> 01:28:26,601
man.

3453
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:26,720
Yeah,

3454
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,340
he's a stout little man.

3455
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:32,360
This is a savage fucking workout for a
no shirted man in the middle of the snow.

3456
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,960
That dude once rape kids were all fuck
that dog doesn't give a fuck about the

3457
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:36,231
cold.

3458
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:36,561
By the way.

3459
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:37,040
I look at him.

3460
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,500
That dog might have no experience on.

3461
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,410
Yeah,

3462
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:40,820
it's pretty dope to be a dog like that.

3463
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:41,840
And I live in a place like that.

3464
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,220
Everybody else is suffering.

3465
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,240
Let's take this thing and do you think
homeless dogs have the best just the best

3466
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:48,320
lives of any dog?

3467
01:28:48,321 --> 01:28:51,380
Cause they're outside all the
time and so they do feed them,

3468
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,040
but they're out.

3469
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,491
You know what I'm saying?

3470
01:28:52,491 --> 01:28:54,560
Like this raise their
dogs are pack animals.

3471
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:56,150
So as long as they have a pack to be with,

3472
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:56,660
yes,

3473
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,380
they're alone.

3474
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:57,660
No,

3475
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:57,930
no,

3476
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:58,161
no.

3477
01:28:58,161 --> 01:28:59,210
I'm saying they have a owner,

3478
01:28:59,211 --> 01:28:59,991
but he's homeless.

3479
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:02,140
This Russian mother fucker
has not stopped at somebody.

3480
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:06,810
He's a dub us talking about this guy
over his video and send it to them.

3481
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:07,753
Respect,

3482
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:08,880
respect,

3483
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,420
respect.

3484
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,680
We give to you respect.

3485
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:11,100
Sure.

3486
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:11,880
He's a bad ass.

3487
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,600
Fucking savage.

3488
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:12,930
Look at him.

3489
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:13,763
He's still going.

3490
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:15,323
He's still going.

3491
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,200
That guy.

3492
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,520
That's a lot of Goddamn reps.

3493
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:18,930
This guy's got a really good shit.

3494
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:19,830
He's a crossfitter.

3495
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:21,423
Please.

3496
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,300
Little didn't salt the pleas from mother
lent these sorts of kettle bells then I

3497
01:29:26,301 --> 01:29:26,770
do.

3498
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:27,050
Gosh,

3499
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:29,760
I drink vodka all night.

3500
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,550
Have you ever seen that picture of
young fade or in front of kettle bells?

3501
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,270
No.

3502
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:38,250
Maybe one of the best pictures ever
have a fucking post training session.

3503
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:41,190
Really that training session,

3504
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:44,520
great super athletes cause the kettle
bells being a Russian invention.

3505
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:45,121
You know,

3506
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:46,240
like you see fade or widow.

3507
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:47,430
His kettle bells around him.

3508
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:51,810
It sort of signifies like this was a
different motherfucking man made from iron

3509
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:52,890
sambo champion.

3510
01:29:52,990 --> 01:29:53,590
Oh,

3511
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:56,070
booking photo God damn son.

3512
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,520
And he was thin while he
had very little body fat,

3513
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:00,960
but he was very thick muscle.

3514
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:02,250
Look at them back on that.

3515
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,710
He had a less body fat
back then but more muscle.

3516
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:05,550
He was a big fucker.

3517
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,151
But that's also,

3518
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:06,984
he's pumped.

3519
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:10,080
Like he's probably just worked out and
once you get real thick cause you're all

3520
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:10,621
pumped up,

3521
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:12,740
you don't get more masculine Danette.

3522
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:13,170
That dude?

3523
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:13,670
Nah.

3524
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:15,750
How about the fact that he
never gave a fuck about his gut?

3525
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:18,820
He's rushing.

3526
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:19,650
Give a fuck.

3527
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,790
Just one in there dropping bombs.

3528
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,624
He married,

3529
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,970
he's been married and
divorced a couple of times.

3530
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,230
He does paintings and shit.

3531
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,190
Yeah he does.

3532
01:30:26,191 --> 01:30:28,390
He does art like drawings and she goes,

3533
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,640
not the best shit you've ever seen.

3534
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:30,281
Well it's not bad.

3535
01:30:30,281 --> 01:30:31,800
It's like cartoon weird.

3536
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:32,251
It's weird.

3537
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:35,040
It's like the shit like a
real serial killer thinks.

3538
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:35,630
Oh for sure.

3539
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:36,211
Well no they're not.

3540
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:39,030
They're smashing people's heads and his
brother's a fighter and was spent a lot

3541
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:39,511
of time in jail.

3542
01:30:39,511 --> 01:30:40,350
I think Wright brothers,

3543
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,490
a maniac,

3544
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:44,340
call level prison tattoos like his,

3545
01:30:44,341 --> 01:30:45,330
his on his back.

3546
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,090
There's a picture of like the
angel of death holding a baby.

3547
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,940
Well that's not case prison tattoo shit.

3548
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:51,720
You never seen it.

3549
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,060
We'll get,

3550
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:52,893
we'll pull that up.

3551
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:54,840
Alexander a million INCOSE tattoos.

3552
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:56,310
He's in jail right now for rape.

3553
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,233
Oh No.

3554
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:57,750
Yeah,

3555
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,710
I don't really buy night.

3556
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,131
He did it,

3557
01:30:59,131 --> 01:30:59,701
but he has,

3558
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:00,990
he's definitely an alcoholic.

3559
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:04,890
He definitely gets drunk and he's very
different than fade or was fate or is

3560
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:06,300
like completely composed,

3561
01:31:06,301 --> 01:31:07,440
like very disciplined.

3562
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,410
Alexander also had some like
some significant losses,

3563
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:12,600
like he lost in pride to Mirko.

3564
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,560
Mirko head kicked him.

3565
01:31:13,561 --> 01:31:14,070
Yup.

3566
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,460
Yeah.

3567
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,091
But this is like,

3568
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:15,860
look at his back.

3569
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:17,790
It's like the angel of
death holding a baby.

3570
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,080
It's weird.

3571
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:19,320
Yeah.

3572
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:19,921
He's got weird.

3573
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:22,080
Like he had these ones on his,

3574
01:31:22,081 --> 01:31:22,914
um,

3575
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:23,850
on his shoulders,

3576
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:25,470
but he had them taken off.

3577
01:31:25,471 --> 01:31:28,230
It was like they had these
gang tattoos on his shoulders,

3578
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,260
but he had them removed and
change to some sort of pattern.

3579
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,220
He's a,

3580
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,053
he's a,

3581
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,190
you think anyone's fucking
with that guy in prison?

3582
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:36,180
Jesus Christ.

3583
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,230
Not a good idea.

3584
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:40,980
He's got kind of knocked James
Thompson out in about 15 seconds,

3585
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:42,210
right?

3586
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:42,451
Yeah.

3587
01:31:42,451 --> 01:31:43,380
He's a beast dude.

3588
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,141
Alexander million.

3589
01:31:44,141 --> 01:31:45,360
Nicole was abused,

3590
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:46,290
you know,

3591
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:47,970
I mean he got knocked out by cro cop,

3592
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:51,690
but he fought cro cop when
cro cop was just on fire.

3593
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:52,830
Do you think that there's,

3594
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:53,910
there's dudes that just like,

3595
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:55,890
they hit this like Bj Penn level,

3596
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:58,890
like Bj Penn when he beat Sanchez.

3597
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,790
Bj Penn when you know,

3598
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,610
he was like at his very best.

3599
01:32:02,611 --> 01:32:04,390
Like this is only like a couple of years.

3600
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:05,800
You can keep that intensity.

3601
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:07,150
I think it's only a couple of fights.

3602
01:32:07,151 --> 01:32:08,060
I don't even think it's a year.

3603
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,303
Yeah.

3604
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,980
Do you think that maybe that's
where Cain is right now.

3605
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:13,540
That's why he's getting
all these injuries.

3606
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,610
That's his fucking junior dos Santos wars.

3607
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:17,470
We just so insanely taxing.

3608
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,560
I think junior junior is not the
same after those awards either.

3609
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:21,011
No,

3610
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:21,731
I don't think so either.

3611
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:22,810
But you got to remember too,

3612
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:23,830
back in those pride days,

3613
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:25,660
those guys were fighting
a lot more frequent.

3614
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:30,370
So we got the seed the very best when
they're at their prime and now in the UFC,

3615
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:30,551
you know,

3616
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:31,180
you fight,

3617
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:31,491
if you,

3618
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:32,201
if you,

3619
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:33,790
if you're a start two times a year,

3620
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,560
maybe three granted people and say,

3621
01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:37,150
Oh cowboy that I'm talking about.

3622
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,250
You know when a guy got a superstar,

3623
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:42,010
he's fighting maybe twice a year
now think it was back in the day,

3624
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:42,761
we'd see him three,

3625
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:43,570
four times.

3626
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:45,400
And you remember when they
used to make these fights,

3627
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:48,120
they there put the fight together within
like three or four weeks of the fight.

3628
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:48,380
Yeah,

3629
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:48,880
it would be like,

3630
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,120
it would be like what happened in the UFC
when there's a fallout would happen in

3631
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:53,260
pride all the time.

3632
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,680
It would happen in pride instead of like
you having like eight weeks to prepare.

3633
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:58,540
Like they would tell you
like a couple of weeks out.

3634
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,580
Like occasionally there
would be like a long wait.

3635
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:01,810
You knew like when uh,

3636
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,190
the Open Weight Grand Prix tournament
pretty much we knew who it was.

3637
01:33:06,191 --> 01:33:07,690
But then last minute like guys,

3638
01:33:07,691 --> 01:33:08,381
we're getting added.

3639
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:10,780
Josh Barnett I think was a
one of the later additions.

3640
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:11,920
I might be wrong about that though.

3641
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:13,600
But I mean you look at that lineup,

3642
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:15,550
Barnett Nogueira Cro,

3643
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:17,070
cop hunt like Jesus,

3644
01:33:17,071 --> 01:33:21,070
fuck the same price in those days
cause motherfuckers on the planet.

3645
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,180
Yeah,

3646
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:22,500
it's,

3647
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:22,900
it's,

3648
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,960
it's interesting when you
think about that time,

3649
01:33:25,961 --> 01:33:27,730
the wild west days of a,

3650
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:28,361
of pride.

3651
01:33:28,361 --> 01:33:31,360
No head stomps and soccer
kicks on the ground.

3652
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:32,990
When Vandelay fought to Maura,

3653
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:35,680
it was holding off the rope
and stomping on his face.

3654
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,750
Bro was cro cop fuck Ron.

3655
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:41,050
Ron Waterman and soccer
kicked him in the face.

3656
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,480
I forgot about that flight.

3657
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:44,050
Yeah.

3658
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:45,520
And Brian wanted me to ate it too.

3659
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:46,640
He ate a couple of water,

3660
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:47,070
a lot of them.

3661
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:48,470
It was one of my first training partners.

3662
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,010
Big flat me out with his titties.

3663
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,190
Got It in my garden.

3664
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,910
Just smothered me with this.

3665
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:56,380
Teddy's that strong man.

3666
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:56,521
Oh,

3667
01:33:56,521 --> 01:33:57,340
it's broke my nose.

3668
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,173
Yeah.

3669
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,440
I knew nothing at the time.

3670
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:03,490
My training partner was Ron watermen
in Shanghai with my first two training

3671
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:03,990
partners.

3672
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:07,650
So they were just rotating
on me and just dismantled me.

3673
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,351
Terrible idea.

3674
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:09,460
I wish I was your friend back then.

3675
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:10,443
That'd been

3676
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:12,753
nice.

3677
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:14,501
No one says,

3678
01:34:14,501 --> 01:34:15,150
Shit Dude,

3679
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,570
this Shane Shane was like,

3680
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:17,680
now it's making the tough man.

3681
01:34:17,681 --> 01:34:17,880
I'm like,

3682
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:18,640
I know.

3683
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:18,971
I'm like,

3684
01:34:18,971 --> 01:34:19,541
I know man.

3685
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:22,080
But he liked tap me out with his
titties and super embarrassed.

3686
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:22,991
It's happening.

3687
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,940
You have the titties is
the least of your concerns.

3688
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,800
That is the least of your concerns.

3689
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:27,634
We didn't spar.

3690
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,300
I'll thank God.

3691
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,200
But you know what Ron?

3692
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:33,130
Ron used to whoop my ass and then
four years down the road be shoveled,

3693
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:33,910
work on stand up.

3694
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:34,950
And he comes into spar.

3695
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:36,460
Yes,

3696
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,410
me and Shane put it on him.

3697
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,850
Well he was a big guy,

3698
01:34:39,851 --> 01:34:41,020
but he didn't move that good.

3699
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:41,411
No,

3700
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:43,630
he's real stiff but so strong.

3701
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:45,940
Crazy strong.

3702
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,560
Do you remember Dan [inaudible]?

3703
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:48,940
No.

3704
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:52,060
God Damn Damn Bovis was
dude who was in the,

3705
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:57,100
he lost a Mark Kerr in the UFC where Kirk
got on top of them is stuck his chin.

3706
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,130
His eye socket.

3707
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:00,220
Well used to be allowed to uh,

3708
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,270
stick your chin in someone's eye socket.

3709
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,310
So Dude's would get ahold of your head.

3710
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,440
They would shove their chin like you get,

3711
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,120
like they'll get the mount
or something like that.

3712
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:08,271
You know,

3713
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:11,450
any position where they get on top of
and they can balance out and they would

3714
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:14,750
get their hand behind your head and
then get your fucking Chin right in your

3715
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,210
eyeball.

3716
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,730
Just squeeze and you know your,

3717
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,900
your eyes on fire,

3718
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:19,130
you get blowout fractures,

3719
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:21,440
your eyes guys are seeing sparks and shit.

3720
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:22,340
Shit,

3721
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:25,740
you got a giant man like Martin never
thought of that and that's fine.

3722
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:28,430
If you could find that is a mark.

3723
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,370
Kerr taps Dan Bobe ish with his chin.

3724
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,581
Yeah,

3725
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:32,121
it was there,

3726
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:32,451
dude.

3727
01:35:32,451 --> 01:35:33,500
I interviewed him afterwards.

3728
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:35,690
There was the glory days
when I lie jacked up.

3729
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,351
Oh yeah.

3730
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:37,280
He had a tap man.

3731
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,540
Suddenly you have the best body
and those American flag shorts.

3732
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:42,441
Any bird.

3733
01:35:42,441 --> 01:35:43,160
Nice guy too.

3734
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:43,371
Yeah.

3735
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:44,204
Great Guy.

3736
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:44,670
Cruz,

3737
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:48,950
this guy mark marker two 62 60.

3738
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:49,940
Always a very,

3739
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:50,660
very cool dude.

3740
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,190
Regardless of what was
going on in his life.

3741
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:55,610
If you saw Mark Curry was your
boy Ken shamrock explaining again.

3742
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:55,941
Yeah,

3743
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:56,930
he's fighting Kimbo.

3744
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,571
Yeah.

3745
01:35:59,571 --> 01:36:01,070
And you don't want to
say I liked about it.

3746
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:01,491
What he said,

3747
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:01,821
he goes,

3748
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:02,240
uh,

3749
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:02,571
he goes,

3750
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:04,070
I've earned the right to fight for fun.

3751
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:04,521
He goes,

3752
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:04,731
yeah,

3753
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:05,660
I'm doing it for money.

3754
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:06,000
You know,

3755
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,980
you know I'm a professional,

3756
01:36:06,981 --> 01:36:08,450
but I've earned the
right to fight for fun.

3757
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,110
He goes,

3758
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:09,551
I don't want it.

3759
01:36:09,551 --> 01:36:09,771
He goes,

3760
01:36:09,771 --> 01:36:10,820
I don't want to go play golf.

3761
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:11,271
He goes,

3762
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:12,200
I don't want to go hiking.

3763
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:13,310
I don't want to go hunting.

3764
01:36:13,311 --> 01:36:14,091
I don't want to go fishing.

3765
01:36:14,091 --> 01:36:14,271
He goes,

3766
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:15,104
I like fighting.

3767
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:15,651
He goes,

3768
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:18,140
I like the comradery that comes
or preparing for a big fight.

3769
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:18,830
I enjoy it,

3770
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:20,090
but I'd love the way he
said it and you know,

3771
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:22,610
it's like very honest and
refreshing and it's true.

3772
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:23,444
He did it.

3773
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,730
God Damn all times legend.

3774
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,593
He's a legend,

3775
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:26,901
you know,

3776
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:27,650
and all the famous,

3777
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,110
and he had some fucking great
technique back in the day,

3778
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:30,440
man.

3779
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,490
Ken shamrock man,

3780
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,750
go to the early UFC.

3781
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:35,120
He tap Pat Smith and fucked his leg up.

3782
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:37,530
That heel hook can Shamran
dropdown for that heat.

3783
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,960
Pat Smith had no idea what
the fuck was going on.

3784
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:43,310
I was fighting in Japan right way
before fight in Pancrase fought.

3785
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,040
He fought a bunch of cars.

3786
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,430
We Fun Pride for a while.

3787
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,780
He had some good fights in pride.

3788
01:36:47,781 --> 01:36:48,110
Man.

3789
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:49,080
Ken shamrock had some,

3790
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,720
he was developing some pretty decent stand
up like remember that fight where um,

3791
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,141
you know,

3792
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:54,711
like the PD,

3793
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:55,131
my heart,

3794
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:56,390
like you had something
going on with his heart,

3795
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,490
like his heart was beating too
fast and one of his fights,

3796
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,190
I remember that like
they stopped the fight.

3797
01:37:00,191 --> 01:37:02,990
I think it was Fujita but he was
putting it on them before that.

3798
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:05,300
Like I was really impressed
with his star is striking.

3799
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:09,830
Like Ken Shamrock doesn't
get enough credit because
he fought Tito Ortiz when he

3800
01:37:09,831 --> 01:37:14,570
was already past his prime and his knee
was fucked up when he fought Tito the

3801
01:37:14,571 --> 01:37:15,590
first time he fought Tito.

3802
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:17,030
He basically didn't have an ACL.

3803
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:17,450
Wow.

3804
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:18,560
Like he was fucked up.

3805
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:22,520
I was at that fight with you and
after the fight it was crazy.

3806
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,880
Like,

3807
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,121
you know,

3808
01:37:23,121 --> 01:37:24,170
Tito is still mad at him.

3809
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,250
And Ken said to him,

3810
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,411
he's just real honest about it.

3811
01:37:26,411 --> 01:37:26,541
He goes,

3812
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:26,841
hey man,

3813
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:27,674
we made some money.

3814
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:27,890
You know,

3815
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,300
we made some money so let it go you,

3816
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:29,720
you won.

3817
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,553
Congratulations.

3818
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,790
And he gave him a hug and like,

3819
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:34,130
you could see Tito like notice
what we calm down and he'll,

3820
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,900
Tito was still mad even
after he kicked his ass.

3821
01:37:35,901 --> 01:37:36,920
Cause all the trash talking.

3822
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:37,701
Ken's like,

3823
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:38,061
look,

3824
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:38,841
look what happens.

3825
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:39,920
Like all this trash talk.

3826
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:41,420
We'd both made a lot of money.

3827
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:42,470
It's over you one,

3828
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:42,741
you know,

3829
01:37:42,741 --> 01:37:42,861
like,

3830
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:42,981
yeah,

3831
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:45,320
but then we can very
mellow handled though.

3832
01:37:45,321 --> 01:37:46,240
Then they the second

3833
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,800
money get mad.

3834
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:50,081
Yeah,

3835
01:37:50,081 --> 01:37:50,570
you're right.

3836
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:51,920
Get this money son.

3837
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:52,960
I remember you and I were,

3838
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,560
we talked to Tito after that fight.

3839
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,800
I remember that long time ago.

3840
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:56,634
We went there.

3841
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:57,030
Well,

3842
01:37:57,030 --> 01:38:01,140
I ran into Ken at a diner at
like one o'clock in the morning,

3843
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:04,090
the night of the fight
he was eating and uh,

3844
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,920
identify that before it like,

3845
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:07,480
you know,

3846
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,400
it was into the morning.

3847
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:09,270
I just want to talk in the morning,

3848
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:09,651
the day of,

3849
01:38:09,651 --> 01:38:11,850
if he's going to fight the next
day when he's out at a diner.

3850
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:12,870
And uh,

3851
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:13,800
he was real,

3852
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,240
he had been through so much,

3853
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:16,290
just fought so many times.

3854
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:17,341
He goes,

3855
01:38:17,341 --> 01:38:17,860
hey man.

3856
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:18,121
He goes,

3857
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:19,320
it only hurts after it's over.

3858
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:20,423
Yeah.

3859
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,881
That's going.

3860
01:38:20,881 --> 01:38:21,840
He's like laughing about it.

3861
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:22,081
He's like,

3862
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:23,250
so I'm going to go fight tomorrow.

3863
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,230
Like that was his attitude about it.

3864
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:27,720
This is Mark Kerr and Dan mobish.

3865
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:31,200
Let's see if we could see the video of
him putting his fucking chicken is eye.

3866
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:33,210
So he got them in side control.

3867
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,433
Beautiful back.

3868
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,340
Certainly did and but Dan
Babish is God damn enormous.

3869
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:40,050
I look at it,

3870
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,460
look at,

3871
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,690
just to see the way he's
grabbing his head with his arm.

3872
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:46,050
So he gets inside control
and he gets on top of him.

3873
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:46,740
Can you see it?

3874
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:47,573
They have a good angle.

3875
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,230
Poor production team back then.

3876
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,213
Full mouth.

3877
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,080
Chin in the eyeball.

3878
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,840
You can't see it and that angle,

3879
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:55,703
man,

3880
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:57,480
I'll maybe can't see it.

3881
01:38:57,481 --> 01:38:58,080
I don't think.

3882
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:58,913
I don't think they have a,

3883
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,000
he goes to mountain here will be.

3884
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:00,601
That was it.

3885
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,470
I mean that was the tap.

3886
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:02,130
It's over.

3887
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:03,420
But this is the full sequence.

3888
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,733
Let's see it.

3889
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,133
Look how strong.

3890
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,221
She's like,

3891
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:08,521
bitch,

3892
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:09,750
you ain't going nowhere.

3893
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,311
Mark Curve back.

3894
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:13,650
And then I saw that one 88 in college too,

3895
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:14,693
by the way.

3896
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:14,851
Well,

3897
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:15,301
you know what,

3898
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:15,571
man,

3899
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:17,280
he had a lot of Korean team in his diet.

3900
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:18,150
He certainly did.

3901
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:18,984
And um,

3902
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,381
he's,

3903
01:39:19,381 --> 01:39:23,400
he's fine with pride and he
definitely didn't take steroids then.

3904
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:23,860
Right?

3905
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:24,311
Is that true?

3906
01:39:24,311 --> 01:39:25,680
It'd be crazy to assume that.

3907
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:26,971
Well,

3908
01:39:26,971 --> 01:39:27,750
you know what man,

3909
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:28,590
that documentary,

3910
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:30,480
it was super brave smashing machines.

3911
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:31,470
Super brave of him.

3912
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:36,060
I mean he basically left them document
his ascension into drug addiction and a

3913
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:38,640
lot of that came from fighting
like painkillers and shit.

3914
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:41,190
He got addicted to and it was everything.

3915
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:41,791
Steroids,

3916
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:42,511
painkillers,

3917
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:45,070
like he's a great guy.

3918
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:46,220
And let me seen that documentary.

3919
01:39:46,221 --> 01:39:46,950
It's good.

3920
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:47,161
Yeah,

3921
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:47,994
it's pretty good.

3922
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:52,410
This is actually pretty
fucking good technique here
for the day or passing guard

3923
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:53,890
is Kurt was a hell mouth.

3924
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,200
Our big collegiate wrestlers,

3925
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:56,131
we sound like boats.

3926
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:57,150
He can't really see it here,

3927
01:39:57,151 --> 01:39:58,260
but he's got his chin in.

3928
01:39:58,261 --> 01:40:00,620
His fucking eyeballs are going to
grab his eye looking at grandma's.

3929
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:02,240
I look at him say,

3930
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:03,661
yeah,

3931
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:05,720
I remember that man that was back in,

3932
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:08,090
look at the size hard.

3933
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,890
God Damn,

3934
01:40:10,891 --> 01:40:11,640
that's a big man.

3935
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:11,761
Yeah.

3936
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:13,380
Cause I said you wrestled at one 88.

3937
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:13,651
He goes,

3938
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:13,831
yeah,

3939
01:40:13,831 --> 01:40:15,320
put a little miracle grow on my cereal.

3940
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:16,800
I don't really,

3941
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:17,430
yeah.

3942
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,770
Yeah.

3943
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:18,501
Just different animals.

3944
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:19,410
How's he doing now?

3945
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:20,283
I'm not so good.

3946
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,140
It was selling cars for a while.

3947
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,150
I lost a shit ton of weight.

3948
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:24,570
Um,

3949
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:28,860
he fought a few times since I got
knocked out by King Mo and he looked like

3950
01:40:28,861 --> 01:40:29,131
really?

3951
01:40:29,131 --> 01:40:29,964
Actually that's right.

3952
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:32,490
King Mo smashed him in the first round.

3953
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,140
It was really not fun to watch.

3954
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:34,981
It looked bad.

3955
01:40:34,981 --> 01:40:38,610
He went to sleep and you could tell
like he was in a bad spot and then um,

3956
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:40,770
and he wound up retiring from MMA.

3957
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,180
Sold some cars.

3958
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,020
Dan,

3959
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:43,853
I don't know what he's doing now.

3960
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:44,431
Hoping to him.

3961
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:45,300
Well I hope so too.

3962
01:40:45,301 --> 01:40:46,134
He was a good dude.

3963
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,011
He's always a good dude,

3964
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:48,180
but he definitely had his demons,

3965
01:40:48,181 --> 01:40:48,630
man.

3966
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:49,500
Like a lot of those dudes.

3967
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,700
I mean you were talking about it,

3968
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:54,100
you know that it hit you for a few
months cause God damn pain pills

3969
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,933
man,

3970
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,691
you can get,

3971
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:59,260
you can get those demons can fucking
haunt you when you can get stuck day pain

3972
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:01,060
pills and the most
dangerous drug in the world.

3973
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,013
Hands down.

3974
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:04,450
There's nothing more dangerous
than prescription pills.

3975
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:06,070
They're trying to slow that down.

3976
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,690
They're trying to cut back in America.

3977
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:08,381
I mean there's,

3978
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:08,830
there's,

3979
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,350
there's started passing too
much money should be made.

3980
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:13,180
What was too much you're talking about,

3981
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:14,560
cause also oxytocin,

3982
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,240
all the hot and Oxycontin,

3983
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,290
oxytocin.

3984
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,250
But the,

3985
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:18,670
um,

3986
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:19,481
the thing being,

3987
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:20,860
there's still so much profit.

3988
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:21,790
Even if they cut back,

3989
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,040
there's still over this,

3990
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,053
there's just too many.

3991
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,470
I mean I get the,

3992
01:41:26,471 --> 01:41:29,320
I get the idea like what would you rather
do if you had like severe pain all the

3993
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:29,860
time?

3994
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:32,740
Would you rather be addicted to opiates
and just deal with that pain and be

3995
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:33,550
fine?

3996
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:37,270
Or would you rather be absolutely
miserable and sober all day long?

3997
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,390
And I think you have the right and as
an adult to choose to be fucked up on

3998
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:40,960
opiates,

3999
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:41,890
but they're addicting.

4000
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,360
Like you have to depend on them.

4001
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:45,610
And then you also got to realize
when you take painkillers,

4002
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,410
it sends a message to your body.

4003
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:47,740
It says,

4004
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:48,100
oh,

4005
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:48,970
we're doing fine.

4006
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:49,481
It's healed.

4007
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:52,510
We don't need to send those
receptors to heal the muscle or bone,

4008
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:53,200
whatever it is.

4009
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,310
So you're fucked man.

4010
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,780
Or You could smoke marijuana,

4011
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:57,130
God damn dude.

4012
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:58,000
Damn.

4013
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,500
Or you can eat marijuana.

4014
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,363
You know,

4015
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:00,940
whichever.

4016
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:04,690
You can really get that CBD oil
that people are using to help tumor.

4017
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:05,853
It's crazy.

4018
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:06,720
Inflammation,

4019
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:07,120
pain,

4020
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,580
painkillers.

4021
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:08,381
You get stuck on him.

4022
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:08,951
You're in trouble.

4023
01:42:08,951 --> 01:42:09,640
You're in trouble.

4024
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,240
Yeah.

4025
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:10,550
It's,

4026
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:14,860
I think I've come up with a way to heal
injuries that they don't have today and

4027
01:42:14,861 --> 01:42:17,200
we're going to look back at these
days like it was the dark ages.

4028
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:19,960
Like you know how we look at
back at using leeches and shit.

4029
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:23,260
When they had a saw people's
legs off and they broke.

4030
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:25,600
They didn't add up then and
I'll put rods inside your bone,

4031
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:26,740
like Anderson Silva's leg,

4032
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:27,910
guess what's on?

4033
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,550
We're going to have to
take that sucker off.

4034
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,200
They would do back then
it would faster and rot.

4035
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:33,250
They wouldn't know what to do with it.

4036
01:42:33,251 --> 01:42:35,450
You die most of the time
for antibiotics and see,

4037
01:42:35,451 --> 01:42:37,540
probably braced it and
some people survive.

4038
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:40,300
What are the odds that you are
getting both legs connected perfectly?

4039
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:41,910
I mean it's like both bones rather.

4040
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:43,420
It's like snapped in half.

4041
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,670
I had an orthopedic surgeon
tell me that if you,

4042
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:47,110
if you're like in the wilderness,

4043
01:42:47,111 --> 01:42:48,820
somebody gets a compound
fracture and I said,

4044
01:42:48,821 --> 01:42:49,301
what do you do?

4045
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:49,930
And he said,

4046
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,763
Paul,

4047
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,131
what do you mean?

4048
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:51,964
He said,

4049
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:54,220
your bone wants to go back in place.

4050
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,360
Take that ankle,

4051
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,500
pull it out,

4052
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,430
pull it out and,

4053
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,321
and the bone,

4054
01:42:59,321 --> 01:43:00,154
we'll reconnect.

4055
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:01,230
And then splits.

4056
01:43:01,231 --> 01:43:02,620
They're just supposed to line it back up.

4057
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:03,040
Yup.

4058
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,720
He said pull that fucker right out.

4059
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,113
Oh,

4060
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:07,750
and that's exactly what they do to you.

4061
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,561
They will pull.

4062
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:09,040
Really?

4063
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,250
Do you ever see somebody that a doctor
reset a shoulder when it comes out of the

4064
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:15,360
socket that's inefficient.

4065
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:16,990
Break up my arm and I was a little kid.

4066
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:20,050
I remember them setting it
freaked me the fuck out.

4067
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,100
He should pull your up.

4068
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,750
My arm went like that.

4069
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:28,110
Like it was like bent up that I fell
on the monkey bars and I try to block

4070
01:43:29,081 --> 01:43:30,550
myself with my hand and it just,

4071
01:43:30,551 --> 01:43:32,770
my forum just snapped and just went crack.

4072
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:33,670
Oh yeah.

4073
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,440
It happens a lot happened to my daughter.

4074
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:36,310
I have all the jobs.

4075
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:37,160
Yeah,

4076
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:37,993
lot of kids.

4077
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:40,720
My friend's daughter and happened to um,

4078
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:42,820
another kid that's
they're friends with half.

4079
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:44,230
But when you're a kid swinging good,

4080
01:43:44,231 --> 01:43:44,441
right.

4081
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:45,274
Cause it's so young,

4082
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,480
they heal so quick.

4083
01:43:46,481 --> 01:43:47,314
It's amazing.

4084
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,160
Their bones just go.

4085
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:49,330
They just fuse up.

4086
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,830
They take the cast off in three weeks.

4087
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,950
Soft and everything.

4088
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:52,551
Yeah Dude,

4089
01:43:52,551 --> 01:43:53,384
they grow like whoa.

4090
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:53,631
And the,

4091
01:43:53,631 --> 01:43:55,340
the thing is I'm with little kids.

4092
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:58,550
What's one of the big issues
is not even the bone healing,

4093
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,030
uh,

4094
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:01,090
that quickly cause it
heal so quickly that it,

4095
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:03,110
as long as it's set correctly
and heals very quickly,

4096
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:05,960
but it's the stiffness but you don't
want to lose the range of motion.

4097
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:08,030
So that's like my
daughter had issues with,

4098
01:44:08,031 --> 01:44:11,060
she had to go through some range of
motion stuff that takes a couple of weeks

4099
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:12,230
before their motion comes back.

4100
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:16,040
But you compare it to like the way you
would be if you broke your arm at 48 long

4101
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:16,410
time,

4102
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:17,960
but take a long fucking time.

4103
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:18,411
You know,

4104
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:18,621
it's,

4105
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:19,101
it's rough.

4106
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:21,290
Especially if you don't use help,

4107
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,520
which is one of the reasons why I
was willing to forgive Anderson and,

4108
01:44:24,521 --> 01:44:24,830
and not,

4109
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:25,581
not forgiving.

4110
01:44:25,581 --> 01:44:25,960
You understand.

4111
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,140
He doesn't need my forgiveness.

4112
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:28,670
I'm just saying like one
of the reasons why I go,

4113
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:29,504
look man,

4114
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:30,010
I'm,

4115
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,150
I'm judging the dude before
he fought Chris Weidman.

4116
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:35,030
I'm judging them up to this point when
she's 38 years old and he gets knocked

4117
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:36,130
dead by this young stud.

4118
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:36,920
Agree.

4119
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,630
I go that guy before.

4120
01:44:38,631 --> 01:44:39,560
That is the best hour.

4121
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:39,810
Yep.

4122
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:41,710
And this guy is a host fail test.

4123
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,490
There's the post failed
test is what sucks.

4124
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,383
I can't,

4125
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:47,960
I can't speak about this cause I know
some shit that I'm not supposed to know or

4126
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:48,621
that I'm not,

4127
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:49,670
that's not out there yet.

4128
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,920
And once it does get out there
and then we can talk about it.

4129
01:44:51,921 --> 01:44:53,360
But the person who told me about it,

4130
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:56,060
a jet legit and we don't have time.

4131
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:57,500
We just missed this one thing for sure.

4132
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:57,951
For sure.

4133
01:44:57,951 --> 01:44:58,590
He took some Shitty,

4134
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:01,190
wasn't supposed to take to
make his leg healed for sure.

4135
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:02,230
Can't explain it.

4136
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:02,841
There's a,

4137
01:45:02,841 --> 01:45:04,550
there's a really goofy explanation.

4138
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:05,900
I'll explain after the show.

4139
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:06,170
Cool.

4140
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,340
But it'll all come out.

4141
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:08,960
Albert Watson.

4142
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,330
I don't know what happened there man.

4143
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:12,770
I heard a couple of different stories.

4144
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,080
I've heard story but I'm just
saying we don't have details.

4145
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:15,651
It just sucks.

4146
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:16,460
He's gone man.

4147
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:16,701
Yeah,

4148
01:45:16,701 --> 01:45:17,360
he quit.

4149
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,980
Apparently that's the
word is that he quit.

4150
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:20,750
He got in an altercation
with someone or something.

4151
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:22,910
I Dunno what happened or
he just got tired of it,

4152
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:23,121
man.

4153
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:26,510
The guy was traveling to fucking China
and traveling all over this place and

4154
01:45:26,511 --> 01:45:27,470
that place in Brazil.

4155
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,760
He's the manager of Joe Frazier.

4156
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:29,510
Yeah,

4157
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:30,410
he's been around a long time.

4158
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:30,831
Crazy.

4159
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:31,041
Right.

4160
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:34,940
And really one of the best
human beings you've ever met.

4161
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,350
One of the nicest guys ever.

4162
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:37,161
I Dunno what happened.

4163
01:45:37,161 --> 01:45:38,960
They don't make too to Burt Watson's.

4164
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,500
Yeah,

4165
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,820
I agree it replaceable.

4166
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,130
I gave him that nickname
babysit to the stars.

4167
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:43,640
Oh really?

4168
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:43,970
Yeah.

4169
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:46,610
That was my nickname when he got on stage,

4170
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,630
when he would get on stage,

4171
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:51,500
say a Burton Watson Babysit to the
stars because that's what he does,

4172
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:51,601
man.

4173
01:45:51,601 --> 01:45:52,431
He babysits everybody.

4174
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:53,060
He makes,

4175
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:56,220
he makes everybody's experience
with the UFC smooth and easy.

4176
01:45:56,230 --> 01:45:57,410
It takes care of all your shit.

4177
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,480
And so that like when
these fighters would fight,

4178
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:02,090
like they would have this welcome
feeling of like being at home.

4179
01:46:02,091 --> 01:46:03,550
Cause Burt Watson was
there to take care of.

4180
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,780
You were talking about that
how when you'd see him,

4181
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:06,620
everything would be okay.

4182
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,100
Yeah.

4183
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:10,850
I mean when you're going to fight these
monsters and you check into the fight or

4184
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:12,440
hotel and it's like chaos.

4185
01:46:12,441 --> 01:46:14,540
There's fans and then you see Burton.

4186
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,081
He's just like,

4187
01:46:15,081 --> 01:46:15,801
what's up baby?

4188
01:46:15,801 --> 01:46:17,120
Everything's smooth.

4189
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,290
Made me just feel calm.

4190
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,880
Even in back in the lock room.

4191
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:21,520
Don't leave it to the judges.

4192
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,910
Like before I fought Travis Browne,

4193
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:23,930
remember La,

4194
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:24,950
don't leave it to the judges.

4195
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:25,461
Boss.

4196
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:26,570
Don't leave to the judges.

4197
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,130
They made you cry last time I
told you and he talks to him.

4198
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:34,550
There's this comfort level where I don't
know if anyone else in the world could

4199
01:46:34,551 --> 01:46:34,851
do it,

4200
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:35,390
man.

4201
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,920
And he was so damn good at it.

4202
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:37,550
He's a,

4203
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:38,630
he's a genuinely,

4204
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:39,560
really nice guy,

4205
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:40,450
great human beings.

4206
01:46:40,451 --> 01:46:41,750
So when he's doing that,

4207
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:41,960
you know,

4208
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:42,890
he's pumping everybody up.

4209
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:43,760
That's his nature.

4210
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,170
His nature is to pump you up,

4211
01:46:45,171 --> 01:46:45,951
to make you feel good.

4212
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:47,960
He wants you to feel good when
you see Bert Kreischer every,

4213
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:50,130
there's not a time that I
saw that guy that I didn't

4214
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,090
give him a big giant hug.

4215
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:52,880
Bert Kreischer you're
talking about referral,

4216
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:53,120
right?

4217
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:53,490
I'm sorry,

4218
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:54,080
Watson,

4219
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,890
but Watson who said crusher crusher?

4220
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:56,851
I was like,

4221
01:46:56,851 --> 01:46:57,400
yeah,

4222
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:57,961
well he's another one.

4223
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:58,231
I was like,

4224
01:46:58,231 --> 01:46:59,610
that's probably going to be here tomorrow.

4225
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:00,180
He's a great guy.

4226
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:00,720
Nice.

4227
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,710
But Bert Watson,

4228
01:47:01,711 --> 01:47:02,544
sorry,

4229
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:04,100
[inaudible] guy.

4230
01:47:04,590 --> 01:47:07,470
He would make guys on the new card
feel like they're the main event.

4231
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:10,980
You would every one you felt like you
were literally the only guy fighting that

4232
01:47:10,981 --> 01:47:11,230
night.

4233
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:12,240
Like you'd just amazing.

4234
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:13,950
But every time you'd
see them you'd hug them.

4235
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:15,050
Just like that's what it was.

4236
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,080
Just such a switchable,

4237
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:17,003
listen tangible.

4238
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,150
Some people just have that,

4239
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,370
that quality that makes sort of,

4240
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:21,690
well you know what the problem is man,

4241
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,490
it seems like a job that
other people could do.

4242
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,420
So it says like,

4243
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:24,751
you know,

4244
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:27,180
maybe sometimes you think
you always appreciate.

4245
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,270
It seems like when you look
at it like what's he doing?

4246
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:31,103
It's so important.

4247
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:31,441
You know?

4248
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:31,591
Like,

4249
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:32,520
why is this guy,

4250
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:33,890
why is he getting all this attention?

4251
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,310
Like sometimes they look on paper,

4252
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:36,421
what he does.

4253
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:37,500
You can't like it's not,

4254
01:47:37,501 --> 01:47:38,730
there's not a job description.

4255
01:47:38,731 --> 01:47:39,330
Okay.

4256
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:43,440
Oh you deal with divas and deal with some
of the toughest guys on the planet and

4257
01:47:43,441 --> 01:47:43,521
you,

4258
01:47:43,521 --> 01:47:43,920
you know,

4259
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:44,930
he makes sure their weakest,

4260
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:45,270
smooth.

4261
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,900
I get it.

4262
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:46,021
Yeah,

4263
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:46,770
I can do that.

4264
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:47,850
I'm telling you man,

4265
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:48,930
it's going to be a beast.

4266
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:49,710
Yeah.

4267
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:52,710
I mean I think other people probably
could do it but no one's going to replace

4268
01:47:52,711 --> 01:47:52,891
him.

4269
01:47:52,891 --> 01:47:55,860
He has his own unique
individual and you know,

4270
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,480
he's a beautiful guy to be around.

4271
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:59,310
Like I just think that's worth something.

4272
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,641
You know,

4273
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:00,420
I don't know.

4274
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:01,390
I would've never let the dark,

4275
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,191
I have a weird,

4276
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:07,191
like this guy we used to train American
bulldogs to for attack train and he had

4277
01:48:08,311 --> 01:48:11,550
this dog on a leash called acts and we
went and saw all this dogs cause at the

4278
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:15,660
time I was thinking about buying an
American bulldog and he said he can't go

4279
01:48:15,661 --> 01:48:16,710
near that dog over there.

4280
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,990
I said okay guys.

4281
01:48:17,991 --> 01:48:18,240
Hey,

4282
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:18,371
he's,

4283
01:48:18,371 --> 01:48:20,940
he's by trainees and amazing
mean boy in and everything.

4284
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:26,010
And then they were talking about how
there was a guy who just could walk up to

4285
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:29,160
every single dog he had in that whole lot.

4286
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:30,013
He had a bunch of them.

4287
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:30,880
And uh,

4288
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,740
one point acts is just the only person
that acts that's near him is this dude.

4289
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:39,870
And they didn't tell him not to go up to
ax and he walked up to ax and the next

4290
01:48:39,871 --> 01:48:40,321
thing you know,

4291
01:48:40,321 --> 01:48:44,850
he saw the guy get down on his knees and
opened his arms and acts and acts was

4292
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:46,640
wagging on Max's wagon.

4293
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:47,550
I said,

4294
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:47,881
rip his,

4295
01:48:47,881 --> 01:48:48,900
he just had a,

4296
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:51,630
he had a thing with dogs.

4297
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,700
That's matter how Sam's experience,

4298
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,531
some people just have a,

4299
01:48:54,531 --> 01:48:56,610
I wonder if it's an the retarded,

4300
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,250
the dog recognizes they're
too stupid to know any better.

4301
01:48:59,270 --> 01:48:59,670
Yeah.

4302
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:01,230
So talk to us and fight their face off.

4303
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:01,671
God,

4304
01:49:01,671 --> 01:49:02,400
man,

4305
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,530
who knows when I was going to do a movie,

4306
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:06,510
when I was going to do
a movie a long time ago,

4307
01:49:06,990 --> 01:49:08,100
I can't remember the name of the movie,

4308
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:13,130
actually got released and it was about
a French soldier in the desert who meets

4309
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:17,700
a leopard and they have directed
by a woman named Lavinia career.

4310
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,890
And I had a meeting with her and she said,

4311
01:49:19,891 --> 01:49:20,460
well,

4312
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:21,810
we're looking for an actor.

4313
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:22,590
Um,

4314
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:24,440
the only issue is that they,

4315
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:27,210
the leopard will either like
you or it won't like you.

4316
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:28,560
If it doesn't like you,

4317
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:29,460
it will never like you.

4318
01:49:29,461 --> 01:49:30,160
If it likes you,

4319
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:30,993
you'll be fine.

4320
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,630
And that was a huge part of
getting cast in the role.

4321
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,400
And I said,

4322
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:34,860
what does it,

4323
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:35,221
what does it,

4324
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:36,060
how does it know?

4325
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:36,601
How does it know?

4326
01:49:36,601 --> 01:49:37,434
And she said,

4327
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,220
we don't know.

4328
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:40,320
It's maybe a cent or however your move,

4329
01:49:40,321 --> 01:49:41,340
but it likes you.

4330
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,270
You get the part.

4331
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,090
So getting the parts one thing and then
you'd have to go through the leopard

4332
01:49:45,091 --> 01:49:45,420
tests.

4333
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:45,671
Oh,

4334
01:49:45,671 --> 01:49:46,980
I was like very,

4335
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:48,010
did you go through the level

4336
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,330
of depth?

4337
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:48,531
Sure.

4338
01:49:48,531 --> 01:49:48,821
Didn't.

4339
01:49:48,821 --> 01:49:49,654
I didn't know.

4340
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,980
So what were you thinking when he
gets on his knees in front of the dog?

4341
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:54,910
I'm sorry,

4342
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:55,743
I didn't see that.

4343
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:56,321
I didn't see it.

4344
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:57,154
I was just told the story.

4345
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:04,110
I don't like those stories that you
weren't there for tell those guys store.

4346
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:04,480
Yeah,

4347
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,201
those are not good.

4348
01:50:05,201 --> 01:50:05,860
You know why?

4349
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,090
Because they might be bullshit.

4350
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:10,150
I hate those styles out there.

4351
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:10,481
Yeah,

4352
01:50:10,481 --> 01:50:11,800
but it might have been exaggerated.

4353
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,400
Dogg might've been super friendly.

4354
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,850
So video is a wiener dog.

4355
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:19,490
Red At all my friend's dog
house and they're like,

4356
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:19,820
yeah.

4357
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:20,321
Everybody's like,

4358
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:20,431
oh,

4359
01:50:20,431 --> 01:50:20,801
it's dog.

4360
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:23,560
Scary on the quick cause this is German
shepherd as a family doc comes over

4361
01:50:23,561 --> 01:50:24,370
wagging its tail.

4362
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:25,250
Everyone thinks their sweet.

4363
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:26,133
Well,

4364
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:28,900
we're talking about the difference
between a liar and an exaggerator,

4365
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:29,091
right?

4366
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:29,200
Yeah.

4367
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:29,691
You just,

4368
01:50:29,691 --> 01:50:31,480
you just took me down a
journey where you don't know.

4369
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:32,620
You have no veracity.

4370
01:50:32,621 --> 01:50:33,450
Your likes your tent.

4371
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:35,140
You're Brian Williams of the podcast and

4372
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,780
saying you'd see escaped one.

4373
01:50:40,781 --> 01:50:42,090
I'm Ronda Rousey's our virus.

4374
01:50:42,091 --> 01:50:43,720
It's called really nice.

4375
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:45,880
Fuck when you're in these guys.

4376
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:46,421
Six months,

4377
01:50:46,421 --> 01:50:46,810
man.

4378
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:48,250
What the fuck ever,

4379
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:49,031
dude,

4380
01:50:49,031 --> 01:50:50,190
it's over son.

4381
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:53,650
You guys a crazy America.

4382
01:50:53,651 --> 01:50:53,981
Forget,

4383
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:55,630
oh no press conference.

4384
01:50:55,631 --> 01:50:57,190
No one can do that.

4385
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:57,881
Listen,

4386
01:50:57,881 --> 01:51:00,220
if I'm wanting to be a
fucking newscaster tomorrow,

4387
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:05,410
if it wasn't for my checkered past
tomorrow ain't doing it tomorrow.

4388
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:06,930
It's a clean wreck.

4389
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:12,080
This way too many endorsements of illegal
drugs of mine on and I are friends.

4390
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:13,330
We're friends.

4391
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:14,141
If you found out,

4392
01:51:14,141 --> 01:51:17,370
I told a major lie like that
Doug story of the Taekwondo,

4393
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,590
which one?

4394
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:20,110
I mean I've told a lot of stories

4395
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:25,210
and you found out that I was just a liar.

4396
01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:26,710
There's a big difference,

4397
01:51:26,711 --> 01:51:27,490
man.

4398
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,323
That's where you go.

4399
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:30,040
I've got to reassess everything now.

4400
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:33,700
Brian Williams is doing it for ratings
like there's a lot of competition out

4401
01:51:33,701 --> 01:51:34,480
there and he went,

4402
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:34,631
yeah,

4403
01:51:34,631 --> 01:51:35,560
I was in this helicopter.

4404
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:38,110
He heard of a helicopter crash
and he's just putting himself,

4405
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,890
giving them too much credit.

4406
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:42,610
I think you're,

4407
01:51:42,610 --> 01:51:42,881
you're,

4408
01:51:42,881 --> 01:51:44,110
you're saying that he's like,

4409
01:51:44,111 --> 01:51:45,670
this is a calculated move,

4410
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:46,691
but that's stupid.

4411
01:51:46,691 --> 01:51:47,350
You know why?

4412
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:50,230
Because the true story is still awesome.

4413
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:50,621
Okay.

4414
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:51,431
Here's the true story.

4415
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:52,151
The true story.

4416
01:51:52,151 --> 01:51:53,140
He's in a helicopter.

4417
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,150
There's a helicopter convoy
of three helicopters.

4418
01:51:55,151 --> 01:51:57,280
The one in front of them
gets hit with an RPG.

4419
01:51:57,430 --> 01:52:00,940
They have to force land in a fucking
sand storm and they're stuck in the sand

4420
01:52:00,941 --> 01:52:01,774
star for two days.

4421
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,420
That stories awesome
and that story is true.

4422
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:06,670
That's a true story you're missing.

4423
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:10,490
What you're missing is is he was three
and a half hours behind the one that hit

4424
01:52:10,491 --> 01:52:10,810
with,

4425
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:11,450
I heard what you said,

4426
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:13,330
but this is what the fuck the pilots said.

4427
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,800
The pilots said that's not the case.

4428
01:52:14,801 --> 01:52:18,400
The pilot said they landed an hour late
because they had to get rid of their

4429
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:19,150
cargo.

4430
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,680
They had a full load of cargo.

4431
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:21,543
They landed,

4432
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:24,720
they got rid of their cargo and then
they met up with the other helicopter.

4433
01:52:24,721 --> 01:52:25,750
I got hit by the RPG.

4434
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,340
That's why they were an hour behind it.

4435
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:27,520
Yeah.

4436
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:28,480
They were all story then,

4437
01:52:28,481 --> 01:52:28,841
but this is,

4438
01:52:28,841 --> 01:52:32,980
the guy says they were all in a convoy
and the helicopter pilot even said that

4439
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:33,690
the,

4440
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:36,430
the helicopter that Brian Williams
was on took small arms fire.

4441
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:37,540
Okay.

4442
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:39,790
Then when he landed he a,

4443
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:42,820
or then when he told his story to
other people came out and said,

4444
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:43,360
no,

4445
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,320
they were the guys that were flying,

4446
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,070
Brian Williams

4447
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,360
around and he didn't fly him around.

4448
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:48,111
And so he's like,

4449
01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:48,944
you know what?

4450
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,660
I don't even know anymore.

4451
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:50,991
He said,

4452
01:52:50,991 --> 01:52:54,950
I have suppressed this so much and this
is a guy who was a totally legit guy and

4453
01:52:54,951 --> 01:52:55,400
he said,

4454
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,430
I'm starting to get nightmares again
and I had already put this behind me.

4455
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:01,910
Now you're making me relive
this experience from 12
years ago and I'm starting

4456
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:02,840
to question my own memory,

4457
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:07,670
which is super common in traumatic
situations like for Brian Williams,

4458
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:08,661
let's be real.

4459
01:53:08,661 --> 01:53:09,530
I don't know that dude,

4460
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:10,910
but I guarantee you he's a pussy.

4461
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:12,510
I guarantee you whatever you're selling,

4462
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,850
he's never been in a fight in his life.

4463
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,310
The way he apologized,

4464
01:53:15,311 --> 01:53:15,790
the way,

4465
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:16,370
I mean this,

4466
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:19,850
I mistakenly plated the two stories.

4467
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:20,990
Maybe you did,

4468
01:53:20,991 --> 01:53:21,570
maybe it didn't.

4469
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:24,500
That's not the way it Goddamn
man apologized and fucking up.

4470
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:28,580
He should have done was instead of doing
it online or that way where you're in

4471
01:53:28,581 --> 01:53:31,670
some constricted time of 15 seconds,

4472
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:33,380
they allot you to try to clear your name.

4473
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:35,090
You should do it on a youtube video.

4474
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:37,070
You should put a goddamn
camera in front of you.

4475
01:53:37,071 --> 01:53:40,430
And as long as it takes to get your full
thoughts out about how this possibly

4476
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:44,270
could have happened or a debt you did
lie or what it was or that you got caught

4477
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:48,080
up in it and somebody repeated it and you
almost forgot because you kept telling

4478
01:53:48,081 --> 01:53:49,460
us to whatever the fuck it is.

4479
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:51,890
The actual story is pretty God damn good.

4480
01:53:51,930 --> 01:53:52,390
Yeah.

4481
01:53:52,390 --> 01:53:53,690
At least according to the helicopter,

4482
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:55,460
the helicopter pilot said that is,

4483
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,100
and then the helicopter pilot came out
the next day and said he's not even sure

4484
01:53:58,101 --> 01:54:00,530
of his own memory and so he doesn't
want to talk about it anymore,

4485
01:54:00,531 --> 01:54:00,801
which is,

4486
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:02,120
that guy's fucking prerogative.

4487
01:54:02,121 --> 01:54:03,560
So what do you think should
happen to Brian Williams?

4488
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:04,394
You don't think she read

4489
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:06,983
your news.

4490
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:08,090
You're not telling me the news.

4491
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:10,530
Your rescue artists do something outside.

4492
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:11,690
Go host a talk show.

4493
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:11,960
Yeah.

4494
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,830
It goes to talk show.

4495
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:14,450
He's the first one ever to lie,

4496
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:14,720
not,

4497
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:15,730
but you can't get caught.

4498
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:16,730
You can't get caught as a,

4499
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:17,990
as a news liar,

4500
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:19,100
you know what I mean?

4501
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,810
It's like he's the face of NBC News.

4502
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,290
Okay.

4503
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:22,040
How about this?

4504
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,670
What did you found out that a dude was
pitching for the world series and he got

4505
01:54:25,671 --> 01:54:29,600
paid off by some gambling
organisation to throw the game.

4506
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:33,530
Would you ever trust that guy to
fucking pitch a legit game again?

4507
01:54:33,890 --> 01:54:35,150
Would you ever know?

4508
01:54:35,151 --> 01:54:37,220
But Anderson Silva told
me didn't take steroids.

4509
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:38,690
He's still your number one guy,

4510
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:40,760
but Brian Williams can't
tell the news these days.

4511
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:45,020
I think it's fun and Anderson Silva at
the end of his career definitely did take

4512
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:46,500
steroids at the end of this girl.

4513
01:54:46,501 --> 01:54:47,190
I'm different though.

4514
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:49,460
It was when he had a broken
leg and he's 39 years old,

4515
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,361
which you,

4516
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:52,190
he'll slow as fuck and I'm with you.

4517
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:53,780
I get all mad did you shouldn't do it,

4518
01:54:53,781 --> 01:54:54,950
but it's totally illegal.

4519
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:55,750
I'm with you.

4520
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,890
I,

4521
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:58,580
what I'm saying is when I say
Anderson's the best of all time,

4522
01:54:58,581 --> 01:55:01,420
I'm not taking away his
previous accomplishments
because he fucked up when he

4523
01:55:01,421 --> 01:55:02,360
was 39 years old.

4524
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:07,160
When I'm saying is if I look at him in
his prime from Chris Liebing all the way

4525
01:55:07,161 --> 01:55:10,520
to Vitor Belfort to
fucking the Stephan Bonner,

4526
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:11,690
if I look at his fights,

4527
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:12,860
Dan Henderson,

4528
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,910
and we assume he's clean,

4529
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:15,110
we assume he's clean.

4530
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:15,360
All right.

4531
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,250
Do we do not know.

4532
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:16,701
Okay.

4533
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:17,780
We obviously don't do not know.

4534
01:55:17,890 --> 01:55:18,160
Do not.

4535
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:18,870
I'm not saying he did.

4536
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:20,450
If he really was clean,

4537
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:20,820
I,

4538
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:22,850
I give him the benefit of the doubt.

4539
01:55:22,851 --> 01:55:25,870
He never failed a test and I
say that he was the best ever.

4540
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:28,580
The benefit of the doubt,

4541
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:32,060
but fate or has more benefit because
fatal or never tested positive.

4542
01:55:32,061 --> 01:55:32,270
True.

4543
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:33,590
Even though he was in a dirty league,

4544
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,760
I mean we could call it a dirty league,

4545
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:35,300
right?

4546
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:36,920
We pride 100% hundred percent.

4547
01:55:36,921 --> 01:55:37,640
Right.

4548
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,020
We nosing fighters.

4549
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:39,921
When we say dirty,

4550
01:55:39,921 --> 01:55:41,030
we don't mean that disrespectfully.

4551
01:55:41,031 --> 01:55:42,830
It was still the environment
that they were competing.

4552
01:55:42,831 --> 01:55:43,220
I say,

4553
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:44,053
okay,

4554
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:47,730
so fade or has way more benefit of the
doubt because he never tested positive,

4555
01:55:47,731 --> 01:55:50,030
but yet it wasn't even tested
until he came to strike bro.

4556
01:55:50,031 --> 01:55:50,910
All I'm saying is,

4557
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:53,790
so Brian Williams basically
tests positive for this one time.

4558
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:54,401
The whole line is,

4559
01:55:54,401 --> 01:55:55,740
so we're just giving assume hall.

4560
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:56,603
It's bullshit.

4561
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:59,130
You Trust Brian Williams to give,

4562
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:00,600
to deliver information.

4563
01:56:00,601 --> 01:56:01,710
He is a journalist.

4564
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:02,710
That pupil is,

4565
01:56:02,710 --> 01:56:06,690
Helen did journalists credibility
and an organization's credibility is

4566
01:56:06,691 --> 01:56:08,070
everything when it comes to the news.

4567
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,020
When you're a journalist
and you have a story,

4568
01:56:10,021 --> 01:56:10,561
you have to have,

4569
01:56:10,561 --> 01:56:12,660
I think that depending on where you're at,

4570
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:14,670
they they cross check your references.

4571
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,301
You've got to get very,

4572
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:19,290
very good sources and I think an
editorial board has to okay it.

4573
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:22,680
That's why we trust
the news in my opinion.

4574
01:56:22,681 --> 01:56:26,610
When someone like Brian Williams lies
and he blatantly lied and it was self

4575
01:56:26,611 --> 01:56:27,660
aggrandizement,

4576
01:56:27,661 --> 01:56:31,770
it was about making himself look not
only like a sympathetic character,

4577
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:33,090
but a grandiose character.

4578
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:36,210
He exaggerate will more
than an exaggeration.

4579
01:56:36,211 --> 01:56:37,110
It's a lie.

4580
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:39,780
It's an absolute blatant lie,

4581
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:43,080
and everybody uses these
euphemisms and and like,

4582
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:43,381
well,

4583
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:44,940
he wasn't forthcoming.

4584
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:45,270
No,

4585
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:46,460
it's okay that you lied.

4586
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,100
It was a fight and he really thought that
he was in the helicopter that got hit

4587
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:53,190
by shit too bad.

4588
01:56:53,191 --> 01:56:53,350
Right,

4589
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:53,570
right,

4590
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:54,330
right.

4591
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:55,920
But what if it's like
the Oj Simpson thing?

4592
01:56:55,921 --> 01:56:59,880
Like people thought that Oj
Simpson literally believed
at the end of his time as

4593
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:00,481
a free man,

4594
01:57:00,481 --> 01:57:01,590
that he hadn't killed his wife.

4595
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:04,140
There's people that knew him
that had said this in interviews.

4596
01:57:04,141 --> 01:57:04,411
They said,

4597
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:06,240
I really believe that he
doesn't believe he killed her.

4598
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:08,710
Like he got it in his head like he,

4599
01:57:08,711 --> 01:57:09,930
he 2010 his brain,

4600
01:57:09,931 --> 01:57:10,750
he didn't know.

4601
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:11,470
But then who knows?

4602
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:11,811
But that,

4603
01:57:11,811 --> 01:57:13,220
that would be the not civil,

4604
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,070
the civil lawsuit.

4605
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,790
He was true.

4606
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:16,590
But the courts have recognized that too.

4607
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:16,831
Right?

4608
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:17,760
They recognize some,

4609
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:21,620
that's the degree of mental
delusion or whatever it is,

4610
01:57:21,621 --> 01:57:21,991
and saying,

4611
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:24,240
Brian Williams shouldn't
be out of a job for lying.

4612
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,320
I don't want to hurt the guy.

4613
01:57:25,321 --> 01:57:28,320
I don't think he said should those little,

4614
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:29,550
let's be honest about this.

4615
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:29,881
First of all,

4616
01:57:29,881 --> 01:57:34,410
he made a dossier of Brian Williams
lives investigating suspense accounts.

4617
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:34,741
Okay,

4618
01:57:34,741 --> 01:57:35,370
he's,

4619
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:35,701
there you go.

4620
01:57:35,701 --> 01:57:36,481
He's done there.

4621
01:57:36,481 --> 01:57:37,440
If they're doing that with,

4622
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:38,520
what's the date on that again?

4623
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:39,300
Boy,

4624
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:39,820
boy.

4625
01:57:39,820 --> 01:57:41,540
So he's like more than once.

4626
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,320
That's all done.

4627
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,190
He's dossier,

4628
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:44,760
but that's how it screws is.

4629
01:57:44,761 --> 01:57:45,690
That's how it always is.

4630
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:48,710
That's maybe just exaggerate this
one time and let's do it that way.

4631
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:49,830
That's not human behavior.

4632
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:51,900
That's not human it when people steal,

4633
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:52,350
when you,

4634
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:54,900
somebody steals money from you and
they go in and they take money,

4635
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:57,480
they got a history of I disagree.

4636
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:59,490
Well we don't know the situation.

4637
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:00,920
You don't know if you're right.

4638
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:04,020
Sometimes there can be
desperate for money.

4639
01:58:04,021 --> 01:58:04,711
I can understand that.

4640
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:08,460
I'm just saying that typically when
people behave a certain way and they get

4641
01:58:08,461 --> 01:58:09,000
caught,

4642
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,550
they've probably done something
like that in the past.

4643
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:12,330
You disagree?

4644
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:13,163
I don't think you know,

4645
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:13,590
it's,

4646
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:16,620
it's very possible to be as what
it is very possible that he hasn't,

4647
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:20,040
but if they do have a dossier of lies
and I'm 10 years suspicions have kind of

4648
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:20,730
been confirmed.

4649
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:20,911
Yeah,

4650
01:58:20,911 --> 01:58:21,570
he screwed.

4651
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:21,751
Yeah,

4652
01:58:21,751 --> 01:58:22,584
he's fun.

4653
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,430
But it's also,

4654
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:25,080
it's like it doesn't
mean that he can't work,

4655
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:25,950
and by the way,

4656
01:58:25,951 --> 01:58:27,420
he was making $10 million a year.

4657
01:58:27,421 --> 01:58:28,340
He's bald is fine.

4658
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:29,760
Just make it a lot of fucking money.

4659
01:58:29,761 --> 01:58:30,660
That guy is going to be fine.

4660
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:33,030
I really don't give a
shit if my newscasters or,

4661
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,331
oh,

4662
01:58:33,331 --> 01:58:33,901
you're crazy,

4663
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:34,490
man.

4664
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:36,780
I don't want that to make you angry.

4665
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:38,190
You should get a watch this puppet,

4666
01:58:38,191 --> 01:58:39,690
this fucking state run puppet.

4667
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:40,830
All of them are about this.

4668
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:41,890
They're not,

4669
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:42,040
they're

4670
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:47,040
not all puppies do you mean CNN didn't
read all those guys spending $10 million

4671
01:58:47,561 --> 01:58:50,980
because you trust him because
he's a face of credibility.

4672
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:54,760
The reason Brian Williams made $10
million a years because he was the face of

4673
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:58,150
NBC News and when you brought them into
your living room like everybody did,

4674
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:58,800
what,

4675
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,320
what happened was you do that
because when you get news from him,

4676
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:03,760
you believe it.

4677
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:03,980
Oh,

4678
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:06,850
that's why you're watching
or not watching fiction.

4679
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,320
I didn't trust them from the get go.

4680
01:59:08,321 --> 01:59:11,700
I don't want assume these are
worldclass great Americans give,

4681
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:12,610
delivers the news.

4682
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:12,860
Well,

4683
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:15,520
we're a dummy for basically a corporation.

4684
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:16,390
We're telling you what to say.

4685
01:59:16,391 --> 01:59:18,000
You exaggerate the news.

4686
01:59:18,330 --> 01:59:18,580
I mean,

4687
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:19,000
you're being,

4688
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,610
you're also being sympathetic
simplistic about this.

4689
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:21,910
Okay.

4690
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:22,960
But he's not really,

4691
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,450
because all Brian Really
Williams credentials.

4692
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:25,781
I mean,

4693
01:59:25,781 --> 01:59:25,941
what,

4694
01:59:25,941 --> 01:59:28,740
what does he need to be able to do that
you can't do or that you can't do with

4695
01:59:28,741 --> 01:59:28,840
it?

4696
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,010
I can't do so reading off,

4697
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:31,640
I'm not good at reading off teleprompters,

4698
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,300
but that's all he has to do.

4699
01:59:34,301 --> 01:59:36,700
Telegenic is used to doing that.

4700
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:38,290
He looks like someone's Dad.

4701
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,760
He's a good height.

4702
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:40,710
He's got good facial,

4703
01:59:40,711 --> 01:59:41,544
are reserved for that.

4704
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,860
That's what they hired his speeches.

4705
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:46,330
But he's not particularly a brilliant guy.

4706
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:48,340
I had a conversation off the record once,

4707
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:48,900
uh,

4708
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:49,960
I won't say the guy's name,

4709
01:59:49,961 --> 01:59:54,400
but he's one of those news guys and I
was shocked at how dumb he seemed like we

4710
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:55,690
were having a conversation about,

4711
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:55,981
and I,

4712
01:59:55,981 --> 01:59:59,890
and I questioned him on a couple of
things were just like throwing some,

4713
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:00,640
you know,

4714
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,530
just shooting the shit back and forth.

4715
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:05,440
And I forget what came up
or what the subject was,

4716
02:00:05,441 --> 02:00:06,220
but I remember thinking,

4717
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:07,053
this guy's nuts.

4718
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:08,170
He's not that bright.

4719
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:08,541
What was he?

4720
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:10,030
Was He hesitant or what was it?

4721
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:10,960
Clumsy.

4722
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:11,650
Clumsy,

4723
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:12,850
like clumsiness thinking.

4724
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:14,220
I can't really tell you what it is.

4725
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:15,630
Then you'll know who the
fuck I'm talking about.

4726
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:16,750
He's not a bad guy.

4727
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,470
My favorite author,

4728
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,180
he's good,

4729
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:19,661
but he,

4730
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:20,020
you know,

4731
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:20,760
look,

4732
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,860
Anderson Cooper is a,

4733
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:24,640
is another one that was
considered by people.

4734
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,540
I've only read this,

4735
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:27,340
I don't know and I
can't give you examples.

4736
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:28,180
He was crying.

4737
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:32,260
He was recognized by a lot of people who
wrote about this afterwards as a pretty

4738
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:34,330
good journalist that got
him to where he was to,

4739
02:00:34,331 --> 02:00:35,920
but got them to be an anchor of NBC.

4740
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:36,641
He had,

4741
02:00:36,641 --> 02:00:39,340
he was a credible journalist
who did good work,

4742
02:00:39,370 --> 02:00:39,880
who did,

4743
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:43,600
who wrote good articles and good did
good investigation and that's why it was

4744
02:00:43,601 --> 02:00:47,770
such a bummer for so many people
buy a lot of other accounts.

4745
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:48,611
That's not true.

4746
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:49,540
Other is not true.

4747
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,370
There's other people that
said that he was an asshole,

4748
02:00:51,371 --> 02:00:52,780
that he was a pretentious.

4749
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:52,990
I mean,

4750
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:53,823
who the fuck knows?

4751
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:55,600
Whenever something like
this happens who sides,

4752
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:58,240
you're going to get
bullshit on both directions,

4753
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:02,710
but all I know is when we
don't really need those guys.

4754
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:05,440
We don't need someone
that's a credible voice.

4755
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:05,981
I agree.

4756
02:01:05,981 --> 02:01:07,060
We need information.

4757
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:10,300
That's what we need and it's almost
worse when it comes from a personality,

4758
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:13,420
especially if we think that personality
could potentially be manipulated.

4759
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:17,320
It's charismatic father figure
that's reading you the new escalator.

4760
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,130
It's actually kind of,

4761
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:19,600
it's kind of creepy in a way,

4762
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:24,160
but a free honest and open press and
knowing that you can trust the information

4763
02:01:24,161 --> 02:01:26,860
you get say for it from the New
York Times because they have a,

4764
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:32,070
they work very hard at making sure
at least what that the stories or the

4765
02:01:32,741 --> 02:01:33,401
information,

4766
02:01:33,401 --> 02:01:36,480
not the stories of the slant but
the information presented so,

4767
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:37,271
so for example,

4768
02:01:37,271 --> 02:01:39,070
somebody gets shot a 12 year old gets,

4769
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:40,400
we know that's true.

4770
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,170
We're not going to say
they're making that up.

4771
02:01:42,171 --> 02:01:47,171
There has to be a certain amount of non
cynical trust in a society where we just

4772
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:48,950
give people the benefit of the job.

4773
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:53,330
You can't go through life believing that
CNN and dateline is the best source of

4774
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:55,670
news and they have no hidden motivated.

4775
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:56,150
Absolutely.

4776
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:56,811
They certainly do.

4777
02:01:56,811 --> 02:01:58,160
But here's the other part of the problem.

4778
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:01,910
The format is incredibly
flawed and antiquated.

4779
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:02,180
Yeah.

4780
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:06,290
The format of getting the entire world's
news in an hour with 18 minutes of

4781
02:02:06,291 --> 02:02:07,820
commercials is ridiculous.

4782
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:09,140
You can't get it that way,

4783
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:11,660
cause they're going to pick and
choose the things that are exciting.

4784
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:14,450
It's an entertainment show about events.

4785
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:15,470
That's what it really is.

4786
02:02:15,471 --> 02:02:15,800
Yeah.

4787
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:19,460
It's an entertaining show about events
and that's why you have this asshole with

4788
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:22,310
a tie who speaks like
your girlfriend's father.

4789
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:22,760
Like,

4790
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:22,941
oh,

4791
02:02:22,941 --> 02:02:23,840
this fucking guy again.

4792
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:24,381
You know what I mean?

4793
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:24,981
Like this is,

4794
02:02:24,981 --> 02:02:28,520
this is who he is and he's the reason
Kim Kardashian posting a selfie sign a

4795
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:31,340
deal for $100 million is
the start of the news.

4796
02:02:31,341 --> 02:02:31,910
That's the,

4797
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:32,661
if it bleeds,

4798
02:02:32,661 --> 02:02:33,494
it leads.

4799
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:34,573
That's what they say.

4800
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:39,990
And there's no doubt that that political
leanings by journalists bleed into the

4801
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:40,701
news.

4802
02:02:40,701 --> 02:02:41,090
I mean,

4803
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,950
there's too much credit.

4804
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:43,760
It's a shit on.

4805
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,860
Assume they're does shitty
way to get information.

4806
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,830
That's not how any of us should get
information and they shouldn't have it

4807
02:02:48,831 --> 02:02:49,430
anymore.

4808
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:52,190
It was important back in the day when
they didn't have fucking reading,

4809
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:52,761
you know,

4810
02:02:52,761 --> 02:02:54,260
and they would get on TV and nobody,

4811
02:02:54,261 --> 02:02:57,080
I mean you'd read your newspaper in the
morning and then the afternoon you would

4812
02:02:57,081 --> 02:02:58,880
listen to the news or
you would watch the news.

4813
02:02:58,881 --> 02:02:59,900
It became on television.

4814
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:02,510
That's we are at war with Japan.

4815
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:03,281
What's his,

4816
02:03:03,281 --> 02:03:04,310
you hear on the news,

4817
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,990
we're at war with Japan now.

4818
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:08,780
You would get Twitter alerts like
way before that shit would have,

4819
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:10,940
when you see rob Walter
Cronkite back in the day,

4820
02:03:10,941 --> 02:03:12,590
it was just very matter of fact,

4821
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:14,180
he got on and read the news.

4822
02:03:14,181 --> 02:03:14,781
And one of the things,

4823
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:16,400
there's a famous story I think about the,

4824
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:21,320
the guy who was ran 60 minutes
and he came in and he said,

4825
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:22,610
good news and bad news.

4826
02:03:22,611 --> 02:03:24,830
Good news is got very
high ratings last night.

4827
02:03:24,831 --> 02:03:27,860
And bad news is we've got very high
ratings last night and the news will never

4828
02:03:27,861 --> 02:03:28,490
be the same.

4829
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:29,211
So in other words,

4830
02:03:29,211 --> 02:03:31,220
we now have a lot of
pressure to get ratings.

4831
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,350
And what does that mean
sensationalize things?

4832
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:34,250
What does that mean?

4833
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:35,600
Focus on what's wrong,

4834
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:37,150
not what's right for fear.

4835
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:40,030
It's an input.

4836
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:45,510
It's a disproportionate in a non and non
accurate view of the world because by

4837
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:50,861
only focusing on these negative things
and not focusing on the fucking hundreds

4838
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:53,600
of millions of positive things
that are happening all the time,

4839
02:03:53,601 --> 02:03:54,434
all over the world,

4840
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:59,180
you're getting this distorted version of
reality that threatens people and makes

4841
02:03:59,181 --> 02:04:00,470
people alert and uh,

4842
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:02,030
react to stress.

4843
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:03,710
You're reacting to danger.

4844
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:04,603
A sense of fear.

4845
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:10,190
I feel like isis lives next door
and run and more importantly,

4846
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:12,350
I'm going to get a fucking lion killer.

4847
02:04:12,351 --> 02:04:16,160
Let the guy fucking rant about Isis and
Jesus Christ and you just can't stop.

4848
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:17,060
And Keller,

4849
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:17,751
he's trying,

4850
02:04:17,751 --> 02:04:18,980
he's trying to do some comedy.

4851
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:21,100
[inaudible]

4852
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:22,043
says,

4853
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:22,491
no,

4854
02:04:22,491 --> 02:04:23,900
you got this man can,

4855
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:26,490
are you guys going on about
Isis in fucking Marina del Ray?

4856
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:26,691
You're like,

4857
02:04:26,691 --> 02:04:26,880
hey,

4858
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:26,960
yeah,

4859
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:27,241
yeah,

4860
02:04:27,241 --> 02:04:27,441
yeah,

4861
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:27,790
but my,

4862
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:28,623
my uncle,

4863
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:29,211
no,

4864
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:29,540
I wasn't.

4865
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:30,340
I was going to say that.

4866
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:30,481
What,

4867
02:04:30,481 --> 02:04:34,790
what I think that the damage done is
that you don't get any real information.

4868
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:35,570
Like,

4869
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:36,950
like I was having a conversation,

4870
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,310
somebody who really knows the Middle East

4871
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,143
and they were like,

4872
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:40,080
nobody ever talks about.

4873
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:42,900
The biggest problem with two
things with first of all,

4874
02:04:42,901 --> 02:04:45,180
the Middle East is the Sunni Shia schism.

4875
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,890
The idea that you start there,

4876
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:48,570
some we don't even know
where to start with a debate.

4877
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:49,830
We start talking about Isis,

4878
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,520
we start talking about the problems that
bother us and we don't actually really

4879
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:55,380
know where the source of the problem is.

4880
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:57,660
We don't know how it
started because we're not,

4881
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:59,310
you don't get it from
what you were saying,

4882
02:04:59,311 --> 02:04:59,911
you don't get it from,

4883
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:04,140
we get them from CNN and dateline
suppose does that you're not supposed to,

4884
02:05:04,141 --> 02:05:04,471
you didn't,

4885
02:05:04,471 --> 02:05:05,100
you know,

4886
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,830
it used to be you have to wait for the
news to come out yet to get a newspaper

4887
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:10,900
and then you get alerted to the important
stories in the radio or on the news,

4888
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:11,551
on the news,

4889
02:05:11,551 --> 02:05:12,180
on television.

4890
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:13,110
We don't need that anymore.

4891
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:16,350
It's just antiquated and it's dangerous
because it gives you a version of the

4892
02:05:16,351 --> 02:05:16,681
world.

4893
02:05:16,681 --> 02:05:17,970
It's not entirely accurate.

4894
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:20,190
It's very slanted because
that's what you're scared of.

4895
02:05:20,191 --> 02:05:21,160
So that's what you're tuned into.

4896
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:23,010
So that's where they can sell advertising.

4897
02:05:23,011 --> 02:05:23,340
Hey,

4898
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:24,960
we scared the fuck out
of a hundred people.

4899
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,730
Did you see nightcrawler?

4900
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:27,240
Yes,

4901
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:28,410
it's fucking excellent.

4902
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,060
Excellent.

4903
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:31,320
And it's all about this.

4904
02:05:31,470 --> 02:05:32,970
Nightcrawler is all about this.

4905
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:33,391
First of all,

4906
02:05:33,391 --> 02:05:35,400
Jake Glue and hall is a bad motherfucker.

4907
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:36,470
How did he not win a,

4908
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,560
he should have won an award.

4909
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:40,410
Think awards are stupid.

4910
02:05:40,411 --> 02:05:40,891
I agree.

4911
02:05:40,891 --> 02:05:41,241
He's,

4912
02:05:41,241 --> 02:05:41,760
he's just,

4913
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,593
he's just excellent.

4914
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:43,570
It's an excellent movie.

4915
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:44,650
It doesn't mainly really,

4916
02:05:44,651 --> 02:05:44,981
really,

4917
02:05:44,981 --> 02:05:46,120
really dope ass.

4918
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,600
A dodge challenger makes the hands right.

4919
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,070
It's not even starts balling.

4920
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:51,060
Yeah.

4921
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:51,841
What is that ball?

4922
02:05:51,841 --> 02:05:54,150
And it gets red challenger with black.

4923
02:05:54,151 --> 02:05:55,230
Get there faster.

4924
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:57,330
I love how he talks to his sidekick.

4925
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:58,080
Yeah,

4926
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:58,741
it's an amazing,

4927
02:05:58,741 --> 02:05:59,041
Jeremy.

4928
02:05:59,041 --> 02:05:59,361
If don't,

4929
02:05:59,361 --> 02:05:59,620
don't,

4930
02:05:59,620 --> 02:05:59,780
don't,

4931
02:05:59,780 --> 02:05:59,911
don't,

4932
02:05:59,911 --> 02:06:00,450
don't,

4933
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:00,990
don't give it.

4934
02:06:00,990 --> 02:06:01,823
Don't spoil it.

4935
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:04,103
Folks that are listening.

4936
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:05,310
Oh my bad.

4937
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:07,050
Goddamn a spoiler alert.

4938
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:10,610
And I see every movie shit,

4939
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:11,460
man.

4940
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:12,420
Tell him I go,

4941
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:13,960
don't tell me about the fights
or whatever you've done.

4942
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:15,900
14 seconds.

4943
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:16,691
That's all I'm going to say.

4944
02:06:16,691 --> 02:06:18,630
It pisses me off when he misses the fight.

4945
02:06:18,631 --> 02:06:19,980
So I text him all the results.

4946
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:20,401
He says,

4947
02:06:20,401 --> 02:06:20,581
you know,

4948
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:22,580
that's part of your job is
to be a pay attention to.

4949
02:06:22,581 --> 02:06:24,540
I'm aware of that and
when he doesn't see it,

4950
02:06:24,541 --> 02:06:24,811
I'm like,

4951
02:06:24,811 --> 02:06:25,644
fuck that noise.

4952
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:27,083
I'm aware.

4953
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:32,880
Tape taping a defensive stance because
fucking Cobra for impact because I get

4954
02:06:34,621 --> 02:06:34,891
mad.

4955
02:06:34,891 --> 02:06:35,131
I'm like,

4956
02:06:35,131 --> 02:06:35,461
Brennan,

4957
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:36,570
don't tell me anything.

4958
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:37,423
Work waterway to play.

4959
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:38,670
I don't want to play volleyball.

4960
02:06:38,671 --> 02:06:39,090
I go,

4961
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:40,820
don't tell me anything.

4962
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:42,330
Cain Valasquez ends up winning.

4963
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:43,170
He punches him in the face.

4964
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:44,731
Man,

4965
02:06:44,731 --> 02:06:45,710
I got to teach you.

4966
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:47,890
You know,

4967
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:48,301
what are you doing?

4968
02:06:48,301 --> 02:06:49,920
You're out there in the wild dude.

4969
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:51,180
My workouts are at night.

4970
02:06:51,181 --> 02:06:53,700
A lot of times it's hard to just beach.

4971
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,653
Think about death.

4972
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:57,060
The Alexander Emily Yanko workout.

4973
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:57,953
Not The fight or what?

4974
02:06:58,890 --> 02:06:59,641
What's the difference?

4975
02:06:59,641 --> 02:07:00,270
Just a lot.

4976
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:01,680
A lot of back work and crime.

4977
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:02,693
A lot of packers,

4978
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:03,840
shit,

4979
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:04,710
ups and crimes.

4980
02:07:04,711 --> 02:07:06,540
Is Crime just to cry?

4981
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:08,560
Oh man,

4982
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:10,290
that's hilarious.

4983
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:12,210
How about Brendan's apart?

4984
02:07:13,640 --> 02:07:14,330
It's beautiful.

4985
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:15,660
It's got a God damn full head of hair.

4986
02:07:15,661 --> 02:07:16,321
If I had that much hair,

4987
02:07:16,321 --> 02:07:17,090
I do weird shit.

4988
02:07:17,090 --> 02:07:18,490
You don't want a man because you know,

4989
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:21,660
I've been taking a break from training
and I haven't grown my hair out since I

4990
02:07:21,661 --> 02:07:22,380
was in.

4991
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,220
I Dunno man.

4992
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:25,470
So for me to grow it out,

4993
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:28,080
she can't have really
hairstyle trained a ton.

4994
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:29,280
Putting Gel in your hair.

4995
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,960
Feel like you know dude,

4996
02:07:30,961 --> 02:07:31,540
I've been a,

4997
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:31,861
I don't know.

4998
02:07:31,861 --> 02:07:32,440
I know you got to,

4999
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:33,630
you had a neck injury for awhile.

5000
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,350
I've been getting this.

5001
02:07:35,351 --> 02:07:35,860
Uh,

5002
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:36,100
this

5003
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,740
dude does rolfing and he uses a,

5004
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:40,930
he's got this fucking crazy,

5005
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:44,980
it's like this metal piece that's wrapped
in like a soft plastic or got thin

5006
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:46,960
sheet of plastic around it,

5007
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:47,321
you know,

5008
02:07:47,321 --> 02:07:49,480
so it's like semi soft on the outside,

5009
02:07:49,481 --> 02:07:51,160
but underneath it's iron or steel,

5010
02:07:51,161 --> 02:07:51,994
whatever the fuck it is.

5011
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,870
This shit breaks up.

5012
02:07:52,871 --> 02:07:53,710
Scar tissue.

5013
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:54,550
Woo.

5014
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:55,450
This shit hurts.

5015
02:07:55,451 --> 02:07:56,230
Soggy.

5016
02:07:56,230 --> 02:07:56,441
Okay,

5017
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:58,930
so now here east of he
and sit through that.

5018
02:07:58,960 --> 02:07:59,101
Oh,

5019
02:07:59,101 --> 02:08:02,530
I had it done on my hands to get done
once a month or once a week or gangster.

5020
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:03,311
Not Mom once a month.

5021
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:03,770
Once a week.

5022
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:05,020
Know what's weird is people be like,

5023
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:05,591
oh shop,

5024
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:08,230
your neck hurts and this is my fault.

5025
02:08:08,231 --> 02:08:09,280
We'll have random people that got,

5026
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:13,000
let me see it and I'll just sit down and
they start cracking in and this random

5027
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:16,140
girl was grabbing my neck
was like your ribs out,

5028
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:17,013
your ribs out.

5029
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:18,220
Oh I'm sitting there,

5030
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:19,660
her weight's on my shoulder.

5031
02:08:19,661 --> 02:08:20,500
Push on my head.

5032
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:23,020
I'm thinking I don't know this woman.

5033
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:23,830
I let her do it.

5034
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:24,700
You can't do that.

5035
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:25,031
You can't.

5036
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:25,751
I know man,

5037
02:08:25,751 --> 02:08:27,190
we know you know a lot about this stuff.

5038
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:28,800
What do we know about like when you,

5039
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:29,890
if my lower back hurts,

5040
02:08:30,280 --> 02:08:32,020
is that a function of inflammation?

5041
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:34,750
Well here's the deal and you
don't know until you get an Mri,

5042
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:35,890
you need to get an Mri.

5043
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:36,580
Okay.

5044
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:39,340
I got an MRI recently cause I
wanted to get a look at my back,

5045
02:08:39,341 --> 02:08:41,080
no exact what's going on
and everything's cool.

5046
02:08:41,110 --> 02:08:42,700
Just some disc degeneration,

5047
02:08:42,730 --> 02:08:44,140
minor disc degeneration,

5048
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:46,510
a little bit of soreness and inflammation
is really nothing to do for that.

5049
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:46,900
No,

5050
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:47,620
not much you can do.

5051
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:48,161
So it's all,

5052
02:08:48,161 --> 02:08:48,790
it's all fine.

5053
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:50,140
Like it's fine to push myself,

5054
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:52,570
but you got to know that
you're fine to push yourself.

5055
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,433
Yeah.

5056
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:56,110
Badge if you don't you say that.

5057
02:08:56,111 --> 02:08:57,160
But if you don't know,

5058
02:08:57,161 --> 02:08:58,850
it's just guessing like
people that have psychiatric.

5059
02:08:58,860 --> 02:08:59,410
I'd be like,

5060
02:08:59,410 --> 02:08:59,950
they keep going.

5061
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:01,510
Oh my sciatic nerve.

5062
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:01,710
Well,

5063
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:02,800
do you know what that is?

5064
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:05,830
That's a bulging disc that's
pushing on your nerve.

5065
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:08,200
Like you're making it look like
your nerve is acting weird.

5066
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,960
You know you're nervous
being washed by your fucking,

5067
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:11,943
just the,

5068
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:16,480
the soft shit in between your bones in
your spine is pushing into your fucking

5069
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:17,300
nerve.

5070
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:18,370
That's serious shit.

5071
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:22,690
And people that ignore that or try to
work through it like you can fuck yourself

5072
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:23,170
up.

5073
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:28,120
I know three dudes that
have had significant neck
surgery because of impinged

5074
02:09:28,121 --> 02:09:30,730
nerves where it was causing
atrophy to their muscles.

5075
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:31,511
Three dudes,

5076
02:09:31,511 --> 02:09:33,190
very close guys from my gym.

5077
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:34,530
I know one dude that can't,

5078
02:09:34,531 --> 02:09:35,590
he can't do Jujitsu anymore.

5079
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:35,990
We can't,

5080
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:36,560
we can't roll.

5081
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:36,941
Can't do it.

5082
02:09:36,941 --> 02:09:37,960
It's a fine line though.

5083
02:09:37,961 --> 02:09:38,794
Like a lot of guys,

5084
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:40,660
there'll be messed up and like,

5085
02:09:40,661 --> 02:09:40,831
Nah,

5086
02:09:40,831 --> 02:09:41,980
I'm not going to see a doctor.

5087
02:09:42,130 --> 02:09:44,680
And then now you know
the UFC insurance policy,

5088
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:45,041
I'm like,

5089
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:45,251
damn,

5090
02:09:45,251 --> 02:09:45,851
my wrist hurts.

5091
02:09:45,851 --> 02:09:46,684
I get an x ray.

5092
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,100
That was damn my nose hurts.

5093
02:09:48,101 --> 02:09:48,671
I get an x ray,

5094
02:09:48,671 --> 02:09:50,770
you should do that fucking
professional fighter,

5095
02:09:50,850 --> 02:09:51,170
man.

5096
02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:53,320
The UFC must be like fucking shop man.

5097
02:09:53,321 --> 02:09:53,821
What's wrong with him?

5098
02:09:53,821 --> 02:09:54,800
He jammed his thumb,

5099
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:55,511
man.

5100
02:09:55,511 --> 02:09:56,410
You're not the only one.

5101
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:58,630
A lot of dudes are doing
that and they should.

5102
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:59,501
They should.

5103
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:01,780
That is a giant part of
what you do for a living.

5104
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,920
I have awards.

5105
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:03,813
You got to know

5106
02:10:05,420 --> 02:10:06,880
the years they sound,

5107
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:07,601
they're silly.

5108
02:10:07,601 --> 02:10:08,200
That's silly.

5109
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:11,950
You can look this is what you like that
that's antagonistic sort of relationship

5110
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:13,060
with people when they have injuries.

5111
02:10:13,061 --> 02:10:13,600
Yeah.

5112
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:15,690
That's a very fucking tricky
you think to beats me.

5113
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:16,600
It's weird though man,

5114
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:17,051
because you,

5115
02:10:17,051 --> 02:10:18,520
you know like back in the day it's like,

5116
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:19,390
oh I want to be tough.

5117
02:10:19,391 --> 02:10:23,290
So now like it's my own ego
when I have to call my manager,

5118
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:23,681
but like dude,

5119
02:10:23,681 --> 02:10:23,800
I,

5120
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:24,020
yeah,

5121
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:24,450
am I,

5122
02:10:24,450 --> 02:10:25,720
I got to get my neck checked out.

5123
02:10:25,870 --> 02:10:29,800
It takes usually three or four weeks
for me to talk myself into getting the

5124
02:10:29,801 --> 02:10:31,810
doctor cause it's like this ego thing,

5125
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:32,410
right?

5126
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:33,590
I want to be a bitch man.

5127
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:34,170
Like,

5128
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:34,460
like,

5129
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:35,510
like metro was in town.

5130
02:10:35,511 --> 02:10:35,691
He's like,

5131
02:10:35,691 --> 02:10:36,524
you want to train?

5132
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:38,450
I really can't go real
hard wrestling right now.

5133
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:39,830
I want to with him and Barnett,

5134
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:41,060
I just can't.

5135
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:41,950
And so I was like,

5136
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:42,081
Oh,

5137
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:42,880
I'm busy man.

5138
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,770
That's smart man would
do to try to ignore pain.

5139
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:46,791
There's a lot of dudes,

5140
02:10:46,791 --> 02:10:47,810
I try to ignore pain there.

5141
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:48,381
Their bodies,

5142
02:10:48,381 --> 02:10:49,550
why not fallen apart?

5143
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:53,030
We had John Wayne par on and he
was talking about Ramon Dekkers.

5144
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:57,860
Ramon Dekkers date got him to a point
where they fused his fucking ankle to his

5145
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:59,630
shinbone cause he had broken,

5146
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:02,660
it's so many times just full power kicks.

5147
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:08,980
He would kick so fucking hard and smash
into elbows and knees and shins and he

5148
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:14,291
shattered his ankle so many times from
his right kick that they had a fuse it so

5149
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:15,111
he would hobble,

5150
02:11:15,111 --> 02:11:18,740
when he walked new tape that fucker
up and get in there and they told him,

5151
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,130
they were like,

5152
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:22,190
you can't kick with this and we're going
to have to fucking amputate your leg if

5153
02:11:22,191 --> 02:11:23,024
you break it again.

5154
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:25,760
And he would wait a little while
fighting a southpaw and say,

5155
02:11:25,770 --> 02:11:26,270
you know what?

5156
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:30,240
Fuck it switched dances and
just start attacking with me.

5157
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:31,370
Dude.

5158
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:32,011
Fumes,

5159
02:11:32,011 --> 02:11:34,460
a bad motherfuckers
fucking ankle didn't bend.

5160
02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:35,703
He still,

5161
02:11:37,190 --> 02:11:37,371
yeah,

5162
02:11:37,371 --> 02:11:38,930
he passed away right at 43.

5163
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:39,530
Oh No.

5164
02:11:39,530 --> 02:11:41,120
Died of a heart attack at 43.

5165
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:41,600
Oh boy.

5166
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:42,800
Riding a bike apparently.

5167
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:45,430
And he was one of the all time great dogs.

5168
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:46,131
Phenomenal.

5169
02:11:46,131 --> 02:11:46,964
If you don't know who he is,

5170
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:48,230
resets a compromise.

5171
02:11:48,231 --> 02:11:49,090
It gets in your artery.

5172
02:11:49,091 --> 02:11:50,860
Ramon Dekkers woo.

5173
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:51,703
He was good.

5174
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:53,030
Oh Dude.

5175
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:55,490
Just the most average savage,

5176
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:55,681
so,

5177
02:11:55,681 --> 02:11:56,750
so aggressive.

5178
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:57,883
And he was like,

5179
02:11:58,070 --> 02:11:59,690
he was a Dutch guy,

5180
02:11:59,691 --> 02:12:01,820
but the Dutch people were very big.

5181
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:02,090
Yes.

5182
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:04,550
Like the average height for
a Dutch man is six feet tall.

5183
02:12:04,551 --> 02:12:05,180
It's people in Europe.

5184
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:05,360
Yeah.

5185
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:08,300
The tallest people in Europe and
a lot of big and he was little.

5186
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:09,250
So he,

5187
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:11,160
he had to be tough.

5188
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:12,123
Uh,

5189
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:15,740
and he was one of the first guys to go
over to Thailand and beat the ties and

5190
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:16,583
tie boxer.

5191
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:18,350
You think about how tough he is,

5192
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:21,350
your ankles fused to your fucking leg,

5193
02:12:21,351 --> 02:12:21,711
man.

5194
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:21,940
Yeah.

5195
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:22,521
Oh yeah.

5196
02:12:22,521 --> 02:12:23,354
Your foot,

5197
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,560
knee and your ankle,

5198
02:12:24,570 --> 02:12:26,030
like all the way down is one piece.

5199
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:26,331
Yeah.

5200
02:12:26,331 --> 02:12:27,164
That's not good.

5201
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:28,213
Don't use it.

5202
02:12:28,230 --> 02:12:29,510
Definitely don't use it.

5203
02:12:29,511 --> 02:12:30,720
And then gets in a fight and fuck.

5204
02:12:30,721 --> 02:12:32,750
He's definitely a guy who doesn't
know what to do with his time.

5205
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:33,001
Like he,

5206
02:12:33,001 --> 02:12:34,230
he's just not going to quit this.

5207
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:37,190
Tell Him we might have to amputate your
leg cause you've shattered your bones so

5208
02:12:37,191 --> 02:12:37,761
many times.

5209
02:12:37,761 --> 02:12:38,930
The whole thing is like you to be honest,

5210
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:40,810
it's not that it's gonna be like,

5211
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:42,043
Ooh man.

5212
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,620
It's Kinda how I feel about Madonna at 56.

5213
02:12:45,621 --> 02:12:47,780
Sean her ass off like an
old fighter who won't quit.

5214
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:49,610
Just take a look at this.

5215
02:12:50,780 --> 02:12:52,580
How dare you make that comparison.

5216
02:12:52,581 --> 02:12:53,240
Sorry.

5217
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:53,630
No,

5218
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:55,370
he fucked the whole thing
up with Eddie Murphy.

5219
02:12:55,371 --> 02:12:56,120
Shrek thing.

5220
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:56,251
Yeah.

5221
02:12:56,251 --> 02:12:57,750
But this might just be just sad.

5222
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:59,690
Madonna's an oddity at this point.

5223
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:00,291
I think so.

5224
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:01,280
When people go to see her,

5225
02:13:01,281 --> 02:13:02,114
it's an oddity.

5226
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,250
She's a 60 year old
woman in her underwear.

5227
02:13:04,251 --> 02:13:07,010
I was dancing around with a bunch of gay
guys following her everywhere she goes

5228
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:07,601
and hanging on her.

5229
02:13:07,601 --> 02:13:08,020
Every word.

5230
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:08,221
Yeah.

5231
02:13:08,221 --> 02:13:09,650
Yanked off stage the other day.

5232
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:09,881
Well,

5233
02:13:09,881 --> 02:13:10,371
I know that,

5234
02:13:10,371 --> 02:13:10,701
I don't know.

5235
02:13:10,701 --> 02:13:12,050
I think fucking Brian Williams was me.

5236
02:13:12,051 --> 02:13:12,470
What happened?

5237
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:13,460
Ah,

5238
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:14,720
she uh,

5239
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,570
that she was dancing the things
was like yank the Cape off,

5240
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,740
but like God,

5241
02:13:18,741 --> 02:13:19,280
her neck.

5242
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,150
Oh my God.

5243
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:20,600
Gangsters.

5244
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:20,841
Bitch.

5245
02:13:20,841 --> 02:13:21,850
Right off this stage.

5246
02:13:21,970 --> 02:13:22,850
Is there video of that?

5247
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:23,450
Oh yeah.

5248
02:13:23,450 --> 02:13:23,631
Oh,

5249
02:13:23,631 --> 02:13:25,400
we got to see them play it for us.

5250
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,181
Play it again.

5251
02:13:26,181 --> 02:13:27,014
Jamie.

5252
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:28,700
She gets to cap.

5253
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:30,350
She'll be 80 Sean her body off.

5254
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:34,000
Should you best that she fired whoever
made that case was brought by her dead.

5255
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:34,761
Oh yeah,

5256
02:13:34,761 --> 02:13:35,400
he's probably dead.

5257
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:36,121
He's probably Dutch.

5258
02:13:36,121 --> 02:13:37,020
Probably beat him to death.

5259
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:40,530
He's remember Madonna beat someone
to death with a hammer and they just,

5260
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:42,570
you see the body just
scoop out the back door.

5261
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:43,670
It was like the 19th,

5262
02:13:43,671 --> 02:13:44,620
the little hammers.

5263
02:13:44,621 --> 02:13:45,780
It was the 1930s.

5264
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:47,370
Just had a carpenters hammer.

5265
02:13:47,371 --> 02:13:48,210
Just fucking impaler.

5266
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,860
Oh Shit.

5267
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:52,230
Let me see that again
one more time please.

5268
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:53,070
Oh,

5269
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:54,450
look at this bitch.

5270
02:13:54,650 --> 02:13:55,530
Ah,

5271
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:56,580
oh.

5272
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:57,330
Oh my God.

5273
02:13:57,330 --> 02:13:58,320
She's old dude.

5274
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:00,060
When you fall like that and you're old,

5275
02:14:00,061 --> 02:14:00,990
you could break a hip

5276
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:03,923
champ.

5277
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:05,611
Oh my God.

5278
02:14:05,611 --> 02:14:06,450
That's crazy.

5279
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:10,470
She handled that really well by the way.

5280
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:11,670
She fell really well.

5281
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:12,683
She really did.

5282
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:15,300
She could have got her that tailbone up.

5283
02:14:15,301 --> 02:14:16,770
She has zero as she got her,

5284
02:14:16,771 --> 02:14:18,630
got her a muscle on her ass.

5285
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:23,810
I was filming this movie
and Kevin James Zookeeper.

5286
02:14:23,980 --> 02:14:24,390
Yes.

5287
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:26,660
Boston chasing scene.

5288
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:30,850
We had a bike chasing scene and I kept
hitting the front brakes on the bike

5289
02:14:30,851 --> 02:14:32,180
because the front brakes
where my left hand,

5290
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:35,100
the back bakes for my right hand and
I'm riding this bike and I'm hitting him

5291
02:14:35,101 --> 02:14:39,120
with this thing and I hit the front
bags and go flying over the handlebars.

5292
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:41,850
All the concrete like
tumble into the grass.

5293
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:42,930
I did it like three times.

5294
02:14:42,931 --> 02:14:43,471
So you're doing that.

5295
02:14:43,471 --> 02:14:44,550
You did your own stock in other words?

5296
02:14:44,551 --> 02:14:44,640
Yeah,

5297
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:45,473
I did all of it.

5298
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:50,700
One where a guy jumped meet a bike jump
where it was a stunt man right where he

5299
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:51,480
had to,

5300
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:56,160
he had a ride down this hill and then hit
this ramp and jump over this flight of

5301
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:57,930
stairs and land on the ground.

5302
02:14:57,931 --> 02:14:58,111
And the,

5303
02:14:58,111 --> 02:14:58,920
he did that.

5304
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,300
He was like a stunt jumper but all the
other shit I did and they wanted to have

5305
02:15:03,301 --> 02:15:08,301
a stunt guy do the fall like cause that's
what would eventually happen was was

5306
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:13,670
he was supposed to jam his flag into my
wheel and then I go flying and he takes

5307
02:15:14,011 --> 02:15:14,670
off.

5308
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:19,670
But I fell so spectacularly that
they use my actual fall in the,

5309
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:21,270
in the actual movie body.

5310
02:15:21,271 --> 02:15:21,670
And did,

5311
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:23,190
did you do a judo roll or what happened?

5312
02:15:23,191 --> 02:15:23,711
I got to see,

5313
02:15:23,711 --> 02:15:24,550
oh look at you.

5314
02:15:24,551 --> 02:15:25,384
You're sick.

5315
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:30,360
I think I rolled in one of them and one
of them maybe I fell a bunch of times.

5316
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:30,911
One of them.

5317
02:15:30,911 --> 02:15:32,580
It was cool because I landed in the grass.

5318
02:15:32,581 --> 02:15:34,230
Like I hit the curb and went flying.

5319
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:35,190
I got to see this reality.

5320
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:35,950
I can't believe I've been,

5321
02:15:35,950 --> 02:15:36,751
Jane's a Good Dude,

5322
02:15:36,751 --> 02:15:36,990
Huh?

5323
02:15:36,990 --> 02:15:37,823
He's a very good dude.

5324
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:38,481
He was very,

5325
02:15:38,481 --> 02:15:38,990
very kind.

5326
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:39,570
The great guy,

5327
02:15:39,570 --> 02:15:39,751
dude.

5328
02:15:39,751 --> 02:15:40,584
How about stuntmen?

5329
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:42,150
They're fucking crazy man.

5330
02:15:42,151 --> 02:15:42,984
Stunt men in a crazy,

5331
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:44,730
I have people tell me all the time,

5332
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:45,870
I'd probably say once a week,

5333
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:46,291
dude,

5334
02:15:46,291 --> 02:15:48,990
you should get into some
stunt were no fucking cool.

5335
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:49,801
That's easy.

5336
02:15:49,801 --> 02:15:51,420
That's how boss hurt his neck.

5337
02:15:51,730 --> 02:15:55,290
It was one of the things I was going
to get to his boss when he was on,

5338
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,460
I think sons of anarchy.

5339
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:56,760
Yep.

5340
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:57,593
One of those shows,

5341
02:15:57,720 --> 02:16:01,110
he did a stunt and he's doing his own
stunt work and they landed them on his

5342
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:02,980
head and bang,

5343
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:04,590
it just fucked his neck up.

5344
02:16:04,591 --> 02:16:06,680
And then he had to get his discs fuse.

5345
02:16:06,681 --> 02:16:08,010
Didn't you have a friend
who does stonework?

5346
02:16:08,070 --> 02:16:10,060
And he like was in a coma for grid,

5347
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:11,340
can't taste food anymore.

5348
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:13,920
You got to hit the back
of his head and uh,

5349
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:16,800
lost his sense of taste and
smell and it's never come back.

5350
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:18,090
And his testosterone,

5351
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:18,540
my,

5352
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:19,590
so we had to go on.

5353
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:21,081
But,

5354
02:16:21,081 --> 02:16:21,510
um,

5355
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:21,700
I,

5356
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:22,300
I was doing,

5357
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:26,190
I was doing the Goldbergs and
this girl had to fall down on her,

5358
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:27,390
just fall on her back.

5359
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:28,021
And I thought,

5360
02:16:28,021 --> 02:16:28,710
and I said,

5361
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:29,650
she was a girl and,

5362
02:16:29,651 --> 02:16:30,010
and I,

5363
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:30,311
and I,

5364
02:16:30,311 --> 02:16:31,900
and it was on a linoleum floor,

5365
02:16:31,901 --> 02:16:33,160
like a real cafeteria floor.

5366
02:16:33,161 --> 02:16:33,880
And I said,

5367
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:34,720
how are you going to do that?

5368
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:35,501
And she goes,

5369
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:36,280
just fall.

5370
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:36,731
And I said,

5371
02:16:36,731 --> 02:16:36,971
I know,

5372
02:16:36,971 --> 02:16:38,530
but then she just boom,

5373
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:39,220
just hit,

5374
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:39,381
hit,

5375
02:16:39,381 --> 02:16:39,520
hit,

5376
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:40,360
hit it five times.

5377
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:40,601
No,

5378
02:16:40,601 --> 02:16:42,730
she was a stunt woman
five times and I said,

5379
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:43,210
I said,

5380
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:43,511
I said,

5381
02:16:43,511 --> 02:16:44,081
how are you doing?

5382
02:16:44,081 --> 02:16:44,291
She goes,

5383
02:16:44,291 --> 02:16:45,160
I'll be sorta mall.

5384
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:46,270
She was falling.

5385
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:48,820
I remember when I did death
valley and I had a judo flip,

5386
02:16:48,821 --> 02:16:49,750
this giant guy,

5387
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:50,650
Joe or na's,

5388
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:52,390
this guy Joe or Knaus who is a,

5389
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,000
well this,

5390
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:53,890
this was crazy.

5391
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:58,540
It's got [inaudible] who's a giant stunt
man on death valley and I'm awesome.

5392
02:16:58,541 --> 02:16:59,111
Works all the time.

5393
02:16:59,111 --> 02:16:59,890
Just pig,

5394
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:01,180
big judo guy.

5395
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,320
And He,

5396
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:04,820
we had this desk like this uh,

5397
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:05,530
thing and I,

5398
02:17:05,530 --> 02:17:06,161
he's a vampire.

5399
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:09,610
He jumps on me and I had to flip them
over and I thought it was going to break

5400
02:17:09,611 --> 02:17:10,360
away furniture.

5401
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:12,070
It really wasn't breakaway furniture.

5402
02:17:12,071 --> 02:17:16,660
It was as hard as it gets and I just
would throw him and he would flip over me

5403
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:18,160
and throw him slip and fall on his back.

5404
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:21,170
He did it over and over and just,

5405
02:17:21,390 --> 02:17:21,641
you know,

5406
02:17:21,641 --> 02:17:22,900
they get paid well to do that.

5407
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:23,890
They get paid well,

5408
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:24,311
not well,

5409
02:17:24,311 --> 02:17:25,210
not well enough.

5410
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:26,331
I would never do.

5411
02:17:26,331 --> 02:17:27,760
It depends on what you have to do.

5412
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:27,971
I mean,

5413
02:17:27,971 --> 02:17:30,310
if you have to do something like
that is definitely not well enough.

5414
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:32,860
Oftentimes they were padding
and they do their best,

5415
02:17:32,861 --> 02:17:33,641
but look,

5416
02:17:33,641 --> 02:17:34,990
they're taking bumps no matter what.

5417
02:17:34,991 --> 02:17:35,310
And they're,

5418
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:39,370
their head's getting jostled around and
dragged by a horse they say is the most

5419
02:17:39,371 --> 02:17:40,860
dangerous resolute.

5420
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:41,950
Fuck that.

5421
02:17:41,951 --> 02:17:43,780
And they have to do that
for some fucking movies,

5422
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:44,350
man.

5423
02:17:44,350 --> 02:17:45,790
There's not much you can do about it.

5424
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:47,040
You get dragged by a horse,

5425
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:47,201
you,

5426
02:17:47,201 --> 02:17:47,470
you,

5427
02:17:47,470 --> 02:17:50,500
you got to do it very specifically and
you gotta be really careful because they

5428
02:17:50,501 --> 02:17:51,310
can't really stop the horse.

5429
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:51,790
They've got to be,

5430
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:52,601
how do you control the Horse?

5431
02:17:52,601 --> 02:17:53,680
You control it with another horse,

5432
02:17:53,770 --> 02:17:57,310
but you got to let that horse go for
a while and they spooked the horse.

5433
02:17:57,311 --> 02:17:59,920
The horse is trained to run and
you get dragged and that is,

5434
02:17:59,921 --> 02:18:01,510
they consider the most dangerous.

5435
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:03,370
How about car shit?

5436
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:03,771
Well,

5437
02:18:03,771 --> 02:18:08,720
they're doing car chases and shit
like fucking hangover to listen to.

5438
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,630
Someone was in a movie.

5439
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:11,950
Oh Jay Quillen hall.

5440
02:18:12,130 --> 02:18:16,150
They were saying that that fucking movie
there was not CGI when they did those

5441
02:18:16,151 --> 02:18:17,650
car accidents and that movie.

5442
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:19,600
All the car accidents in nightcrawler.

5443
02:18:19,601 --> 02:18:21,010
I'm pretty sure it was him.

5444
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:21,401
See,

5445
02:18:21,401 --> 02:18:22,420
please Google that.

5446
02:18:22,421 --> 02:18:24,640
So it wasn't that he
was in too much crazy.

5447
02:18:24,990 --> 02:18:26,440
What about the fucking high speed chase?

5448
02:18:26,441 --> 02:18:27,490
I don't want to say anything more.

5449
02:18:27,730 --> 02:18:31,930
I will say that the one time there's
some serious shit enough so that you like

5450
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:32,860
get the fuck Outta here.

5451
02:18:32,910 --> 02:18:34,060
Like this is real.

5452
02:18:34,061 --> 02:18:35,290
This is not CGI.

5453
02:18:35,530 --> 02:18:38,710
Apparently that was one of the things
that the director wanted to do.

5454
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:40,510
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

5455
02:18:40,511 --> 02:18:43,600
And you know people clown and Tom
Cruise for kind of being a sissy,

5456
02:18:43,601 --> 02:18:45,480
but he did all his own stunts
and mission impossible.

5457
02:18:45,490 --> 02:18:46,810
I heard when he hung from that building,

5458
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:47,830
that's pretty gang.

5459
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:49,740
He does his own driving stunts too.

5460
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:50,551
Does running and,

5461
02:18:50,551 --> 02:18:51,440
and he's a powerful guy.

5462
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:53,800
Whatever the fuck that movie was
that he did with Cameron Diaz,

5463
02:18:53,801 --> 02:18:55,370
he had some crazy movie with whether,

5464
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:56,250
Oh,

5465
02:18:56,250 --> 02:18:58,260
I like that movie and
if days or what it was,

5466
02:18:58,300 --> 02:18:58,540
no,

5467
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:58,700
no,

5468
02:18:58,700 --> 02:18:58,801
no,

5469
02:18:58,801 --> 02:18:58,911
no,

5470
02:18:58,911 --> 02:18:59,001
no.

5471
02:18:59,001 --> 02:18:59,530
That's a great,

5472
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:00,990
that's a great movie to know.

5473
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:01,853
The edge of tomorrow.

5474
02:19:02,430 --> 02:19:03,820
That's very underrated.

5475
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:05,260
Good movie.

5476
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:07,930
That's a movie that almost
suffers from him being too wacky.

5477
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:09,100
I agree ma'am.

5478
02:19:09,101 --> 02:19:10,660
As a beast of a movie.

5479
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:10,960
Yeah.

5480
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:13,060
Like if that movie was like someone else,

5481
02:19:13,061 --> 02:19:13,990
like will Smith,

5482
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:19,440
will Smith's a little
wacky to [inaudible] movie?

5483
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,200
Yeah.

5484
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:20,540
If you,

5485
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:20,981
if like,

5486
02:19:20,981 --> 02:19:21,761
who would have been,

5487
02:19:21,761 --> 02:19:24,160
who would like Tom Cruise
killed it and that movie,

5488
02:19:24,161 --> 02:19:24,700
by the way,

5489
02:19:24,700 --> 02:19:25,510
edge of tomorrow.

5490
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:26,590
He kills so good.

5491
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:27,350
Oh yeah.

5492
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:29,540
But if someone else did an
equal job of killing it,

5493
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:30,591
like okay,

5494
02:19:30,591 --> 02:19:31,970
here's one Travolta Daniel Day,

5495
02:19:31,971 --> 02:19:33,590
Lewis of Daniel Day Lewis was,

5496
02:19:33,591 --> 02:19:35,750
he's too serious though
for a fucking year.

5497
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:37,310
Saifai crazy movie.

5498
02:19:37,490 --> 02:19:39,770
That was a realistic
Scifi movie that wasn't,

5499
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:40,700
you know what I mean?

5500
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:42,800
It wasn't like so stupid that you put,

5501
02:19:42,801 --> 02:19:47,360
you put that heart throb from Thorin there
that things he knew well that boys up

5502
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:48,560
a what man?

5503
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:49,071
Tom Cruise.

5504
02:19:49,071 --> 02:19:52,280
I did a reading with him and
I took his body and I took,

5505
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:53,570
I spent a good four hours,

5506
02:19:53,571 --> 02:19:56,750
Tom Cruise [inaudible] I spent
a good four hours with him.

5507
02:19:56,751 --> 02:19:56,871
Well,

5508
02:19:56,871 --> 02:19:57,980
he'll tell you he was there.

5509
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:58,431
We talk.

5510
02:19:58,431 --> 02:19:59,264
How tiny is he?

5511
02:19:59,510 --> 02:20:00,343
He's not,

5512
02:20:00,410 --> 02:20:02,000
he's not as tall as I am,

5513
02:20:02,001 --> 02:20:03,200
but he's very stout.

5514
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:05,000
He's got wide center of gravity,

5515
02:20:05,001 --> 02:20:05,660
thick hips,

5516
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:06,461
fixed shoulders,

5517
02:20:06,461 --> 02:20:08,900
sloped shoulders as you asked.

5518
02:20:08,901 --> 02:20:09,930
I would make out with them,

5519
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:12,170
make out with them while if all went down,

5520
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:14,600
if you were like canopy,

5521
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:15,380
well,

5522
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:16,111
under a canopy,

5523
02:20:16,111 --> 02:20:16,944
you've got to push back.

5524
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:18,080
Guys made a corner,

5525
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:19,731
put me in a corner,

5526
02:20:19,731 --> 02:20:20,000
don't you?

5527
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,670
And you were playing a
gay lover and a movie,

5528
02:20:22,671 --> 02:20:24,020
but in the movie you don't ever make out.

5529
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:24,290
Right.

5530
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:25,850
But he wants to make out
with you just one time,

5531
02:20:25,851 --> 02:20:28,940
just like pretend that this way we're
going to look and where together we're gay

5532
02:20:28,941 --> 02:20:29,360
lovers.

5533
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:29,660
Well,

5534
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:30,390
this is our movie.

5535
02:20:30,390 --> 02:20:30,831
I,

5536
02:20:30,831 --> 02:20:31,760
after I did the rating,

5537
02:20:31,761 --> 02:20:34,880
I see him six months later at
this big Hoity toity party.

5538
02:20:34,881 --> 02:20:36,560
I talked to him for a good hour,

5539
02:20:36,561 --> 02:20:40,550
maybe hour and a half to wake up over
the past 10 I remember saying to myself,

5540
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:43,423
five minutes,

5541
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:46,930
even an hour and a half brokers like,

5542
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:47,913
oh fuck.

5543
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:49,850
Half an hour and a half by himself.

5544
02:20:49,851 --> 02:20:50,120
Just,

5545
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:54,870
we talked about one on one for an hour
to have killed Americans for an hour and

5546
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:54,880
a half.

5547
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:55,020
Oh,

5548
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:55,853
I kept it.

5549
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:57,211
I kept him though.

5550
02:20:57,211 --> 02:20:58,400
You ain't lying a little bit though.

5551
02:20:58,430 --> 02:20:59,870
I got an,

5552
02:20:59,871 --> 02:21:00,704
I got a witness.

5553
02:21:02,140 --> 02:21:02,691
Jeremy Pivot.

5554
02:21:02,691 --> 02:21:03,081
You tell him.

5555
02:21:03,081 --> 02:21:03,381
Anyway,

5556
02:21:03,381 --> 02:21:04,330
he's got a funny story about it.

5557
02:21:04,331 --> 02:21:05,164
It doesn't matter,

5558
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:09,930
but we're sitting there
talking for 15 minutes and he

5559
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:16,100
and I remember looking at him going
and he was complimenting me on my job.

5560
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:18,230
I did it in the reading and Jeremy was,

5561
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:18,561
he said,

5562
02:21:18,561 --> 02:21:18,861
he said,

5563
02:21:18,861 --> 02:21:20,000
you did a good job 13 times.

5564
02:21:20,001 --> 02:21:20,271
I said,

5565
02:21:20,271 --> 02:21:20,811
13 he goes,

5566
02:21:20,811 --> 02:21:20,991
yes.

5567
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:21,231
I said,

5568
02:21:21,231 --> 02:21:21,680
good.

5569
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:22,650
So we talked for a long time.

5570
02:21:22,651 --> 02:21:23,271
They've talked about kids,

5571
02:21:23,271 --> 02:21:23,571
everything else.

5572
02:21:23,571 --> 02:21:24,680
And I remember thinking to myself,

5573
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:25,490
this is so lame.

5574
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:27,340
And I was a grown man and
I remember thinking myself,

5575
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:28,130
I'll go,

5576
02:21:28,130 --> 02:21:30,230
I just really want to be his friend.

5577
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:30,651
I hope.

5578
02:21:30,651 --> 02:21:31,071
He says,

5579
02:21:31,071 --> 02:21:32,120
let's hang out again.

5580
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:33,020
I remember saying,

5581
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:33,890
I would love to just,

5582
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:37,910
I was so star struck and I really liked
him and he was so nice and I figured,

5583
02:21:37,970 --> 02:21:38,511
you know what's,

5584
02:21:38,511 --> 02:21:41,690
what happens when you give them a list
kind of friends now I kind of know him

5585
02:21:41,691 --> 02:21:42,520
kind of,

5586
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:42,710
Eh,

5587
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:43,543
that didn't happen.

5588
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:44,211
And I remember I said,

5589
02:21:44,211 --> 02:21:44,321
no,

5590
02:21:44,321 --> 02:21:44,810
I was going to happen.

5591
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:45,490
I looked at my house,

5592
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:45,770
I go,

5593
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:46,720
I know I,

5594
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:47,631
this is what I said to him.

5595
02:21:47,631 --> 02:21:48,230
I go,

5596
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:48,980
so how you been?

5597
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:50,510
What's it like just to be the king?

5598
02:21:50,511 --> 02:21:52,490
Is it just generally
boring or a lot of fun?

5599
02:21:52,491 --> 02:21:54,080
He just looked at him and then it's a,

5600
02:21:54,081 --> 02:21:54,501
you know,

5601
02:21:54,501 --> 02:21:55,311
it is what it is.

5602
02:21:55,311 --> 02:21:55,970
And,

5603
02:21:55,970 --> 02:21:56,990
and we started talking.

5604
02:21:56,991 --> 02:21:58,340
I tried to make them laugh and I did.

5605
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,970
I've seen him in person at Tom Cruise.

5606
02:21:59,980 --> 02:22:01,610
He was the first time I've ever been like,

5607
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:02,570
I was at this party.

5608
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:03,620
Everyone was there,

5609
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:05,750
athletes and I was going to the bathroom.

5610
02:22:05,751 --> 02:22:08,990
I was going to expect any him and I
saw much when it first time everyone.

5611
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:09,651
Oh Shit.

5612
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:12,530
Tom Cruise and he was tiny,

5613
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:13,880
tiny like five,

5614
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:14,743
six,

5615
02:22:14,810 --> 02:22:15,520
uh,

5616
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:15,920
yeah,

5617
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:16,280
five.

5618
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:16,940
Yeah.

5619
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:18,650
Five six one 60 yeah.

5620
02:22:18,651 --> 02:22:22,000
Tiny I think thicker than one
60 I think I get five days,

5621
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:22,551
but then again,

5622
02:22:22,551 --> 02:22:23,384
he's in shoes.

5623
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:25,590
Probably might have some
weird shoes probably,

5624
02:22:25,970 --> 02:22:27,000
but he's thick.

5625
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:27,781
He's thick.

5626
02:22:27,781 --> 02:22:28,530
He's got a fan.

5627
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,410
I'm a fan man.

5628
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:30,540
Run the a fan.

5629
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:31,600
He's got a deck on them.

5630
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:32,610
Kids get it.

5631
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,810
We did take a piss together.

5632
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:34,310
What about us?

5633
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:35,490
How long pice together?

5634
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:38,400
You didn't look at his dick.

5635
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,770
I was at the urinal right next to him.

5636
02:22:40,771 --> 02:22:42,660
We were talking about he
took a long pice together.

5637
02:22:42,661 --> 02:22:43,470
What the fuck does that mean?

5638
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:44,850
We talked about Dan cables run.

5639
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:46,440
How long you're pissing.

5640
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:48,510
We've talked about Dan Gables
wrestling camp cause I went to,

5641
02:22:48,511 --> 02:22:50,280
Dan gave us intensive
wrestling camp in Iowa.

5642
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:53,910
My between my junior and senior year of
high school and he said he would have

5643
02:22:53,911 --> 02:22:55,410
loved to have but he couldn't afford it.

5644
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:57,960
We are holding our dicks and I remember,

5645
02:22:58,110 --> 02:23:00,240
I remember thinking I'm not
pissing with Tom Cruise.

5646
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:02,250
I pissed with Dennis Miller ones.

5647
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:03,100
That's not bad.

5648
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:03,933
That's my story.

5649
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:07,070
Doesn't mean somewhere like
NBC or something like that.

5650
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:07,561
Hey Joe,

5651
02:23:07,561 --> 02:23:09,000
you got a hit on your hands there?

5652
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:10,850
It was like fear factor
first got on the air.

5653
02:23:10,851 --> 02:23:11,071
I'm like,

5654
02:23:11,071 --> 02:23:11,431
Oh shit,

5655
02:23:11,431 --> 02:23:12,710
I'm pissing right next to desk Miller.

5656
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:14,221
I wanted to ask him,

5657
02:23:14,221 --> 02:23:14,371
man,

5658
02:23:14,371 --> 02:23:16,260
what's it was all his
fucking George Bush shit.

5659
02:23:16,261 --> 02:23:17,370
You're buddies with George Bush.

5660
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:18,480
I didn't have the balls.

5661
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:19,353
No,

5662
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:20,311
I'm wanting to ask him.

5663
02:23:20,311 --> 02:23:21,780
That's when it became George Bushes Buddy.

5664
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:26,580
Is there anyone now that would startle
you or make you star struck a lot of

5665
02:23:26,581 --> 02:23:26,850
people.

5666
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:27,211
Really?

5667
02:23:27,211 --> 02:23:27,721
For sure.

5668
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:28,554
Yeah,

5669
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:29,670
I got you.

5670
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:31,320
I got weirded out when
I met Anthony Bordain.

5671
02:23:31,321 --> 02:23:32,190
There was a few years back,

5672
02:23:32,191 --> 02:23:34,280
but I got weird about all the UFC is now.

5673
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:36,570
A lot of them are Trans
Jiu Jitsu every day.

5674
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:37,290
Wow.

5675
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:38,370
He trains you just to every day.

5676
02:23:38,371 --> 02:23:40,360
He does two hour classes every day.

5677
02:23:40,361 --> 02:23:42,270
He does an hour of classes
all over the place.

5678
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:43,104
Even when he's on the road,

5679
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:43,890
he was doing wrong.

5680
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:45,120
He was rolling in Budapest,

5681
02:23:45,121 --> 02:23:45,954
Hungary.

5682
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:50,040
I'm a big fan of a picture of him on
Twitter with his fucking white belt and a

5683
02:23:50,041 --> 02:23:53,820
geeky showing up at this fucking Jiujitsu
pleased to Carlson Gracie's place.

5684
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:56,670
Told me he was doing all top game.

5685
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:58,350
He said he was shitting
how bone fragments.

5686
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,753
God Damn.

5687
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:01,110
He said they all have old school.

5688
02:24:01,111 --> 02:24:02,430
Carlson Gracie top game.

5689
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:03,001
Oh my God.

5690
02:24:03,001 --> 02:24:07,520
I said I'm shitting out bone
fragments and you gave me so,

5691
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:11,780
so you're a little star struck the
who would you be starstruck with free.

5692
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:14,640
I got starstruck when I met Arnold
Schwarzenegger and he knew who I was.

5693
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:15,480
Oh you did?

5694
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:16,141
Nice to meet you.

5695
02:24:16,141 --> 02:24:16,900
So,

5696
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:17,260
oh,

5697
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:17,541
I know.

5698
02:24:17,541 --> 02:24:17,881
I was like,

5699
02:24:17,881 --> 02:24:18,714
what's up dude?

5700
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:20,090
I got that camera.

5701
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:22,950
Very good job.

5702
02:24:23,370 --> 02:24:25,800
I was like UFC fan.

5703
02:24:25,801 --> 02:24:26,634
He's a UFC fan.

5704
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,863
Arnold.

5705
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:28,531
I mean,

5706
02:24:28,531 --> 02:24:28,670
yeah,

5707
02:24:28,670 --> 02:24:29,250
it was a big one.

5708
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:29,940
That was a big one.

5709
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:30,480
Um,

5710
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:31,313
if I met Clint Eastwood,

5711
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:32,610
even though I think he's a silly bitch,

5712
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,430
you know that thing he did with the
Obama when he's talking down to them in a

5713
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:35,761
chair,

5714
02:24:35,761 --> 02:24:36,810
it's still Clint Eastwood.

5715
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:36,961
I mean,

5716
02:24:36,961 --> 02:24:38,100
he's a crazy old man now.

5717
02:24:38,101 --> 02:24:39,360
Kind of Clint Eastwood.

5718
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:40,920
He's give him his props.

5719
02:24:40,921 --> 02:24:42,150
Rog Josie Wales.

5720
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:43,720
Great movies period.

5721
02:24:43,721 --> 02:24:48,090
It's on pumps and much of our
live in boy o high plains drifter.

5722
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:48,541
Come on.

5723
02:24:48,541 --> 02:24:50,070
So I gotta be honest with you guys.

5724
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:54,170
I'm a lot younger than the clinics
was not that big of a dance hall dude.

5725
02:24:54,730 --> 02:24:57,870
It's a shame if you're a family
dollar million dollar baby.

5726
02:24:57,900 --> 02:24:59,760
Unforgiven gypsy the unforgiven.

5727
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:00,001
No,

5728
02:25:00,001 --> 02:25:01,050
I didn't do the good,

5729
02:25:01,051 --> 02:25:01,411
the bad,

5730
02:25:01,411 --> 02:25:01,801
the ugly.

5731
02:25:01,801 --> 02:25:02,790
It just goes on and on.

5732
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:06,210
Then you guys know he was before our time.

5733
02:25:06,211 --> 02:25:07,050
Man Clean.

5734
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:07,891
She's old as fuck,

5735
02:25:07,891 --> 02:25:08,161
dude.

5736
02:25:08,161 --> 02:25:09,710
Don't try to put it as he's older.

5737
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:10,573
His Clark Tori.

5738
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:13,050
You guys dirty Harry.

5739
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:13,920
When we were kids,

5740
02:25:13,921 --> 02:25:16,920
when we were like little kids every
which way was loose every which way,

5741
02:25:16,921 --> 02:25:18,320
but loose was the big enemies,

5742
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:20,190
which meant that he was already so old.

5743
02:25:20,191 --> 02:25:21,690
He wasn't doing the cowboy movies anymore.

5744
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:24,900
He was like this old
bare knuckle boxer too.

5745
02:25:24,910 --> 02:25:25,990
Back in those days.

5746
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:27,123
Oh my God.

5747
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:27,941
Amy Puts set.

5748
02:25:27,941 --> 02:25:30,010
His girlfriend was in every movie here.

5749
02:25:30,011 --> 02:25:31,940
This chick Sandra Lockhart was,

5750
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,370
she has with the bond,

5751
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:36,100
every fucking movie he did.

5752
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:37,950
Every movie he did dirty shit.

5753
02:25:37,951 --> 02:25:38,920
That was his girlfriend.

5754
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,470
Motherfucker had this one was in the,

5755
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:43,690
they put her in every movie.

5756
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:46,780
Every movie was him and his girlfriend
until they broke up and when they broke

5757
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:46,901
up,

5758
02:25:46,901 --> 02:25:50,020
like part of their breakup was that he
had to get her some sort of a development

5759
02:25:50,021 --> 02:25:52,520
deal and then she sued for,

5760
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,770
she sued him because she said that
like allegedly I should say this is all

5761
02:25:56,771 --> 02:25:57,940
allegedly I'm reading this online.

5762
02:25:57,941 --> 02:25:58,900
It could be all be bullshit,

5763
02:25:59,110 --> 02:26:03,200
but she thought that he was blocking
her movies from being made dad.

5764
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:05,860
It was like it was an ugly
composes his own music.

5765
02:26:05,861 --> 02:26:08,140
All the jazz and there's all the scores.

5766
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:09,250
Sure,

5767
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:09,970
sure he does.

5768
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:12,340
He composes in and now what's the movie?

5769
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:13,390
A high plains drifter.

5770
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,231
That's his,

5771
02:26:14,231 --> 02:26:14,920
that's his score.

5772
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:16,070
Have you seen shortly,

5773
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:17,560
have you seen interviews with him?

5774
02:26:17,561 --> 02:26:17,710
Why?

5775
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:18,500
He's very old now.

5776
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:18,700
I don't,

5777
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:19,361
that's what I'm saying.

5778
02:26:19,361 --> 02:26:20,620
He did American sniper.

5779
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:25,680
That's what they say or was the onset
and they just know he directed it.

5780
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:27,040
You know he's not,

5781
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,930
he's not so old that he can't do that.

5782
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:31,050
That's what he's not all up in there.

5783
02:26:31,051 --> 02:26:34,170
Like frick you think
he's all you American,

5784
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:34,870
right.

5785
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:35,261
My mind.

5786
02:26:35,261 --> 02:26:37,060
Your p's and q's about
claims would do me a favor.

5787
02:26:37,610 --> 02:26:37,910
What?

5788
02:26:37,910 --> 02:26:39,060
Chris cow motherfucker.

5789
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:39,970
I think he lied.

5790
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:42,281
Hold on.

5791
02:26:42,281 --> 02:26:42,881
Hold on a second.

5792
02:26:42,881 --> 02:26:44,330
It's not hating on someone.

5793
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:45,310
It's tell the truth.

5794
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:49,150
It's hating on the rest of the population
to pretend that truth doesn't exist

5795
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:52,600
and to not take those facts
into consideration when
you're discussing a story.

5796
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:53,770
I can't say,

5797
02:26:53,771 --> 02:26:54,071
hey,

5798
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:54,821
hit that,

5799
02:26:54,821 --> 02:26:58,420
but he's the greatest
American sniper ever,

5800
02:26:58,720 --> 02:26:59,171
ever.

5801
02:26:59,171 --> 02:27:00,250
Whether he's lying or not.

5802
02:27:00,251 --> 02:27:01,060
That's true.

5803
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:01,990
Those are facts.

5804
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:04,120
What do you know about that?

5805
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:06,040
I know what America tells me.

5806
02:27:07,450 --> 02:27:09,820
What do you know about Clint
Eastwood directed American sniper?

5807
02:27:09,821 --> 02:27:10,571
What do you know about it?

5808
02:27:10,571 --> 02:27:11,740
For sure it's a movie.

5809
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:16,190
That's what they tell and it's a
good movie according to some pizza.

5810
02:27:16,990 --> 02:27:17,710
I haven't seen it.

5811
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:18,360
I haven't seen it.

5812
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:19,380
You want me to tell you what happens?

5813
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,650
Ours for your fucking hated it.

5814
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:23,290
I have a video of Ari Shaffir
and Thompson girl arguing.

5815
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:26,680
Thompson Gara says it's amazing
and Ari Shaffir says retarded.

5816
02:27:26,681 --> 02:27:27,970
I listened to it on your show.

5817
02:27:27,971 --> 02:27:28,550
Hate on it.

5818
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:29,770
It's fucking crazy.

5819
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:30,780
Well,

5820
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:31,660
Teesha join us.

5821
02:27:31,661 --> 02:27:33,400
If what he said was true.

5822
02:27:33,610 --> 02:27:34,600
Does he not have a point?

5823
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:37,150
Was there a rubber baby that was
like obviously a rubber baby?

5824
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:38,290
Not really.

5825
02:27:38,710 --> 02:27:39,550
Not really.

5826
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:41,200
I thought it was a real baby.

5827
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:43,241
Not really.

5828
02:27:43,241 --> 02:27:44,350
It was a real baby.

5829
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:45,510
Jamie has something to say to them.

5830
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:45,850
I don't,

5831
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:47,410
I don't go to the movies and be like,

5832
02:27:47,411 --> 02:27:47,861
God damn,

5833
02:27:47,861 --> 02:27:49,000
that baby looks fake.

5834
02:27:49,001 --> 02:27:50,140
This is ridiculous.

5835
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:51,430
Clint Eastwood come on.

5836
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:52,390
That is splitting hairs.

5837
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:53,260
Well,

5838
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:54,280
that's just one thing.

5839
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:57,250
I mean are you had a boost in my
worries when I go to the movies.

5840
02:27:57,290 --> 02:27:58,480
The famous baby,

5841
02:27:58,650 --> 02:27:59,680
the big baby.

5842
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:01,170
Come on,

5843
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:02,140
get the fake baby.

5844
02:28:02,470 --> 02:28:03,281
That looks real.

5845
02:28:03,281 --> 02:28:03,700
Hold on.

5846
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:04,533
We'll see.

5847
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:06,160
You just saw it for a brief second.

5848
02:28:06,490 --> 02:28:07,530
If you're staring at the baby.

5849
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:09,790
Picture the fake baby right now.

5850
02:28:09,791 --> 02:28:10,630
It looks like a baby.

5851
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:11,613
I'm cool with it.

5852
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:12,790
It seems fine.

5853
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:13,903
It seems fine.

5854
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:16,090
I'm not really paying attention to it.

5855
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:16,601
Okay.

5856
02:28:16,601 --> 02:28:17,434
That was it.

5857
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:18,401
And your boy,

5858
02:28:18,401 --> 02:28:19,234
he's hating on it.

5859
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:19,571
No,

5860
02:28:19,571 --> 02:28:22,910
there's more apparently some real
fake baby shit going on later.

5861
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,421
Oh,

5862
02:28:23,421 --> 02:28:23,901
here it goes.

5863
02:28:23,901 --> 02:28:24,111
Okay.

5864
02:28:24,111 --> 02:28:25,480
That's fake as fuck Louis Thumb.

5865
02:28:25,590 --> 02:28:26,260
Oh God.

5866
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:27,230
Mark is.

5867
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:28,700
Fuck it does look,

5868
02:28:28,770 --> 02:28:29,603
you don't

5869
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:32,390
drastic Parkman like that.

5870
02:28:32,391 --> 02:28:32,961
T rex,

5871
02:28:32,961 --> 02:28:33,171
man.

5872
02:28:33,171 --> 02:28:34,490
I'll tell you why they think

5873
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:37,700
you're being dishonest.

5874
02:28:37,730 --> 02:28:42,470
You don't think it's ridiculous looking
at his thumb moving show that the sat.

5875
02:28:43,230 --> 02:28:44,063
No,

5876
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:45,021
it's not even.

5877
02:28:45,021 --> 02:28:45,741
That's a joke.

5878
02:28:45,741 --> 02:28:46,790
That's someone being silly.

5879
02:28:47,090 --> 02:28:49,190
They're joking around because
it's a fucking rubber baby.

5880
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:49,451
Oh,

5881
02:28:49,451 --> 02:28:50,330
come on.

5882
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:53,720
The baby can only work a certain amount
of hours and they got union rules,

5883
02:28:53,970 --> 02:28:56,470
so it's a bad movie
because that baby's face.

5884
02:28:56,620 --> 02:28:58,070
I had to work with babies.

5885
02:28:58,520 --> 02:28:59,630
It's a pain in the ass.

5886
02:28:59,631 --> 02:28:59,961
Listen,

5887
02:28:59,961 --> 02:29:02,540
I don't think it's a bad movie because
I don't think it's a bad movie cause I

5888
02:29:02,541 --> 02:29:03,110
didn't see it,

5889
02:29:03,110 --> 02:29:04,890
but I definitely don't
think that just look,

5890
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:05,331
you got to,

5891
02:29:05,331 --> 02:29:06,830
I don't want to pay attention to the baby,

5892
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:08,750
but apparently the baby
was only one issue,

5893
02:29:10,390 --> 02:29:11,091
that's for sure.

5894
02:29:11,091 --> 02:29:11,924
Just look terrible.

5895
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:15,800
I didn't see the movie movie
was implausible was ridiculous.

5896
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,930
I was just disappointed that
I didn't see it at that,

5897
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:18,823
that he,

5898
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:19,290
he,

5899
02:29:19,290 --> 02:29:22,080
he lied a lot about certain
things and I think that's a bump.

5900
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:22,933
Fuck.

5901
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:26,630
He still is the greatest
American sniper ever.

5902
02:29:27,610 --> 02:29:28,010
Okay.

5903
02:29:28,010 --> 02:29:29,120
That's a weird thing to say though.

5904
02:29:29,121 --> 02:29:30,050
Like you don't give a fuck.

5905
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:30,471
So you,

5906
02:29:30,471 --> 02:29:35,090
you were not willing to overlook
Anderson Silva a pass on doing steroids.

5907
02:29:35,970 --> 02:29:36,650
Interesting.

5908
02:29:36,650 --> 02:29:38,840
It's interesting and Brian
Willing to pass though.

5909
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:39,291
Yeah,

5910
02:29:39,291 --> 02:29:39,770
that's true.

5911
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:41,050
You're very inconsistent

5912
02:29:43,050 --> 02:29:43,883
that

5913
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,510
we've gone with the wind.

5914
02:29:47,710 --> 02:29:51,620
Just kind of like a blind tire
career blind patriotism to that.

5915
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:51,980
Right?

5916
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:54,440
Like you recognize that he's
a greatest American sniper,

5917
02:29:54,441 --> 02:29:56,450
so all the other stuff you
just don't want to talk about.

5918
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:57,171
No,

5919
02:29:57,171 --> 02:29:57,981
I'll talk about it.

5920
02:29:57,981 --> 02:30:02,540
But him being a great American sniper
is the biggest thing that that should

5921
02:30:02,541 --> 02:30:03,374
Trump all of it.

5922
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:03,771
Yeah.

5923
02:30:03,771 --> 02:30:04,311
He lied.

5924
02:30:04,311 --> 02:30:06,200
He didn't take out people,

5925
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:06,710
uh,

5926
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:08,390
during that trip we say Katrina.

5927
02:30:08,391 --> 02:30:08,660
Yeah.

5928
02:30:08,660 --> 02:30:08,871
Yeah.

5929
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:09,540
He didn't do that.

5930
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:11,480
He didn't beat up Jesse Ventura.

5931
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:11,651
Yeah,

5932
02:30:11,651 --> 02:30:12,140
I know.

5933
02:30:12,140 --> 02:30:12,920
Cool man.

5934
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:16,190
But just killed 160 terrorist.

5935
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:16,791
Yeah,

5936
02:30:16,791 --> 02:30:17,361
I'm cool man.

5937
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:18,650
I'm gonna overlook some of that shit.

5938
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:21,470
You're still a great American
and they're both true.

5939
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:22,610
It is true.

5940
02:30:22,610 --> 02:30:22,881
I don't,

5941
02:30:22,881 --> 02:30:23,780
I don't know what's true.

5942
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:27,560
Obviously I'm talking about interviews
and people's books and all this different

5943
02:30:27,561 --> 02:30:27,801
shit.

5944
02:30:27,801 --> 02:30:28,634
I didn't really,

5945
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:29,503
unless we were there,

5946
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:31,250
we really don't know what
the fuck actually happened.

5947
02:30:31,460 --> 02:30:32,960
But they can both be true.

5948
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:36,260
Like I've met people that were movie
stars that were also tremendous wires.

5949
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:37,130
I mean,

5950
02:30:37,130 --> 02:30:40,340
I don't want to name names with the dude
was a movie star and he's a tremendous

5951
02:30:40,341 --> 02:30:40,641
liar.

5952
02:30:40,641 --> 02:30:43,460
Just makes up stories about all kinds of
things and you would never believe you

5953
02:30:43,461 --> 02:30:44,720
like this stuff.

5954
02:30:44,721 --> 02:30:45,381
You know,

5955
02:30:45,381 --> 02:30:46,910
it's just a complete fabrication.

5956
02:30:46,911 --> 02:30:49,730
Things that never happened to him and
the guy's worth millions and millions of

5957
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:49,731
dollars.

5958
02:30:49,731 --> 02:30:54,170
But one thing we do know is he was a navy
seal and he was a sniper who killed a

5959
02:30:54,171 --> 02:30:55,170
lot of people for,

5960
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:56,033
for America.

5961
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:57,290
He risked his life for America.

5962
02:30:57,291 --> 02:30:57,561
Hold on.

5963
02:30:57,561 --> 02:30:58,340
So he's okay with,

5964
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:58,880
hold on,

5965
02:30:58,880 --> 02:30:59,713
hold on.

5966
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:00,870
For sure.

5967
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:01,400
Relaxed.

5968
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:01,880
He had,

5969
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,500
he went to buds training.

5970
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:03,741
Yes,

5971
02:31:03,741 --> 02:31:04,521
he became a navy seal.

5972
02:31:04,521 --> 02:31:07,910
Very difficult to do and he's
really good at killing people.

5973
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:08,870
Uh,

5974
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:11,930
that's a skill set as a sniper that I'm
sure it takes a lot of things I don't

5975
02:31:11,931 --> 02:31:12,764
know about.

5976
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:15,650
I don't think that that necessarily means,

5977
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:17,840
and I'm sorry to say this and that,

5978
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:19,410
that means he's a good guy.

5979
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:20,280
I don't

5980
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,360
think that necessarily means
that girls aren't getting,

5981
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:25,200
it doesn't mean he gets a pass for lying.

5982
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:25,691
Uh,

5983
02:31:25,691 --> 02:31:29,520
and direct a making up stories
about not only killing looters,

5984
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:31,440
New Orleans who are stealing stuff,

5985
02:31:31,441 --> 02:31:34,950
which is already illegal and considered
murder under the laws of this land.

5986
02:31:34,951 --> 02:31:36,420
But he didn't do it so well,

5987
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:37,770
but that's what he was
saying he was doing,

5988
02:31:37,771 --> 02:31:38,521
which is very strange.

5989
02:31:38,521 --> 02:31:40,650
I haven't read the book so I don't want
to talk too much and I haven't seen the

5990
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:41,550
book or the movie.

5991
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:42,540
All you do is no his name.

5992
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:44,970
Let me play devil's advocate here.

5993
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,050
Just as a,

5994
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:47,850
as a person who like,

5995
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:49,680
let me just be completely
objective ticket,

5996
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:50,820
a wild shot at this.

5997
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:53,280
Now this might not be the case,

5998
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:57,540
so I'm just put that out there in the
advanced would if he decided to tell all

5999
02:31:57,541 --> 02:32:01,560
these tall tales because the book would
be better and he wanted to sell a book

6000
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:04,500
and make a lot of money selling a book
and he didn't understand the kind of

6001
02:32:04,501 --> 02:32:07,020
media storm and that these checks,

6002
02:32:07,050 --> 02:32:09,480
these are these stories going to
be checked and double checked.

6003
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:12,960
And when he decided to do was add a
bunch of fabricated shit to a real story

6004
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:14,250
because you know,

6005
02:32:14,310 --> 02:32:17,910
first of all he's probably psychologically
damaged from shooting a hundred and

6006
02:32:17,911 --> 02:32:19,080
fucking 60 people.

6007
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,180
Like I don't think you'd
get away from that for free.

6008
02:32:21,450 --> 02:32:22,620
I don't think you'd go to war.

6009
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:24,320
And I don't think anybody
rides for free anymore.

6010
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,160
I think you do.

6011
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:27,450
You take in a lot of psychological damage.

6012
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:28,530
Everybody says that.

6013
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:33,090
So it could possibly be that the guy
just said all that shit because he wanted

6014
02:32:33,091 --> 02:32:33,750
to sell books.

6015
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:34,470
It's possible.

6016
02:32:34,470 --> 02:32:35,220
And is that crazy?

6017
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:36,360
Does that make him a bad guy?

6018
02:32:36,361 --> 02:32:37,430
Because I don't know.

6019
02:32:37,431 --> 02:32:39,870
It was government's not
paying them very well.

6020
02:32:39,871 --> 02:32:40,704
Right.

6021
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:41,310
Good point.

6022
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:42,420
He's not making much money,

6023
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:44,040
so he fabricates his stories.

6024
02:32:44,130 --> 02:32:46,950
His book is a New York Times bestseller.

6025
02:32:47,130 --> 02:32:48,180
He gets all this money.

6026
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:48,920
Is that,

6027
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:49,950
that's the deal.

6028
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:50,521
It's all possible.

6029
02:32:50,521 --> 02:32:51,540
All I'm trying to say is this.

6030
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:52,170
I'm not,

6031
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:53,190
I don't know Chris Kyle.

6032
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:53,410
I didn't,

6033
02:32:53,410 --> 02:32:54,720
I don't know anything about the guy.

6034
02:32:54,990 --> 02:32:56,460
I don't know if he's a bad guy,

6035
02:32:56,461 --> 02:32:57,294
a good guy.

6036
02:32:57,390 --> 02:32:57,570
I,

6037
02:32:57,570 --> 02:32:57,850
I'm,

6038
02:32:57,850 --> 02:32:59,460
I tend to be pretty patriotic,

6039
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:01,261
so usually,

6040
02:33:01,261 --> 02:33:01,640
yeah,

6041
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:02,640
so usually he gets,

6042
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:03,150
he gets,

6043
02:33:03,150 --> 02:33:04,440
he gets a lot of leeway with me.

6044
02:33:04,441 --> 02:33:06,840
When you're a soldier and you went
to Iraq and you do all that stuff.

6045
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:07,650
Yes.

6046
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:08,101
For me,

6047
02:33:08,101 --> 02:33:08,940
that's how I am,

6048
02:33:09,300 --> 02:33:13,680
but I do think that I still have to
at least like what Joe was saying,

6049
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:17,760
when you found out that
you made up these stories,

6050
02:33:17,761 --> 02:33:18,870
that's kind of a bummer for me.

6051
02:33:18,871 --> 02:33:21,440
It's just disappointing that he
did lie about something like,

6052
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:23,970
I don't give a shit trying to
sell blue for whatever reason.

6053
02:33:23,971 --> 02:33:26,670
It could very well have been that he was
trying to sell books and he could also

6054
02:33:26,671 --> 02:33:28,500
very well be that we were talking before.

6055
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:33,690
Maybe we need to understand a little
bit better since none of us went to war.

6056
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:38,910
What kind of mental toll that takes on
a person and that you kind of shouldn't

6057
02:33:38,911 --> 02:33:43,290
expect them to be completely fine with
everything when they come back and some

6058
02:33:43,291 --> 02:33:46,860
of them are going to make shit up and
maybe they're making shit up because

6059
02:33:46,861 --> 02:33:50,820
reality is so fucking crazy that they
don't want to deal with it anymore.

6060
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:51,750
Or maybe so they just,

6061
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:52,861
he thinks it's real.

6062
02:33:52,861 --> 02:33:57,510
Maybe he maybe had a situation where he
was in New Orleans and you thought about

6063
02:33:57,511 --> 02:33:58,530
shooting didn't happen,

6064
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:59,460
but he goes to war.

6065
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:00,300
Something happens like,

6066
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:01,591
yeah,

6067
02:34:01,591 --> 02:34:02,700
well it's good for the book.

6068
02:34:02,730 --> 02:34:03,000
Right?

6069
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:08,000
And by the no one could understand what
the fuck that guy's life was like except

6070
02:34:08,551 --> 02:34:09,384
for him.

6071
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:11,550
And it's not even given him an excuse.

6072
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:13,980
What we're saying is we're just
looking at the possibilities,

6073
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:14,190
right?

6074
02:34:14,190 --> 02:34:15,060
Like instead of saying,

6075
02:34:15,061 --> 02:34:15,510
Hey,

6076
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:17,130
this is a guy that was full of shit,

6077
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,100
he lied about that

6078
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:18,940
and he's a bad person.

6079
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:23,320
This is a guy that was forced to do
some anti human shit for the government.

6080
02:34:23,350 --> 02:34:24,520
People are complicated.

6081
02:34:24,521 --> 02:34:25,600
And you and I have talked about this.

6082
02:34:25,601 --> 02:34:26,770
People are complicated.

6083
02:34:26,771 --> 02:34:27,161
A lot of people,

6084
02:34:27,161 --> 02:34:31,240
we know certain people that are high
profile people that get criticized a lot

6085
02:34:31,241 --> 02:34:34,360
and they're hated on and you know
them pretty intimately and it's like,

6086
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:35,650
yes,

6087
02:34:35,650 --> 02:34:36,610
they've done some things.

6088
02:34:36,611 --> 02:34:38,350
There are also complicated people.

6089
02:34:38,470 --> 02:34:41,830
They also do incredibly good things
for people that nobody knows about.

6090
02:34:41,831 --> 02:34:42,790
So there's,

6091
02:34:42,791 --> 02:34:46,840
there's no question that people
generally are not black and white.

6092
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:48,640
They have a bad side.

6093
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:49,121
They have a good side.

6094
02:34:49,121 --> 02:34:50,050
And I know I do.

6095
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:50,941
I know I do.

6096
02:34:50,941 --> 02:34:52,140
I know I have a lot about,

6097
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,510
I haven't,

6098
02:34:52,510 --> 02:34:53,800
I know a lot of things about myself.

6099
02:34:53,801 --> 02:34:54,760
I'm not that proud of.

6100
02:34:54,761 --> 02:34:56,170
So if this is black and white,

6101
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:57,670
this is very black and white.

6102
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:59,080
If you didn't like the film,

6103
02:34:59,081 --> 02:35:00,280
American sniper hero,

6104
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:02,460
fucking terrorist diseases,

6105
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:04,750
we should fear is a Jew.

6106
02:35:05,170 --> 02:35:06,100
That's what they should do.

6107
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:07,480
They should.

6108
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:08,590
This is how they should check.

6109
02:35:08,591 --> 02:35:09,251
If you're a terrorist.

6110
02:35:09,251 --> 02:35:09,490
We've uh,

6111
02:35:09,490 --> 02:35:09,910
been,

6112
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:11,080
did you like American sniper?

6113
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:11,680
No.

6114
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,513
Go to the right.

6115
02:35:12,520 --> 02:35:13,510
Did you like American sniper?

6116
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:13,840
Yes.

6117
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:15,520
Go to the lab is when you
go to the right though.

6118
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:16,900
You don't get on the plane.

6119
02:35:18,490 --> 02:35:18,880
Dammit.

6120
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:23,470
Brennan arch fear would chew you up
if you guys had this conversation.

6121
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:24,341
He gets sun,

6122
02:35:24,341 --> 02:35:25,540
so anchoring it sunny.

6123
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:29,360
I get an eerie tune in to hear him
ranting with the Thompson [inaudible].

6124
02:35:29,390 --> 02:35:30,223
It's hilarious.

6125
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:31,271
The two of them together.

6126
02:35:31,271 --> 02:35:32,770
I got to eventually put this online,

6127
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:35,860
but they get so fucking in
each other's face about it.

6128
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:38,800
They're like yelling like at something
like really important to talk about.

6129
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:40,330
I do think it's,

6130
02:35:40,331 --> 02:35:40,661
it's,

6131
02:35:40,661 --> 02:35:45,661
it's important to be charitable about
just how complicated human beings are.

6132
02:35:47,290 --> 02:35:48,123
Yes.

6133
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:50,030
It doesn't mean you
don't call somebody out.

6134
02:35:51,450 --> 02:35:52,740
Just so contrived at all.

6135
02:35:53,850 --> 02:35:57,690
The fact that they didn't show him
getting shot was actually a good choice

6136
02:35:59,930 --> 02:36:02,640
and then at the end of like he
was killed that day and writing,

6137
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:07,450
oh,

6138
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:08,231
we play the whole thing.

6139
02:36:08,231 --> 02:36:08,671
I'll put it on.

6140
02:36:08,671 --> 02:36:11,220
I'll put the whole thing in
Boston winters communist,

6141
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:13,510
they big go.

6142
02:36:14,330 --> 02:36:15,610
They go at it for like 10 minutes.

6143
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:19,690
He was mad that at the end they don't
show him getting killed is mad about

6144
02:36:19,691 --> 02:36:20,121
everything.

6145
02:36:20,121 --> 02:36:20,954
You thought it sucked.

6146
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:25,240
He brought a bunch of people from his
Twitter feed to go to the movie and heckle

6147
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:26,493
and they all went,

6148
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:28,660
they filled the audience,

6149
02:36:28,770 --> 02:36:31,550
the the entire audience
already best friends.

6150
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:35,100
I would've got a recipe like UFC
fighter beats the shit out of Bahrain.

6151
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:36,520
His friends during the Mexican side,

6152
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:37,990
not the time to get arrested.

6153
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:38,853
This is not for you.

6154
02:36:38,860 --> 02:36:40,610
Don't do that man.

6155
02:36:40,660 --> 02:36:41,620
Beat up a bunch of chairs.

6156
02:36:41,621 --> 02:36:42,401
Coffee forever,

6157
02:36:42,401 --> 02:36:42,850
son,

6158
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:43,683
Chris Calvert.

6159
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:45,903
Hey man,

6160
02:36:45,950 --> 02:36:46,510
terrorists.

6161
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:47,221
I can be swayed.

6162
02:36:47,221 --> 02:36:48,040
When did you see the movie?

6163
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:49,290
I did and I haven't read
the book or anything.

6164
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:50,051
He knows nothing.

6165
02:36:50,051 --> 02:36:50,330
No bad,

6166
02:36:50,330 --> 02:36:50,651
no nothing.

6167
02:36:50,651 --> 02:36:51,131
I only read.

6168
02:36:51,131 --> 02:36:52,620
All I read is that the,

6169
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:55,030
I looked at all the stuff
online and I was like,

6170
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:55,301
wow,

6171
02:36:55,301 --> 02:36:56,134
that's interesting.

6172
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:56,741
I haven't read it.

6173
02:36:56,741 --> 02:36:57,041
I don't know.

6174
02:36:57,041 --> 02:36:57,250
I'm,

6175
02:36:57,250 --> 02:36:57,920
that's incredible.

6176
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:58,753
So swimming,

6177
02:36:58,960 --> 02:36:59,830
pinning on anything.

6178
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:03,520
When someone has killed that
many people for the government,

6179
02:37:03,521 --> 02:37:06,790
they give him a green light to kill that
many people and to kill 160 people like

6180
02:37:06,791 --> 02:37:08,650
the idea of like telling
a lie about something.

6181
02:37:08,651 --> 02:37:09,880
It's like really no big deal.

6182
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:13,000
Well that guy killing 160
people doing all these tours,

6183
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:15,620
you know in war should be,

6184
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:16,130
should

6185
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:18,410
get $1 million from the US
government for the rest of his life.

6186
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:20,660
He should be financially set
for the rest of his life.

6187
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:20,961
Yeah,

6188
02:37:20,961 --> 02:37:21,381
no kidding.

6189
02:37:21,381 --> 02:37:21,591
Right?

6190
02:37:21,591 --> 02:37:22,131
Like how much,

6191
02:37:22,131 --> 02:37:24,290
how much do they actually
get when they retire?

6192
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:28,520
My Buddy Buddy's Delta force was
delta force and he said that I heard,

6193
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:32,360
and I don't want to say online
because I mean it's so pitiful.

6194
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:34,130
It's called hazardous duty pay.

6195
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:35,570
You don't make any money,

6196
02:37:35,740 --> 02:37:35,980
you,

6197
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:36,191
you,

6198
02:37:36,191 --> 02:37:37,370
you don't have enough to live.

6199
02:37:37,371 --> 02:37:38,031
And if you are,

6200
02:37:38,031 --> 02:37:38,960
if you go to a divorce,

6201
02:37:38,961 --> 02:37:41,450
half of that money goes to your
wife and your personal life,

6202
02:37:41,451 --> 02:37:44,990
your fuck cause their divorce
rate's like 96% it's not cool man.

6203
02:37:44,991 --> 02:37:46,760
They should definitely
get more money and stress.

6204
02:37:46,761 --> 02:37:47,720
The same with cops.

6205
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:50,000
Stress that's tress is insane.

6206
02:37:50,001 --> 02:37:50,181
It's,

6207
02:37:50,181 --> 02:37:50,361
it's,

6208
02:37:50,361 --> 02:37:50,810
it's like,

6209
02:37:50,810 --> 02:37:53,510
it's an unprecedented
level of success of stress.

6210
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:54,710
It's so hard to deal with.

6211
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:56,450
It's also really hard
when you're a sniper,

6212
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:56,870
you're,

6213
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:57,800
I don't know this,

6214
02:37:57,801 --> 02:38:01,580
but I do know that a combatant can be
even a child running munitions to a

6215
02:38:01,581 --> 02:38:02,270
mortar,

6216
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:04,670
and if that child is doing that
or a guy's looking at you with,

6217
02:38:04,671 --> 02:38:06,980
with binoculars and trying to
get a beat on your position,

6218
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:07,843
you take them out.

6219
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:09,343
That's hard.

6220
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:11,780
That's hard for a
soldier who gets command.

6221
02:38:11,781 --> 02:38:12,441
Take that guy out.

6222
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:14,970
Should that kid shoot that woman
because she happens to be San Francisco.

6223
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:15,980
The enemy,

6224
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:16,791
if you watch the movie,

6225
02:38:16,791 --> 02:38:17,541
it's sucks.

6226
02:38:17,541 --> 02:38:18,780
Word hard is not even a,

6227
02:38:18,870 --> 02:38:20,120
it's not a good enough word.

6228
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:20,450
No,

6229
02:38:20,450 --> 02:38:20,911
it's not that.

6230
02:38:20,911 --> 02:38:21,261
It's hard.

6231
02:38:21,261 --> 02:38:22,550
It's almost impossible.

6232
02:38:22,551 --> 02:38:26,360
It's almost impossible to reset from
that and be a normal person without some

6233
02:38:26,361 --> 02:38:26,750
help.

6234
02:38:26,750 --> 02:38:30,980
I'm sure that's something go from doing
that to fucking walking through radio

6235
02:38:30,981 --> 02:38:32,050
shack with your wife.

6236
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:33,350
What the hell?

6237
02:38:33,950 --> 02:38:36,620
That's why you know all these
guys coming back from war I,

6238
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:37,350
you know,

6239
02:38:37,350 --> 02:38:40,910
that's one way to make America a little
bit more polite and running into a bunch

6240
02:38:40,911 --> 02:38:43,070
of people that just got back from
killing a bunch of other people.

6241
02:38:43,210 --> 02:38:43,900
Like,

6242
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:44,420
you know,

6243
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:47,300
people have a different attitude when
you've been to a war is a different

6244
02:38:47,301 --> 02:38:51,230
mentality and we have to respect that
and I think we have to consider that

6245
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:52,880
that's an important as a culture,

6246
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:57,830
as a society that sort of wants to gloss
over war and wants to glorify it and

6247
02:38:57,831 --> 02:39:00,140
make it out to be this
all this John Wayne Shit,

6248
02:39:00,350 --> 02:39:01,980
we have to look at what the
fuck is really happened.

6249
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,930
These people psychologically absolute
same and the same thing with cops.

6250
02:39:06,110 --> 02:39:10,310
Everybody wants to shit on cops because
cops do occasionally do they do bad

6251
02:39:10,311 --> 02:39:13,610
things and for you that have
been done wrong by these cops,

6252
02:39:13,611 --> 02:39:14,630
they couldn't handle that job.

6253
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:16,340
I 100% feel for you.

6254
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:17,590
I 100% feel for it.

6255
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:18,051
I feel bad.

6256
02:39:18,051 --> 02:39:23,051
I think we also have to consider the
fact that being a cop is insane job.

6257
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:27,800
Some people beat calm
fucking insurance salesman.

6258
02:39:27,890 --> 02:39:29,960
Some people sell cars,

6259
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:32,600
some people become artists.

6260
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:36,530
Some people would come cops and you're
out there in your fucking pulling up to

6261
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:40,670
pulling sideways a guy shooting a rifle
out of a fucking window and taking

6262
02:39:40,671 --> 02:39:41,350
people out.

6263
02:39:41,350 --> 02:39:42,890
You've got to figure out how
to sneak into the building.

6264
02:39:42,891 --> 02:39:43,940
He called the Swat team.

6265
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:46,550
You're hiding behind your
car here in fucking bullets,

6266
02:39:46,551 --> 02:39:47,600
bouncing off the street.

6267
02:39:47,810 --> 02:39:49,960
Cops have to deal with some
issues getting shot at.

6268
02:39:51,250 --> 02:39:52,610
So I'm going to have much experience.

6269
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,470
And you know how few of
them know how to fight.

6270
02:39:54,890 --> 02:39:58,640
That was the thing that always shocked
me when I would train with guys who had

6271
02:39:58,641 --> 02:40:01,210
been police officers and they
didn't know how to fight.

6272
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:02,240
I'm like this is insane.

6273
02:40:02,241 --> 02:40:02,960
Like you don't,

6274
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:04,610
you don't know any Jujitsu.

6275
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:05,750
You know nothing.

6276
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:07,550
Like if you get into
scrambled with somebody,

6277
02:40:07,551 --> 02:40:08,031
what do you do?

6278
02:40:08,031 --> 02:40:08,630
Do you know how to get it?

6279
02:40:08,630 --> 02:40:09,980
Like they don't know anything.

6280
02:40:09,981 --> 02:40:10,250
Yeah,

6281
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:11,083
they freak out.

6282
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:12,950
You could sign up for being a cop,

6283
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,070
you could be a cop and you

6284
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,800
have to just be in reasonable
shape and not completely insane.

6285
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:17,640
That's it.

6286
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:17,970
Yeah.

6287
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:20,070
And then they get in trouble
cause they get put in these lists.

6288
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:21,060
I'm not defend all cops.

6289
02:40:21,150 --> 02:40:22,410
Some cops are scumbags.

6290
02:40:22,411 --> 02:40:23,070
I get that.

6291
02:40:23,070 --> 02:40:25,980
But in general they're good people
and they get put in these situations.

6292
02:40:25,981 --> 02:40:26,820
Why do you think in general,

6293
02:40:26,821 --> 02:40:27,930
all people are good people.

6294
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:28,650
I agree,

6295
02:40:28,650 --> 02:40:31,140
but then you get put in these situation
where they have no experience.

6296
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,030
They don't know if this kid's
going to shoot her in us,

6297
02:40:33,060 --> 02:40:33,391
so like,

6298
02:40:33,391 --> 02:40:34,201
Dang my life,

6299
02:40:34,201 --> 02:40:35,040
his they shoot,

6300
02:40:35,041 --> 02:40:36,270
and then there's this big uproar.

6301
02:40:36,300 --> 02:40:38,790
It's similar to what we were
talking about earlier with referees.

6302
02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:40,380
Referee's make a mistake,

6303
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:43,500
you're making a mistake and a guy's
going to take some fucking punishment

6304
02:40:43,501 --> 02:40:44,334
because of that mistake.

6305
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:48,600
You're not designed to handle those
high pressure situations or you're not

6306
02:40:48,601 --> 02:40:52,200
qualified because you don't understand
martial arts or you're just not good at

6307
02:40:52,201 --> 02:40:52,651
your job,

6308
02:40:52,651 --> 02:40:53,371
but for whatever reason,

6309
02:40:53,371 --> 02:40:53,971
not focused,

6310
02:40:53,971 --> 02:40:54,661
whatever the fuck it is,

6311
02:40:54,661 --> 02:40:55,494
it makes you fuck up.

6312
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:57,120
But if you fuck up as a referee,

6313
02:40:57,121 --> 02:41:01,650
it's way worse than if Bruce Buffer
fucks up as an announcer at Bruce buffer

6314
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:03,520
mispronounces Brian Cave.

6315
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:05,610
You know,

6316
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:05,911
you're like,

6317
02:41:05,911 --> 02:41:06,744
Oh God,

6318
02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:07,620
my name.

6319
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:08,401
It's not that bad.

6320
02:41:08,401 --> 02:41:09,120
You know what I'm saying?

6321
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,350
If a cop fucks up,

6322
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:15,240
someone gets shot and dies or he gets
shot and dies or he sees someone gets shot

6323
02:41:15,241 --> 02:41:15,601
and died,

6324
02:41:15,601 --> 02:41:16,650
that he could've prevented.

6325
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:20,970
All that stuff is too much for people
to tough just to manage and to have that

6326
02:41:20,971 --> 02:41:21,930
go on day after day.

6327
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:24,780
What do you have to look forward to
when you're 25 they give you a watch.

6328
02:41:24,990 --> 02:41:26,130
What do you look at?

6329
02:41:26,131 --> 02:41:28,680
All the friends that you've had along
the way that a blown their brains out or

6330
02:41:28,681 --> 02:41:31,320
drank themselves to death
or we'll fill in the blank,

6331
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:32,970
done all kinds of crazy shit.

6332
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:33,410
My,

6333
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:33,910
my buddy,

6334
02:41:33,910 --> 02:41:38,580
my buddy was a swat team sergeant and he
said he knew he had to get out when he

6335
02:41:38,581 --> 02:41:43,350
was sitting down next to a body that they
had shot and the corners are doing all

6336
02:41:43,351 --> 02:41:45,900
their vests and he started eating
a sandwich and didn't occur to him.

6337
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:46,201
And he was like,

6338
02:41:46,201 --> 02:41:47,850
I'm sitting right next
to our body and I'm this,

6339
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:48,481
not this,

6340
02:41:48,481 --> 02:41:49,260
not phased I,

6341
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:51,510
I've been so I become
so numb and the view,

6342
02:41:51,511 --> 02:41:52,344
my job,

6343
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:53,131
the view,

6344
02:41:53,131 --> 02:41:53,731
and cops too,

6345
02:41:53,731 --> 02:41:54,360
it's not like,

6346
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:55,980
you know most Americans and they're like,

6347
02:41:55,981 --> 02:41:56,431
oh hell,

6348
02:41:56,431 --> 02:41:57,360
he had cops man.

6349
02:41:57,361 --> 02:41:57,900
Sweet.

6350
02:41:57,900 --> 02:41:59,040
Most than when they drive by.

6351
02:41:59,070 --> 02:41:59,761
Most people,

6352
02:41:59,761 --> 02:42:00,690
especially the ones I hang out with,

6353
02:42:00,691 --> 02:42:00,871
they're like,

6354
02:42:00,871 --> 02:42:01,021
no,

6355
02:42:01,021 --> 02:42:01,351
fuck,

6356
02:42:01,351 --> 02:42:01,621
come.

6357
02:42:01,621 --> 02:42:02,401
Americans don't want tough,

6358
02:42:02,401 --> 02:42:02,661
hard,

6359
02:42:02,661 --> 02:42:04,770
long Americans always have a problem.

6360
02:42:04,771 --> 02:42:08,850
And it was an interesting article that
I put up the other day that again,

6361
02:42:08,851 --> 02:42:09,684
I don't know if it's true,

6362
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:11,460
but it was that this private,

6363
02:42:11,461 --> 02:42:16,461
this town in Texas hired a private
security firm and crime dropped by 61% and

6364
02:42:18,301 --> 02:42:22,680
that with no financial incentive for
there to be crime because they were just

6365
02:42:22,681 --> 02:42:24,120
compensated for their job,

6366
02:42:24,121 --> 02:42:26,550
for what they do for the hours on the job,

6367
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:28,440
they found less crime.

6368
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:33,650
They also patrolled areas that had the
most crime instead of just arbitrarily

6369
02:42:34,771 --> 02:42:37,920
deciding where people went based on
whatever the fuck it was that they had

6370
02:42:37,921 --> 02:42:38,850
decided on before.

6371
02:42:39,030 --> 02:42:44,030
They targeted it like very tactically
and they cut back on crime by 61% and it

6372
02:42:44,581 --> 02:42:45,300
costs less money.

6373
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:45,740
I'm trying,

6374
02:42:45,740 --> 02:42:46,261
I'm confused.

6375
02:42:46,261 --> 02:42:48,000
So they hired a private security.

6376
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:48,821
They have a fire.

6377
02:42:48,821 --> 02:42:50,430
The cops in 2012 right?

6378
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:51,271
They fired the cops.

6379
02:42:51,271 --> 02:42:53,670
They said this police force is retarded.

6380
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:55,740
This government police force sucks.

6381
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:56,610
We're going to hire,

6382
02:42:56,610 --> 02:42:57,930
we're going to hire
our own security force.

6383
02:42:57,931 --> 02:42:58,830
We're going to vote to do this.

6384
02:42:58,950 --> 02:43:00,060
So they decided to do this.

6385
02:43:00,061 --> 02:43:02,220
They hired a security firm to become cops.

6386
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:05,160
And because these guys don't have the
incentive to write tickets because they're

6387
02:43:05,161 --> 02:43:05,840
not getting,

6388
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:07,080
it actually costs less.

6389
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:08,310
It costs them less.

6390
02:43:08,311 --> 02:43:09,960
It cost them less and there's less crime.

6391
02:43:10,110 --> 02:43:11,680
They're not getting as
much revenue from it,

6392
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:13,960
but they're also not arresting
people for fucking nothing.

6393
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:14,441
So the P,

6394
02:43:14,441 --> 02:43:16,720
it's gonna adjust the attitude of
the people that live in the city.

6395
02:43:16,930 --> 02:43:19,290
They're not going to be upset at cops
all the time because they're not thinking

6396
02:43:19,310 --> 02:43:21,970
to think that cops had just trying to
pull people aside because they have,

6397
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:22,600
you know,

6398
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:24,070
they have criteria they have to meet,

6399
02:43:24,071 --> 02:43:25,150
they have quotas.

6400
02:43:25,151 --> 02:43:25,870
They have to make,

6401
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:27,610
which is they did the
same thing with that.

6402
02:43:27,611 --> 02:43:29,090
They did the same thing with road signs.

6403
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:29,831
Jamie,

6404
02:43:29,831 --> 02:43:31,450
see if you could pull that
article up cause it's on my,

6405
02:43:31,451 --> 02:43:32,430
it's on my Twitter feed is,

6406
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:33,580
it's pretty fucking interesting.

6407
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:33,700
Yeah.

6408
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:35,170
There was an intersection in Holland.

6409
02:43:35,171 --> 02:43:35,711
It's really,

6410
02:43:35,711 --> 02:43:37,570
really busy and the guy took all the,

6411
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:41,610
all the road signs out and cause there
were a lot of accidents said watch this.

6412
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:44,860
I'm going to take all the all road signs
out and people figured it out on their

6413
02:43:44,861 --> 02:43:46,750
own and he does this
experiment where he walks,

6414
02:43:46,751 --> 02:43:50,290
he puts his hands behind his back
and walks backward into the busiest

6415
02:43:50,291 --> 02:43:54,490
intersection and of course never gets
hit because people figure out how to

6416
02:43:54,491 --> 02:43:57,070
navigate that crazy space on their own.

6417
02:43:57,100 --> 02:43:57,731
For sure.

6418
02:43:57,731 --> 02:43:59,620
That guy's going to get hit for sure.

6419
02:44:01,590 --> 02:44:02,500
I was there,

6420
02:44:02,910 --> 02:44:05,310
said the best story team,

6421
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:09,250
61% seal security solutions.

6422
02:44:09,251 --> 02:44:11,890
They hired a bunch of fucking people
that were former seals and shit.

6423
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:12,281
Oh well.

6424
02:44:12,281 --> 02:44:13,170
And they gave him a job.

6425
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,710
Shit of course it makes sense.

6426
02:44:14,711 --> 02:44:16,560
It's fucking guys have experience.

6427
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:18,220
Look at that high stress situation.

6428
02:44:18,221 --> 02:44:22,090
Reduce crime by 61% in just 20 months,

6429
02:44:22,570 --> 02:44:22,841
you know,

6430
02:44:22,841 --> 02:44:26,880
and also then you don't get to deal with
the militarization of the fucking legit

6431
02:44:26,881 --> 02:44:27,260
shit.

6432
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:27,520
Yeah.

6433
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,270
This is legit.

6434
02:44:28,270 --> 02:44:30,180
Just written up by the operation.

6435
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:30,700
The seals,

6436
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:31,030
I dunno.

6437
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:32,620
I'm just reading what I'm reading online.

6438
02:44:32,621 --> 02:44:34,960
I've done very little actual
research out in the field.

6439
02:44:34,990 --> 02:44:38,680
I didn't take any plane trips
down there when it on the ground.

6440
02:44:38,890 --> 02:44:42,640
When you prioritize and gravitize an
area that the solution goes when we

6441
02:44:42,641 --> 02:44:43,510
privatized and area,

6442
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:46,960
that tends to be policed better a lot
of times then if the government wants,

6443
02:44:46,961 --> 02:44:49,510
but now this is where fucking
some Alex Jones shit comes up.

6444
02:44:49,690 --> 02:44:50,471
This is what you want,

6445
02:44:50,471 --> 02:44:51,040
America,

6446
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:52,930
you want former military garden.

6447
02:44:52,931 --> 02:44:55,780
Your straights holding a
gun to your children's head.

6448
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:56,770
And who do you think they,

6449
02:44:57,380 --> 02:44:59,860
who do they listen to when
the shit hits the fan?

6450
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:00,820
Fema.

6451
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:01,211
Fema.

6452
02:45:01,211 --> 02:45:02,044
God dammit.

6453
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:04,750
I got plastic coffins
out there in the field.

6454
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:05,980
I've seen it with my own eyes.

6455
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:07,600
You this.

6456
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:08,770
We have a guy with his babies.

6457
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,750
We support our troops by
hiring many employees.

6458
02:45:10,751 --> 02:45:11,680
I served our country.

6459
02:45:11,710 --> 02:45:11,891
Dude,

6460
02:45:11,891 --> 02:45:13,210
I'm not mad at this at all.

6461
02:45:13,211 --> 02:45:13,750
Sound bad.

6462
02:45:13,750 --> 02:45:13,931
It's,

6463
02:45:13,931 --> 02:45:14,141
look,

6464
02:45:14,141 --> 02:45:14,920
if it works,

6465
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:18,280
I think that there's a lot of things
that they do better when you take out

6466
02:45:18,281 --> 02:45:19,114
bureaucracy,

6467
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:20,200
when you privatize that,

6468
02:45:20,380 --> 02:45:24,090
when you offer them an incentive to be
successful and when they have the support

6469
02:45:24,091 --> 02:45:25,240
of the community because it can,

6470
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:26,590
community actually likes them.

6471
02:45:26,650 --> 02:45:26,771
Yeah,

6472
02:45:26,771 --> 02:45:27,604
for sure.

6473
02:45:27,730 --> 02:45:28,563
For sure.

6474
02:45:28,790 --> 02:45:30,020
They live in the community too.

6475
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:30,970
Those are fucking sloppy.

6476
02:45:30,990 --> 02:45:31,330
Overweight,

6477
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:32,420
out of shape curves for sure.

6478
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,700
Three out of shape.

6479
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:34,510
Yoked up.

6480
02:45:34,510 --> 02:45:35,150
Roy It up,

6481
02:45:35,150 --> 02:45:35,510
dude.

6482
02:45:35,510 --> 02:45:36,343
Yeah,

6483
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:37,091
I want three.

6484
02:45:37,091 --> 02:45:38,800
Ronnie Coleman's just Jack.

6485
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:40,700
Jack doing shit.

6486
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:41,530
Yeah.

6487
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:43,240
I would go like more of a thinner,

6488
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:45,910
but Ian Freeman in the
machine with you man.

6489
02:45:45,911 --> 02:45:46,121
Damn,

6490
02:45:46,121 --> 02:45:46,451
I like that.

6491
02:45:46,451 --> 02:45:47,141
They have dogs.

6492
02:45:47,141 --> 02:45:48,400
I like those big canines.

6493
02:45:48,401 --> 02:45:48,641
They can,

6494
02:45:48,641 --> 02:45:49,720
they can smell out anything.

6495
02:45:49,721 --> 02:45:49,910
Yeah,

6496
02:45:49,910 --> 02:45:50,520
it's a good idea.

6497
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,121
Use Canine.

6498
02:45:51,121 --> 02:45:52,270
You look at the a bomb detection,

6499
02:45:52,271 --> 02:45:52,660
drug,

6500
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:53,440
drug detection.

6501
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:54,201
Look points dropped.

6502
02:45:54,201 --> 02:45:54,971
The drug detection.

6503
02:45:54,971 --> 02:45:55,300
All right,

6504
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:56,133
let's let that slide.

6505
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:57,273
But the shine.

6506
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:58,601
But I think that,

6507
02:45:58,601 --> 02:45:58,960
uh,

6508
02:45:58,960 --> 02:45:59,793
look,

6509
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:03,850
I think there's a lot of things that
can be taken care of better by private,

6510
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:04,900
by the private sector.

6511
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:05,140
Look,

6512
02:46:05,140 --> 02:46:07,300
that's what you see with education.

6513
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:07,780
Yup.

6514
02:46:07,780 --> 02:46:08,081
I mean,

6515
02:46:08,081 --> 02:46:09,230
you get a way better public,

6516
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:09,661
private,

6517
02:46:09,661 --> 02:46:11,180
every education in most schools,

6518
02:46:11,430 --> 02:46:11,830
uh,

6519
02:46:11,830 --> 02:46:12,200
you know,

6520
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:13,640
will you deal with um,

6521
02:46:13,730 --> 02:46:15,770
really high level private schools?

6522
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:18,860
They're going to have a better
education than the best public schools.

6523
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:20,030
That's just not an insurance incentive.

6524
02:46:20,031 --> 02:46:20,631
This man,

6525
02:46:20,631 --> 02:46:22,960
it's about incentives and the
teachers are more qualified,

6526
02:46:22,970 --> 02:46:23,541
the private schools,

6527
02:46:23,541 --> 02:46:23,691
right.

6528
02:46:23,691 --> 02:46:24,900
And a lot of day and paid more.

6529
02:46:24,901 --> 02:46:27,020
It's a lot of times there's some
really good public schools out there,

6530
02:46:27,021 --> 02:46:27,800
don't get me wrong,

6531
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:30,050
but if you had to look
at them all per capita,

6532
02:46:30,170 --> 02:46:32,240
like what's going to be
the most formal education?

6533
02:46:32,241 --> 02:46:34,430
What's going to be like the
most comprehensive education?

6534
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:37,010
There's a lot of people that have a lot
of money to take their kids to private

6535
02:46:37,011 --> 02:46:39,470
schools because they think that their
kids are going to get a better education.

6536
02:46:39,471 --> 02:46:40,251
It's college too.

6537
02:46:40,251 --> 02:46:41,990
You're looking at private universities,

6538
02:46:41,991 --> 02:46:42,340
man,

6539
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:43,173
it was the beast.

6540
02:46:43,250 --> 02:46:43,461
I mean,

6541
02:46:43,461 --> 02:46:46,640
the good thing about universities is
that people can get scholarships if they

6542
02:46:46,641 --> 02:46:47,210
prove,

6543
02:46:47,210 --> 02:46:47,451
you know,

6544
02:46:47,451 --> 02:46:49,100
academically that they're superior,

6545
02:46:49,101 --> 02:46:51,710
that they're excellent
athletically or athletically.

6546
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:52,580
Those are good things too.

6547
02:46:52,581 --> 02:46:53,570
They get an opportunity,

6548
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:54,980
but you know,

6549
02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:56,900
privatizing shit though.

6550
02:46:56,901 --> 02:47:00,470
That's the thing that I have that
guy on the podcast fuck is his name,

6551
02:47:00,770 --> 02:47:01,970
Peter,

6552
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,040
the fucking Peter Schiff,

6553
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:04,911
very,

6554
02:47:04,911 --> 02:47:05,151
you know,

6555
02:47:05,151 --> 02:47:05,990
financial genius.

6556
02:47:05,991 --> 02:47:07,540
And he was saying one of the
big problems with colleges,

6557
02:47:07,550 --> 02:47:10,280
the reason why it costs so much is
because it's all subsidized by the

6558
02:47:10,281 --> 02:47:11,000
government.

6559
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,080
And because it's subsidized,

6560
02:47:12,081 --> 02:47:15,180
he's fucking loans and these ridiculous
interest rates and nobody gets roped

6561
02:47:15,181 --> 02:47:17,510
into these incredible payment
that they get stuck with.

6562
02:47:17,511 --> 02:47:20,420
You get saddled up in debt before
you even get out of school.

6563
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,241
You get at school,

6564
02:47:21,241 --> 02:47:22,400
you already oh fuck.

6565
02:47:22,401 --> 02:47:23,090
Tons of money.

6566
02:47:23,090 --> 02:47:24,080
You also have to have,

6567
02:47:24,081 --> 02:47:27,260
the good thing about privatization
is you can innovate according to your

6568
02:47:27,290 --> 02:47:28,280
circumstances.

6569
02:47:28,530 --> 02:47:30,380
A lot of times when you have top down,

6570
02:47:30,410 --> 02:47:33,830
you know a bureaucracy telling
you what to do regardless,

6571
02:47:33,831 --> 02:47:34,670
it's hard to innovate.

6572
02:47:34,670 --> 02:47:37,640
It's hard to move if you see with huge
corporations versus smaller companies,

6573
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:39,470
you've got to be able to
change with the times.

6574
02:47:39,530 --> 02:47:40,460
And where I'm torn though,

6575
02:47:40,461 --> 02:47:40,701
man,

6576
02:47:40,701 --> 02:47:43,640
I think every kid
deserves a private style.

6577
02:47:43,641 --> 02:47:44,330
Education.

6578
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:45,690
Every deserves it.

6579
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:46,850
I know it doesn't sucks,

6580
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:48,440
but I think that's where the problem is.

6581
02:47:48,441 --> 02:47:51,710
I think every kid deserves
the best possible education,

6582
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:54,020
but we said like the best
way to make America great.

6583
02:47:54,021 --> 02:47:54,471
Everyone's like,

6584
02:47:54,471 --> 02:47:55,430
let's make America great.

6585
02:47:55,431 --> 02:47:58,430
What's guard our borders and keep our
criminals now this is the best way.

6586
02:47:58,610 --> 02:47:59,840
Make less losers,

6587
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:00,793
less loser.

6588
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:05,180
Put Shit tons of money on community
programs and education and counseling and

6589
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:07,430
try to help people that
are in bad situations.

6590
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:08,500
People that got a Shitty,

6591
02:48:08,501 --> 02:48:08,881
you know,

6592
02:48:08,881 --> 02:48:09,950
that's been societies.

6593
02:48:09,951 --> 02:48:10,161
You know,

6594
02:48:10,161 --> 02:48:12,330
it's been society's problem
from day wise always.

6595
02:48:12,450 --> 02:48:13,820
What do you do with the people that,

6596
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:16,550
that that not losers as
his and you're a loser,

6597
02:48:16,551 --> 02:48:19,130
but the losers in society that
people don't get a piece of the pie.

6598
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:20,490
That's always been the issue.

6599
02:48:20,510 --> 02:48:21,830
There's no issue at the Middle East.

6600
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:24,500
We're never going to solve their
biggest issue with the Middle East.

6601
02:48:24,501 --> 02:48:27,110
You've got a group of people
who have no young men,

6602
02:48:27,111 --> 02:48:27,531
angry.

6603
02:48:27,531 --> 02:48:29,900
Young men know where to place
their energy and you want it.

6604
02:48:29,901 --> 02:48:32,000
You want to go through
the list of wipe fine.

6605
02:48:32,001 --> 02:48:32,421
It's just,

6606
02:48:32,421 --> 02:48:35,060
it's essentially governments
that are not representative,

6607
02:48:35,061 --> 02:48:35,571
et Cetera,

6608
02:48:35,571 --> 02:48:35,931
et Cetera,

6609
02:48:35,931 --> 02:48:36,590
et cetera.

6610
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:37,850
It's a major problem.

6611
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:39,020
What do you do about it?

6612
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:40,040
What do you do about it?

6613
02:48:40,041 --> 02:48:41,210
I think what you do about it,

6614
02:48:41,211 --> 02:48:41,571
if I,

6615
02:48:41,571 --> 02:48:44,180
if I'm obviously not a
fucking financial planner,

6616
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:45,500
but if I was,

6617
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:49,430
if I had a look at the country like
far as allocation of resources with tax

6618
02:48:49,431 --> 02:48:50,211
dollars and you know,

6619
02:48:50,211 --> 02:48:51,080
how much money do we have?

6620
02:48:51,081 --> 02:48:51,914
What do we spend it on?

6621
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:53,660
I would say let's triple,

6622
02:48:53,661 --> 02:48:58,220
quadruple even more the amount of money
that goes into education and anybody

6623
02:48:58,221 --> 02:48:58,941
wants to go to college,

6624
02:48:58,941 --> 02:48:59,870
she'd be able to go to college.

6625
02:49:00,020 --> 02:49:02,180
The idea that you get go to
go to college and get saddled,

6626
02:49:02,181 --> 02:49:04,370
and it sounds contradictory
from what I said earlier,

6627
02:49:04,371 --> 02:49:05,480
because the best schools,

6628
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:07,230
a lot of them are private today,

6629
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:08,393
but still,

6630
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:12,870
I still think that the public education
should be so much better than it is now

6631
02:49:12,900 --> 02:49:15,060
and being a teacher should
be worth so much more.

6632
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:16,051
It should be like a,

6633
02:49:16,051 --> 02:49:19,740
a very prestigious position that's
difficult to get initiated with a lot of

6634
02:49:19,741 --> 02:49:19,981
money.

6635
02:49:19,981 --> 02:49:21,600
You may not need me to my teacher.

6636
02:49:21,601 --> 02:49:22,620
What about a really good one?

6637
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:25,980
What about a really good teacher
teaches you about physiology,

6638
02:49:26,070 --> 02:49:27,090
about explosive,

6639
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:30,270
fast twitch muscle fibers that shows
you how to get better at the one that

6640
02:49:30,271 --> 02:49:31,890
teaches you like kickball and fuck.

6641
02:49:31,930 --> 02:49:33,090
Why do we have to have that though?

6642
02:49:33,091 --> 02:49:33,960
Why can't awesome,

6643
02:49:33,961 --> 02:49:37,110
but why can't you have that kind of shit
where you have a little kickball game

6644
02:49:37,111 --> 02:49:37,620
with kids,

6645
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:40,110
but you also explained to them this
is what's going on when you're getting

6646
02:49:40,111 --> 02:49:40,531
tired,

6647
02:49:40,531 --> 02:49:41,160
this is what's going.

6648
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:44,550
This is the dog you eat has a different
effect on the way your body performs.

6649
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:46,740
A lot of it doesn't take money,

6650
02:49:46,890 --> 02:49:49,530
but sometimes it takes
a change in approach.

6651
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:52,040
Give him some fucking money they've given.

6652
02:49:52,250 --> 02:49:52,741
She's out there.

6653
02:49:52,741 --> 02:49:55,360
They get paid 50 cents an hour
has to be a standard reality.

6654
02:49:56,060 --> 02:49:58,770
Reality is happiest standard.

6655
02:49:58,790 --> 02:50:00,670
You can't understand
every dumb ass school.

6656
02:50:00,690 --> 02:50:01,501
A private school.

6657
02:50:01,501 --> 02:50:02,940
It's not easy to be a doctor,

6658
02:50:02,970 --> 02:50:03,540
right?

6659
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:04,620
It's fucking really hard.

6660
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:05,191
It's really hard.

6661
02:50:05,191 --> 02:50:05,701
You got to go to school.

6662
02:50:05,701 --> 02:50:06,534
A lot of schooling,

6663
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:07,950
a lot of fucking education,

6664
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:08,840
a lot of education.

6665
02:50:08,850 --> 02:50:09,720
You gotta it's difficult.

6666
02:50:09,721 --> 02:50:10,890
Most people fall out.

6667
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:11,461
They don't,

6668
02:50:11,461 --> 02:50:12,570
they don't hack through it.

6669
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:14,310
Big Committee like that
to be your teacher,

6670
02:50:14,550 --> 02:50:15,180
it really should.

6671
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:15,470
Finland,

6672
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:16,170
Finland,

6673
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:17,550
Finland has probably the most,

6674
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:18,980
but like according to the lot of ratings,

6675
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:20,130
the best school system,

6676
02:50:20,490 --> 02:50:21,323
they don't test.

6677
02:50:21,330 --> 02:50:21,481
They,

6678
02:50:21,481 --> 02:50:22,920
I think they have one test here.

6679
02:50:23,250 --> 02:50:28,250
The teachers are responsible to a large
degree in making their own curriculum.

6680
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:30,060
They don't have this core curriculum.

6681
02:50:30,061 --> 02:50:31,590
Everybody has to learn the same thing.

6682
02:50:31,591 --> 02:50:32,680
But I have some good teachers,

6683
02:50:32,681 --> 02:50:32,880
man.

6684
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:33,171
And,

6685
02:50:33,171 --> 02:50:33,571
and they,

6686
02:50:33,571 --> 02:50:34,021
and Matt,

6687
02:50:34,021 --> 02:50:34,531
more importantly,

6688
02:50:34,531 --> 02:50:37,680
they pay their teachers and their teachers
have a great deal of esteem in the

6689
02:50:37,681 --> 02:50:38,161
society.

6690
02:50:38,161 --> 02:50:41,880
And Finland school system is always
outperforming almost every other country.

6691
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:45,060
And when I had the guy on who wrote
this thing called Finnish lessons,

6692
02:50:45,061 --> 02:50:45,570
a book,

6693
02:50:45,570 --> 02:50:46,320
he said,

6694
02:50:46,320 --> 02:50:50,370
I don't even like talking about rankings
because that's already the wrong way to

6695
02:50:50,371 --> 02:50:50,731
look at it.

6696
02:50:50,731 --> 02:50:53,340
And the problem with testing is
that that's what happens is you,

6697
02:50:53,341 --> 02:50:55,380
instead of focusing on understanding,

6698
02:50:55,710 --> 02:50:56,543
and the other really,

6699
02:50:56,670 --> 02:50:57,321
really interesting thing,

6700
02:50:57,321 --> 02:50:57,691
as he said,

6701
02:50:57,691 --> 02:51:01,410
we've focused on teaching people
how to solve problems as a group.

6702
02:51:01,530 --> 02:51:02,341
Because if you think about it,

6703
02:51:02,341 --> 02:51:05,580
you do the a lot of that when you work
in a corporate function test at some

6704
02:51:05,581 --> 02:51:06,300
point.

6705
02:51:06,300 --> 02:51:07,740
Because if the teachers for,

6706
02:51:07,800 --> 02:51:09,390
let's say they're teaching for a year,

6707
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:09,930
it's like,

6708
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:11,430
well let's see if these
kids learned anything.

6709
02:51:11,650 --> 02:51:12,660
Learning to anything.

6710
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:13,553
You have to test it.

6711
02:51:13,580 --> 02:51:14,280
You learn,

6712
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:17,310
well actually they do because they have
to rely on each other to solve problems

6713
02:51:17,311 --> 02:51:20,580
and we'll give them a problem and then
they'll kind of let them solve that

6714
02:51:20,581 --> 02:51:24,390
problem and they try to
mimic as closely as they can.

6715
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:28,560
The real life situations and problems
that they're going to come across when

6716
02:51:28,561 --> 02:51:28,981
they are.

6717
02:51:28,981 --> 02:51:29,521
For example,

6718
02:51:29,521 --> 02:51:31,550
working for a company
like Toyota or no care,

6719
02:51:31,810 --> 02:51:32,641
like just that.

6720
02:51:32,641 --> 02:51:33,241
I don't like that,

6721
02:51:33,241 --> 02:51:34,500
that new age teaching men.

6722
02:51:34,700 --> 02:51:35,730
Why it's not new age,

6723
02:51:35,731 --> 02:51:36,600
it's more practically,

6724
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:37,770
I think it's more practical.

6725
02:51:37,771 --> 02:51:39,120
I think you still have to have history.

6726
02:51:39,121 --> 02:51:42,420
They have to learn all that they do and
they do have testing but not nearly as

6727
02:51:42,421 --> 02:51:42,930
much.

6728
02:51:42,930 --> 02:51:43,021
Oh,

6729
02:51:43,021 --> 02:51:43,854
so they do have some,

6730
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:44,340
they have they,

6731
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:45,450
I think they have two tests.

6732
02:51:45,450 --> 02:51:47,790
He said no testing for
the most part they don't.

6733
02:51:47,791 --> 02:51:49,860
But they had the ask Brian
Cowen the way he talks.

6734
02:51:50,050 --> 02:51:50,600
Yeah,

6735
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:51,420
no,

6736
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:52,650
literally no test.

6737
02:51:52,651 --> 02:51:53,600
And he said they ended up tents,

6738
02:51:53,640 --> 02:51:54,660
just afraid of shit.

6739
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:56,040
I said they have one test a year,

6740
02:51:56,041 --> 02:51:56,910
maybe two tests here.

6741
02:51:56,970 --> 02:51:57,091
Well,

6742
02:51:57,091 --> 02:51:59,790
there's a lot of people that do
think that you shouldn't have that.

6743
02:51:59,791 --> 02:52:04,050
That shouldn't be your incentive to get
a high score to absorb knowledge and

6744
02:52:04,051 --> 02:52:05,280
then it becomes confusing.

6745
02:52:05,290 --> 02:52:05,950
People say,

6746
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:06,131
well,

6747
02:52:06,131 --> 02:52:07,780
the becomes a competitive thing like a,

6748
02:52:07,781 --> 02:52:11,260
my daughter got a 98 and my
daughter got a 100 sorry.

6749
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:13,240
I bet you forgot your daughter's man.

6750
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:15,220
You need competition like sports too.

6751
02:52:15,221 --> 02:52:15,670
It's like,

6752
02:52:15,670 --> 02:52:15,911
you know,

6753
02:52:15,911 --> 02:52:17,140
you can't play tag anymore.

6754
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:18,300
Can't play dodge ball anymore.

6755
02:52:18,310 --> 02:52:19,990
They don't want losers in certain games.

6756
02:52:19,991 --> 02:52:22,060
My daughter played
softball and no one lost.

6757
02:52:22,061 --> 02:52:22,871
That's where I'm like,

6758
02:52:22,871 --> 02:52:23,630
I watched people.

6759
02:52:23,630 --> 02:52:24,310
No noise man.

6760
02:52:24,310 --> 02:52:24,551
How come?

6761
02:52:24,551 --> 02:52:27,540
No one lost but there were four and
they're barely hitting the ball.

6762
02:52:28,130 --> 02:52:29,380
I'm the dad keeping score.

6763
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:29,940
No one.

6764
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:30,460
Nothing.

6765
02:52:30,460 --> 02:52:32,200
That's real life to nothing,

6766
02:52:32,940 --> 02:52:33,370
Janine.

6767
02:52:33,370 --> 02:52:34,150
You're out.

6768
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:34,721
Get the fuck.

6769
02:52:34,721 --> 02:52:35,680
You only get three swings.

6770
02:52:35,681 --> 02:52:37,260
Ain't home learned that losing's.

6771
02:52:37,270 --> 02:52:37,661
Okay,

6772
02:52:37,661 --> 02:52:38,890
because that's how you try harder.

6773
02:52:38,891 --> 02:52:41,440
Because it feels bad to lose like
no one wants their kid to feel bad.

6774
02:52:41,890 --> 02:52:43,110
Everybody won except teared.

6775
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:44,320
You're preparing them for life.

6776
02:52:44,350 --> 02:52:45,700
That's that Calabasas Shit,

6777
02:52:45,701 --> 02:52:45,970
man.

6778
02:52:45,970 --> 02:52:47,020
It's not Calabasas.

6779
02:52:47,890 --> 02:52:49,300
Calabasas going on out here,

6780
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:50,740
going out across the country.

6781
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:51,040
Fox,

6782
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:51,731
the little kids,

6783
02:52:51,731 --> 02:52:53,560
the way to shoot live underwater Colorado.

6784
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:56,440
You struck out and you struck
out and got made fun of.

6785
02:52:56,470 --> 02:52:57,560
What's it Gallagher Bassett's.

6786
02:52:57,570 --> 02:52:58,210
I'll bet.

6787
02:52:58,210 --> 02:53:00,100
I bet there's places today in Aurora,

6788
02:53:00,101 --> 02:53:02,980
Colorado and all over the country
that employ these ridiculous ideas.

6789
02:53:02,981 --> 02:53:04,060
I don't think it's local.

6790
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:05,230
I they don't know.

6791
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:06,400
My life is basically,

6792
02:53:06,401 --> 02:53:07,480
I think life is,

6793
02:53:07,481 --> 02:53:08,350
if you look at your life,

6794
02:53:08,351 --> 02:53:10,530
life is working really hard to get to,

6795
02:53:10,580 --> 02:53:13,630
to accomplish something and
losing to a degree anyway.

6796
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:15,320
Yeah.

6797
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:19,000
Learning how to navigate those failures
are what motivate you to never feel that

6798
02:53:19,001 --> 02:53:20,800
shitty feeling so it
gets you off your ass.

6799
02:53:20,830 --> 02:53:21,280
Yes.

6800
02:53:21,280 --> 02:53:24,910
That's why people who are born
rich or they win the lottery early,

6801
02:53:24,940 --> 02:53:25,630
they're fucked.

6802
02:53:25,630 --> 02:53:26,980
That's why we hate those people.

6803
02:53:26,981 --> 02:53:28,780
The motivation just slides away.

6804
02:53:28,790 --> 02:53:29,330
You know?

6805
02:53:29,330 --> 02:53:30,820
There's very little motivation.

6806
02:53:30,821 --> 02:53:31,810
If you're already wealthy.

6807
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:36,310
It's hard for me to relate to a dude who
just grew up super rich and he's never

6808
02:53:36,311 --> 02:53:37,150
had any struggles.

6809
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:39,460
It's hard to sit down and
have dinner with that dude.

6810
02:53:39,550 --> 02:53:41,020
I feel bad for me too.

6811
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:42,093
I feel too,

6812
02:53:42,170 --> 02:53:43,360
because they have no idea.

6813
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:44,330
Especially you don't,

6814
02:53:44,331 --> 02:53:46,690
you know any friends that are rich that
were raised by like their nanny and

6815
02:53:46,691 --> 02:53:47,140
shit?

6816
02:53:47,140 --> 02:53:47,441
Oh yeah.

6817
02:53:47,441 --> 02:53:50,790
With a mom and dad are both working 20
hours a day and no one's ever home and

6818
02:53:50,791 --> 02:53:51,870
they are fucking weirded out.

6819
02:53:51,871 --> 02:53:52,750
A lost man.

6820
02:53:53,750 --> 02:53:54,310
Oh yeah.

6821
02:53:54,310 --> 02:53:55,280
Those rich guys who,

6822
02:53:55,281 --> 02:53:55,441
who,

6823
02:53:55,441 --> 02:53:59,080
who are surrounded by yes men and they
come up like wearing a shitty holiday

6824
02:53:59,081 --> 02:54:01,930
sweat and you're like nice fucking
sweater and it ruins his night.

6825
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:02,400
You know,

6826
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,540
you'd like no one ever
hangs out with guys.

6827
02:54:05,670 --> 02:54:06,130
Must've.

6828
02:54:06,130 --> 02:54:06,400
Yeah.

6829
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:07,480
No one ever busted bog.

6830
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,000
True sweetening.

6831
02:54:09,050 --> 02:54:09,400
Sweet.

6832
02:54:09,400 --> 02:54:10,240
You hear cut.

6833
02:54:10,570 --> 02:54:11,410
That sucks.

6834
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:13,553
Or night.

6835
02:54:14,480 --> 02:54:15,400
We were playing a cold,

6836
02:54:15,401 --> 02:54:19,720
the silly game like running charades
like a group of us and I made fun of the

6837
02:54:19,721 --> 02:54:21,040
guy's boyfriend,

6838
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:22,600
the girl's boyfriend.

6839
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:24,370
We said that's not a word.

6840
02:54:24,371 --> 02:54:27,700
He had some stupid movie and he dropped.

6841
02:54:28,060 --> 02:54:33,030
He dropped the hat and threw his hands
in the air and went off in the balcony.

6842
02:54:33,050 --> 02:54:33,431
We were like,

6843
02:54:33,431 --> 02:54:33,810
what?

6844
02:54:33,810 --> 02:54:36,400
This salt that has grown from,

6845
02:54:36,401 --> 02:54:37,600
cause he just gets really sensitive.

6846
02:54:37,990 --> 02:54:38,823
Wow.

6847
02:54:40,510 --> 02:54:41,291
And a mouth.

6848
02:54:41,291 --> 02:54:41,960
That's what happens.

6849
02:54:41,960 --> 02:54:43,390
We don't keep score and shit.

6850
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:47,770
I was on a Sitcom once and this guy
was adlibbing to something as an actor.

6851
02:54:47,771 --> 02:54:51,730
It was a couple comics and an actor and
the actor tried to ad Lib something and

6852
02:54:51,731 --> 02:54:55,510
it wasn't funny at all
and we stone faced it.

6853
02:54:55,511 --> 02:54:56,344
We were like,

6854
02:54:56,410 --> 02:54:57,243
what?

6855
02:54:57,280 --> 02:54:59,290
Like he just wanted to
try something different.

6856
02:54:59,291 --> 02:54:59,940
How about I bought it.

6857
02:54:59,940 --> 02:55:00,970
I say this and that,

6858
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:01,841
but it was really,

6859
02:55:01,841 --> 02:55:04,010
he was not a bright guy and a,

6860
02:55:04,011 --> 02:55:06,250
I remember we just looked at
each other and we're like that.

6861
02:55:06,470 --> 02:55:07,040
No,

6862
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:07,940
I don't think that works.

6863
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:11,310
He throws the fucking script up
in the air going well with Dan.

6864
02:55:11,770 --> 02:55:12,680
Always said is,

6865
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:13,603
I don't think that works.

6866
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:14,690
You tell that to a comic.

6867
02:55:14,691 --> 02:55:15,230
They go,

6868
02:55:15,230 --> 02:55:15,660
yeah,

6869
02:55:15,660 --> 02:55:16,040
suck.

6870
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:17,120
Something fucked up about it.

6871
02:55:17,121 --> 02:55:17,391
Right.

6872
02:55:17,391 --> 02:55:18,021
Can you tell?

6873
02:55:18,021 --> 02:55:18,980
It's even a lot of funny.

6874
02:55:18,980 --> 02:55:22,070
People just have good senses of humor
and we started laughing so hard.

6875
02:55:22,071 --> 02:55:23,840
Brennan pitched an idea for
this thing we're gonna do.

6876
02:55:23,841 --> 02:55:24,530
And I was like,

6877
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:25,150
oh,

6878
02:55:25,150 --> 02:55:25,983
and

6879
02:55:27,310 --> 02:55:28,310
then I go,

6880
02:55:28,311 --> 02:55:29,210
let's get out of here.

6881
02:55:29,211 --> 02:55:29,971
Is that you're having to go?

6882
02:55:29,971 --> 02:55:30,320
That's,

6883
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:31,400
I couldn't stop laughing.

6884
02:55:31,430 --> 02:55:31,761
I was like,

6885
02:55:31,761 --> 02:55:32,990
that's not funny.

6886
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:34,970
I can't stop.

6887
02:55:34,970 --> 02:55:37,130
Like we do all that,

6888
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:38,450
but we bust each other's balls.

6889
02:55:38,451 --> 02:55:38,841
Do you only thing,

6890
02:55:38,841 --> 02:55:40,590
I won't stand for it if you
guys made fun of my talk.

6891
02:55:40,591 --> 02:55:40,861
Well no,

6892
02:55:40,861 --> 02:55:43,170
that's the only thing I put my foot down.

6893
02:55:43,171 --> 02:55:44,004
It's not your life.

6894
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:44,750
Do you ever,

6895
02:55:44,750 --> 02:55:47,300
have you ever gone back and read your
notebooks from like your first years of

6896
02:55:47,301 --> 02:55:48,134
comedy?

6897
02:55:48,170 --> 02:55:49,220
Sure have dude.

6898
02:55:49,221 --> 02:55:51,140
I have a notebook from
when I was driving limos.

6899
02:55:51,320 --> 02:55:52,330
I found it the other day.

6900
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:53,000
It's amazing.

6901
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:53,800
It's been awesome.

6902
02:55:53,800 --> 02:55:55,250
It's unbelievably bad.

6903
02:55:55,251 --> 02:55:56,060
I should have quit.

6904
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:56,811
I bet it's awesome.

6905
02:55:56,811 --> 02:55:58,190
I can't believe I kept going.

6906
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:03,110
I should have fucking retired so bad,

6907
02:56:03,111 --> 02:56:06,650
like my ideas and to this
day like sometimes I'll write
ideas that are dog shit,

6908
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:09,080
but I write the ideas that
are dog should hoping like,

6909
02:56:09,081 --> 02:56:09,291
man,

6910
02:56:09,291 --> 02:56:10,430
it's some fucking something.

6911
02:56:11,170 --> 02:56:14,690
Write down like a half a concept and then
I'll sit down and start working on it.

6912
02:56:14,691 --> 02:56:15,200
Yeah.

6913
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:16,400
So it might've been that,

6914
02:56:16,401 --> 02:56:18,200
but more likely I was just a 21 year old,

6915
02:56:18,201 --> 02:56:19,100
retired with a pen.

6916
02:56:21,010 --> 02:56:23,330
I want to tell you want to tell
story but I'll make me sound bad.

6917
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:24,440
Too late.

6918
02:56:24,440 --> 02:56:25,310
Ah dammit.

6919
02:56:25,730 --> 02:56:25,871
Right.

6920
02:56:25,871 --> 02:56:26,704
I'm just going to tell it.

6921
02:56:26,910 --> 02:56:28,400
Don't judge me two minutes ago,

6922
02:56:28,430 --> 02:56:29,660
this better not be someone else's.

6923
02:56:31,050 --> 02:56:33,140
I was in Jamaica and I don't do drugs.

6924
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:34,950
I don't smoke weed.

6925
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:36,560
Getting high in Jamaica story again.

6926
02:56:36,580 --> 02:56:37,413
I know.

6927
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:39,680
See I don't want to tell it now.

6928
02:56:39,710 --> 02:56:39,951
No,

6929
02:56:39,951 --> 02:56:40,450
go.

6930
02:56:40,450 --> 02:56:40,820
All right.

6931
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:41,840
If it's someone else's story,

6932
02:56:43,850 --> 02:56:45,380
I don't can try finding it.

6933
02:56:45,410 --> 02:56:48,410
I don't get done cocaine use at all.

6934
02:56:48,530 --> 02:56:50,840
I was in Jamaica and
somebody gave me some,

6935
02:56:50,841 --> 02:56:54,740
I may have may or may not have done it
all night and I then I wrote all night

6936
02:56:54,741 --> 02:56:56,450
and kept waking up my
girlfriend who you know,

6937
02:56:56,451 --> 02:56:59,210
my old girlfriend and telling her
what amazing bits and she was like,

6938
02:56:59,211 --> 02:56:59,660
Huh?

6939
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:00,020
I was like,

6940
02:57:00,020 --> 02:57:02,930
and God's a roster Farhan and I was high.

6941
02:57:02,931 --> 02:57:04,070
I was doing last and writing,

6942
02:57:04,071 --> 02:57:04,401
writing,

6943
02:57:04,401 --> 02:57:08,240
writing and I looked at my notes and
it was basically one long bit about God

6944
02:57:08,241 --> 02:57:08,810
being a roster.

6945
02:57:08,810 --> 02:57:12,470
Florian and I thought it was the greatest
thing I've ever written in my life and

6946
02:57:12,471 --> 02:57:14,900
it was just fucking chicken scratch.

6947
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:20,000
And the motto is historic kids just don't
do cocaine in Jamaica because you are

6948
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:21,620
never going to write anything funny.

6949
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:25,730
Brian Cowen will be appearing at
some club and in the Lexington,

6950
02:57:25,950 --> 02:57:26,783
Kentucky,

6951
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:31,520
Broadway better jokes than he
just damaged us fighting God.

6952
02:57:31,521 --> 02:57:32,090
Joe Frick.

6953
02:57:32,090 --> 02:57:32,590
Exactly.

6954
02:57:32,590 --> 02:57:33,050
Yeah.

6955
02:57:33,050 --> 02:57:33,890
This is a setup.

6956
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:35,150
It's guys best bits ever.

6957
02:57:35,470 --> 02:57:40,470
It's ever just wants you to like really
low expectations create to exactly.

6958
02:57:41,480 --> 02:57:42,710
I read every,

6959
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:46,970
every team got a guy fighter in the kid
podcast is kicking all kinds of ass.

6960
02:57:46,971 --> 02:57:48,200
You got to be happy about that.

6961
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:50,670
You guys are storming the
fucking sports charts here.

6962
02:57:50,671 --> 02:57:51,920
The only thing that's on sports,

6963
02:57:51,921 --> 02:57:54,310
it's funny you have it.

6964
02:57:54,380 --> 02:57:55,101
It's the shouldn't be.

6965
02:57:55,101 --> 02:57:56,420
It should be a comedy podcast.

6966
02:57:56,421 --> 02:57:57,740
You cheating by being on sports.

6967
02:57:57,741 --> 02:58:00,230
You know that I barely talk about sports.

6968
02:58:00,250 --> 02:58:00,480
Yeah,

6969
02:58:00,480 --> 02:58:02,940
you guys should need to move over to
comedy and that's talk about sports

6970
02:58:02,941 --> 02:58:04,210
occasionally because the people are,

6971
02:58:04,211 --> 02:58:04,821
we do it.

6972
02:58:04,821 --> 02:58:06,330
Look for funny shit and they miss you.

6973
02:58:06,390 --> 02:58:07,700
They might miss a good point.

6974
02:58:07,890 --> 02:58:08,161
Yeah,

6975
02:58:08,161 --> 02:58:08,941
because Fox is,

6976
02:58:08,941 --> 02:58:09,980
I did do sports.

6977
02:58:10,270 --> 02:58:13,870
You gotta cut that tit on after and
break off the fighter and the kid.

6978

Schaub on Twitter,

6993
02:58:55,130 --> 02:58:55,200
Okay.
